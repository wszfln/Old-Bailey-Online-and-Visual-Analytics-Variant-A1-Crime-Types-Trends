On the night of the 30th of January I was on duty in White's-yard - and at two o'clock I saw the prisoners, Walker and Wise, coming up White's-yard, together - I was sitting in my box; they both passed me, and were stumbling, as if drunk; they were going in a direction from Crawley's - I called my regular hour, and saw Wise again, alone, at four o'clock in the morning - I saw him go towards Crawley's house, and stand opposite to it; I was then in my box, which is about forty yards off; he went up and down the yard - there are two houses and two coach turnings between my box and Crawley's house; I looked out of my box, and saw all down the yard; Barnett, my officer, came up to me - we talked together, and then separated; he went up the yard, and I down, towards the Two Brewers, after Wise - when I got to the house he was gone through Crown-court; I went round Crawley's house, and saw the kitchen window open - I went to call Taylor, and we went and called Mrs. Crawley up; I stopped outside while Taylor went in to search the house; no one was found there - I then called half-past four o'clock, and then went to the watch-house; I found Smith and Barnett there - I went with them, Taylor, and two other watchmen to Parson's-court, Blue Anchor-yard - we knocked at the door of a house there - a woman's voice asked who was there - she was in a room on the ground floor; Smith said, "It is only me - don't be afraid - open the door," which she did directly; I, Smith, Taylor, and another went into a room, and there found the six prisoners - this was between four and five o'clock; they were all dressed - three were laying on the bed, and three were sitting up; we took them all into custody. I was conveying Maney to the watch-house - as soon as I got out of the house, he up with his hand, and threw his arm out, to drive me away, saying, "I am d-d if I am going to be taken by you;" I tore his jacket, but he got from me, and out-ran me. I returned to the house, which Smith was searching - we stopped there a little while, and Maney came into the court - I said, "Smith, here is one of the men we want;" Smith came out, and said, "Oh, I know you" - he said, "If you want any thing with me, I will go with you;" we secured him at last, after a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050004"/>struggle; Smith found some things under the bed, upon which three of the prisoner had been laying.</p>

I cannot swear to any of the things - the handkerchief is something like mine; we give out cans, and do not always get them back - I think I missed one, but cannot be certain whether I gave it out or not; I did not give it out that night - I did not miss rum, but there was a strong smell of it in the bar - I could not tell whether any was missing; my servant had a shawl something like this one; mine cost 38s.; I believe there is the name of "Crawley, Two Brewers, White's-yard," on the can.</p>

I told him I did not know - I knew him before - he lived in the neighbourhood. As I returned from school, a little after eight o'clock, I met him - he rushed by me very fast one door from my father's house; I did not observe any thing in his hand, but I am quite sure he had only one shoe on; I found my father's window broken, and an old shoe on the cellar flap; it was like the shoe he had shown me; it was the same shoe.

On Monday, the 12th of March, I saw the prisoner come from the back garden; I found he had broken through the fence; I asked what he did there - he said he wanted the old man in the next cottage; I told him he must have known this was not the old man's cottage; he said nothing, but passed me, and went through the gate; our front door was fast, but the back door, leading to the garden, was open; I was in the garden; he went towards the next cottage, but passed the door, without going in, for I watched him. The moment he went out at the front gate I looked through my kitchen window, which is on the ground floor, and missed the mustard-pot, which was safe two minutes before; I sent the servant after him - I went in doors, and missed the rest of this property from the parlour cupboard, which is also on the ground floor. I saw the prisoner at Mary-le-bone Office the next day, and was not quite certain of him. When I talked to him in the garden I thought I should know him in a moment, but I was frightened at the office, and did not look thoroughly at him, but when I saw him before the Magistrate I recognised him perfectly, and am quite certain he is the person. I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. What time of the day was this? A. Somewhere about two o'clock, or from that to three. He was fresh shaved at the office, and appeared to have some pimples round his face, which I had not observed; I said I thought he was not the man, not that he was not; he was popped out of a cupboard in a hurry, and I could not notice him. but when he came to have his hearing I knew him instantly.</p>

I missed all this property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him a very short time? A. I stood, and said to him, "Pray Sir, what do you want?" he said, "I don't want you - I want the old man at the next cottage;" I stated at the office that I spoke to him; I went to the Kingsland-turnpike, and asked if they had seen a cart go by with two men, and described the men; they said they had not.

I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, in Lisson-grove; I told him it was for stealing some plate in the neighbourhood of Ball's pond; he hesitated a minute or two, and then said it was not him, or that he was not there; he pulled off a pair of blue trousers, and put on another - I said he had better not do so, but he said he thought they would be warmer, as he knew he should be detained. Immediately that Hardeastle saw him she said he was the man - she never doubted about him - she had described him before. Mrs. Clark saw him in the lock-up-room - there was a great many men about, and she did not recollect him. I found 4l. 16s. 6d. in his blue trousers pocket; I found in his room a yellow handkerchief; Mrs. Clark had stated that the bundle she had seen was in a yellow handkerchief.</p>

I went into the Artichoke public-house at half-past one o'clock on the night of Thursday, the 22d of February, with Downes and Palmer - we had a glass of peppermint; the prisoner, whom I had seen once before, came in - he had a little doll called Tommy - he asked me to give him a glass of liquor, which I did; he asked if I would go with him to a female's apartment, and he would perform Tommy. I went with the other women, and he made the doll speak; the women came out with me, to the corner of White Hart-yard; I wished them good night: the prisoner said nobody should see me home but himself; he followed me as far as my mother's court, in <placeName id="t18270405-8-crimeloc41">Broad-street</placeName>

I went to Bow-street in the morning, and described him; I did not know where he lived, and have not found my property.

            . I was with Kennedy at the Artichoke; the house is open all night, for the printers; the prisoner came in, and Kennedy gave him a glass of peppermint; I saw her pay some money: she tied a sovereign, two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, in the corner of her handkerchief; the prisoner asked if we knew where he could go to play the ventriloquist; we took him to Mr. Wither's, No. 5, the corner of Little Catherine-street; he performed there, and we came out - we left the prosecutrix, but he walked by her side up to Drury-lane Theatre. I did not see them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have known her? A. I have seen her about three times by Covent-garden Theatre, but never drank with her before; there were a great many women seeing the prisoner play Tommy - it was in a private house.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St, Giles, and apprehended the prisoner on the 25th of February, at the King's Arms public-house, Coal-yard, Drury-lane, from the description Kennedy had given; I knew him before, as a ventriloquist; I told him it was for knocking a woman down, and robbing her, on Thursday morning - he said he knew nothing about it, and laughed; I did not mention Kennedy's name. I left him with Furzeman, and fetched Downes - I told her to look round the room, and see if the man was there - she pointed the prisoner out; Kennedy came in afterwards, and pointed him out; there were twelve or fourteen men there. He said, at the watch-house, that he recollected drinking two glasses of gin with Kennedy.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. That was before he was taken up? A. Yes - she said she treated him at the darkey, and also at the Artichoke.</p>

On the night of the 14th of February I saw the prisoner get out of a hackneycoach in Thames-street; the coachman asked, in her presence, if I knew where the Gravesend boats went from; I said from Darkhouse-lane; she asked me to show her the house; I took her to the Queen's Head, and told her they went from there - I left her there - I was called back in a minute or two, and saw her with a number of sovereigns in her hand - I asked where she got all that money, and said I thought she had more money than wit; she said she had more money than that; and putting her hand in her bosom, took out some loose papers, among which was a 20l. Bank of England note; she put her hand in her bosom again, and began to cry, saying she had lost a 20l. note; she said she had four, or more notes - I asked how she came by so much money; she said her father had sent it to her from Coventry, that she might appear decent to see her brother, who was then at Gravesend, at a ship - I counted twenty-two sovereigns and a half, and a 20l. note into the landlord's hands, and he put them away - the prisoner went up to bed before I left - I went in the morning, and took her to the Compter - I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050009"/>returned for the money, and the Alderman ordered it into the care of Brand the marshalsman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did you receive the money from in the morning? A. From the servant - I saw the prisoner get out of the hackney-coach at twenty minutes after twelve o'clock - I was on duty - she accompanied me willingly to the public-house - she told me a different story next day about how she got the money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. No; I was on the opposite side - their backs were towards me, but I had a good view of their faces when they stood in the opening; I did not see the watch taken; when they were in the opening Mr. Pritchard pointed his stick, or umbrella to them; I am certain that the same men came into the opening - I pointed the prisoner out, from among a dozen others, at the Compter - I did not speak to Mr. Pritchard at the time, because I was confused.</p>

I fetched Yates to the Compter, where the prisoner was among about twenty more - I told Yates to look through the window of the door at them - she said, "I will swear that is the man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who gave you the information? A. A lad came and asked Mr. Pritchard if he should know the parties if he saw them - I was there, and took that lad into custody - he gave me the information; he had said he could identify them - he went into the taproom, came out, and said, "They are not there;" but I went in, took the prisoner and another, and at the Compter the lad said, "They are the people, but the room was so dark I could not see them" - the boy's character will not bear to come here.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 3d of March this dressing case, with the bottom out of it, was brought to me by the prisoner - I lent 10s. on it - it had been broken open to get the contents, the lock being a patent one - it had a few of the steel instruments in it - the prisoner had brought some of the silver articles to me on the 24th of February - they all had Mr. Gifford's crest on them - I advanced 50s. on them - he stated, on the 24th of February, that the case belonged to an Irish officer, who had lost the key and could not open it, without the servant's breaking it; after he got it open, and got out what he wanted, he had told the servant he might have it for his pains - he said he had not got all the contents with him, but would bring the case. On the 26th of February I wrote to the commanding officer at Hounslow, and advertised it, but heard nothing for a long time. On the 5th of March a woman, who passed as the prisoner's wife, came with two gold seals - I asked where her husband was - she went out and fetched him in - I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge - he said the property was stolen by somebody else, and given, or sold to him - he was remanded till Mr. Gifford came up.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. White, an officer of the Lancers. On the 24th of December, I recollect Lieutenant Gifford coming to the barracks - I heard his box had been stolen three days afterwards - the prisoner, at that time, was living at the barracks, as servant to Lieutenant Phillips, at the barracks - I never heard of his master losing a box, or of any other officer losing one, except the prosecutor - the prisoner remained in the barracks for three weeks or a month; I heard him talking in the stable about an officer of the 10th having lost a box - this was the same week as the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man would injure me if he could. Witness. I never differed with him - we parted very good friends; he shook hands with me when he left.</p>

            . I am a constable, and took the prisoner in charge at Guest's. I took him down to Ipswich, as he said he had bought the property of a man belonging to the 10th; he pointed a man out - I took him before a Magistrate, and brought both to London.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the articles from a servant of the 10th of Hussars, a few days before they marched from Hounslow, but he denies the charge, and I have no witnesses to prove it - he trumped up an idle story of my having told him I had lost a cloak belonging to an officer I once lived with - the officer's brother has refuted that charge. I could prove I was in a canteen at Hounslow at the time of the robbery; a person came to town for that purpose, but being poor was obliged to return. One of the men told the Magistrate that I said I supposed the waggoner had stolen the property; another stated, I said I supposed it must be the post-boy, but I did not know the articles were lost, and could not have said any thing of the sort - I have been in the regiment twenty-six years; the servant came to me, and asked if I was not going to be discharged out of the regiment - I said, Yes - he said he had some articles for sale, for his master was going to Portugal, and having lost the key of his case, he had broken the lock open and gave him his case, having bought another - he said he would let me have the whole for 2l., as he was going on the march and could not carry them.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Sadler. On the 20th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening (it was dusky - we had lighted candles, but it was light enough to see a man's features outside the house), I observed the prisoner, in company with another young man, lurking about the window, which induced me to watch; I approached the window - they both went away; they came again, and on my approach went away again; they returned in two or three minutes: I placed myself where they could not see me, and then saw the prisoner's hand at the window, in the act of removing something; they went away in a few minutes; I went out, and placed one shutter up, and as I returned, moved my hand along the window (so that I could not be noticed), and found a wire projecting out of the window - it had removed a brooch and a ring five or six inches from the place where I had put them; part of the glass was broken away, about an inch square - it was large enough to draw them out, if there had been time to have done so; I am certain the pane was intire and perfect in the morning; the prisoner and the other were then in company, on the opposite side of the way - I told our lad to call the foreman, and told him the window had been cut, but he did not understand me; I crossed over to them, caught hold of the prisoner's collar, and said, "My lad, I want you;" I could not make a sure grasp, and he ran away, but fell down, and I collared him; I am quite sure of his person - I had an opportunity of seeing his features at the window for some minutes; here are the articles - I am sure the wire had quite removed them from their places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was near six o'clock? A. About twenty minutes or half-past five. There is an inner glass to the window - I had two panes to look through; there was some property hanging in the window, which would obstruct my view in some degree. Our shop is very dark - the candles were lighted, but at the time it was done there were some bed-steps at the end of the counter, which prevented the ray of the candle light going on the part of the shop where the prisoner was; it was not quite dusk. The part of the window where he stood is not so full of goods as the other part, and I could fully discover his features. There were some spectacles and other things there.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was delivered into my charge; I had not seen him stopped; I took him to Mr. Sadler's house, and asked if he had any thing about him; I found nothing but this piece of stick in his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. SADLER. Part of the wire was outside the window, and part in, and it was attached to the property.</p>
               <p>JURY to WM. CAWOOD. Q. Did you say you moved your hand along as you put up the shutter.? A. Yes, in order to see if there was any thing put through, as I thought they might think I was suspicious; I did not stay to look, but merely felt the wire - I saw it moving in the window before I went out; the hole was an inch or an inch and a half large; I did not know but the wire might have been put through the putty. I did not find the broken piece of glass - I might have trod on it - I saw him moving his hand outside, and the wire within.</p>

             three or four months, or perhaps six months - I knew him before this happened; I understand he is clerk to Mr. Price, an attorney, whose chambers are above mine; I have seen him go up towards those chambers, but never saw him enter them. The prisoner was my porter - he came to me in November, and left about the middle of February; I put money into his hands from time to time, to make small payments for me; he rendered me an account from time to time; I have not got the last account that he rendered, as it is in a book which he kept himself; when the money was nearly expended I examined it, and gave him back the book, with a further sum - the last time he brought it to me to be examined was the beginning of February - I examined it, and returned it to him; I have seen it since, in his hands - it is still in his possession, as far as my knowledge extends; when he brought me the book to examine he gave me vouchers for his payments. When he brought it to me in February there was a charge for money paid to Braznell - he gave me this voucher (producing it) to support that charge; it corresponded precisely with the charge in the book; I had employed Braznell to do some work for me. I have since paid the money to Braznell, myself, about the 14th of 15th of February, which was before the prisoner left; he absconded on the day that Braznell applied for it; I paid Braznell part that day and part the next - I only paid part before the prisoner left, I told him Braznell had applied for it - he stopped the whole of that day, but did not come next morning - he was taken up nearly a month afterwards, I think on the 14th of March; I had not seen him during that time - there was nothing due to him the last time I settled the account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there no some account running between you and the prisoner? A. Yes; I had struck a balance at the time this voucher was given - I did not owe him any money at the time he went away; there was no book debt due to him; I had not sufficient silver about me when Braznell called, and only paid him part. I had no character with the prisoner - his mother lived as laundress in the house for ten or twelve years. I knew him for three years, and had a good opinion of him.</p>

The prisoner came to me about the middle of February, and asked for the bill; I told him I could not write, and should be obliged to him to sit down and write it for me, and I would tell him what the materials were - he did so, and I told him to put down a new key to the back door, 1s. 6d. - opening the wine-cellar door, with eight inches of iron, 2s. - repairing a winetruck, 8s., making together 11s. 6d.; he wrote that, as I suppose; he put the bill into his pocket, and took it away; he did not pay me the money. I went to Mr. Arrowsmith for the money, about a fortnight afterwards; he paid me 5s. and 6s. 6d. the next day.</p>

I attend at his chambers in the Adelphi - Mr. Arrowsmith's chambers are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050014"/>in the same building, below Mr. Price's. I have known the prisoner since November last, and knew he attended Mr. Arrowsmith's chambers - his mother, who is a laundress, and lived in the same building, used to get me my dinner; one day, when I went down to dinner, he was down stairs, and asked me to copy a bill for him, which he produced; he said it was in his own hand-writing, that the man and his wife could neither read nor write, and it would not do for him to give a bill in his own hand-writing, as Mr. Arrowsmith would know his hand-writing; I wrote the bill for him (looking at it), this is all my writing; the words, "Settled, J. Braznell," are my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on it when he gave you the bill to copy, or did he tell you to add it? A. As far as I recollect that was on it - he asked me to write it, and I thought it no harm.</p>

               <p>COURT to Mr. ARROWSMITH. Q. You said the prisoner absconded? A. He did - I was there later on this evening than usual, and saw him; I sent after him, but he would not come in - I sent some people to secure him till I could procure an officer - that was the first time I had seen him after he left me; he gave me the bill produced at the chambers.

The prisoner came to lodge with me the beginning of February; she paid me 1s. a week for part of my bed. I went out to nurse the beginning of February, leaving the key with her, as I slept out; I locked my drawers, and am sure every thing was safe; I came home in a fortnight and three days, about eight o'clock in the evening, found the door locked, and the key laying on the floor, by the side of the door - I had been home once in the interval; my drawers were then locked, but I did not look into them. When I came home on this evening the prisoner was not there; I missed some of this property from a box - I did not sleep at home that night; I had lost the keys of my drawers a few days before I went to my place, which was the reason I did not open them; I had them broken open the next morning, and missed the rest of the property. I did not see the prisoner till the 28th of February, when I found her at Hackney work-house, where she received 2s. a week. I had her taken into custody, and she produced several duplicates.</p>

On the 9th of January we had company at my room, and they all staid all night; the prisoner was one of them; he was there in the afternoon of the next day - I laid down on the sofa to rest, and fell asleep - he was then in the room with my wife and her sister; my writing-case was then on the sofa, with two sovereigns and a half, and seven shillings in silver in it, and also a gold breast-pin - when I awoke, I found them all three in the room - they were awake - I had slept from two till five o'clock - the prisoner said he had been to Bermondsey while I was asleep; I did not miss my case till next morning; the prisoner came in soon after, and I asked him if he had taken it in a joke; he said he had not; I heard of it on the 9th of March; he kept my sister-in-law company up to that time; but there had been a dispute between him and me, and he did not come to the lodging later than a week after the case was gone, as my sister-in-law left then. On the 9th of March Lyles gave me information, and I took the prisoner up on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You say your house is in St. John's, Clerkenwell? A. Yes; I believe that to be a parish of itself. Mrs. Watson told me that on the day of the robbery, she saw a man come out of the house with a portfolio; the street-door is generally open, as the house is in a yard; the prisoner lent me 9s. on the 9th, and I have not paid him. I quarrelled with him, because he was impudent to my wife - I did not miss the case till I wanted to use it; I did not suspect him, as he was represented as a man of property.</p>

No; my wife is confined; I have not brought her sister-in-law here, because I considered that she knew about it; I accused another person of it, as the prisoner urged me so to do; that person, and the prisoner, had both seen me put the money into it, the night before.</p>

I said,"Where is she?" they said, up-stairs. I said, "What ill?" they replied, "Yes, very ill." I asked if they had come home with her? they said, Yes. I opened the street door; they both walked out and said they should return presently, but never did. I ran up stairs and found it was all false, for my mistress was not at home, nor any body in the house. I missed a silver tea-pot and silver creamjug from the kitchen, which were safe when I went out; a plated tea-pot from the pantry cup-board, two large silver forks from the kitchen; a salt-spoon, mustard-spoon, and tea-spoon; I missed a silver desert knife from the kitchen - the silver tea-pot was a nice large one, worth full 9l. as old silver; the property was worth 25l. The prisoner was brought to our house on Monday evening last, the 2d of April - I recollected him well - I am quite positive he was one of the two men - I never had a doubt of him - they must have picked the lock, or used a false key.</p>

At a quarter past 8 o'clock, and returned at a quarter past nine - I never said I was almost sure he was the man - I was always certain of him - I was frightened about my mistress, but took particular notice of the men, as I had never seen them before - we have an area to the house, but no steps - I had not unfastened the area door that morning - it was still fast when I missed the things.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's-shop. I was coming by on the morning of the Duke of York's funeral, and saw the prisoner standing close by Mrs. Farmer's house; I knew him before, and called to him, saying, "Halloo young man, you don't speak now;" he turned his face half round; I called to him on purpose that Buckeridge, who was with me, might notice his face - he was alone - I saw no more of him that day - this was about ten minutes past nine, and I heard of the robbery a very few minutes afterwards - I saw him again on Tuesday evening last, about nine o'clock, and took him into custody - I was quite certain of him - he wanted me to go into a public-house and have something to drink, to see if we could not settle matters - I said, that was more than I dare do - I had told him it was for a case in Manchester-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A trimmer. I gave him to understand he was in custody. I heard the house had been robbed a very few minutes after I saw him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the Duke of York's funeral I was returning home with Smith, and passing through Manchester-street, by the Marquis of Hertford's wall, I saw the prisoner standing, and looking up George-street, this was a quarter or twenty minutes past nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect - Smith pointed him out to me - I had a full opportunity of seeing his features - Smith spoke to him to draw his features into my observation - I am certain he is the man - I went to the office, and in a few minutes I heard of this robbery - he was apprehended last Tuesday night, and brought to the office - I went into the lock-up room and saw him - this house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw? A. Yes. I cannot be exactly certain as to the time. I suppose he was waiting for another person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not bad time to bring my friends here - the servant says she saw me in the passage at the same time the others say I was in the street.</p>
               <p>S. HARBUT re-examined. When he was taken he was brought to the house, and begged of me for mercy several times, saying he had a wife and family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken to the house she said she believed I was the man, and she believed that was the coat I had on.</p>
               <p>W. H. BUCKERIDGE. When she first came to the office, she was positive of him, and mentioned his dress; she never expressed a doubt about him. I heard him ask her to show him mercy.</p>

On a Sunday morning, a little after two o'clock, 1 awoke, and found her standing in my bed-room (I do not recollect the date); my husband was in bed with me. When I went up to bed that night I put my pocket under my pillow; there was a purse in it containing eleven sovereigns and 3l. worth of silver, there was also a sovereign and 24s. in silver, loose in my pocket, and 21/2d. in copper, and a small knife, belonging to my little boy; the bed-room would not lock, but I shut it, and put a chair against it - I did not hear her come into the room; she awoke me by screaming and hallooing that thieves were in the house; my husband said, "Halloo, open the window;" she said, "I can't, I can't;" I answered, "You open the window;" he did so, and called Thieves and Watch! I do not know what prevented her opening it, if she had liked; she said they had stripped her room; my husband went down stairs; the watchmen came in; the prisoner still remained in the room; the watchmen said, "Here is a bundle;" I saw my husband on the stairs with the watchmen, and a bundle wrapped in a shawl, which the prisoner has now got on; the prisoner still remained in the room - she said, that two men had come into her room with black crape over their faces, and come to her bed, litted her head up and took her pocket from under her head, with 2l. in money in it; she said they opened the door, which awoke her, lifted the pillow up, to lift her head easy, and drew the pocket out with the other hand - I then looked for my pocket, which was gone - I then went to the stair-foot and hallooed to the watchman, to tell them I was not worth a farthing, I had lost all, and she kept saying, "I have lost my all, I have lost my all" - she said she saw them go to my press-bedstead, which stood in her room, and open it, and take a counterpane out, a pair of blankets, and all the things which were there; the other things in the bedstead were hers - she said they went to her box and stripped it, and drank nearly a pint of rum in the room, and ale bread and cheese - they had a dark lantern which they put backwards and forwards over her eyes, to see if she was asleep; that she heard the kitchen-door slam after they went down stairs; and as soon as she heard that she came into our room, as she thought she was then safe. After this I went down stairs into the kitchen, leaving her on the top of the stairs, and on the kitchen-table was the bundle which I had seen before; she came down to the kitchen, I said, "These things are all mine," and she said, "Yes, they are;" there was a pair of blankets and a gown of mine, a bit of stuff which I had given her to make a child's frock, and some Irish which had been given her to make shirts; the blankets had been in the bedstead; the counterpane, which had been in the bedstead, was not there. A little after six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050018"/>o'clock a pocket was brought to me - it was nearly daylight then - I saw Brown, the watchman, find it in the back-yard, between the wall and an old box; the prisoner had said she wished the watchmen to look about, as they might find something; the pocket was the one which had been taken from under my head; the purse was not in it then - the loose sovereign, 24s. 51/2d., and the little knife were still in it, but the purse and eleven sovereigns were gone. I saw my husband find an empty purse afterwards near the same place - she said that was hers.</p>

            . I am husband of the last witness. I did not hear the prisoner come into the room; she awoke me, by making a noise, and saying thieves were in the house - I found her standing by our bed side; I called the watchman, who came; I met him on the top of the stairs, with a bundle. I found the kitchen window open; it is a sash window, with an inside shutter, which puts up and down on hinges, so as to form an ironing board - it was still on the hinges - it was down, laying on two chairs; the bolts which fasten it inside were undone - I saw that it was bolted when I went to bed. I could find no marks of violence, as if any one had broken in; I looked both outside and in - this was on Sunday, the 4th of March; the prisoner continued to lodge with us till the Friday night, and then left, as my wife gave her notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had she lodged with you? A. Three months; she had the use of the kitchen. It was between two and three o'clock when I found the shutter down - I do not always look to see that it is fastened, but am sure I looked that night, and the night before. Her father took her away on the Friday, to her brother's house, next door. She awoke me to tell me the house was robbed.</p>

The prisoner went up into her own room with me - I found a large box there, open, and asked her if any thing had been in it; she said it was full of her clothes, but every thing was taken out; she told me about their taking her pocket from under her head.

The prisoner came to our house on Monday morning, the 5th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, and brought a counterpane - she asked if I knew where there was a washer-woman, who would do some washing for her; I said the washer-woman next door had left, but as my wife was washing, perhaps she would wash what she wanted; she produced a gown and counterpane, and gave them to my wife. The officer, Hanley, got them from my house; I saw them delivered to him on the Sunday following, and am sure they are what she brought.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who did she leave them with? - A. With me and my wife; I can swear to them by a mark on the counterpane, which I observed - it is done with thread - there are many washer-women in the neighbourhood. I did not know the prisoner nor the prosecutor before; I should not have taken them but she said she was coming to live in the neighbourhood, and I thought it might induce her to deal at my shop - my wife does not take in washing.</p>

            . I took the gown to the office, and gave it up to the prisoner's father - here is the mark on the counterpane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you unfold it, to look at the mark, when she brought? A. No, but I saw it half an hour afterwards, and can swear this is the same she brought - it had not been out of my wife's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any others of that size in your house? A. No, nor any like it.</p>
               <p>MRS. ALLOWAY. This is the counterpane which I lost from the bedstead in her room; I know the flannels by the darn, as they were moth eaten, and the prisoner had darned them for me; the pocket is mine. The things found in the bundle are all mine.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANLEY re-examined. I first went to this house on Tuesday, the 6th of March, and examined it very closely, but could find no mark of violence, or of any person having got in or out. I saw the prisoner that day, and told her, in her brother's presence, that either she had robbed Alloway, or Alloway was privy to her being robbed, for there were no external marks about the house; she told me, that about two o'clock on Sunday morning, her room door opened, and two men entered, as Mrs. Alloway has stated, and that she saw them take a white counterpane - she gave exactly the same account to me that Mrs. Alloway has stated. I took it down in writing, and have it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050019"/>here. I went to Alloway's house again on the Friday following, and saw the prisoner - I asked her to produce to me what money she had in her pocket; she produced a sovereign, wrapped up in brown paper; I asked her to account how she became possessed of it - she hesitated very much, and at last said she had sold some things to a person in Rosemary-lane - I asked who it was - she said she thought she should know the person again - then she said she had sold them to some gentleman; I asked who the gentleman was - she appeared so much agitated that my brother officer objected to my questioning her further; I declined, and nothing more passed then. I apprehended her on Sunday night, the 11th of March, in a court in William-street, Harper-street, New Kent-road, at her sister's; I asked if she had any objection to say where the property was; this was before I told her I should take her into custody (I did not say it would be better or worse for her if she told - I make her no threat nor promise whatever) - she said she was very sorry for what she had done - that I should find the counterpane and her gown at a chandler's shop, in Essex-street, Hoxton - she did not know the person's name, and I should find the flannels at a mangler's, in Margaret-street, Hackney-fields - I found them there the same night; I asked her if the sovereign which I found in her possession on Friday, was part of the money she had taken from under Mrs. Alloway's pillow - she said it was. I was about an hour with her - she appeared very ill, and begged I would not take her into custody; I said I was compelled to do it - she stated that she let the kitchen window down before she took the pocket - that she had 8l. from Mrs. Alloway's pocket; I asked her what became of the rest of the money, and after some time she stated what she had done with it - her sister, her brother-in-law, and Mrs. Alloway were in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stay on the Friday? A. Perhaps half an hour or three quarters - she also appeared very ill on the Sunday - I was there near an hour, and she got better. I was endeavouring to discover the property. None of the persons in the room either threatened or promised her. I believe, towards the end, her sister said the prosecutor was a very poor man, and she should do what she could to restore his property; he said nothing to induce her to confess. I remember she said she had told Mr. Goupel what had become of the property - one of her relations directed me to her sister's house. - The prosecutor said he suspected she was over in the Kent-road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to the mercy of the Court.</p>

I left my box locked when I went out that morning; the prisoner had slept there on Tuesday night, and I dined with him there at one o'clock on Wednesday, but when I was fetched he was gone - I was informed he had been gone about half an hour. I went in pursuit, and found him on the Friday following, in Essex, about sixteen miles off; I detained him, and sent for a constable - he had my waistcoat and shirt on, and the handkerchief he had in his hand, when he came into the house where I was; I saw him put the purse out of his hand, and give it to a young woman, whom he was in company with - I took it from her, telling her it was mine; it was the purse my sovereigns had been in - there was only 2s. in it then.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Miller, a cabinet-maker, of Marchmont-street. On the 13th of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I was passing through Wilsted-street, and as I crossed the road Edwards called me, and gave me information - I then went into the middle of the road, and saw a tall young man, with his clothes splashed with whitening, opposite a broken pane of glass, at the prosecutor's shop window; the prisoner and two young women were near him; the prisoner was within a yard of him; I saw the tall man put a wire into the broken pane, and pull out some parcels, which he gave to the prisoner; they appeared like cards. About a fortnight after I saw the prisoner in Tavistock-place - he was not taken then - I was confident of him. When I saw this done I ran and told a watchman; he came to the shop, but the prisoner was gone.</p>

            . I am a brass-founder, and live with my father in Wilsted-court. I saw two young men standing by the prosecutor's window, between nine and ten o'clock at night; I think one of them had a piece of wire in his hands - I cannot say which, as I did not take much notice - I told the witness, and then went on an errand - I could not distinguish their persons, as I did not take much notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you point out two boys to Brown? A. I said, "Look over there, at those young men;" I told the Magistrate I would not swear whether the prisoner was one of them or not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Q. Are you positive I am the person who engaged the bed? A. Quite so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the hotel you made your how to me, and asked what I would take - I said a glass of ale, and asked if you had any knowledge of me; you said No, and the landlord said the same. Witness. When he was brought to the hotel I did not recognise him at first, in the hurry of business; he was then dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, blue trousers, and a dark green great coat; when he engaged the bed he had a light drab coat, buttoned up to his chin, and the same when he went away in the morning - I could not tell what clothes he had on under it - I am quite positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had a drab-coat in my life. I bought the watch, the day I pawned it, of a respectable man opposite the Waggon and Horses public-house, near the Elephant and Castle, for 4l. I had seen the man before, and wanting money I pawned it in my own name.</p>

I am porter at this hotel, and remember the prisoner being there - I did not see him till the morning of the 22d of February; I went up to his room about nine o'clock, and took his great coat, his other coat,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050023"/>and shoes to brush; there was a screw-driver in his coat-pocket, which I took out and put in again. I missed a pair of trousers that morning, about twelve o'clock, out of a box in my bed-room - I slept on the same floor as Champ, but not in the same room. I am sure he is the man.</p>

I had two boxes in my room, which is the front garret - one was at the foot of the bed, and the other (a small one, which was locked and nailed down) was under the bed. - On the 21st of February I found them broken open when I went to bed - I had opened the large box the morning before, and locked it again; there was then three sovereigns in a little purse, a silver watch, and a suit of clothes; I lost the articles stated in the indictment from the two boxes. I went with Mallars and my brother-in-law, and apprehended the prisoner, next day, at a house in Windmill-street, Borough; I went afterwards with Simms, to the house, and found in a drawer in the lower room four shirts, several pairs of stockings, and two or three handkerchiefs; one shirt was taken off his back at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMMS. I and my sister keep this public-house - we are in partnership, and both live there. The prisoner was our pot-boy and general servant. I missed him about seven o'clock on Wednesday night, the 21st of February, when I wanted him to take out the beer; I went into the privy, and found his working dress, a shoehorn, and an old pair of shoes there; I went next day, with Dennis and the constable three times, and at last found the prisoner at a house of ill-fame, in Windmill-street, near the Cobourg Theatre, in a back room, on the right-hand side of the ground floor - another young man, named Forrester, and three girls were in the room - we afterwards found this property in a drawer there. I saw a shirt taken off his back at the watch-house.</p>

On the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, a lady came in for half a yard of silk, which I cut off, and placed the remainder in the window, which was broken, but there was the lid of a box placed against it, with a roller to keep it steady. I went on the other side of the shop, to serve two women, and in ten minutes I heard a noise at the window, as if it was being cut - being alone in the shop I called the young man, who ran out; I went round, and missed this seven yards of black silk, but not the ribbon, although it was taken - a person could reach it after pushing the lid aside. The officer brought the prisoners to the house the next morning, with it. I had not notices them about.</p>

I was on duty on the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in High-street Whitechapel, where I stopped the two prisoners - I took them into a public-house, and on Ashley I found this seven yards of silk, and Holland threw down this seven yards of ribbon - they told us they had found it under a gas-lamp, at the back of the London Hospital, which is about half a mile from the shop - the silk was rumpled up, under his coat, not in any paper - the streets were dirty, but there was neither dirt nor dust on the property.</p>

            . I live at Hayes, and work for Robert Willis Blencowe, Esq. This shovel was in his coal-shed, near the house. On the 15th of March I saw the prisoner running across Mr. Blencowe's park with it - I pursued him - he threw it over a hedge into the garden; I picked it up, and saw that it was ours. I pointed him out to the constable in about an hour, and he was taken.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a carman to Mr. Holt, of the Axe Inn. I met Smith in the gateway, going down the yard, and when I got into the street I saw two or three men about the cart - I went up Addle-street, and saw the prisoner with this hamper on his back; I tapped him on the shoulder by Philip-lane, and asked where he was going with it - he threw it down, and ran away; I ran after him, crying Stop thief! Anderson stopped him, before I lost sight of him. I brought him back to the hamper, which Smith claimed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Steadman, who owed Mr. Hunt 3l. 2s. On the 3d of February I took it to Mr. Hunt's warehouse, and paid it to the prisoner. I think I gave him two sovereigns, two half sovereigns, and two shillings. I am sure there was three pounds in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and two shillings. He went up to the desk, and wrote a receipt, which he gave me - this is it(looking at it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the desk higher than the floor? A. Yes; I saw him writing the receipt; I swear I paid him some sovereigns, and there were two shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. The paper produced is in the prisoner's writing; it is a bill for the goods. 3l. 2s. - and at the bottom he has written, "Feb. 3, By Cash, 3l. 2s. Jas. Carroll."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hunt never sent me for the money.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. I sent him for it previous to the 3d of February, and again on the 16th; I found, on the 21st, that it was paid. I am quite certain that he never brought it to account.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and went with Mr. Hunt to the prisoner's lodgings - he asked his master to forgive him; he would promise him nothing - but said he had lost property, and insisted upon his telling what he had taken; the prisoner then told what he had taken; he said he could not find the duplicates for some time; but at last said to his wife."Go and fetch the duplicates of Mr. Hunt's property." I followed her down stairs, and saw her take them out of a hole in the privy.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNT. This woman never visited him at my warehouse; she came there once after he had absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On what grounds did you discharge Thomas Hunt from your service? A. Because I discovered he had formed a very improper female acquaintance. I never suspected him to be guilty of any dishonest act - I allowed him to sell goods among his friends. I might have told the female, that such a connexion as hers would bring him to Newgate. I never saw any poplins made exactly like these - I have been seven years in the trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to H. TURNPENNY. Q. On arriving at my apartment, what did Mr. Hunt say? A. He asked why you did not come to the warehouse - I believe you said you were ashamed. I am certain he made you no promise of forgiveness, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He held out insinuating language to me, by which I might understand he was going to forgive me, if I gave him information. I know nothing whatever of these goods being pawned.</p>

I knew them all before - I have often seen them in company; I followed them up Holborn, and lost sight of them; I then went down to the Vine public-house, in Laystall-street - stood there, and saw them all three come out of the Vine; they began to lark together, shoving each other about - I kept out of their sight - they went down by Mr. Burge's, the nightman's house. I saw them come up, and cross over to Henry-street, Gray's-inn-lane - they all three walked up and down by the prosecutor's door. Smith then went in - I cannot say how he got in, as I was at the corner of the street - it is a private house - I saw him stand at the door a short time, and then go in; the other two walked up and down by the door - he came out in about five minutes, then they all three went in, and remained there about ten minutes -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050029"/>Ford came out first, with a lot of things in his white apron- the others came out directly after him - Wicks had some things in his apron - Smith had nothing; they came running up the street by me, as hard as they could. I let them pass, pretending not to notice them - then went over to the house, knocked at the door, and asked the prosecutor's wife if she had lost any thing; she said she did not know - I came away, and ran down Falconer's-alley, Cow-cross, having seen Smith go into a house there once, and just as I got to the corner of the alley, the three prisoners came up the alley; they then had the things in two bags, but still had their aprons on. Ford and Wicks each had a bag - I saw them go into a house in the alley with the things, and shut the door. I ran to Hatton-garden, and fetched Limbrick, and another officer, to Falconer's-alley - they went into the house; I stood at the window, and saw them sorting all the things out upon the bed, and the woman of the house with them.</p>

            . This house in Henry-street is mine, and is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn - I did not come home till late on this evening - I had seen all this property secure, laying on the table, about ten o'clock in the morning - when I returned it was gone; I found it at Hatton garden the next morning - it consists of the articles stated in the indictment - here they are - they are worth 3l. 9s., the very lowest - the Irish cost me 2l. 2s. 8d. I know nothing of the prisoners - the door has a clasp lock to it - my wife is unwell.</p>

Wicks came in, and asked if his tea was ready - in a short time in came Smith. As to Toole I have seen him at all the notorious houses.</p>

            . I am a bookseller and stationer, and live at No. 4, Brompton-terrace - I keep a subscription library - I know the prisoner's person. I first saw him about a month or five weeks before the 26th of March - I sent to his house, and he subscribed to my library, by the name of Cope - he then lived at No. 4, Grove-place, Brompton - I have sent books from my library there, and saw him frequently - he often came to my shop twice a day to change books. On the 26th of March, at near three o'clock in the afternoon, he came and asked if I was going into the City, as he did not feel very well, he had a pain in his chest, and thought he had caught cold; he asked if I would get a cheque changed for him - he then looked out a book, and directly said, "If you will give me a piece of paper, I will write the cheque;" I gave him a piece; he came round the counter close to me, and wrote it at my side - I saw him write it (looking at it) - this is the cheque - after he had written it, he said, "Perhaps you can give me something, as it may be some time before you return;" I said certainly, and gave him a 5l. note, first writing on it the name of the gentleman I had taken it of - I went into the City, but being detained on business, I had not time to go to Lombard-street, and called on Mr. Ottley, my brother-in-law, in Fleet-street - I gave the cheque to him, and he gave me the cash for it; this was as near five o'clock as possible - the prisoner said, when he had the 5l. note, that he would have the remainder when he came to the shop again, but he never came again- Mr. Ottley brought me the cheque next evening, and gave me some information about it - I then went to No. 4, Grove-place, where the prisoner lived, but he was gone from there - I presented the cheque myself at the banking house the following day, the 28th - it was refused payment - this writing was on it when Mr. Ottley brought it back to me, but not when I delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what time did you go to Ottley's? A. Within a few minutes of five o'clock - it was too late to present the cheque that day -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050030"/>I myself know of no presentation, till the 28th - I did not see this writing on it till Ottley returned it to me - I saw the prisoner write the whole of this cheque - he could not write on the other side of the counter, on account of a rail, and he came round to me - I made no mark on it when he gave it to me, nor have I made any at all - I speak to it from the writing and the signature, which I noticed - it is written in the usual form of a cheque.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is the cheque drawn in your favour? A. It is - I kept it in my possession till I delivered it to Ottley.</p>

            . I live at No. 159, Fleet-street. On the 26th of February, about ten minutes before five o'clock, Mr. Taylor asked me to give him the cash for this draft(looking at it) - I have not the least doubt of this being the same - I put it among my cash in my money bag, and kept it till the next day; I then sent my servant Ray with it to the bankers', about three o'clock, or a little after - he brought the cheque back to me, with this writing across the back, which was not on it when I gave it him; I immediately set off to Brompton, and gave it to Mr. Taylor - we went to No. 4, Grove-place, and the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many other cheques had you in that bag? A. Not any; there was nothing but sovereigns; I put it into my bag as soon as I received it, locked the bag in my desk, and nobody had access to it but me - I did not see it again till next morning, as I had been out all the evening - the desk was locked - I made no mark on the cheque.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you any doubt of its being the same cheque? A. None whatever, from the appearance of it altogether.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it out of your possession, from the time you gave it to the clerk, till it was returned to you? A. About three minutes; I remained in the shop a short time before I was taken to Mr. Curtis; when I went in Mr. Curtis had the cheque before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the difference between a cheque and a bill of exchange? A. I cannot say that I do.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the partners in the house of Sir William Curtis &amp; Co.; Sir William is a Baronet, and the senior partner; I have seen the cheque produced, and have examined our books; no person named James Cope keeps cash at our house - we have no such account- there is no fund in our house, out of which James Cope has authority to draw (looking at the cheque) - I did not write this on it; the witness must have mistaken my person - Mr. Robarts is the person he saw, and this his is handwriting - I was in the house at the time, but not in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been a partner in the house some years? A. I have; I do not keep the books- all the customers of the house come under the observation of every partner - I speak decidedly, on my oath, that no James Cope has an account at our house - the clerks keep the books, but no new customer is taken without the knowledge of all the partners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of every customer? A. The greater part of them - I say generally I do - I know there is no such name as James Cope in the books - it is possible the name of one customer may escape me; I attend to the business daily, and see the books daily, in which the names of the customers are entered - there cannot be a customer whose name I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you looked over every book in your house, in which the name of a customer would appear? A. I have, and if such a name had been in the books, I must have seen it - there is no such a name; no account is ever opened without reference to the firm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If a person opens an account at your house, does he write his name in a book? A. He does, in what is called the signature book; the clerks always go to that book if there is any doubt about a cheque.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you searched back? A. The whole of this year, and for a considerable time back - I will not say that I have looked back all the last year.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you now a perfect recollection of his person? A. Perfectly so: I recognised him the moment I came into Court; before I saw the certificate - I do not mean to say positively, that I have not seen him since 1814.</p>
               <p>These two documents were here read. One was a certificate of the prisoner having served as a clerk in the navy, under Sir John Gore, from July, 1801, to February, 1806, and his good conduct during that time. - The other, as having served as clerk on board the Revenge, from February, 1806, to the 1st of August, 1808, and of his good conduct during that period.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live at No. 167, Bond-street. On the 14th of March the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I let private boxes for Covent-garden Theatre - I told him I did - he asked if I had a box for that evening - I said Yes; and he engaged one; he asked the price, I told him three guineas; he looked down the shop and said, "I bought some books of you last year; there was a copy of Rasselas which I gave to my youngest daughter - I want two more copies of the same book for my elder daughters;" he then saw a complete set of Washington livine - he came to the desk where I do my business, and said, "I have no money in my pocket, will you take a cheque on my bankers?" and from his appearance I agreed to take it - I furnished him with pen and paper, stood by him, and saw him write a cheque and sign it; (looking at one) this is it - it is signed Geo. Crofton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before, to your recollection? A. No; he was in my shop, I should think, twenty minutes - I was the only person who spoke to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you give him any box ticket? A. I gave him this box ticket (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. What makes you speak to that ticket? A. It is a box which I had to let, and it has my own signature - I never sign two for one night.</p>
               <p>MR. GATES. I found this box ticket in the prisoner's trunk.</p>
               <p>The cheque uttered to the witness Andrews was here put in and read - it was drawn on Messrs. Praed and Co. Fleet-street, payable to Mr. Andrews, dated the 14th of March, for 10l. 3s., and signed Geo. Crofton.</p>
               <p>WM. CURTIS, ESQ. re-examined. Here is our signature book - I have examined it; there is no such name as James Cope in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any other signature book? A. There is one which I have sent for - I have searched through the whole of this, which embraces a period of about twenty years - I have examined the other, which has been very recently taken into use; those two are the only signature books we have.</p>

            . I am a lamp-lighter. I know the prisoners Williams and Featherstone - I first knew them about three months ago; I knew Williams by the name of Dick - I became acquainted with him at the George and Ball public-house, Westminster; Dick introduced Featherstone to me there. I had known Dick seven or eight days before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he introduce you to Featherstone for? - A. I was in the habit of going to the George and Ball; Dick asked me if I would buy a set of carpenter's tools - Featherstone was not present - I said No, they did not suit me - he said, would I buy any thing that did suit me; I said I was out of work, and if I could earn 1s. I would; he did not know where I lived - I told him I occasionally came to my sister's, who lived in Church-lane, Strand, and I could be found there - her name is Lilley - her husband lives with her; I do not lodge there, but go backwards and forwards; Ursula Willis also lives there. When I called there once my sister delivered a message to me, and in consequence of that message I went to the George and Ball, Westminster - it was on a Friday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock - I found Featherstone standing at the door of the George and Ball - he asked if my name was Tom; I said "Yes, and where is Dick?" - Featherstone said inside; I said I had come in consequence of a message from my sister - I went in, and found Dick sitting on a bench in a little box on the right-hand side of the tap-room; I and Featherstone joined him: we all three sat in the box together, and had half-a-pint of gin and a pot of beer - we had it inside the house; I paid for it- while we were there Dick asked me if I would buy any brass - he did not say what quantity, or where it came from - I said I would try to sell it for him as well as I could; after drinking our beer I went away, and went to my sister's. The prisoner Isaacs came into my sister's shop, to buy a herring - I said to him, "Do you keep an old iron-shop?" he said Yes - I said, "Are you in the habit of buying brass, and how much will you give me a pound for it?" he said he would give 5d. if it was good, but if there was bell-metal mixed with it he could not give so much; this conversation was in the presence of my brother, sister, and mother; after he said he would give 5d. I looked at him; he said, "You need not be afraid, for if it was Jesus Christ I would by it, for it would go where hundreds have gone before" - he had not seen it then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to draw from him that answer? A. I asked him the price, and was looking at him rather dubiously - he said, "Is it here?" I said No - "Well," said he, "when can I see it?" I said I would have it brought there. Six o'clock that evening was fixed upon for his seeing it, at that place. After this I went back to the George and Ball, and found a horse and cart standing exactly opposite the door of the house, on the other side of the street, where there is some palings; I found Dick, and Featherstone there; I said to them, "It is all right bring your horse and cart, and the brass to the Strand - they knew where I meant, as they had been there in the morning (but I had not seen them there myself;) Dick said, "We will be there" - I said, "Go on first, and I will follow;" I went the back way, round Scotland-yard and Northumberland-street, and came up with them and the cart at the corner of Church-lane - the cart arrived first; both the prisoners were there with it; nothing had been taken out of the cart. I told them to wait there till I went and asked my sister's leave for them to put two sacks in the cellar - I went, and my sister gave me leave; I went back, and told them to bring the sacks into the place - they contained brass - they each brought one sack; they were put into the cellar - I went forward with a light while they put them there. When I got down stairs they asked 2l. 10s. for it - I agreed at last to give them 1l. 15s. and 1s. I had spent - they were to be paid the same day. I told them to go on, and I would follow them - after they were gone I borrowed two sovereigns of Mrs. Lilley, my sister. I then went back to the George and Ball, and gave the money to Dick; I gave him both the sovereigns - Featherstone was present in the room; Dick gave me 5s. change - he gave Featherstone a sovereign of it, and Featherstone gave him some change - I do not know how much; I left them there, and went back to my sister's - it was then between two and three o'clock - Isaacs came at six o'clock; I went down stairs, and showed him the brass - he looked at it carefully, took a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050034"/>piece out of the bag, like a coronet, and said, "This came from a church" - I said they told me it came from the country; I said I did not think it was all right; Isaacs said, "Never mind about its being all right - if it were Jesus Christ I would buy it," and, laying hold of the cellar door, he said, "If this was gold I would buy it;" he said, "You have no occasion to be afraid, I will take every thing upon myself;" he agreed to give me 5d. per lb. for it. I said, "Shall it be taken away to-night?" he said, "No, because it is dangerous" - because there were people going along the Strand, and he might be stopped, but it should be fetched the next morning, Saturday, at ten o'clock - he promised to come between ten and eleven- he came about that time - I met him there; I borrowed a basket of my brother, to carry the brass in it to Isaacs' place; I took one bag in the basket, to take it to Isaacs' - I went with him; it was carried to No. 22, Houghton-street; I helped him carry it - he led me there; we went backwards and forwards for it twice. Before I moved it he asked how much I thought there was - I said I did not know; he said I might depend upon him about the weight - he gave me 10s. after I delivered it - he said, that in the course of an hour and a half or two hours, he would come back and pay the rest; my brother-in-law and sister were there when the brass was moved; Isaacs came again in the afternoon, and said, "How much do you think the weight is?" I said, "About 130 lbs. I suppose;" he said, "Why it is 128lbs., but as there is iron and other things we will take off the 8lbs., and make it 120 lbs.;" I agreed, and he gave me two sovereigns that afternoon; my sister reckoned it up by a ready-reckoner which she had; she said it came to more - he said he should give no more. I received in all 2l. 10s.; he went away, after giving me the money. I saw a woman named Jane at the George and Ball - she served liquor there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday following did you hear some people in Church-lane talking about old Isaacs and the church? A. Yes - that frightened me, and I went to Dick's lodgings at Westminster, near the George and Ball, and told him what I had heard - he said, "I hope you will not take any notice - you know I have got a family, but I don't mind myself - I hope you will be as a man, and not say any thing about it?" I said I would not. I stopped at his lodgings seven or eight days - I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Dick's wife come backwards and forwards? - A. I cannot say that she was his wife; Jane came there once or twice, and my own wife came there sometimes. - When I left Dick's lodgings I went to Liverpool, to get out of the way. While I was stopping at Dick's I told him Isaacs had opened every thing about the brass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not know Featherstone before? A. No. I paid Dick the money, and he gave me 5s. out of two sovereigns - Featherstone gave Dick some change out of a sovereign. The cart was open, like a chaise cart, and a very pale lead colour - Featherstone drove it - they were both in it; Dick said nothing about paying Featherstone for the hire of the cart; I do not know how much per day a cart lets for. - Our second meeting at the George and Ball was between two and three o'clock - the property was in two bags; I cannot say whether Featherstone could see what was in them as they lay in the cart, as I did not get up into the cart. I was taken into custody at Liverpool - I cannot exactly say the date.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you think of becoming a witness here? A. I did not think about it; I was never examined before a Magistrate. I was questioned at Mr. Harmer's office five or six days ago - there were a good many people in the room; I do not know how many. I am giving evidence for the good of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not once stand where the prisoners do now, in this Court? A. I am not obliged to answer that; I came here to tell what I am about now; I do not say but what I have stood at that bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Perhaps you have been here oftener than once? A. You may say as many times as you like - I never was but once in my life. I knew Isaacs before by his coming to my sister's - he dealt there.</p>
               <p>Q. You first said to him, "Do you keep an old ironshop" - it was your object to make a sale to him? A. Yes. I did not know the value of old brass - it was broken brass in pieces; I thought he gave a fair price. I went to Liverpool because I heard the people talk about the church, and mention Isaacs' name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was in consequence of what Isaacs said, that you were taken at Liverpool? A. I do not know - my wife told me somebody had been, and in consequence of that I went off. The brass had not been weighed - I left that to Isaacs.</p>

            . I am Willis' sister, and live at No. 2, Church-lane, Strand. One day somebody came and knocked at my room door, and asked for Tom - I cannot say what day it was; I only saw one man; I should know him - it was the prisoner Williams - he left a message for Tom; my brother came about ten o'clock that morning - I told him what message had been left; it was to tell him, when he came, to come down to them at Westminster- he went, and came back again. Isaacs came in after he returned, for a pickled herring. Tom asked him, in my presence, if he bought brass; Isaacs said Yes; he asked what he gave per lb. - he said 5d. Tom looked at him, and Isaacs said "You need not be afraid, it is all right - if it were Jesus Christ I would buy it, for that will go where hundreds have gone;" that is all that passed that I heard. Isaacs went away - my brother came in the same afternoon, and asked if I would let him put two bags into the cellar - my husband, who was present, gave him leave. Williams and Featherstone brought two bags; I could not see what was in them; they were put down in the cellar. Tom asked me for two sovereigns. I do not know what it was for - I let him have them, and he went away. Isaacs came again that evening about six o'clock - Tom was there; they went down in the cellar where the bags were, and when they came up, I heard them agree that Isaacs was to come next morning to take it away; he said he would come between ten and eleven o'clock; he came about that time. Tom moved the bags - Isaacs was present; the basket was borrowed of my husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dick and Tom agreed that Isaacs should come next morning? A. No; Tom and Isaacs agreed; I said nothing about Dick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know any thing of the bags? A. No. Nobody came to search for my brother at my place.</p>

I saw Featherstone there on a Friday morning, as I came into the George and Ball; he and Dick were there, and called for a pot of porter, which I took them - Willis was also there; Dick just came in as I did. I took them two pots of porter, and half a pint of gin - I remember seeing a horse and cart there; I looked into it, and saw a bag - the cart stood five or six houses off, on the other side of the way; it was a middling sized horse, and had a sore on its back - I only saw one sack; I have seen a cart in possession of Pople, but do not think it is the same; I did not observe the colour, but it is broken; the cart I saw had no step to it. I did not hear Tom Willis say any thing about a Jew - I sometimes went to Dick's lodgings for some pots; I have seen Willis there.</p>

            . I am a dealer in marine-stores, and live in Eagle-court, Strand. The prisoner Isaacs applied to me on Friday, the 2d of February. I went into a public-house to have a pint of beer, and he wanted me to buy some metal - I told him I did not deal in it, but I had a son-in-law who was going into business, and he might sell it to him. I did not see the brass that night; he came to me on the Saturday, after eleven o'clock, and said "Gashion, have you a mind to buy this brass?" I said No - he said he had 17l. to make up before one o'clock, to send away in the country. I said No, it would not pay me; he said he would be obliged to me if I would - I at last went to look at it; he took me to No. 22, Houghton-street, Clare-market - it was in two bags; I agreed to give him 61/2d. per lb.; but when I looked at it, I said it would not suit me at that price, and agreed to give him 6d. He asked if I would take it home to be weighed; I said, No. We took it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050036"/>potatoe-shop at the corner of Clare-market, it weighed 156lbs.; I paid him 3l. 18s. Heath, my man, was present all the time; I sent the brass from there to Mr. Bottons by Heath, and received 4l. 6s. 11d. for it. I was taken up on this charge, and gave this account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; Isaacs was there, and admitted that he had sold it to me; I bought it for 6d. and sold it for 7d. I saw him about it twice; he was at the public-house on Friday - I suppose six or more persons were present; he made no secret about it; it was weighed in the bags at the potatoe-shop; several persons were about; he made no secret of the matter; the bag was untied, but the brass was not visible. I told the master of the shop I had bought two bags of brass, and would be obliged if he would allow me to have them weighed - Isaacs heard that. I have known him attend different sales, and have known him from a boy. I never heard any harm of him, and believe he bore a good character.</p>

            . I apprehended Tom Willis at Liverpool, in Lancashire, on the 24th of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you go to any place in consequence of what Isaacs said? A. No; I went with Isaacs' brother from the 6th to the 10th of February, in search of Willis, but could not find him; and after Isaacs was bailed, I saw no more of the brother. I offered to bail Isaacs on the 12th - I said if they wanted one bail I would - I know he was bailed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to say he was set at liberty after he was once taken up? A. He was bailed from Newgate on the 12th; he was charged with buying some brass, and I went with his brother to look after somebody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMs' Defence. Willis says I brought the property to his brother's place - I never saw Willis till he was waiting at the George and Ball: and hearing people mention my name, he said to me, "Dick, have you got any place where I can slow myself out of the way?" I said, Yes, and took him to my room; he said the officer wanted him for a firkin of butter. I kept him in my room for a fortnight; his wife came backwards and forwards - she brought him a pair of pistols, and he said no officer should take him away alive. I then said he should not stop in my place any longer, and he went away in two days.</p>
               <p>FEATHERSTONE's Defence. On the Thursday evening I went to Mr. Morrison, and asked him for twopenny worth of bed-cord in one piece - he gave me twopenny worth; I said that was enough, and had twopenny worth, and then another twopenny worth - I untied them, and he tied all three pieces together for me. Willis says I carried one of the sacks into the cellar out of my cart - my cart was not out that morning at all.</p>
               <p>MR. MORRISON. I have no recollection of his tying them together; I know he undid them.</p>
               <p>ISAACS' Defence. I bought the brass of Tom Willis as honest goods, at 5d. per lb. - he did not agree to my price at first, but let me go; but on the following evening he agreed to let me have it. I said I would not take it away that night, as so many officers were about, and if it was wrong they would stop me, but I would come next morning, which I did - he brought it in two different loads to my house, No. 22, Houghton-street. I had no idea of its being come wrongfully by, or I should not have taken it to a public shop to have it weighed. I hope you will consider me as an innocent man, and the witness against me as guilty of the offence.</p>

On the 26th of February, about half-past four o'clock, I was coming from Somers'-town with these things in a bag - I had collected the money from different shops; the money was in two bags, which was put into a third bag, containing the salts - as I was going up Long-lane, I had got about fourteen yards out of Smithfield, the prisoner accosted me, and asked if I could show him the way to Cripplegate - he was alone; I said I was going that way - he kept in my company for a quarter of an hour - I am sure he is the lad; when I got to <placeName id="t18270405-65-crimeloc368">Cripplegate</placeName>

On the 6th of March my mother and I were passing along Well-street, Mile-end, and saw the prisoner talking to another young person - he saw me - he touched the other one on the arm and said,"That is the cove we served last week;" my mother asked if I noticed him, and when I looked at him, I was certain of him - I went after him - he tried to make his escape, and hit me in the face; my mother assisted me in securing him; I told her what had happened as soon as I got home; I am quite sure he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you say at Guidhall, that there were three more in my company? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH EYCOTT. I sent my son to sell some goods for me - this money was the produce of the goods; he returned about half-past five o'clock, and stated what had happened; I was with him in Mile-end, about a week afterwards, and met the prisoner with another boy - as the prisoner passed he looked at my son, and said, "That is the cove we served last week;" this induced me to notice him; I told my son to look at them; he said the one with the blue bag round his neck (which was the prisoner) was the boy who had robbed him; we pursued - the prisoner ran away, but was at last secured; I held him till Pasque came up; he denied the charge; the other boy went away.</p>

            . I am a wine-cooper, and have been in the prosecutors' employ about seven months. I packed in a wine-hamper four bottles of brandy, four of rum, three of port wine, and one of sherry, also two pints of port; I packed them by Young's direction; Hull was in an other part of the cellar at the time, but he handed me three bottles of port to pack; it was corded, and directed to Richard or Mr. Young, at some buildings in Kennington; Hull took it away on his shoulder; I had no written order to pack it; I gave no information about it at the time; when they took it out of the premises they said it was going to the White Hart public-house, in Tower-street, to be booked for the errand-cart; this was on the 10th of February; I have heard Young say he lived at Kennington; I stated this to my master on the 18th or 19th. and they were taken up; Hull was gone about ten minutes with the hamper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any concealment about it? A. Only us three were there; Hull and I both act under Young's direction; I did not hear Young order him to take it - he ordered me to draw the brandy and pack it up- it was between half-past eight and nine o'clock in the morning; Elwood was up in the counting-house at the time - he did not come into the cellar, or give any orders respecting it; he very seldom gave any orders.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear him give a verbal direction about conveying away the contents of the cellar? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you any wine for a Christmas-box? A. Not by Elwood's orders - it was by Young's orders; I had half a dozen for a Christmas-box, and I packed it up. I told my master about that at the same time as I mentioned this.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I apprehended both the prisoners at the prosecutors' counting-house, on the 20th of February - I questioned them separately, but did not threaten or promise any thing; I had Young out of the cellar first, and asked him about the charge; he denied it: I then had Hull up - he also denied it; I said,"Well, I will send round to the booking-offices, and I dare say I shall ascertain where the hamper went to;" he then said, "It is of no use my denying it - I took it to the White Hart, and booked it myself;" he said the direction was tacked on the hamper. I went to Kennington-lane with Mr. Bradshaw, and in the yard of Young's house we found the hamper, which Mr. Bradshaw claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Young's residence, of your own knowledge? A. No. The direction is torn of the hamper, but there is a nail left on it.</p>

Hagg delivered me the parcel on the 26th of March, it was directed to Mr. Garlick - I took it to town, and gave it to Chase the book-keeper, at the Old Bell, Holborn, about ten in the morning, and told him if Garlick did not come for it, to send it by the prisoner Leach, who had attended my coach for some years, as a jobbing man - I used to send him with what money parcels I could not deliver myself - I saw Leach about the coach that morning - he was not in the office when I gave Chase the parcel - I came in with my coach next day, and Leach came into the office; Chase asked him if he had said any thing to me about the parcel which had not come to hand - he said he was afraid to tell me.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Old Bell. On the 26th of March this parcel was delivered to me, directed to Mr. Garlick, London - I do not know where he lived - he often had money transmitted to him - I locked it up in my desk till about six o'clock in the evening, when I gave it to Leach - a female had called for it about five o'clock, she asked for a parcel which had come by the Wickham coach, directed for Mr. Garlick - she said she was Mrs. Garlick, but I refused to deliver it to her as she had no written order, and she went away - I delivered it to Leach about six o'clock, and told him to take it that evening without fail - he knew where Garlick lived - I told him about the woman calling for it - I had no doubt from its weight that it contained money, and believe I told him it was money - Clark was not present - next morning Garlick himself called for it - I saw Leach in about an hour, and asked what he had done with the parcel which I had delivered to him over night - he asked if it had not arrived safe - I told him No, and that Garlick had got a man in custody, who had had the parcel to take to him - Leach then said, that he was fearful it had not arrived safe, and he had had no rest all night, and he had come to the office earlier than usual to see Clark and be satisfied about it, for he had given it to him with directions to be sure and deliver it - they were well known to each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Leach had taken parcels for Garlick before? A. Yes, about three - I have since found that it was Mrs. Garlick who called for it - I do not know that Leach came earlier than usual - Clark said, a stranger had met him in the street, as he was going to the toll-house, and said his name was Garlick. Leach did jobs for the coachmen but not for us - I have known Clark nearly ten years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They must both know their duty was to deliver parcels no where but where they were directed? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GARLICK. I am lessee of the turnpike-road, and live in Purim-place, Mile-end-road; this parcel never came to me - Leach has delivered me five or six from this toll-gate - Mrs. Garlick went for this parcel, but could not get it - she had come to town, and, knowing it was there, called for it - I should have approved of its being delivered to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Clark came to your turnpike? A. I was not present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are your parcels delivered at the toll-gate? A. Yes, my house is close by - Leach used to leave them at the gate.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 26th of March, about a quarter before eight o'clock, I was at the Mile-end gate, by accident, and Miller, who had got there just before me, had detained Clark there; Mrs. Garlick and the toll-collector were there; they said Clark had been sent there with a parcel of money, and he came there, saying he had given it to a man about 300 yards from the gate - but being fearful he had done wrong, he had come to see if it was all right. Clark said the parcel was given to him by a man called Biscay (meaning Leach) to deliver at the turnpike; that a man in a rough coat tapped him on the shoulder. and said, "I come from Biscay, your name is Clark; you have got a parcel for me;" that he gave it, having his name and Biscay's so pat. I took him into custody, and as we came along, he pointed out where he said he had given it to the man - I found a 1l. note on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050040"/>Cross-examined. Q. At what o'clock was it that you took him? A. A quarter before eight; he never varied in his account at all - the toll-house is about two miles from the Old Bell. I found a letter on him, directed to Mr. Butler, of Cheapside.</p>
               <p>LEACH's Defence. Chase delivered me the parcel; I saw Clark, and asked where he was going - he said into the city; I said, "Then take this parcel and deliver it at the toll-house, and charge one shilling for yourself" - he gave me his word and honour that he would do so.</p>
               <p>CLARK's Defence. He gave me the parcel at the Bell. and told me to deliver it safe; a man stopped me and said,"Your name is Biscay, you have a parcel for me - the man who sent you with it is Leach; I sent my wife for it this afternoon;" as such I gave it him - but in a few minutes I thought it might not be right, and went up to the turnpike to inquire.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GARLICK. I really think Clark is innocent - for I have since heard he is a silly sort of fellow, and would he likely to give up the parcel in the way which he has stated it.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old on the 1st of May - I live in Church-street, Bethnal-green, but have now come from the House of Correction - I have a brother named William - I do not know where he is now - I was taken into custody about eleven weeks ago - one day, nearly a fortnight before I was apprehended, I went out with my brother William and the prisoner White, about half-past five o'clock in the morning - White does not live with me - he and my brother William are sweeps - I had never been a sweep myself until this morning - White came to my brother's house about half-past five,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050041"/>I, my brother William and him, went out - White gave me a chimney-sweeper's cloth, with a brush and scraper, to carry, and some black soot was slapped over my face by White, who said that in getting up the chimney my face would be quite black - we went by the Queen's house which is being built up in the Park - there is a scaffold round it, and through a place where there is all arch-ways which brought us round into a square - White rang a bell - a gentleman came out and asked who was there, and White said the sweeps - we did not get in at that house - we then went up a street and towards the backway of a house; the watchman said, they did not let them in that way - we went round a court where there was archways and came round to the front of the house - White rang the bell and called out sweep; a gentleman came and opened the door, and we all three went into the house - White first, my brother next, and I last - we all went straight down the stairs into a room where there is all tin things - White and my brother took up some cinders and put them into the sack - my brother said to a person who wore a white smock-frock, "Will you give us some beer?" some was given us; we all drank; the person in the frock then said, "Are you done?" my brother said, "No, not yet"- we all went up stairs into a room where there is a tin by the side of the fire - I put my cloth, brush, and scraper down; my brother hung the cloth before the chimney: I went up the chimney about a yard, and then said, "Bill, if you don't fetch me down, I shall tumble down" (my brother had told me to go up the chimney); he said, "Stop a bit;" he afterwards put up his hand, and I came down - when I got down White and my brother were there - White lifted the sack on my brother's shoulder, and told me to go on - my brother William remained with White; I went on till I came to the door - they followed me, my brother tried the door - we could not open the door to get out - he told White to fetch the gentleman to open it - the gentleman came, and said, "Shall I open both doors?" they said, "No, one would do" - my brother had the sack on his shoulder at that time - White had nothing - we all went out together, and I think we turned to the right - we then went up two or three streets which brought us to a square, they went right across the square, up a street where there is a little hill, and that brought us into a road; my brother then said to me, "Jack, do you know your way home?" I said, No; he said, "I will show you the way, go straight on down this road, that will bring you to Charing-cross, and then you will know your way" - White was present all this time, there were houses on one side this road, the other is a dead wall; I followed the direction my brother gave me, and got to Charing-cross - I then knew my way home - when my brother asked if I knew my way home, he meant to his own house - he lives in Pye-street, Westminster - I slept at his house that night, but I did not live there - I went to his house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WHITE. Q. Did you not meet a boy named Hope as you went home? A. When I got home to my brother's, I went out for a light, and met a man named Jem Hope, he asked what made my face so black - I laughed at him and went on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you at your brother's over-night? A. I had no work to do, and had not seen him for some time, he often told me, if I came down there, he would get me some work.</p>

On the 28th of March, I, in company with Goddard and Avis, apprehended the prisoner White in Greek-street, Spitalfields - he made a resistance; we at length secured him - on the 30th of March, when he was locked up at the office, he called to me, and asked if he could see his old woman; I said, I would see what I could do; but I had seen her, and his mother too; I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he then said, "I have seen the Magistrate again;" I said, "Have you?" he said, "He did not seem to want to hear me" - he then commenced by telling me, that, on the night before the robbery, Bill Croker told him, that he knew of a job where they could earn 15s. or 16s. in the morning; that he, and Bill Croker, and Bill's brother, Jack, went to a house in Berkeley-square next morning, and rang the bell to do their job, but they would not let them in; that they came away, and in coming down St. James's-street,

            . I am a refiner, and live at No. 54, Barbican. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 31st of January, the prisoner Solomons came to my house, I paid him 29l. 4s. 10d. for seven silver candlesticks - I do not know that he brought them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any acquaintance with him before? A. He was at my house about two years ago - I am sure he is the man - I will swear to him - he was there at nine o'clock in the morning - he had dealt with my shopman - I was only there while I paid him - I gave him 4s. 10d. an ounce for the silver, which was a full and fair price.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the candlesticks yourself before you paid the money? A. I had a glance of them as I paid the money - they were in the scale at the time; I took one out to see for the hall mark - I saw there was a crest on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you afterwards sell them? A. I sold them to Foligno two hours after I bought them- I sold him the whole seven; he is a dealer in plate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why, you are a refiner; I thought you bought to melt? A. It is usual if we find any thing better, to sell it - I sold them at 5s. 4d. per ounce, and he had them away.</p>

            . I am shopman to Sirrell. On the 31st of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, a person came to master's shop to sell seven candlesticks - I believe Solomon to be the man; he first inquired what we gave for sterling silver; I told him 4s. 10d. an ounce; he then produced them. I examined and weighed them - they weighed 121 ounces - I made a bill of them, and then called master down to pay for them, which he did - he paid the same person who brought them to me. I think I should know the candlesticks again.</p>

            . I am a silver-smith, and live at No. 6, Nottingham-place, Commercial-road. I purchased seven candlesticks of Sirrell, on the 31st of January, at 5s. 4d. per oz. I sold one pair to Mr. Wm. Barrett, and kept the other five; I delivered them up to Sirrell after inquiry was made, and do not remember whether there was any marks on them. I delivered the pair to Mr. Barrett just as I received them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you buy them to sell again, or as old silver? A. To sell again - 4s. 10d. is a fair price for old silver; there was one pair, three alike, and two odd ones. I sold the pair to Mr. Barrett.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to know that Sirrell had them to dispose of? A. I went in quite promiscuously - I had been there several times, and bought plate of him; he had some things in his window exposed for sale, which I had an idea of buying, and went in for that purpose; these candlesticks were not in the window - he asked if I would purchase some, and produced these.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I have seven silver candlesticks which I received from Sirrell, five at his house, and two more at the office afterwards; there is a crest on each of the five, but it has been taken off the two which are polished - I cannot say there has been a crest on them.</p>

               <p>COURT to FOLIGNO. Q. These are old-fashioned candlesticks? A. Yes, but they have been in demand for the last five or six years - every dealer in silver might not know that - new ones are now sometimes made to old-fashioned patterns: these are such as are now sought after.</p>

On Monday night, at half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down Banner-street, with a great weight on his back; I asked what he had got there? he said it was his master's property. I got nearer to him, and said, I should like to see it - he then dropped it and ran away; I sprang my rattle, calling Stop thief! - and in four or five minutes, found him in custody at the watch-house. I was quite sure of him - I took the meat and carried it to the watch-house - it was beef. I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the rattles spring, and saw the prisoner running; the watchman was calling Stop thief! I ran and caught the prisoner by the collar, without losing sight of him, and took him to the watch-house; another watchman came and secured him. Belshaw came in, in a very few minutes, with the beef, and said, "That is the person who had the beef." I found a knife on him, with a small piece of raw fat on it, as if it had been cutting meat.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper, and was there when the prisoner was brought in. Chalkley came about ten o'clock in the morning, and claimed the beef. I saw it afterwards fitted to the rest of the carcase - it had undoubtedly been part of the same. I saw two small pieces of raw fat on the prisoner's knife.</p>
               <p>F. CHALKLEY re-examined. The beef was not cut as a butcher would do it; it had been cut three times and then twisted up.</p>

            . I am the son of Valentine Wortley, and live in New-street, Mary-le-bone. On the 13th of February Taylor came with these candles; George brought them in, and was in the shop when Taylor delivered me the bill; I did not open them in his presence. George came again about half-past six o'clock, when it was dusk, in a cart, but not the same as the candles had come in; he said he had come for the box of candles, which he had delivered wrong in the morning. I asked him some questions, but what, I do not recollect; and he said the box was to be changed for one in the neighbourhood, and he would bring me back another presently. I believed him, and delivered it to him, having taken 1lb. out, which I told him of; he said that was of no consequence. His cart, standing on the opposite side of the road, raised my suspicion, and I watched him; he said he was going into Park-road, where he was to change the box; but he went to the end of the street, then turned to the right, and afterwards back again to the left-hand side of the street, and stopped there a quarter of an hour, in the middle of the road, with a lad in the cart; he made another stoppage, and at last came to the place he mentioned, which was Mr. Hennett's oil-shop, in Park-road; he stopped there about ten minutes, then went round the back way, to the shop of Mr. Pickman, in the Harrow-road. I followed him six or seven miles; he at last went to Montague-street, Spitalfields, and drew up to Lodge's, who keeps an oil-shop on the right-hand side in that street. I watched for a time, and saw George deliver the box of candles into Lodge's shop; Lodge was standing at the door while George and the boy were helping the box into the shop; they went into the shop together, for a few minutes, before the box was taken out. I then went to the watch-house, and got a constable; and just as we came to the door. George came out of the shop. I said to the constable, "That is the man;" he took to his heels and ran; the constable took him, and brought him back to the shop, and asked him, in the hearing of Lodge, how he came by these candles; George said, "That good gentleman (meaning me) gave them to me. I asked him for them, and he gave them to me without any scruple." The constable said, "A pretty thing that a gentleman should buy candles on purpose to give you;" and then asked him where the money was for the candles; he pulled three sovereigns and a sixpence from his pocket, and said that was the money Mr. Lodge had paid him for them. Lodge was in hearing, and said nothing; the constable then asked Lodge if he had a bill of parcels; he did not say that he had not got one, but did not produce it; the constable then told Lodge he must have the candles; he said "No, Sir, not unless I get the money back;" the constable said he would, and if he refused to deliver them, he would take him as well as the candles; the constable then turned to me, and said, "Can you swear to these boxes?" I said I could swear to the one I had sent out, and pointed it out; the constable wished to shut the door, and retire to the back of the shop. Lodge would not permit it; we brought the candles to the watch-house, with George; Lodge remained at his shop; George said at the watch-house that Lodge would have taken a hundred boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lodge show you a bill for the candles? A. Not that evening; he produced one before the Magistrate next morning; he had not been desired to attend before the Magistrate, but he came and claimed either the money or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050044"/>candles, and produced a bill of parcels - Mr. Harmer's clerk, (who appeared for Lodge) had it back - the amount of the bill is 3l. 10s.; here is my bill of the candles and box, which is 2l. 5s. 10d., but there were two boxes at Lodge's - George had another box in the cart besides the one I gave him - I had seen him bringing that box out of Mr. Pickman's; they were both taken into Lodge's, and both contained about the same quantity of candles - mine was 88lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You believed the man when he came to you? A. Yes; I never expected the same box back again.</p>

            . I live at Finchamstead, Berks. I sometimes buy pigs, and fatten them. On the 15th of March I had a full grown hog, which I had fattened - it was kept in a stye in my garden - I saw it safe there between five and six o'clock; I got up about six the next morning, and it was gone; I traced it seven, eight, or nine miles; there was the track of two men having been with it - I there lost that track, and traced the mark of a donkey-cart, as far as a place called Bishopsgate; we inquired there, and met Peck in a donkey cart, at Egham, who gave us information; we came on to Hounslow, and went into a public-house there - I at last found the hog at the prisoner's house at Hounslow; we asked him if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart - he said, No - I then asked him if he had seen a black and white pig in a donkey-cart, with two men in it - he considered a little, and said he did not know but he might have seen such a thing go along the street - Dearlove, my brother-in-law, who was with me, asked if had bought a pig at all that day - he said Yes, three or four of a neighbour, and mentioned a name, which I do not recollect - he did not say Peck - Dearlove asked to see the pigs; he went to three, which hung up in the shop, and asked me if either of those were mine - I said No - we left his premises, went to a public-house for about three quarters of an hour, made some inquiry, and Gilham took us to the prisoner's house again - Gilham asked him to show us the pig, which he had bought of two men out of a donkey-cart - he made no answer for a little time, and then said,"I have got another pig;" or two or three, I cannot say which he said; he lit a candle, and took us down a passage into a back room, it was nearly ten o'clock at night - some pigs hung there - he took a cloth off one, and it was mine; he said that was the one he had bought of two strangers; there was one or two more pigs in the room - the hair had been scalded off, but the rings were in the pig's nose (which I knew), and it had been a good deal bruised - I have not the least doubt of its being mine; the entrails had been taken out - I told the prisoner not to cut it till I came again, for it was mine - he said he had got some of it bespoke, and he did not know but he should cut it up if it was wanted; his house is about twenty-six miles from mine - we left the house, and returned with the watchman, who said, if he did his duty, he must take him and the pig; but we left it in the house - we then went to Egham - the prisoner was in the other Court when Peck was tried, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was a witness against Peck? A. Yes; he was bound over, and attended - Peck was convicted, and he was committed by direction of the Court for prevarication; the Judge ordered him into custody as a receiver - I cannot tell whether the Jury convicted Peck upon his evidence - he was not the only witness.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went to his house, was not your question whether he had cut up the stolen pig, which he had bought of some man in the road? A. No; another person went with us - I cannot positively swear that he said nothing of the kind - when we went the second time, he was some considerable time before he took us into the back room - I cannot say how long; I will not swear it was as long as five minutes; it was in a room down a passage at the back of the house - there was some blood down under where the pigs hung - he said nobody should take it out of the house till I had sworn to it; the watchman had said he must take it - he said I might leave somebody on the premises with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050045"/>Q. Did he not say, if you would allow it to be sold the money it produced you should have, if you proved it to be yours? A. I do not recollect it - we said we would be there at ten o'clock next morning, or as early as we could, and it was not to be cut up till we came - this was on Friday, but we did not go till Sunday, as we had to attend Peck's examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure, that when he was asked if he had bought a pig of two strangers in a donkey-cart, he said he had not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I went with him, and asked the prisoner if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart - he said No - I asked if he had bought any pigs that day - he said Yes, three or four of a neighbour, and mentioned his name - he showed us some which hung in the shop, but did not offer to show us any other; we left, supposing it was not there - we returned in about a quarter of an hour with Gilham, who had given us information at the Lion and Lamb public-house; Gilham asked for

             - he came, and Gilham said he wanted to see the pig he had bought that day - he stood a minute or two, then took a candle, and went down a passage, through a sitting room into another room adjoining, and there were three or four pigs, one of which was Loader's; directly he saw the nose he said it was his - Gilham asked if he might cut the rings out of the nose - he said Yes, and gave him a knife - we then went out, and returned with the watchman, who told him not to cut it up - he said he had promised some to his customers, and should like to have liberty to cut it - the watchman said he must not; but it was cut up, for we never saw it again - the prisoner was bound over as a witness - he appeared here, and we were bound over to prosecute him as a receiver - the pig appeared hardly cold, and not fit to cut up - it must have been driven twenty or thirty miles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not expressly agreed that the pig should not be cut up till ten o'clock the following morning? A. We said we would be there by ten, if we possibly could, but we could not promise - he said he would wait till ten o'clock, but not that if we were not there by ten he must cut it - he said he did not wish to keep it if it was stolen - we told him not to cut it whether we were there or not by ten o'clock - it must have been about nine at night when we first got to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, was there the slightest hesitation on his part to show you the pig? A. He lit another candle - he might be three or four minutes; I did not look for any furniture in the room where the pig was; there was no carpet - it was a room, not a slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell the Magistrate that he cut the pig up for the benefit of all parties? A. I did not hear him state that - he said he gave 3l. 7s. for it; I should think 4l. a fair price, and he could then get a living profit by it - we said nothing about a stolen pig the first time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that when he was asked if he had bought a pig of two strangers out of a donkey-cart, he declared he had not? A. He did; that was the first word he said - he has neither returned the pig nor money.</p>

            . I live at Cranford-bridge, two miles from Hounslow. I saw two persons in a donkey-cart, with a pig - it went down Hounslow, and then returned - I saw them take the pig out of the cart into Shervill's house about noon - the two men were strangers at Hounslow - Peck was one of them - neither of them live at Hounslow, or I must have known them; between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I saw Loader and Dearlove - I went with them to the prisoner's; he took took us through the shop into the passage, and there the pig hung with two more - I was never there before; he might keep pigs there to get cold - I asked the prisoner for a knife, and cut the rings out, which I gave to the watchman; when the two men had taken the pig into Shervill's, he came over to the Lion and Lamb with them; they said "The pig ought to have been 4l.;" he said, "I have given you 3l. 7s., I think it is a good price; what do you think it will weigh?" Peck said, "I fed it, and it ought to fetch 4l."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This conversation was in the public-house? A. Yes, seven or eight persons were present; there was no secret about it - I do not think Shervill thought it was stolen; I have known him from his infancy; he is postman of the town, and an honest steady man; I know they took the pig to Mr. Funnel, and then further down, before they sold it to him; I heard all that passed before the Magistrate; Shervill did not say he was willing to pay a fair price for it; as soon as it was ascertained to be his, I said, "Jem, if it is that man's property, he ought to have it;" he said, "I cannot tell that it is stolen, and shall not give it up;" I said, "The watchman had better secure it for both;" they agreed to be back from Egham by ten o'clock in the morning, and he said it should not be cut till after ten; I got there at ten, and stopped till one, but they never came - they said they should come as soon as they could, and told him not to cut it till they did come; the prisoner was examined on Peck's trial, but did not give a good account of himself - he never offered to pay the money for it in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many have you killed in that place? A. A good many; it is not a private place; it opens into a garden, and they hang there to cool; it is not a slaughter-house nor a furnished apartment; each side weighed 58lbs., and the head 8lbs.; it was not worth 3l. 7s. as it turned out; it was so much bruised, but that could not be told when it was alive.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What should you have thought the value of it, when it was alive? A. I would not have given more than three guineas for it.</p>

About a week previous to this, I applied to Mr. Funnel, a butcher, to know who had a fat pig or two to sell, having some customers who wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050046"/>some; he said if he should hear of one he would let me know. On the 16th of March a stranger called at Funnel's in a donkey-cart, and offered one for sale; he sent over for me; I was out, but was sent for, and went to Funnel's, who told me a person in a donkey-cart had offered him one, and he said if he had wanted one he should not have he sitated at buying it; I went, and overtook the cart - they wanted 4l. for it - I offered 3s. 5s.; they would not take less than 3l. 15s.; I was turning away when the tall man came up and said, "The lowest I will take for it is 3l. 10s." I offered 3l. 7s., which they would not take; we separated about one hundred and twenty yards; they returned, and said if I would stand half a gallon of beer I should have it; I said No - they at last brought it down to my house, and turned it into my yard; I had not the least suspicion of its being stolen - I went to the Lion and Lamb, and took a draught of beer with them.</p>

I afterwards saw the prisoner's brother standing at his door, and recollected his asking me about a pig- I sent for him, and told him perhaps it might suit him; I thought it was honestly come by; it seemed to be a poor man's pet pig; he left me, in order to go and bargain for it - I do not recollect his asking if I thought it would be safe to buy it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Hounslow. The man called in the cart, and offered me this pig; I did not want it - there was nothing to lead me to think it was improperly come by; I should think the pig worth 4s. 4d. or 4s. 6d. a stone; fifteen stone and a half, at 4s. 4d., would come to 3l. 7s. 4d.</p>

            . I was working in Doctor Taylor's garden on the 16th of March, which is about half a mile from the prisoner's shop. I saw the prisoner come up to some men in a donkey-cart, and bargain for a pig; I heard all they said; the man wanted 3l. 10s. for it - he offered 3l. 7s.; they said he should not have it, and went on about one hundred and twenty yards - they then beckoned him back, and said he should have it if he would stand half-a-gallon of beer; he refused, and they shook hands and agreed at 3l. 7s., which I should think a fair price for it, and said so; Peck, who was in the cart, said, for the sake of a shilling he would not go two or three miles further.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house on this night; he came to me at the Red Lion public-house about half-past four o'clock next day, and said, "These men are not come - what am I to do with the pig? it will spoil;" I told him he had better sell the carcase, but to be sure and save the head that they might swear to it - he said he would save the head; Loader came next morning, and said the Magistrate told him he might take the pig - I went to the prisoner's house, and said, "Have you made away with the pig's head?" he said, "Yes, I have sold it." I do not believe there is a man in Hounslow bears a better character than the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 22d of February, a little before six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners coming up Tower-hill, about one hundred yards from Mr. Hurst's - one was drawing a truck, and the other pushing behind; something very heavy was in it; I followed the truck to the house of Wilks, a smith and furnishing brasier; Rudd, who had been pushing behind, left the truck before it got there; Sibley took it to the house - he then threw a sack aside, and took out a large piece of lead - he took it into Wilks' back premises- it appeared to be a sheet of lead rolled up; the bag still remained in the truck, which Sibley returned, and fetched in; I went into the back shop, and saw him put the bag down by the side of the sheet of lead - they weighted together 160lbs.; I asked Sibley who the lead belonged to - he said he did not know, but as he was coming along near Irongate-stairs, he saw the truck, and a man employed him to drag it; I asked who the man was - he said he did not know, but that he had left him, and promised to overtake him; I said, "How came you to bring the lead here?" he said the man told him to take it opposite to Nightingale-lane, and that he had seen the man once or twice before; I said he must go with me and point him out; he went down Tower-hill, but no man was pointed out; I asked who the truck belonged to - he said he did not know, and then said he believed it was Mr. Hurst's, for he had had the use of it two or three times; I went with him to Mr. Hurst's, and saw him - he said he had not lent his truck to anybody, but that Sibley worked for him, and he had employed him for the last two or three weeks, to look after the lead in particular, and that the truck was his. I examined the house next morning, and found two sides of the dormer stripped of lead - I applied the three pieces of lead to the dormer - it corresponded exactly with the nail holes and what was left; I have no doubt whatever of its having come from that house; the next day, in consequence of what passed before the Magistrate I went with Lill, and apprehended Rudd - he said he knew nothing about it, but that a slater employed him to push behind the truck; I asked how he came to leave the truck - he said he went to purchase some handles for Mr. Hurst's drawers.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050047"/>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you see Mr. Hurst's foreman with the truck on the road? A. No. I saw Sibley take the lead out of the truck, and put it down by the side of a sheet of lead, which I believe he had first taken in. He said a man employed him to drag it, and in consequence of that Rudd was taken. Mr. Hurst has many servants; several adjoining houses had been pulled down, but this had not been began; the lead exactly fitted the place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Sibley at the handle of the truck, and Rudd pushing behind; he left about two hundred yards before it got to Wilks'. Littledale's account is correct; I saw the lead taken in, and afterwards saw it fitted to the dormer of Hurst's house - it fitted exactly, in every respect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was all the lead taken from the dormer? A. No, the two sides - I fitted it to what was left.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, employed by the Dock Company. On the morning of the 23d of February I called at Hurst's, to know when he could give possession of the house, and found the lead had been taken away the night before; I saw it fitted to the dormer - it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Company exercise any ownership over the materials at that time? A. No. None of the other dormers were covered with lead.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HURST. Q. Did you know what your dormer was covered with? A. No. When the next house was being pulled down I drove some persons off my roof. Sibley was working with the rest of my men; I had four moving furniture within the house. I have told him he was welcome to the truck whenever he could earn a shilling with it, but I never allowed any body to take it without my knowledge - the foreman had no authority to lend it. I was at the house from half-past one o'clock till five - it could not have been brought down during that time, or I must have seen it. Sibley was employed that day carrying goods for me - Rudd was employed to fit up the house I was moving to.</p>
               <p>SIBLEY's Defence. I wish to ask, as Mr. Hurst says I had the care of the lead, if any more were shown to me than what belonged to the water-closet. I was to set in the parlour to see if any one came to take that, and one night somebody put up a ladder, which I pulled away and kept - I was never up stairs. I am often called from his house to Irongate-stairs, and on this night, as I went home, the other prisoner asked if I wanted a job, as a man wanted this lead taken to East Smithfield - it laid on the pavement; I ran back, and borrowed the truck of Mr. Hurst's foreman - Rudd helped me up the hill with it.</p>
               <p>RUDD's Defence. I assisted him up the hill, but never saw him before.</p>
               <p>JOHN HURST re-examined. The back of my house is covered with lead - I employed Sibley to watch that, but the dormer was on the roof. The prisoners were both occasionally in my employ, but I do not think they were acquainted.</p>

The prisoner was there - I did not see him take this coat down; I saw it on his back, and he was putting his own great coat on over it; he then took off two strings which it hung by, emptied his own coat pocket, and hung it up where the new one had hung - I followed him to the door, and when he got out secured him, and took the coat off him.</p>

            . I am packer to Mr. Bridgman. On the 16th of March I was on the watch, as some soap had been taken - I was concealed about twenty minutes after eight o'clock; when the men went to breakfast, the prisoner used to remain, and his daughter bring him his breakfast. I saw him go to the cellar where there was about a ton weight of soap - I saw him take a bar, weighing about 3 lbs.; he put it either into his trousers or pocket- I was obliged to turn my head, being in a confined situation, and did not see him take any more - he went up stairs, apparently to his work; I tapped, and the apprentice called the prosecutor's brother down - he told me to watch him out; he went out in about ten minutes, and when he had got about one hundred yards, we called him back - he hesitated about returning, and asked us to let him go to get shaved; he was brought back; I charged him with stealing the soap - an officer came, and two bars were found in his trousers or pocket; he had asked Mr. Bridgman not to send for an officer - and said he would leave London altogether.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was sent for; the prisoner unbuttoned his trousers, and pulled the soap out of a kind of large pocket under his thigh, between his drawers and his trousers, it was made to hold two cakes of soap on each side; it must have been a pocket, or the soap would have fallen out at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Owing to my wife having been eight weeks in the hospital, and having three children, it was more than I could support. I earned 30s. a week in the winter, but only 15s. in the summer. It was entirely distress that brought me to it.</p>
               <p>C. ROBINSON. His wife was very ill, and I do not think his furniture was worth 2l.; but I do not think he could be in distress.</p>
               <p>MR. BRIDGMAN. He left me - I took him back again, and he promised to keep steady to his work. He earned what I have stated.</p>

            . I have been married to James Wall - my maiden name was Grant. On the 1st of March, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was in <placeName id="t18270405-82-crimeloc474">Oxford-street</placeName>

A horse had fallen down in a break, and this had drawn a crowd - I went into a shop, and staid there five minutes, to avoid the crowd, and while there I saw the three prisoners looking very hard at me - I am certain of all three. I left the shop with my reticule on my arm, and had not got more than three shops further, when I came to a mews, which the break had gone down; the female prisoner then said, "Here comes the horse again!" I looked down the mews, but could see no horse; I went on about two yards, and then perceived that my reticule had been cut from my arm - nobody but the three prisoners were near enough to have done it. I immediately turned round, and seeing them, the strong impression on my mind was that they must have done it - several persons were behind me, looking very hard at me- I turned round, intending to speak to the female prisoner, but she was gone. I immediately said, "The woman in the red shawl and black velvet bonnet, and the two men, had robbed me;" nobody but them was near enough to have done it - other persons had come near me as the crowd was dispersing. I went to Marlborough-street, and in about an hour and a half, the three prisoners were brought there - the pocket handkerchief, which had been in my reticule, was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoners have been indicted for robbing Eliza Grant, and acquitted? A. Yes, it arose from a mistake of the clerks' at Marlborough-street, and I was directed to file another hill. I suppose my name is Wall, till it is proved to the countrary; I live with my friends in George-street, Portman-square - I live there by the name of Grant, as Mr. Wall has been married before. I have left him two years - it was an open shop that I went into to avoid the crowd; another young female also came in, and she was talking to me - my reticule was safe after I left the shop - I did not stand in the gateway; I merely stopped and looked down - seeing no horse I walked on - I looked, and then missed my bag; I then stopped, and looked back - there were only two or three persons about when I left the shop - my handkerchief was found on the female prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutrix came to Marlborough-street, and stated this case - she produced the strings of her reticule; I and Ballard took her into the clerks' office - then she described the persons she suspected. I and Allensby went out into Oxford-street, and in Regent-street we saw the three prisoners in company, and in conversation together, looking into a shop; we went over - took them into custody, and took them to the office. This lady was sent for, and instantly spoke to their being the three persons; they were all sitting on a bench; I desired the female prisoner to stand up - I had observed her moving something under her cloak, and when she stood up I went and looked under her, and picked up this handkerchief; the prosecutrix said, "That is my handkerchief, it was in my reticule;" it must have been dropped by one of the prisoners; nobody else was near - it was immediately under where the female prisoner sat. I have not the least doubt of it having come from her - I found a pen-knife in her pocket, with four sharp blades - she wanted it returned to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mrs. Wall was in the room before the prisoners? A. We sent for her - she was behind me, and the female prisoner before me - nobody but the clerks and officers were in the room - the prisoner was moving something under her cloak, which excited my suspicion, and when she stood up I saw the handkerchief. Mrs. Wall said the corner of it was torn by a little dog - that it was not hemmed, and she had another like it at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could that handkerchief have come from Mrs. Wall? A. It was impossible - she had not been near the spot.</p>
               <p>MRS. WALL. This is my handkerchief, and was in my reticule - here is a red mark of tooth-powder on it, and a little tear in the corner - I have two others like it.</p>

            . I went with the other officers, and saw the prisoners in Regent-street, about twelve yards from Oxford-street - they were in company; we crossed the road, and each secured one; we took them to the office, and sent for Mrs. Wall. They sat on a bench in the clerks' office - Clements remained by them; Mrs. Wall came in in about an hour, and identified all the prisoners as being close to her in Oxford-street. I saw Clements stoop and pick up the handkerchief, which Mrs. Wall claimed - she was not near it. Llewellyn gave his name as Jones; Williamson also gave his name as Jones, and afterwards as Davis - each declined saying where they lived, except mentioning the Commercial-road and City-road - they said they were in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They never denied being present, and seeing the prosecutrix run into the shop? A. No; I believe the female was searched twice; but the handkerchief was dropped the first time - one of them must have dropped it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the others, and took the prisoners - they sat on a bench in the clerks' office; Mrs. Wall came in; the handkerchief could not have fallen from her - it must have fallen from the female prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she searched twice? A. Yes; first in my presence, and afterwards by a female. Mrs. Wall mentioned several things being in her reticule, but I did not hear her mention the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMSON's Defence. When I first went into the office, the lady said it happened about twelve o'clock; we had not gone through the mob, for the pressure was too great - we were pressed back by the horse plunging on the pavement. We walked down Regent-street - there was nobody with me but my wife; as we returned up the street, two men laid hold of us - the other prisoner was taken full twenty yards from us - it is false that we were speaking together. When we got to the office the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050051"/>prisoner was sitting at the end of the bench - my wife placed herself within a yard of him, and I on the other side- there was nothing found on us; before Clements searched my wife he pushed her right up in the corner, and in three or four minutes he went and picked up this handkerchief. The prosecutrix snatched it out of his hand, and said it was hers - she put it into her pocket; she wanted to swear to the ring on my wife's finger, and to a lot of duplicates.</p>
               <p>H. WILLIAMSON's Defence. I was stripped, but nothing found on me; the prosecutrix said, "What is that ring on your finger?" I said, "It is my mother's;" she said, "Oh, I did not know but what I might have lost one;" I had a long cloak on, it is true, but it was my snuff-box that I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>LLEWELLYN's Defence. My brother wished me to call on Lieut. Gee. in Cavendish-street, and I was to meet my brother at half-past one, in Regent-street. I stopped to look at this restive horse - several people came and asked what was the matter, but I do not recollect seeing either of the prisoners. I was waiting for my brother when Ballard took me.</p>

I had some dealings with him, and told Alderson of it; on the 11th of March I and Alderson went to his house - he was not at home; I was directed to the Castle public-house, in Long-alley, where I found him - I told him I had come for a score of shillings, and asked Alderson if he would have a score - he said, "Yes - how much are they?" the prisoner said 6s.; Alderson said he would have a score - we came out of the public-house, and gave him the money; he said, "Put both monies together." I gave him two half-crowns and a shilling, and asked him where we should wait - he said,"Go to the public-house," meaning the Weavers' Arms, which I had gone to before; he went away - we waited at the public-house about twenty minutes - it was then church time, and we went out and stood at the corner of the court; he came to us, and said, "Did you not think me a long time?" I said No; he put both the scores into my hand; I put them into my pocket. Alderson asked him if he was not going to have any thing to drink - he said No; Alderson then said he was an officer, and took him; I then went away, and afterwards gave Alderson the two scores of shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you ever been in a Court of Justice? A. No - I never stood at any bar. I have been in this line about three weeks, but never passed any bad money; a young man introduced me to the prisoner. I never bought any money but these two scores for myself. I got some with the young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate ask you what had become of the other 8s.? A. Yes; I did not say I had passed them - I gave the two scores to Alderson about twenty-five minutes or half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you ever deal in any counterfeit money till Alderson directed you so to do? A. No.</p>

            . I am Bow-street patrol, and live in Marshall-street, Golden-square. In consequence of information which I received from Stuart I directed him to go with a young man to buy coin - and on the 11th of March I went with him to the prisoner's house in Angel-court - he was not at home - we were directed to the Castle, where we found him; Stuart called him out, and said he wanted a score - he said, "Very well;" I saw Stuart give him two half-crowns and a shilling; he then asked if I would like a score - I asked how much they were - he said 6s. I put my hand into my pocket to give him 6s., and he said cheese it, which means not to give it to him at that moment; when he got by the archway I gave him two half-crowns and a shilling - he directed us to wait at the public-house, which we did, but at church time we were turned out, and stood at the corner of Angel-place, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner came and said, "Did not you think me long?" he gave Stuart two brown papers, containing two scores - I held out my hand for mine - he said, "They are both together;" I asked him to go and have some drink - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050052"/>said No; I then said I was an officer, and took him into custody - he hallooed Murder! made great resistance, and called for a man named Steel: I put him into a coach, and took him to St. Martin's watch-house; I found Stuart at the gate - he gave me the parcel; I went with him to a public-house in Cranbourn-passage, and found twenty counterfeit shillings wrapped in each paper, with silver paper between them; I had disguised myself, so that I should not be known. I remember the Magistrate asking Stuart what had become of the other eight - that alluded to another score which was bought on a former occasion - Mace had that eight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to go as far as St. Martin's watch-house before you saw Stuart? A. I had appointed to meet him there. I had seen the prisoner give him the brown paper parcels.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Were Dodd and Mace near the spot? A. Yes; I asked the prisoner for a score - he said they were both together. I had marked my half-crown and shilling. Dodd afterwards showed me a half-crown, which was one I had marked.</p>

She came again in the evening, and bought a penny candle; she gave me another sixpence - I gave her change, and put that into my pocket- I had then three sixpences, but nothing more; Ann Hoare came in, bought something, and gave me a shilling- I gave her one of the sixpences out of the three - it was a bad one; I then gave her another, and that was bad also; I looked for the other - that was good, and it was the one I had in my pocket before the prisoner came; I put the two bad ones back into my pocket, and did not mix them with any other sixpences. The prisoner came next day for a penny candle, and gave me a bad sixpence - I said I could not give her change; she said she had got nothing but a halfpenny - I said, "You gave me two bad sixpences on Saturday;" she said she was not in the shop, but I am certain of her person. I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge - he found 31/2d. in her pocket.</p>

I met the prisoner under the Piazza; he came up to me, and snatched at my watch; the chain broke, and he took the two seals, the key and ring. I picked up one of the rings, and the officer the other; he made off across Covent-garden, and was stopped there - he was not out of my sight. I did not see him drop the seals, but I picked up one at his feet; I am satisfied he is the man who took them - I only lost sight of him while he passed the pillar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where had you been spending your day? A. At different places; I had had two glasses of porter, and a share of two bottles of wine, between four or five of us, after dinner; I had not taken any supper - I considered myself sober; it was the act of an instant - he passed round one of the columns,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050055"/>and between the coaches. I did not produce my watch before the Magistrate, but I showed the ring and seals.</p>

Wilson came up at the time, and I gave the prisoner to him; I picked up this seal and ring - the prosecutor appeared quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it drop? A. No, I heard it - there was not a strong light; it was a very boisterous night, and the gas did not burn strong. I searched him, and only found a handkerchief on him.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I received some money of Mr. Kirby - I went to the shop and bought six pairs of stockings, at 1s. 4d. per pair - I gave the same money to the prisoner that I had received from Mr. Kirby- he asked me if I wanted any thing, and I said some stockings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you want these stockings for your own wear? A. Yes, and I bought them for myself, six pair at 1s. 4d. per pair - I did not give Mr. Kirby 8s.; I received his 8s. on account - I paid the same money to the prisoner - this was about half-past nine o'clock - I took the stockings home for my own use.</p>
               <p>MR. KIRBY re-examined. After the stockings had been purchased I told the prisoner that I had been daily robbed, and I thought he was the person; I accused him of having property about him - he denied it; I said, "You can have no objection to being searched;" he said No, not at all; he then drew the two half-crowns and three shillings, with my mark upon them, from one pocket, and five shillings from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You asked him if he had any property? A. Yes, any property of mine. I have three young men in my shop who act as cashiers, and receive money from the others, but the regu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050057"/>lar cashier was gone to his supper.

               <p>M. A. HEBERT. There was another girl who went into the watch-house with her; I did not say it was either her or the prisoner; I can swear positively to the prisoner; I had not lost sight of her. When we were at the watch-house I said, as my brooch was a family one, "If you will give it me you may go about your business." I said there had been other women in the public-house, but it was the prisoner who looked so hard at me.</p>

The prisoner came to his shop on the 16th of March, a little before eight o'clock in the morning; she asked the price of a piece of beef; I said 7d. per pound; she then looked at another, and seemed to be going out; she then pointed to the one she looked at first, said she was going further, and would call as she came back; I then missed this piece of beef, and followed her - she had it under her arm; I brought her back to the shop, and my master came out, and said it was his beef - she said she had bought it in the morning - she then offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you constantly there? A. Not always; there are two persons generally in the shop, and they were there at the time. I cannot say whether there was a shopman nearer the door than I was; there was one on the other side of the door. She had just got out of the shop when I stopped her; she was not speaking to one of my fellow-shopmen - I will not undertake to say she had not been at the shop before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was she from the shop? A. She was just off the step, turning to the right; there is no way into the shop that way. I am sure she said she had bought this beef in the morning, of a butcher higher up.</p>

On the 18th of February I was going along the street, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and I went down to try if any one was at the premises, as I knew some persons had been at work there that day. I felt the door - it was fast, and I was going away, when a young man came round to me in a white rough coat - he joined another man in a brown coat, and I looked towards them, and saw another person come over the gate of Mr. Morris' yard, and join them - the one who came over the gate said, "Halloo, William!" and they all went up the street. I followed them, and met Mr. Smith, who had the keys - we opened the door, and I saw the inner door was half open, and heard some one run up stairs - but I did not see who it was; I then heard a window break up stairs, and said, "They have got out that way;" the window leads to Mr. Morris' stables, and from thence into the yard. A young man, named Cook, went in with us, and they went up stairs while I stood at the door - we had locked the outer door, that nobody should enter.

            . I am a workman in the prosecutors' office. I went away on this Sunday, at ten minutes before two o'clock; the things were all right then; I went again with Murray in the evening - it was dark; I opened the outer-door, and saw a person at the inner door, which leads up to the printing office; he ran up stairs, but I cannot swear that it was the prisoner - I immediately locked the door, and called out, "You are all right!" I then went to the front of the premises, and heard the window break; we went into the premises again, and found many of the things out of their places - the first thing I saw was a box, which had been drawn out of the counting-house - it had been broken open, and was standing in the passage leading to the street door. I do not know what had been in that box; I then saw two bundles of foolscap, which had been removed from the table in the warehouse, and brought down stairs to the steam-room door (a bundle of paper is two reams) - I afterwards found, I believe, four desks broken open; the counting-house must have been broken open, or the box could not have been removed. I sent for the officers, who came in about half an hour - I went over the top of the stables with them - I did not see the prisoner found - I saw the persons who went into the premises - the prisoner was not one of them. I knew him before; he had been a pressman of Mr. Sydney's four or five years ago - I have seen him since then, but he has not worked there for the last four years.</p>

I went in at the inner door, with my brother, Smith, Murray, and Cook - I then desired the door to be shut - I am quite certain the prisoner was not there. I had known him before, he was apprenticed to my father; I went up stairs first, and found the window of the overseer's counting-house had been broken, and was open.

            . I am a trunk-maker, and live in the Strand; there is a way from Mr. Sidney's premises to our back yard, by getting over the stables. I discovered that some persons were searching for thieves, and I searched the top of our work-shop, and the top of the kitchen. I then saw the prisoner through our glazed door, as I was going from the kitchen - that door is the way out, he tapped at one of the squares of glass, and said, "Here, halloo, let us through!" I asked what he did there - he said he was searching for thieves. I said he had no business there; he said he had, for he was one of Mr. Sydney's men. I left him in custody of my father, and fetched a person from Mr. Sydney's, who said he did not know him; he was then given in charge to the watchman. A person could get from Mr. Sydney's over the stables, and then there was a piece of quartering, down which he got into the yard - there were the marks of his feet on it.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Martin's. The prisoner was given into my charge on Sunday night, the 18th of February; his hands were dirty, as if with rubbing against some wall. I told him I did not want to know any thing at all about the matter, but in the course of conversation, he said he was an unfortunate young man; he had been abroad, and he supposed he must travel again for this - but it was a fortunate thing, he knew it was not a dwelling house, and that would save his life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home, and had occasion to pass the office, as there was a number of persons there, I went over to see what it was - the door was open, and two or three persons came down the street, and went in at the time I did. Smith told one gentleman to go out and watch by the tiles, and said something about minding his stick - but if there had been no way of getting out but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050060"/>by the gate, what necessity would there be for any one to watch the tiles. I went out and found the counting-house door open - I went out at the window, and fell down before I got far. I then walked about some time, and a person called to know who it was, and some person made answer that they were looking for thieves - I fell down, and cut my hand with a sky-light. I knocked at the door of a house, which had not the appearance of wanting to conceal myself - some person came, and they said they suspected I was the thief, and they took me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was with you? A. Thomas Evans - they had several examinations before the Magistrate - a man named Emmanuel, who keeps a clothes-shop was examined; he said they were not the men who brought the coat - a man named Cole was also examined - Mundy had a kind of brown frock-coat on - it was not a dark brown - I said at the office it was a long brown frock-coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe the coat that they were carrying particularly? A. It was a box-coat; it passed close to my arm and I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MUNDY. Q. If you knew me so well, why did not you stop me at once, as you have given out that I am a thief, and could not keep a place for these three years? A. I said I had seen him out of place for a long time - I followed him so far because I suspected he had stolen it.</p>

            . I was with Morris - it was about twenty-five minutes before five o'clock when they went into the shop with the coat - I saw the prisoners come out of the mews - Newells had the coat in his arms, and Mundy turned back to see if there was any body coming out of the mews - he then took the coat, and they went on together - it was a blue coat with a yellow button, they went through Portman-square, from thence through Portman-street, and several other streets, towards the Seven-dials; they took the coat into a clothes-shop, but I do not know the name of the street, they came out with a coat and went into another shop, a little way off, and there I missed them - I was turning a corner, and heard a door shut, but I could not tell where it was - we waited five or ten minutes - in the meantime they came out again with the coat, and Morris said we would not follow them any further.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the owners of the two shops examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes - we did not stop the prisoners because we had no right to do so - I cannot say what kind of coat Mundy had on, because the capes of the coat he was carrying hung very low down his back - it was not a long coat - it might come to about the knees - I have seen Emmanuel and Cole here to-day - I do not know the name of the streets in which the shops were.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Newells on the 15th - I told him it was about a great coat: he said he knew nothing about it - I then went, on the 16th, with the two witnesses to the Duke of York public-house, in Shepherd-street, where I found Mundy; he said he knew nothing at all about it - I asked what he had done with the great-coat which he got from the other man on Tuesday night - he said he had no great-coat - they were examined several times on account of the coachman being so ill he could not attend.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of March I heard some words between my son and another person; I got up, came down in my shirt, and found the prisoner in my passage; I asked what he had done, he said, "Nothing at all;" I said, "You are my prisoner," and I took hold of him; he resisted, and wanted to go into the taproom - I saw some money in his mouth, and saw him put his hand to his mouth, and then he shuffled about, and I saw a shilling fall from the back of his trowsers; I sent for an officer, who came in about ten minutes, and was going to search him, but 2s. 6d. more fell from him which made 3s. 6d.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 18th of March I got up pretty early, and opened the street-door - I then went into the bar; the prisoner came between six and seven o'clock, he stood by the fire a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I went up stairs to ask my father a question, and as I was coming down, I saw the prisoner coming from the bar-door; I saw the till half way out - I went and looked at it, and there was only 2s. in it; there was 5s. 6d. there when I went up stairs - I went to the prisoner, and asked what he had done with the money - he denied having any; I told him to give me what he had taken from the till, and he might go about his business - I saw some money fall from him.</p>

            . I lodge at the Horse and Groom. On the morning of the 18th of March I remember Osborne going up stairs; the prisoner was then standing with his back to the fire-place; he directly went into the bar, and stood near the till with his face towards it - Osborne came down in about a minute, and the prisoner went into the back yard; Osborne went into the bar, and then he went after the prisoner, and accused him of robbing the till.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see him open the till? A. No; I saw him pushing it too; I was in the tap-room; there was no one went into the bar but the prisoner; there is a passage between the bar and the tap-room. I saw some money fall from the prisoner.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the bar; Osborne had been gone up stairs about two minutes; the prisoner went out of the bar as soon as he heard him step on the stairs; he came down and went into the bar; he then ran to the prisoner, and I heard him tell him if he would give him the money again he might go about his business - I saw the money drop from the back part of his trousers when the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in to call for half a pint of porter, and was talking to the lad about the ticket of a watch seal; he said he would buy it of me, and get it out unknown to his father - I said he was welcome to the ticket, as no doubt it was stopped; I then went to the bar to give it him, and he was not there; I did not go in at all.</p>
               <p>J. OSBORNE re-examined. Q. Did You say that you would accept of the ticket, or have it unknown to your father? A. No; there was 3s. in the till the night before, left to give change; the other was taken that morning. He had a pennyworth of beer after he was taken into custody; he had not called for any thing before that; he said he had no other money but the penny that he paid for the beer.</p>

On the evening of the 8th of March I was passing Amwell-terrace - I saw a horse and cart there - the prisoner and another man were moving some stones; and while I spoke to the prisoner, the other man got away - I did not lose sight of the prisoner. I did not see them put the stones into the cart - but when I got up there were six or seven in it; he said he was employed by an Irishman round the corner, to take them into the field. I said it was very strange to do such work at that time of night, and I had him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he allude to the other man who was with him? No; I cannot say I saw more than one stone removed; he did not attempt to go off. I did not go for an officer - I crossed the road and sent a person for one. I did not go above thirty yards, when I returned I found the prisoner still there.</p>

            .

               <p>MR. CHITTENDEN. I cannot find the mark by this light - I saw it before the Magistrate, but it was very faint - it was done with a pencil, but it answers in quality and description with the piece I lost.</p>
               <p>G. AVIS re-examined. This is the piece of cambric I got at the pawnbroker's; Mr. Chittenden saw it, and there was a pencil mark on it, by which he could swear to it - I do not see it now.</p>

I heard a cry that my coat was taken from the chaise; I ran out, and followed the thief; he had left the coat in a house, and a woman brought it in about five minutes after I got back - this is the coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you run after the same men who had taken your coat? A. I did not see him, but they said he had run down the street - that man is not here now. When I came back I found the prisoner in the public-house.</p>

            . I am going on for eleven years of age, I took care of Mr. Minns' chaise about a fortnight ago, in Earl-street, Lisson-grove; he went into the Champion. - The prisoner and another person came up to the gig, and the prisoner said to me, "I will give you 1d. for your chance;" I said No - (I suppose he meant to hold the horse); he then said he would give me 11/4d.; I said No; he said, "I held it once, and they only gave me a drink of beer;" he then said, "What will you take?" I said 2d., which he gave me, and I went to Salisbury-street, to buy some buttons; I saw the prisoner in custody about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you think will become of boys who play at buttons? A. I do not know; I never sold my chance before. I did not see the other man again.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Earl-street, Lisson-grove. I saw the horse and gig at the Champion between four and five o'clock - I saw the prisoner and three other young men coming down the street; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050065"/>known two of them before, but not the prisoner - I saw him and one of his companions go to this lad, and stand talking with him some minutes - they offered him money, and then went into the Champion; they then came out, and gave him something; the prisoner then held the horse's head, and his companion took the coat, and went away with it. The prisoner went into the Champion as soon as he saw me go after the man; he said, "Your coat is stolen;" my wife said, "Yes it is, and you are the man who held the horse's head."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from the public-house? A. Opposite, about twenty yards off. The prisoner went into the public-house, and gave the alarm; hardly a minute had elapsed. I pursued the man who took the coat, and the prisoner gave the alarm as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at one time that he went in as soon as he saw you go after the man? A. Yes, so he did - I sent my wife to tell Mr. Minns, and I was crossing the road to follow the man; the prisoner went in at the same time as my wife did, at another door.</p>

On the 24th of March I had some clover-hay mixed with oats, which had grown among the clover, which is a thing we do not often see; I do not think there is such a mixture round the country for ten miles - I cannot say how many trusses I had of it, but I missed one truss on Sunday morning, the 25th of March, about seven o'clock - I had seen it safe at eight the night before - it was laying together in the further loft; I saw the clover littered about the loft window, and missed a truss; I then traced to see where it was gone - I went to the bottom of the yard, and saw clover and oats by the fence, as if it had been put over there; I then traced it over three fences, into the yard of the Black Horse public-house; I got an officer, Wilson, and he went with me; I showed him the spots where it was, and we got to the fence leading to the Black Horse yard; the officer got over there, but I did not; he afterwards came out, and in about two hours I went with him to the prisoners' stable - I know them both very well; we found some clover, which the officer pulled out of a rack - it was the same clover which had been lost. Mr. Eames changes six coaches there every day. I did not see any other clover there; I saw the prisoners there, and told them to bring it up into the loft to match with ours - the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050066"/>ficer brought it, and they followed him; I told them it was ours; James said they had it of an ostler at the King's Head public-house, in Kingsland-road, but the direction in which I traced the hay was not that in which they would have gone from Kingsland-road to the prisoners' stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it the mildness of winter which caused the oats to spring up with the clover? A. Yes. The prisoners occupy about fourteen acres of ground, and are market-gardeners; they were bailed - they had leave to go home to get bail, and returned; I could not tell how many trusses were in the loft, but could miss one by the manner they laid; I never knew the prisoners in trouble.</p>

            . I am a private patrol - Mr. Pige's house is in my beat. On Sunday morning, the 25th of March, about a quarter-past five o'clock, as it was just getting light; I saw a chap come down a court, leading to the back of Pige's house; I went up there, and found the privy door shut - I asked who was there - the prisoner answered, "It is Hopcroft;" the parish watchman came up, and knocked at the door - he opened it, and this lead was behind the door; no other person was there; I said,"This is your game, is it Mr. Hopcroft?" he said he knew nothing about the lead, and came there for a certain purpose - the privy is common to all the houses in the court; I tried to seize him - he fought very hard, and struck me in the jaw; I got assistance, and took him to the watch-house; I then went to Mr. Pige's, called him up, and asked if he had lost any lead; he looked round, and said he had; I applied this lead to the roof; it fitted exactly, and covered that part of the roof near the chimney, and exactly matched with what was left; I have no doubt of its being the same.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-yard, George-street, Bethnal-green - the prisoner lived next door to Pige's. Between five and six o'clock that morning I saw the patrol at the privy door; the patrol drew his cutlass, and said he would cut his head off if he resisted; I did not see him resist; I called out to him not to commit murder; I was at the window, and he was inside the privy.</p>
               <p>W. LOYAL. I did not strike him till he jammed the door too, and struck me; he said, "I will muzzle you;" I then drew my cutlass.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Mr. Cole. Dory and Groves came one morning for one hundred bushels of grains. I do not recollect what day it was; they had one hundred bushels, for which, I believe, Dory paid; I received three sovereigns, and said, "This is just right;" as I thought it was two sovereigns and a half, my sight not being good; he said, "How much are they a bushel?" I then saw it was three sovereigns; I gave them to another man, who, I believe, gave change. I saw "S. Howard, Rickmansworth," on the waggon. There were no horses in it when I first saw it, but afterwards there were four - I think one was grey.</p>

            , and live on Hounslow-heath. Fielder's house is on Hounslow-heath: on the 15th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning (I think) I saw a waggon with four horses standing at his house. I did not read the name on it - I saw two men with the waggon - Dory is like one of them; I saw him before the Magistrate - he was then dressed like the man on the waggon, but I cannot be certain of him - I believe him to be the man; there were grains in the waggon. I saw a sack nearly full put on the other man's back from the waggon; it was carried round Fielder's house. I did not see Fielder then - I had seen him before, talking to the two men with the waggon - the man on the waggon put the sack on the other man's back, who carried it round the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live next door to Fielder? A. Yes; his premises are enclosed in front, but open on the side - he is a carman; he does hired work, has a little land, and keeps pigs and horses. I have frequently seen him buying grains of a man who sells them - he generally goes himself to Mr. Palmer, a brewer, for them - but at times people come and sell to him. I am sure I saw him and his son speak to the men. I know a boy named Gritteridge; my husband is a carpenter - there never was any dispute between him and Fielder; my husband was discharged under the Insolvent Act in July, and there was a little difference between them then, but since that they have been friendly. I believe Fielder can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do people who sell grains at his door come with a waggon and four horses? A. No; a jobbing man comes with a cart and one horse. Two of the horses were brown.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow. I know Fielder, and I know Dory's person; on the 15th of March, in the morning, I was by Fielder's house, and saw a waggon directly opposite. Dory and Groves were with Fielder, and his son stood close by the waggon, which was loaded with grains - it was a large one - I did not notice how many horses there were. I saw Dory on the waggon - he filled the sack with grains from the waggon - it was taken into Fielder's yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was Fielder at that time? A. Standing by the waggon.

            . I was in Mr. Howard's employ - Dory was my fellow-servant - he kept the nags. On the 14th of March Mr. Howard sent me to the brewery for grains - we got a hundred bushels - Dory paid for them - I do not know how much; we put one bushel into the stable for the horses, and then went towards home. Dory called at a house on Hounslow-heath as we went - he went on before the horses, and called at the house; I came up soon after - he spoke to somebody, but I did not see who it was. When we returned home, Dory went on before, and spoke to Fielder on the heath. Dory got up on the waggon, and bid me come up, and put some grains into one of master's sacks, which we had taken some grains in for the horses. I carried the sack of grains into Fielder's stables, emptied them out, and brought the sack away - Fielder stood by the yard in view of me and Dory. I did not know him before, nor was I ever that road before - we were opposite the house three or four minutes - Fielder said nothing to me - I did not hear him speak to Dory. We all went to a public-house, and Fielder wished me good day - he told us to call again. When we got home Dory gave me 2s. 11/2d., and said that was my share - he did not say what of. We were about ten minutes in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. How long are you going to Twickenham and back? A. I was never that road before - master gave us 2s. between us for going; we went away about eleven o'clock at night, and returned before dark next day. Dory went on to Fielder's house before me - I carried the sack in; I have been accused of stealing the grains - master said if I would tell the truth he would forgive me. Dury said nothing to me about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Dory call at the same house in the morning? A. I did not see him go in in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did you go into the stable? A. Only once; there were about two bushels and a half in the sack - I received 2s. 11/2d. as my share - grains are sixpence a bushel; no explanation was given me by Dory. I was committed as the thief; I saw Cook the constable once while I was in Newgate - he did not ask me to accuse my fellow-servant. Mr. Fellows, the lawyer said, I was to come as a witness, and asked what I knew about it - he said if I would be of use on the trial, I should not be prosecuted; this was the day before yesterday. I heard Fielder say nothing about the grains.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time in the morning did you cross the heath to go to the brewery? A. A little before four o'clock, I think - there was then some hay for the horses on the waggon. Dory did not say what the 2s. 11/2d. was the share of - the waggon stopped on the heath as we went, for three or four minutes, just opposite Fielder's. I was behind the waggon, and saw a man speak to Dory, but cannot say who it was - he came from Fielder's yard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was dark at four o'clock? A. Yes, rather - it appeared to be a man that I saw.</p>

I said we had lost a pig, and tracked it; he said another man came to his house, and hired him to carry the pig to Brentford for him, but the donkey and cart was his own; that he kept it to do jobs for any body; we asked where he had left the hog; he said the other man sold it at Hounslow; that he drew down the Lion and Lamb public-house yard, and there unloaded it; that he was going home, and the other man had come back with him to Egham; we went on to Hounslow, inquired at two or three public-houses; an ostler went with him, and we found the pig at Shervill's; the prisoner had not mentioned Shervill's name.</p>

I took the pocket out of her hand, and they were all gone - she said in the morning, it was a pity I had been robbed, and she would get up and make me a cup of tea - but she did not she got up and went into the next room to the two men and a woman, who were in bed there.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at the the corner of Whitecross-street - I asked her if she knew any thing about the woman's things - if she did, she had better give them up. The prosecutrix wished for her cloak above all things; she said she had pawned it at Mr. Fothergill's the night before, and that the duplicate was with ten others in the purse, with 1s. 9d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met her much intoxicated; she asked me for a lodging - and as she took out her money to pay for it she dropped this duplicate - I took it up; I went to bed afterwards, and found a gin bottle under the pillow; I told her in the morning I had picked up a ticket of a cloak, and if she would go with me I would give it to her</p>
               <p>E. PIMLEY. I was quiet sober.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then you cannot swear that this prisoner took your watch? A. No; the other prisoner pawned it, but I know nothing against him.</p>

            . I am a silver-smith, and live in Pump-row. On the evening of the 27th of February, about seven o'clock, I heard a rumbling in Mr. Pearce's house, which is next to mine, and had been left closed at 5 o'clock that afternoon; my wife had been out on an errand, and when she came home Henry Pearce was at the door; we inquired of him if he had been into the house, he said No- I then came out and looked through the key-hole, and saw four lads in the shop, scooping up pearl-ashes into bags - I knocked at the door, and then the light disappeared; I went to my own back yard, but there was no one there - they then went to the front of the house, and went back again and got into another house - I sent round to North-street, to tell the persons there, if they got into their back yards to stop them - I went into the house, and found a hole in the roof - we found they had got up there from the garret cieling to another house, and from thence into the street.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Waring in Milk-alley, and the prisoner drawing his handkerchief out of his coat pocket - he rolled it up, put it under his coat, and ran down the alley; I pursued; he dropped it - Brown picked it up; I only lost sight of him in turning the corner - I secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he dressed? A. In a long blue coat and top boots; he struck me when I took him; another man, who was a head, got away. I am certain the prisoner took the handkerchief; the other got out of the court before the prisoner dropped it - there was no crowd till after he was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of March, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning, I stood at Tyburn-gate, and a cart drawn by two horses came up the Uxbridge-road - the prisoners were with it, and another person was about twenty yards behind. Hewett led the first horse, which was blind; Higgins drove the other; Hewett stopped to pay the toll, and went on - the third person came up and objected to the toll; the load appeared heavy, and was covered with straw and hay very closely - I suspected something, and followed the cart a quarter of a mile down Oxford-street, opposite to Mary-le-bone watch-house - I then went up, and said to Higgins,"If it is a fair question, what have you in that cart?" he said, "I don't know how many cwt. I have got;" I said,"I asked what it was;" he said lead. I produced my staff, said I was an officer, and considered myself right in stopping them - the horses were stopped. I pulled up the cover, and saw it was lead; the third man turned down a street, and got away - "Thomas Minter, Hammersmith," was painted on the cart in white paint; there was 18 cwt. of lead - I asked Higgins where he brought it from - he said from Hammersmith, but he had come the Acton road; Hewett was by, and I suppose heard this. I asked who he bought it from; he mentioned a name, which I have forgotten - he said the man bought old iron, rags, and such things - I said, "I suppose he employed you to move it;" he said, "No, we were sent by our master, whose name is on the cart." Minter was taken at Hammersmith, but discharged - he keeps a horse and cart, and carries turf for sale; he was not the man behind the cart - it was a lad, about eighteen years old. Higgins said they set off about a quarter past five o'clock - they were nearly four miles from Acton; he said he was taking it to the bottom of the Haymarket. I said, "You have come two miles out of your way, and have come a very hilly road." I took the prisoners into the office - I went to them again, and told them I had forgotten who they said they had it from. Higgins then said, "I know nothing at all about it." I went to Acton on the Wednesday following, and found this house which had been robbed of a quantity of lead; and appeared to be fresh cut. I have brought some pieces, which corresponds with that in the cart.</p>

I went to ask Minter to lend me his cart to fetch a load of mould - he said he could not till Saturday; I then got it, and met a man, who asked if I could take a load of goods to the Haymarket, and he would give me 20s. I went to Shepherd's-bush for the load, and it was this lead - he gave me money for the toll, and said he would meet me at the bottom of the Haymarket.</p>

On the 6th of March I met the prisoners at Ponder's-end Middlesex - as I passed them Lawrence said, "I think you know me;" I said I did; he said, "Well, we will have a pot of beer;" we went into the Goat public-house, and had a pot of beer - I drank once, but told them I had no money; I saw a piece of print in Lawrence's pocket - he said, "For God's sake, don't you say you saw me; if you should get to Hare-street" - I afterwards heard King had been robbed, and gave information - before we went to the public-house I saw Lawrence shew the print to a woman; I do not know what he said to her, or what she took away, as I was at some distance - Uncle was close by at the time - there appeared about fifteen yards of print.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Enfield. On the 6th of March I went into the Nag's Head public-house - Lawrence was there - he asked me to drink, and then asked if I would walk with him across Edmonton fields; we went near Edmonton church, and met Uncle with a bundle - they had some conversation, which I did not hear. We had some more beer, and crossed the fields towards Enfield - Uncle opened his bundle in the field, and took out a large piece of print, but we saw Camp the constable coming along, and they put it up again and went on. I had a basket on my shoulder - they asked me to put the bundle into it, which I did. When we came near Enfield town they took the bundle out - we went into the Rising Sun public-house, and had some beer. Camp came in and said, "What is in that bundle?" Uncle said"A piece of cloth;" Camp untied it, and said, "This is print;" Uncle said, "I meant print;" we were all taken into custody. I heard Lawrence say at the watch-house, that if he was asked where he got the bundle, he should say an Irishman gave it them to carry; and he said, "If Mr. King comes down I shall be done;" but they should say an Irishman met them at Eofield highway, and said, "How does trade go?" and he would say, "Very badly;" and he said, "If you will carry this I will pay you." I saw Uncle pull his stocking down, and take out two duplicates from there, and put them under a piece of paper at the bottom of his hat.</p>

            . I am a journey man silk-dresser. On Monday, the 2d of April, Samuel Moore called on me; I went with him to the Royal Oak, Pitfield-street, Hoxton,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050082"/>and staid till three o'clock; I first saw him just before two - he called on me at Mr. Stanbridge's. I saw Charles at the Royal Oak; they left at three, leaving me there - I was in their company the whole hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so particular about the hour? A. I afterwards heard this robbery was at half-past two o'clock; I do not know where Castang lives; nobody is here from the Royal Oak - it is two or three hundred yards from the City-road. Sam's wife fetched me to Worship-street, in case I should be wanted; I heard of them being in custody about pigeons; they bore a good character; I never heard of their being in custody before.</p>
               <p>Semuel Moore received a good character.</p>

I then went up on the roof, and took him; Mr. Palmer got a ladder, and we got the prisoner down; there had been three rows of bricks on one side of the lead - they were taken up, and placed on the tiles of a shed; the lead was pulled up, but not cut off - the tiles were pulled up on one side, and the bricks on the other; the lead was not separated, only ripped up; I did not see that any part of it was gone; a little hammering would have put it down as it was before.</p>

On the night of the 6th of March I was on the roof; I had given notice to the patrol to be on the alert - I had lost twenty-three feet of lead from there the night before - I met the prisoner that night about twenty minutes before eight o'clock, going to the work-house - I went on the roof a few minutes afterwards, and found the bricks taken off, and the lead raised up - I think nine or ten of the tiles were taken away - one end of the lead was turned up, and there was a cut in it, as if it was began to be cut - I saw the prisoner there, and heard him say, "I know I shall have seven pennyworth, I ought to have had it last time." There are some sloping sheds, by which he could get on the roof - I saw him ripping the lead.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 10th of March I was with Hackwell in Whitechapel, and saw the prisoners together near Petticoat-lane. I kept them in sight for about twenty minutes, and saw the prosecutrix come out of a cheesemonger's-shop - we had followed the prisoners to that shop. Moses stood in front of the shop, and Jacobs up a little court - they joined, and followed her to the corner of a street - Moses let his apron down; Jacobs struck her on the back; Moses put his hand into the basket, took something out, and ran off. I pursued and took him, but found nothing on him - Hackwell took Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Moses run into the road? A. Between the curb and kennel; he might run about one hundred and fifty yards. I did not lose sight of him.</p>

            . I was with Keys, and saw Moses' hand in the basket; I saw him run away - Jacobs was close to the prosecutrix's back, but did not see the blow - she staggered, and Jacobs run among the crowd, but I took him. I had watched them for twenty minutes - I had not seen the prosecutrix before.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, I was on my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050085"/>beat with Saunders - I stopped the prisoners; I let one of them pass - Joseph had this pick axe; John then passed me - I bid him good morning, but seeing something under his (John's) coat, I said, "What have you in there?" he said a bit of canvas, which he had picked up - I told him to unbutton his coat, and found it was this sack. Joseph went on - I knew them before; I compared the pick-axe with the marks in the door, and they corresponded.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son; he was born on the 7th of May, 1787 - I knew nothing of his being married to Cuttriss till after the marriage - his father was living at the time - they dined at our house the day they were married.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know of it? A. I received a note between ten and eleven o'clock the same day, and provided for them as quick as I could - I knew nothing about it before - my husband is very ill, and unable to travel here - he was not at home when I received the note, but I carried it to him as quick as I could - he dined with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You took the note to him, where was he? A. He worked for 'Squire Deering, and was not at home - I cannot tell at what time they were married - we live at Denvers, sixteen or seventeen miles from Ely - I took no care of the note.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Cuttriss is well aware my father was applied to for his consent previous to the marriage, and would not give it; and he knews that he went and made the affidavit himself to obtain the licence.</p>
               <p>WM. CUTTRISS. I understood the prisoner went to Denvers to communicate with his father - I did not go with him, nor see the father afterwards - I do not know whether his father consented - I went with the prisoner to make the affidavit before the Rev. Mr. Griffiths, at the request of Cuttriss' mother, who was a widow.</p>
               <p>E. MILLS. I know the letter was my son's hand-writing - it was addressed to me, not to my husband.</p>

On the 5th of April the prisoner came to my master's with another person, and dined in the first floor front room - two other persons dined at the same table - they paid for what they had; I left the prisoner and the other person alone for a quarter of an hour, and as I went up again the other man ran by me as fast as he could - the prisoner remained in the room at the same seat as he had dined at; I went into the room, and saw one drawer a little open, and a piece of trimming hanging out of it - I missed these articles from that drawer; I found the gown under the table where the prisoner sat, the rest were quite gone; the drawer could not have been opened without the prisoner seeing it - he sat with his hand down close to where the gown was - I asked what ailed him - he said he had a pain in his side - he had come with the other man, and the prisoner paid for both; I bolted the door, and rang the bell - the prisoner jumped up and opened the door - I went after him, seized him, and held him till master came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did the other two pay for what they had? A. Yes; they had left - I went down for change - I had not noticed the drawer open before they left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The other men did not run away? A. No- the drawers were not above a yard from the table.</p>

On the 10th of March, at eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out in company with Wheeler, at the great gate - the prisoner went towards Charing-cross - he had this handkerchief under his left arm, with something which appeared more weighty than victuals; I followed, passed him, and returned; and by a sudden gust of wind, I saw the top of a leaden weight out of his pocket - he turned up the Haymarket; Wheeler left him at the top of Panton-street - I followed the prisoner to the house of Mrs. Wellington, a dealer in marine-stores, in Crown-street, Soho - I stopped at the door, heard a rattling at the seales, went in, collared him and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "What is that to you;" he took this leaden weight from his pocket, and made a desperate blow at me with it - I caught it, or it must have killed me; he made a desperate struggle, and threw me down against a chair; I got up, and threw him down; he took up an iron sash-weight, and struck me with that; I got the poker, and secured him - I saw him throw some other pieces of lead out of his pocket; I took him to the office - I got Elizabeth Grant to collect the lead; it was brought to the watch-house; I went to Carlton House, and compared the lead with some on the premises - this piece of pipe matches a piece which was fixed to Carlton House; here are several pieces; what he said at the office was written down.</p>

On the 5th of February, in the morning, I examined my premises, and found a hole made through the boards of my warehouse, which was bricked inside - it was on the side next the canal, and about a foot wide - some corn was stacked against where the hole was made; three sacks had been cut, and about three bushels and a half taken out. I did not examine the sacks till about the 14th of March - it was Dantzic wheat, which I had received from Mr. Stevens, to be ground at my mill - it had been there five or six weeks, and was safe before the 5th of February.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find near the hole any marks of wheat on the ground? A. Yes, and I traced it for nearly a quarter of a mile - it appeared as if there had been a hole in the bag; and every time the person carrying it moved, it had fallen; it went along by the side of the canal up to Long-bridge, in the way towards the prisoner's house. It was evident on the 5th of February that grain had been taken from the sacks, but I did not ascertain how much till the 14th of March. I sent a sample of the grain to an adjoining mill - Jennings was aware of my loss; he called on me, and brought a sample of corn, which we compared with that in the sacks. I have no doubt of their corresponding - I produce a sample of each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far from your place does the prisoner live? A. About two miles and a half - Jennings lives about a mile from him, and two miles from me; the prisoner said he received it from one Carter - we got a warrant out, but he has not been taken - he has a son; there is a great deal of Dantzic wheat imported. Carter lives about two hundred yards from my warehouse.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did the tracing extend in a direction to Carter's house? A. Yes; to Carter's house, and past it - he lives nearer to me than the prisoner - he has absconded. I have no doubt but two persons carried the sack - I went to the prisoner's with a search-warrant, but found nothing. I went a second time, but the next morning the prisoner surrendered himself to the constable, and came to my house; he then said Carter was the person who had the corn, and he had it to get ground for him. I said, "Where is it?" he said at Jennings' - I said it was strange he should take it to Jennings' mill, two miles off, when mine was close by; he said he could not tell much about it - we asked the prisoner what corn he had in his house; he said Carter had brought no more than the bushel which had been taken to Jennings'. I asked if he had any more in his house, he said that was the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of further information, did you search the prisoner's house a second time? A. Yes, on Friday, the 16th, and I found buried in his orchard, in a bag, one bushel and one peck of corn - there was a small hole in the bag - he was then in custody - we saw the prisoner at the Magistrates' a few hours after, and he seemed to say that very likely Carter might put that there - I am sure, that when he surrendered, he said Carter only brought a bushel - the orchard is thirty or forty yards from his house.</p>

            . I am a miller. Stacey; (my servant,) showed me a bushel of Dantzic wheat, which came to be ground, and in consequence of information I examined it. I took a sample of it to Mr. Stevens, and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to Mr. Austin's warehouse, and compared this sample with the very sacks which were cut; it corresponded exactly. I sealed up the bushel; it is that now produced - here is a sample from the sacks and the bushel; and here is one of the sacks which is cut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been acquainted with grain all your life, perhaps? A. Yes; I have no doubt whatever they are all the same wheat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is not Dantzic wheat much of the same quality? A. No, there is a great deal of difference in it - it is smaller than English, but there is a difference besides - here is a wild tare in the bulk and in the sample, we call it cockel - it will show exactly the same.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then not only are there the same sort of tares in it, but is it in the same proportion? A. Yes, there is no doubt of their being from one bulk.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live at Hillingdon. I went to the prisoner's house on the 16th of March, and was present at his examination before the Justice; nothing he said was taken down; he was asked if the bushel taken to Jenning's, was all he had - he said that when Carter came to grind some tools in the morning, he(Carter) brought the bushel of wheat. On the 16th I went to the prisoner's premises, found his wife, and said I was come to search; she said I was welcome; when we were in the orchard Mr. Austin said, "Look here, Read"- and we found about five pecks of wheat buried there in a bag, which I produce - he had another examination afterwards; I asked him who brought that wheat; he said Carter, and that he had divided the bushel from the big bag, and put it into the small one - he is a master carpenter, and lives at Iver; I searched for Carter, but cannot find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has that bag been washed since? A. No; I mended this hole; I could not get into Carter's house; it was locked up - I got into the privy, and found some corn; I have not brought it here; it was down on the soil - I do not know Dantzic wheat; there might be half a peck that I saw; there might be more lower down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What will the bag, found in the orchard, contain? A. I should think it would hold three bushels more.</p>
               <p>MR. AUSTIN. I saw the wheat in Carter's privy, and have no doubt but it was Dantzic; I lost about three bushels and a half, as near as can be; Carter's house lays a little out of the road - I traced it perhaps the eighth of a mile beyond his house.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. If a man was carrying it, and threw it up to relieve himself, a little would come out? A. Yes; I think two men must have carried it, unless one man went twice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Philip Carter brought this to me to get ground for him - he worked for me some years, and I allowed my boy to take it.</p>

On the 20th of March, about ten o'clock at night, I went into the yard and heard some tiles rattle, supposing something wrong, I went to Hanbury's and gave information: one of their watchman came with me; I stood on the steps of a public-house nearly opposite, and saw two men on the house; one of whom was on his knees - I went afterwards to the door of the house, and saw two men rush out with speed, I followed, crying Stop thief! Johnson knocked down one, which was Boon, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long was this after you heard the tiles rattle? A. An hour or more, perhaps; I could not identify the men on the tiles - several officers were there when they rushed out; the gates were open when he came out; others had gone in, but they belonged to the brewhouse.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I heard an alarm, and went with Smith to the door; they are folding doors; one seemed open, but was tied with a string; I broke the string, and went in; I then went up a step-ladder, and heard several men escape down through a hole in the partition; I called out "Stop them at the door"(Shakespear afterwards brought Robinson to the watch-house.) I went on the roof, and found two sides of the lead turned up from the gutter, and cut across, in two pieces; some wall-hooks, which fastened it, had been drawn out of the wall. I found no tools there; here is the lead - it was rolled up, and cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search Robinson? A. Yes; I found nothing on him. The lead was quite severed from the roof.</p>

On the 20th of February he called - we afterwards missed some property; he came again on the 24th, and asked me to allow him a piece of cloth to cut a coat; I told him to come to Mr. Clark in the evening, to see if he had heard of a situation for him - before he came again I missed a flannel waistcoat and a jacket; I told Mr. Clark; when he came I and Mr. Clark took him into a private room - Mr. Clark said, "I have reason to suspect you have robbed me;" he at once said, voluntarily, that he had, and was very sorry for it, and said he had eight duplicates at home but had destroyed the others - he appeared to think that we knew more than we did; he sent one of our men to his lodging for the duplicates, and selected what belonged to Mr. Clark's property.

I turned round, collared the prisoner, and said, "You rascal, you have taken my watch;" he made no reply, and I offered him a glass of grog to restore it; he made no reply; I then said, "I will give you a bottle of wine," and then offered a sovereign; three or four persons surrounded me; he then said he had not got it; I endeavoured to persuade him to give it me, as I wanted to get home by the mail to Bromley, in Kent; I am sure nobody else was near me; only a few seconds passed before others came up. Kilby then came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you very much in liquor? A. Not till afterwards; I swear that it happened in Eastcheap, not in Gracechurch-street; I did not accuse two other persons; I did not hear the prisoner send for the watchman - he might be sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this gentleman give you in charge? A. He did, after we had been in the watch-house; Kilby did not advise him to give me in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one Myett come up and say, "It is of no use taking this gentleman; I have seen this man charge two other persons, who shook him off, and said 'Get along, you drunken vagrant?" A. No; I dined at the Belle Savage with some friends, and had some wine, but I was sober at this time - but by the suddenness of this transaction and my treatment at the watch-house, I got tipsy; I took no more liquor. I was taken to the Compter, and kept there all night; I might have said it happened in Cannon-street, as both are in one line; I now say it was in Eastcheap; several persons came round us in Eastcheap. When I was in the watch-house I offered 1l. to have my property back; a person there said it was not enough; I then said I would give 2l.; this person then accused me of collaring two or three other person; I denied it, and then he said to the prisoner, "Give him in charge for disorderly conduct;" I was then given in charge.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of February I locked up the house a little after seven o'clock; I and my fellow servant, John Lees, were the last persons in the house; we left it together when I locked up; I slept in the house that night, and always sleep there; I returned a little after eight o'clock, and found the two prisoners in the counting-house; I found the door on the single lock; I had left it double locked; Plowman had a dark-lantern, and Smith was rummaging my master's desk; I instantly went out of the warehouse, and called out "Thieves!" I locked the street-door, and locked them in; I cannot say whether they had seen me; unfortunately I had taken the key out of the lock, and they came out at the door by means of a skeleton key; the watchmen and patrol were off duty, as they were then just changing, but Charles and Edward Hitchings came up at the time; I had secured Plowman, and they secured Smith; they had a scuffle at the end of the street, Smith turned back; I secured him also, and gave them both in charge of my neighbours and Benison, an officer, who came up; I found the warehouse dog dead a few hours after; he was well when I left the warehouse; we had given him his supper. I observed the prisoners' features distinctly through the window by the light of their dark-lantern, in the counting house, and could swear to them any where; they were taken to the watch-house, and then to the Compter; no property was taken away that I know of; I had left the desk locked; I had seen that it was locked; my master locked it; the papers were a good deal rummaged about - the dog was poisoned, the poison was found in his stomach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Are you speaking of the night or the morning of the 17th? A. The night: it is a large warehouse - there are rooms on the first floor - it is a dwelling-house two stories high - there are five distinct rooms - there is only one room below - the counting-house is parted off; the goods are kept in the warehouse on the ground floor; there are two rooms on the first floor, one is to store goods in, and the other a sleeping room - I sleep there, as Mr. Boyer's servant, and receive wages - he has no partner; I had not been out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050093"/>warehouse before I left it at seven o'clock; the door is left open in the day time; Lees, Mr. Boyer, and the clerk, are there in the day time; Mr. Boyer and the clerk had left about an hour and a half or two hours - Lees remained with me till I fastened the premises - I had been working in the warehouse till then - I was in the counting-house the last thing, when I went to fasten up; I had just got in at the street door when I saw the prisoners in the counting-house - I looked through the counting-house window, which is just on the left hand, and saw them, and undertake to swear to them from the view I then had of them - they rushed out upon me, and I caught Plowman - Smith got by me; I just saw his back, and saw his face afterwards - I never lost sight of him; I gave Plowman to others to hold, and went after Smith - he came back towards me, and I knocked him down into the kennel; I was then ten or twelve yards from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. At what hour did you leave the warehouse? A. A little after seven o'clock - I am certain it was seven - it was as dark as it usually is at that time - I could see a man's face in the street without a lamp: it was quite dark - not twilight; there was no light except what was from the gas-lamps.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was in Old 'Change on the 17th of February, I think it was between eight and nine o'clock, but am not certain - I came down Carter-lane into Old 'Change, and had not passed Mr. Boyer's warehouse many yards, when I heard a cry of Thieves! and Murder! I said to my brother, "Let us go back" - I went back, and saw Tunnicliff, who said, "There are two thieves in the house - I have locked them in;" he had no sooner said so than I heard the noise of a key inside, the door burst open, and out came Plowman - Tunnicliff grasped him on the neck, and with the force he came out with, he reeled round to me: I had a tray in my hand - I struck him, he fell, and Tunnicliff on the top of him - I turned my head and saw Smith rushing forward - I took up my tray and tried to hit him, but he jumped over it, and ran to my left - my brother was then on the opposite side, I called to him, "Ned, here is the other going;" he and I pursued him - my brother overtook him, and got hold of him - I saw them struggling together, and I went to assist him; I am certain he seized the man I had first seen, for I had not lost sight of him; when I came up to them my brother slipped down, I caught hold of Smith and hit him with my tray, he leaned forward and got from me, and ran up the street towards the warehouse again; I got up as soon as I could, and run up the street - Tunnicliff put out his arm and caught hold of him - he resisted very much; my brother and others assisted, and the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did the second man come out of the door at the same time as the other? A. Plowman came first and Smith after, close following each other, perhaps a yard and a half after each other - I just turned my head, and he came out; Plowman and Tunnicliff fell together - I think they falling at the time Smith came out - it was all in a minute; I did not turn so as to have my back to Smith, while I struck at him; I never lost sight of him till my brother got hold of him, which was fifteen or sixteen yards off, I will not swear to the time, it might be about nine o'clock; if I was quite close to him I might see his face, but not by the light of the heavens, without the gas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was it light or dark at seven o'clock? A. I should think it was quite dark; I saw Plowman quite plain; I said at Guildhall that I struck him, and was the means of his falling, I suppose.</p>

            . I was in Old 'Change with my brother, between eight and nine o'clock (I think), on the 17th of February - I heard a cry of Watch! my brother said "We will go back" - I said "You had better not;" but we did go back, and Tunnicliff said, "There are two thieves in the house;" my brother said, "Well, you stand hard, and I will give him a crack with my tray;" he stood behind Tunnicliff, and I stood in front of the door - I saw Plowman rush out - I could see his face distinctly by the gaslight on the opposite side - I do not think the twilight was sufficient to enable me to see his face - he fell at my feet in the kennel, and Tunnicliff upon him - Smith rushed out at the instant, and my brother struck at him - he jumped over the tray, and I ran after him; I caught him about twelve yards off - he ran in a slant direction across the street; when I stopped him, he stood back, and asked what I wanted with him; I said I would let him know - he gave me several blows, and was going to return - we closed, and I caught hold of his collar; we both stumbled, as it was icy, and I lost my hold. I never lost sight of him; he then ran back towards the warehouse, near the place he started from, and just as I got hold of him again, Tunnicliff held out his arm, and stopped him; there was blows between them - another witness and the officer came up, and two or three others were round him - he made great resistance, but was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Can you tell how long it had been dark? A. No, I did not take sufficient notice.</p>

I ran up, and saw Smith and Tunnicliff struggling together - I knew Tunnicliff, and had seen Smith before. Tunnicliff asked me to help; I took hold of Smith, and said to Tunnicliff, "You had better go and see who is at the warehouse door," and he did so. Smith struggled with me, and used had language, threatening me if I did not let him go; I said, "I am as good a man as you, and will not let you go;" we fell together into the kennel, but I kept him, and we went to the watch-house.

            . I am porter to Mr. Boyer, and saw Tunnicliff lock up the warehouse a little after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Will you swear it was latter than six o'clock? A. Yes; I had no watch; I looked at the clock when I got home to Friday-street, it was then ten minutes past seven o'clock. I do not know whether it was twilight or dark: it was dark; there are large piles of cheese and butter in the warehouse; a man could not easily hide himself behind them. Mr. Boyer lives in Nelson-square himself, but his dwelling premises are in Old 'Change. I never knew him sleep there; persons could not slip in and hide themselves in the day-time; there was a large dog chained inside the door, and there are always people in the warehouse; the dog was alive and well when I left - I gave him some meat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you examine the premises before you left? A. Yes; I went all round with a candle; I found nobody there.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to TUNNICLIFF. Q. How long have you slept there? A. About ten months; Mr. Boyer never slept there; I do not cook there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you get your meals there? A. Sometimes; there is convenience for cooking, but I never use it. I was there to protect the property and premises; the bed-room is on the first floor; I sleep there; there is a fire place and stove in the bed-room. I dine on the premises once or twice a week.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was passing along Fish-street, and turning into Old 'Change, I heard a cry of Fire! or Thieves! which induced me to run up to see what was the matter; a man caught me in his arms, and gave me in charge, without saying on what grounds. I was taken to the watch-house, but no property, except my own, was found; nor was any thing suspicious found near me. Do you suppose if I was the man, after making my escape, I should return to the spot? as to the person being positive of my identity, after losing sight of the man, I leave to your judgment; I was frequently passing in Old 'Change on business. I have not the slightest knowledge of Plowman. I solemnly protest my innocence of being the man who escaped.</p>
               <p>PLOWMAN's Defence. What has been sworn against me I positively disavow; I know nothing of the prisoner or witness - I was passing the Old 'Change, and standing against the wall when I heard the cry, and saw three or four men rush by me; one man struck me on the shins, and knocked me down; as to the men who came out of the house, I declare I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Smith a good character.</p>

Saunders is my apprentice; on the 17th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I accused him of having property not his own; he denied it - I said, "Walk up stairs with me, and what you have which is not your own, give me." I went up, and found a book, a shawl, and two silk handkerchiefs - I said, "Give them to me to carry to Mr. Atkinson." I went there, but he was gone to bed - I took them to the night constable, and had Saunders secured: he then said George, who lived at Mr. Atkinson's, had given them to him to dispose of as well as he could. Mr. Atkinson afterwards saw them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you fill it yourself? A. No - the permit stated it to be full, but I did not raise the hung; I went to Anderson's, where it came from - they sent a man to fill it with a gallon measure; I measured what was left in the measure, and there was a quart.</p>

            . I am a broker and appraiser. I have known Prince some years - he was in the employ of Mr. Cole; I have dealt with him for books, and sold books for him for the last eighteen months, Lexicons of this description and Bibles; I used to sell them to the prisoner Bond, but to nobody else. I have sold him books to the amount of 150l. at several different times, sometimes it was very trivial - Prince gave me the price I was to sell them at - I did not always get the price he fixed; I have frequently spoken to Prince about how he got them; he said they were stock that had been reserved at the time of the dissolution of partnership between Mr. Hodson and Mr. Cole - I understood him to mean that he had reserved them for himself - I always paid the money to Prince; he said nothing about any danger in it, that I recollect. I have not seen him and Bond together above twice, once at my house at Walworth, and once we met Prince and went into a public-house in St. Paul's-church-yard - I do not recollect any particular conversation between them; the Lexicons were such as are produced. I never sold any to any one else - Bond never asked me any question before he bought them; the first I sold he gave me 2s. for; the second, 1s. 9d.; and after that, 1s. 6d. - they were bound in the same state as those produced - I sold these prayer books at 1s. 3d. each. I sold several large octavo B bles at 9s. or 10s. each, bound as those produced; Bond keeps a little stationer's shop on Peter's-hill, Doctors' Commons; I think his name is over the door, and the words, "Dealer in marine-stores." I saw some books on his premises, which seemed as if they had been bought for sale; it is a shop, but has a private window - some books were in the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You are a broker, where is your shop? A. I keep no shop; I lived in Walworth-villa for fourteen months before I was taken, and had my name over my door there.</p>
               <p>Q. When this charge was first made, was not Bond a witness against you? A. He brought the officers to my house; there was a contention who should be the witness. I heard him say something to the Magistrate about the price while I was at the bar; I was before Sir Peter Laurie; Bond was in custody, though he was examined; I carried the books in my hand - I might go about a hundred times; I had 25 per cent. for it. I did not have half, on my oath - his brother-in-law has seen me sell him books - he generally paid me at a public-house, at the Blue Last. Peter's-hill, and another house in Thames-street; he often got change there; the best price he ever gave was 2s., and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050099"/>the lowest 1s. 6d. I knew Prince was only Cole's servant - I understood by the word "reserve," that he had stolen them. I did not tell Bond they were stolen, but he must know it by the marks on the papers. I cannot point out which books I sold him - I frequently did not see them till Bond opened the paper parcels - he opened the papers and destroyed them - I never inquired what they sold for.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know any thing about the books but what Prince told you? A. No; I took them in the booksellers' papers, which were taken off and destroyed - they were in parcels marked, and the marks taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you married? A. Yes, and have a family; I was not in an extensive business, but was not particularly pressed for money. I had not left my family; I do not live with my wife now, nor have I for some years. Mr. Cole does not publish any other Lexicons - I never threatened Prince at all in order to get more books.</p>

            . I am managing clerk to Mr. Cole; these Lexicons are his publication; the worst bound ones are sold at 4s. 10d. to the trade, the others are all higher according to the binding; they were not published when Messrs. Hodson and Cole separated. In consequence of information I went with an officer to Bond's house, and found fifty-four Lexicons, three Common Prayer books, and about twelve Ambulators; Bond was not present till just as we were coming out; four or five of the books were exhibited for sale - the others were locked in a writing-desk; the officers asked Bond how he came by them - he said he bought them of Lawrence, a broker, whom he had known, and dealt with, for two years, and gave 2s. 9d. each for them; he was asked if he had sold any to Mr. Mason, and denied it, but named Ratcliffe, a bookseller, who he believed lived in the Borough; he professed himself unable to say to whom else they had been sold, but at last called "Jem," (who was James Bartlett): the officer asked him to whom he had sold them - and Tottenham-court-road being mentioned, he named Tyler, or Taylor, as a person to whom some had been sold; I believe Jem said so; I think Bond said he had sold Ratcliffe half a dozen; I believe the name of Clark. of Paternoster-row, was mentioned as having had some; Boud denied all that we said; I asked him what kind of broker Lawrence was; he said he was a man who did business as he did, by carrying round paper and other goods to customers, of whom he was one; he said he had spent about 50l. with him in the course of two years; the officer asked him if he had not told Mason that he got these books in payment for paper, which the publishers could not always pay for in money; he said he had not said so; Bond was taken into custody; we went over to Walworth to find Lawrence, whose residence he said he could not exactly describe; I staid in a coach, and the officer brought Lawrence out - he was told to say nothing to hurt himself; he named Prince as the person he had the books from, and after some time admitted that he knew Prince was in Mr. Cole's employ, and named his residence; we then went to the counter - he was asked what Bond had paid for the Lexicons, he said 2s. 6d., and Bond said 2s. 9d. - Lawrence said nothing in answer; I asked Bond if he had had a considerable number, and believe I named five hundred - he said somewhere about sixty - Bond did not say a word to that - I believe all Bond said, was, that he only wished other people were as honest as himself - he said that to me in a low whisper; Prince's name was mentioned, and it was said, at one time, that Prince and Bond had met at Lawrence's house once, but he denied any intimacy: some of these books are very well bound; Prince could take books at any time, being the warehouseman, through whose hands all books passed, but nobody else could; when Prince was going to be examined, Mr. Cole and I went into the Justice-room, and I spoke to him before the Magistrate came; he said he was very guilty, he was ashamed to look Mr. Cole in the face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. No particular property had been mentioned to him? A. I had spoken of the Lexicons - nobody could take them without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. This book appears on the title-page to be published by Mr. Cole? A. Yes - it was not printed when Mr. Hodson was in the business; the officer pressed Bond to go to find Lawrence; I saw Jem go to the counter - he came to the Justice-room next morning - Lawrence was then at the bar - I brought the books away - the Ambulators were afterwards brought there; Bond produced them before the Justice, himself, I believe; Lawrence first said he sold some for 2s. 6d., Bond said 2s. 9d.; these books have not been reduced in price - some works published since are reduced; Bond informed where to find Laurence - Prince was then very ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. If a partnership was dissolved, a proprietor would have a fresh title page? A. Yes - Bond was examined before Alderman Crowder, and afterwards before Sir Peter Laurie; Alderman Crowder sent him to obtain bail, but Sir Peter Laurie committed him for felony.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Bond himself give up the Ambulators? A. Yes - I had seen them at his premises, but left them, and could not swear to a book published by two people.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Foster to Bond's house, on Peter's-hill; I looked in at the window; and there saw five Lexicons, nine Ambulators, and three Prayer books; I went in, and asked the price of the Lexicons; they said 3s. 6d. - Bond was not there then; I asked for one better gilt; the person in the shop then opened a desk, which was full; while I was looking at them Mr. Maunder and Foster came in; I then went up-stairs, and staid about ten minutes; when I came down I found Bond had come in, and was talking to Foster; I heard him ask if he had not sold some of them to Mason, and told him he could sell them cheap, having taken them for paper; he said, "No, I never did;" he then said, Jem might have done it; Bartlett was then called, and said he had sold some to a person named Tyler; I asked Bond who he bought them of - he said of Lawrence, a broker - I asked what broker - he said, neither a furniture broker, nor a commission broker, but a general broker; I said it became him to say where he bought them, as they were stolen - he said he did not know where he lived, as he had only been there once; I took a coach, and went there; I sent Bond to the door, supposing he might get admission; he knocked at the door, and asked if Lawrence was at home; they said Yes - we went into the room, where three per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050100"/>sons were, and he pointed out Lawrence; I said some Lexicons had been sold to Bond, and asked if he had sold them - he said he had, and there was one of them on the shelf - that he had them from a person named Prince, who he believed was a binder, who bought them in sheets, and bound them for sale - that he lived in Princes-street, Barbican, on the right-hand side of the way; we then came to town - I rode on the box, there not being room inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did Lawrence's account appear correct? A. Not quite; Prince was not a bookbinder. Jem said he had sold none to Mason, but to Tyler, and that a book, which he had in his hand, would shew what were sold.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live at No. 75, Blackman-street, Borough.

He stated that some bookbinders had got a quantity of the Lexicons in sheets, in consequence of Mr. Cole being unfortunate in trade, and would be glad to sell them for the price of the binding, to get rid of them; he never stated to me that he gave a price, but said he took them in barter.

Prince says Lawrence had half the money for what he had sold; I have got his bills, and he gave me a very good reference; he called on me on the 27th of November, 1825, and said, "You have seen me over the water;" I said Yes - he named one or two persons whom he had sold to; he called again in a few days, and I bought some of him, and have his bill; I bought of him from that time - he said he had a friend in the business, and sold the books for him; I bought forty, which he then had, and said, if they sold well I would take more - I did not know but they were his own. I have dealt with Mr. Alderman Key to a large amout, and with other stationers; I always gave a fair price. I know his prices were as high as other people's; his bills will show what I gave.</p>

            . I am Bond's brother-in-law. I remember Lawrence coming to his house with books - I may have seen him a dozen times - Bond often refused to buy, because he could not sell them; the lowest price I ever knew him give was 2s. 9d. per book - I have bought books of him myself, but not Lexicons - I had known him two years - he represented himself as a broker - I heard him say he was in the habit of going to sales, and got them cheap, and by that means could sell them cheap - I have sold them - the first lot for 3s. 6d., and some at 3s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where these, which were brought away, bought of Lawrence? A. Yes: they have dealt for fifteen months - he has sold Bibles, Prayers, and ambulators - I asked no questions how he got them - I have not sold many in the shop - I sold six to Mr. Mason, in Tottenham-court-road, to the best of my recollection, at different times, at 3s. a book. I sold some books to Tyler, but not Lexicons - I have been at Mason's seven or eight times - he does not live at Tottenham-court-road, but in High-street, Bloomsbury - I do not recollect being asked if I sold him any - I sold some to Mr. Clark, in Paternuster-row, and to Ratcliffe. I do not recollect telling Mason why I sold them so cheap; I never told him Bond took them in exchange for paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you called down when Martin was there? A. Yes; they asked if I had sold any to Mason, of Tottenham-court-road - I did not know Mason, of Tottenham-court-road, and denied selling any to Mason, of Tottenham-court-road, not selling to Mason.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far is Mason's from Tottenham-court-road? A. I suppose fifty yards - I thought they meant Mason's father, as I have seen him there.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was any thing said about an account book? A. No; I do not keep any account.</p>

Bond told me to enter forty books at 2s. 9d., which I did - I have seen him bring in books at different times, he said, "The same as the last;" some were sold at 2s. 6d., being not bound so well - Lawrence said he was a broker, and bought things cheap at sales - I heard nothing about bookbinders.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PREDERGAST. Q. There was no particular time at which he was to have possession? A. No; I believe he said the rent would commence on the Monday after the Thursday that the partition was taken - he did not apply to sleep there before - he was to sleep there on Thursday, the 1st of March - he had taken my bed-room at the same time; he did not say the partition was useless to him - I had no other fixture, except two or three shells - it had been a fishmonger's, but those fixtures were not mine - he did not say I had better take them away - he said the partition must be moved about a yard towards the fire-place - he did not afterwards say that space would not do - he gave me this paper (looking at it) on the morning of the day the partition was taken down - he paid me no money; he left my daughter in care of the place while I was out, and a friend of his proposed to cut out part of the partition: I said if they did, they must make it good - I refused to let him move it without the landlord's leave - it was not to go out of the house - I never said he might do what he pleased with it.</p>
               <p>This paper was here read; it was an agreement from the prisoner to make good any alteration made upon his leaving the premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know you were going out? A. He saw me, and I saw him with the carpenter, and thought he was come to make alterations - I did not know where he lived; he had given a reference to the Surrey-road.</p>

In consequence of information I went afterwards to the house of Richards, in the neighbourhood of the City public-kitchen, about half-past twelve o'clock - Taylor, who had received the potatoes at the kitchen, went with me, I found a basket of potatoes concealed under the front of the shop window, it was covered with one of our sacks, but not one which had been sent that morning to the kitchen - Taylor, who was with me, pointed it out to me - I looked at them, and said they were part of the last lot of potatoes sent to the City public-kitchen - I looked at them very particularly, and there appeared to me to be just 2 cwt. which was one sack - I believe, on my oath, that there were no more of such potatoes that day in London - Richards said they were not mine, for she bought them in Thames-street - I told her there were no such potatoes sold in Thames-street: she said she had them there, and that a man brought them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050103"/>home - I cannot recollect whether she said she bought them that day or not - I think she said she gave 6s. a cwt. for them, the price was 7s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did she say a man brought them from Thames-street? A. She said she purchased them in Thames-street, of a man who brought them there - they were what are called Wellington potatoes - we sell all the potatoes that grow on that farm - there may be other Wellington potatoes in London, but not of that sort and quality - they grew at a place called Mind Island, in the parish of Dagenham - I believe there were no such in London - I had seen them that morning shot out of the sacks they came from the country in; here are some of them. Richards lives at the top of the court, near the City public-kitchen; I do not know the name of it, it is the first turning on the left hand, beyond St. Paul's church-yard, on St. Andrew's-hill; she keeps a green-shop, and sells potatoes and vegetables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you go to Spitalfields-market? A. I live there, but I am not the only potatoe merchant there. Three or four of our men wear red caps, and I dare say others may, but I never noticed any other carters wearing them in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How do you know these potatoes? A. By the particular soil they grew in, and they are a particular sort of Wellington potatoes - it has been a bad season for them, and most potatoes have grown at twice, but these were all of one growth; I said nothing to Crawley about the sacks when he left my premises.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Gregory. On the 28th of March I went out with the prisoner with the waggon; he had a red night-cap on, and a flannel jacket, such as he has on now - there were twenty sacks of potatoes in the waggon - we were to drive them to the City public-kitchen - I do not know the name of the place it is in; the waggon stopped on St. Andrew's-hill; I untied the first sack, and he took it up Ireland-yard; when he returned he took another sack another way; he was gone about two minutes with the first, and when he came back he said there was such a mob the front way, that he would carry the other the back way, and he was gone about five minutes with that; he took all the other sacks throught Ireland-yard; I could not see down the yard as I was in the waggon; I did not hear any noise of a mob; I went to the kitchen before the waggon went away; I went by Ireland-yard to it; the prisoner told me he had pitched twelve sacks there, and shot eight; we went and had some beer, and then went home with the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The first sack you opened yourself? A. Yes; and the second; I do not know that the way he took the second sack was the back way to the kitchen; he said so.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came you to untie the sacks? A. He told me to do so; there were no others untied; I had a fustian jacket, corduroy trousers, and a leather cap on; James Farrel was with us - he had a flannel jacket and a hat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you work in Spitafield-smarket? A. Yes - I see a great many men there in red caps and flannel jackets; the first sack I opened went the straight road to the kitchen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by opening the sacks? A. To make them ready for shooting - but that should not be done before they got to the place - there were eight empty sacks brought back by the prisoner and the other man.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Gregory. On the 28th of March I went with the prisoner to St. Andrew's-hill; the waggon was stopped at the but of the hill; I carried the first sack to the kitchen - the prisoner carried the second; I always met the prisoner the right way, as I was going with the sack or coming back; I had no red cap on; I cannot say whether the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say you carried the first sack? A. Yes - and he the other; I always met him regularly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you meet him at all when he came back from delivering the second sack, as you were coming back from delivering the first? A. I never missed him at all out of the way, but I cannot say I observed one sack more than another: if I had missed him out of the way when I had delivered my first sack, it would have appeared strange - there was no reason why I should not meet him that first time - I always met him - I took the first sack out of the waggon, he took the next, and we went on regularly - there were a number of persons serving out the victuals in the kitchen - I took the third sack, the prisoner the fourth, and I met him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If the prisoner had gone any other than the direct way, should you have met him? A. I do not know, but I met him with the full sack when I was returning with the empty one, when I had shot them; there is only one door to the kitchen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deliver the potatoes in the kitchen? A. Yes; there are two doors to the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a box-maker, and live at No. 11, St. Andrew's-hill - the City public-kitchen is in New-street, Blackfriars - a waggon cannot drive close to it - they generally stop at the corner of Ireland-yard, or in Shoemaker-row - the way to the kitchen is to go up Ireland-yard. but there is another way up Green Dragon-court, up Gloucester-court, and so into Ireland-yard again- the distance up Ireland-yard may he about thirty yards - I should think the other is one hundred. On the morning of the 28th of March I saw the waggon of potatoes at the corner of Ireland-yard, but did not notice whose it was - the horses were down the hill - I met a man in Green Dragon-court with a sack on his back, which was untied at the month - he had a light coloured jacket on, and a red night-cap - he was going up Green Dragon-court, the longest way to the City kitchen - I know the shop of Richards, the prisoner - one door of it comes into Gloucester-court, and the other into Ireland-yard - he had not got to the shop when I saw him - I spoke to a person, and in consequence of what I said, Mary Hart was desired to take notice of the man - this was between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When was it that you saw the waggon? A. A quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes before I left my work in my shop - I did not observe whether it was there when I left the shop, as I had not occasion to pass it - my house is at the corner of Green Dragon-court, and I went up that court.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you going? A.

            . I was in Green Dragon-court on the 28th of March - I saw Weston there. In consequence of what he said, I noticed a man who was passing with a sack of potatoes on his back; he had a jacket on, and a red nightcap - he went into (the new shop) Mrs. Richards' shop - one part of it is in Ireland-yard, and the other in Gloucester-court - it has two doors - I saw him go into that shop with the potatoes, but I did not wait.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You called it the new shop? A. Yes, because it has lately been opened - Mrs. Richards had just gone there - I did not know I was to look after the person for any thing particular - I merely saw him go into the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of March I saw the waggon near the City public-kitchen, between twelve and one o'clock; there were two men carrying out potatoes, and a boy was in the waggon; the prisoner was one of the men - he was dressed as he is now, and had a red cap on. I afterwards heard something, and went to the kitchen; I saw a great quantity of potatoes there; I did not take any of them away; I afterwards went with Taylor to Richards', to see if I could find potatoes there; this was in consequence of what I heard from Hart or Weston; I told Richards that there was an oration round the parish that a sack of potatoes had been taken into her shop; she denied it - we then began to search, and a hamper of potatoes was found under the counter - I told her I had heard that a sack of potatoes had been brought into her shop, by a man in a red cap, instead of being taken to the City public-kitchen - she said there had been no such thing brought there, but I found them covered with a sack in the hamper; they were under the counter and behind it; a person coming into the shop could not see them - the counter was enclosed on one side and open on the other; the potatoes were in the mould, and seemed damp; I could not tell whether they had been there long. Taylor, who was with me, said they were the potatoes that belonged to the City public-kitchen; Richards made no reply to that - I waited till all the potatoes were delivered, and the prisoner Crawley had put on a hat; I took him up to Weston's door, but neither he nor Hart were at home. I let him go, and took the name and number of the waggon - I afterwards saw the prisoners in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You found these potatoes in the shop? A. Yes - Taylor went there with me; that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I had seen the waggon standing - I said, "You have got a sack of potatoes, which ought to have been carried to the City public-kitchen," she said she had not; I do not know whether a red night-cap is worn by persons who carry loads; when I saw the prisoner he had a slouch hat on; I did not see any one who had a red night-cap carrying them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you say any thing about the man who came with the potatoes? A. I said it was a man with a red night-cap; it was after I had been to her shop that I saw the potatoes were not quite delivered; I saw Crawley carry a sack or two of them up to the kitchen - he had his night-cap on then; he afterwards put on his hat, and drove the waggon.</p>

            . I am an assistant at the City public-kitchen - it is a charitable institution for the poor. On the 28th of March I saw some potatoes come there; two tons should have come - I do not know how many did come - I did not count them - it was not my place, but when they brought in some, and shot them down, I said to the prisoner and the other man, "How many have you brought in?" - they said four sacks a piece; I said I thought there were but seven altogether; the rest they pitched in the sacks as they brought them in. I went to Richards' house with Potter - I saw her, and said to her, "I understand you have had some potatoes brought in here;" she said, "No, I have not;" I said, "You certainly have" - she said, "These are all the potatoes I have got;" I said,"These are not the right sort - these are not the kitchen potatoes;" I looked about, and coming away towards the door, I stopped, and under the board I saw some potatoes like those which had been shot out - they were in a large basket, and covered over with a sack, under the showboard; I said to her, "These are the potatoes;" she said,"I bought them at the wharf;" she went into the room, and I went away; I was present in the kitchen; there was not such a crowd as to prevent any person getting to the kitchen conveniently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go with the constable? A. Yes; I went in first - he came in immediately after me; I do not know whether he heard what I said - it is a large room; it is parted off from the shop, as a kind of sitting-room; I said, "These are the same sort of potatoes that went to the kitchen;" I did not say, "You have got some of the potatoes that came from the kitchen; or ought to have gone to the kitchen."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say at first, "It is reported that you have got some of the potatoes that ought to have come to the kitchen?" A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not your business to attend to the quantity of potatoes? A. No, I said I thought they had only brought in seven sacks, and they said eight.</p>

               <p>RICHARD GREGORY re-examined. Q. Was that one of your sacks? A. Yes - it was one of a larger size, which had gone out with some washed potatoes some time before; these potatoes are the same sort as those sent to the kitchen that day; I saw these potatoes in the basket, and I desired the man at the kitchen to bring Richards to Guildhall, and I would go and fetch a man from Spitalfields - I took him to Guildhall, and it was too late - the Alderman was gone - I took him the next day, but Richards did not attend till the day after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Then it was on the 30th that the potatoes were taken out of her basket? A. Yes.</p>

            . I was porter to the late Mr. Jackson, who lived at No. 94, Watling-street - Mr. Thompson has the care of his property since his death. On the morning in question I gave the prisoner a lighted candle to go into the cellar to take the dust - I went into a back cellar to clean boots - the books laid in the corner near where the dust was - I missed them afterwards; I am sure I did not tell him to take them; I did not see him take them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you not say any thing to him about the books? A. No; the cellar is a dark place; there were boxes and other things there - I cannot say how many books there were; he is the regular dustman, I suppose; I did not watch him, because I had no idea he would take the books; I did not miss the books for an hour.</p>

"Yes (said one of the men), and I have got your handkerchief;" I came down with them to the watch-house, but it was not open - I gave my address and left them, as I was on business - this is my handkerchief.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of February, I sent him with four 5l. Huntingdon notes, to go to Esdaile's to change them, and go to the Bank and get silver for them - he went about ten o'clock, and I directed him to be back by twelve o'clock - he said he should have plenty of time to return, but he never did return. My husband brought him back on the Saturday fortnight, and he was taken to the Compter - he never returned any thing that he got for these four notes.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of February I saw the prisoner, and another young man, with him, near Red Lion-street, Holborn, about seven o'clock in the evening; it was quite dark; I followed him nearly a mile to Mr. Turner's factory, near the Temple, in Whitefriars; I saw the prisoner get over a high iron railing, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050107"/>hand something over, but I could not see what it was, as it was dark; I know there was a great quantity of iron pipes for pumps, deposited there; they then went up a court by the side of the glass-house, which led them round to Water-lane. I followed them, but lost sight of them in a court; I then met them again in Shoe-lane (I had taken sufficient notice of them to know they were the same persons); when they got to the end of Shoe-lane the other one gave it again to the prisoner; I then took the prisoner, and asked him where he got it; he said a man gave it him to carry; his companion got away; I could not hold them both; I found it was this piece of iron-pipe - I took it down to Messrs. Turner's, and there we found a broken pipe - this piece exactly matched it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not possible that when I got over the rails you could take me? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. TURNER. I saw this pipe brought back, and have no doubt whatever that it was a part of the stock there - it is worth about 1s. 6d.; the yard is surrounded by a high wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time he took it from under my arm, I looked round and told him that was the man who gave it me; he would not take him, but took me, and said, "Why did not you tell me what you had got, and I would have let you go?" he asked the night-constable if he was willing to let me go; he said "No," as the charge was given.</p>

The prisoner took a lodging of me on the Tuesday before the 28th of November - he took my kitchen, and I provided every thing for him, for 3s. a-week; he went away on the Tuesday following, at six o'clock in the morning, without paying his rent for the last week; I had my suspicions, and two minutes after he shut my street-door I went to his room, found the door wide open, and missed these articles. I have never seen them since - I met him in about three months, at the Ship public-house, in Tower-street, and secured him; I had one more lodger; he continued with me - he usually went out at eight o'clock, after breakfast; he never went out till eight before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Other people lodge there; I left to go into the country for work; I afterwards met the prosecutor at a public-house, and went up and spoke to him myself; he offered at the watch-house to take 10s. or 12s. as a compromise, but, being conscious of my innocence, I refused.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WARNER re-examined. He did not speak to me first; I seized him the moment he came in; I am certain he did not speak to me; he did not attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>- FULLERGRATH. The prisoner was in my employ, and usually came to work at six o'clock in the morning; I think he was never later than a quarter past six; he worked for me the latter end of November, but whether he was with me on the 28th I cannot say.</p>
