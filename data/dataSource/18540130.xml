I am a boot and shoe maker; I have been in England about eight weeks; I have been lodging at Mr. Rose's, No. 1, Shorter-street, Wellclose-square. On Monday night, Dec. 19th, I left home about 5 o'clock, leaving sixty-three pairs of boots and shoes in my room—I locked the door of my room, and the door of the house when I left—I returned at half-past 10—I found the street door to, and my bed-room door open; the street door was locked, the key was turned—I went into my room and missed all my boots and shoes—these produced are mine—the bag in which they are is not mine—I had left some of the boots on the table—I had left no one in the room, my wife was not in England—these boots (<hi rend="italic">looking at a pair</hi>) are my property—they have my mark—some of the boots are marked with the letter K.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 129). From information which I received touching this robbery, I went on Wednesday afternoon, 21st Dec, at 5 o'clock, to a marine store-dealer's, at 4, Queen-street, Tower-hill; it was kept by the Chapmans—I saw Mercy Chapman in the shop at the time I went in—I have known the marine store shop for some time—Mercy Chapman's name is over the door—I have had occasion to go to the shop several times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">M. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On those occasions have you seen them both in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have on some occasions—I have seen each of them taking a part in the management of the shop—on this occasion, when I went into the shop, I saw Mercy Chapman—I asked her if she had bought any boots that day or yesterday, or if she had had any left there within a few days—she said no, she had not bought any boots; she did not lay out a shilling a day in the shop—I then said, "I shall search your house"—on my saying that she turned round and walked into the back parlour—any<lb/>thing that was said in the shop could be heard in the parlour, if spoken in the tone in which I spoke—I followed her into the parlour; I there found John Chapman and the prisoner Smith—I saw Smith having hold of a bag, trying to push it out into the passage—it was a heavy bag—this produced is it—John Chapman was sitting in the room—I said, "Halloo, what is this?"—I took hold of the bag and took out some boots-—Mercy Chapman said, "They were left when me and my brother were out for a loan"—she afterwards stated that they had been to Old-street Road for a loan—Smith said, "Mrs. Chapman and John had nothing to do with it; if there is any<lb/>body to blame, take me"—Mercy Chapman said she was out at the time—I cannot remember her saying anything else—I then took the prisoners into custody with the assistance of the other constables—at that time Vanden<lb/>berg was in the house—he was not taken into custody till late that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Vandenberg at the marine store shop at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not go there with me—I ran round there first, and he came after me—I had not had any communication with him, two other constables had.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you know how long Mercy Chapman has carried on this shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known it about four or five years—Mercy Chap<lb/>man and her brother have carried it on during that time—I never noticed the name over the door till this transaction—I never searched the house before—I went there once to inquire about a box which had been stolen from off a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I have several times popped into the passage adjoining the shop, being a dark one, when I have been looking after other things—I went in plain clothes—when I made this inquiry of Mercy Chapman, she walked into the parlour; she turned round very quickly, she did not run, there was not room enough, but she went as quickly as she could very well walk—the first question I asked her was, "Have you bought any boots, or had any left here yesterday, or within a few days?"—I asked her that all at once; it was not merely, "Have you bought any boots?"—her answer was,</p>

               <p>"No; I don't lay out more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day"—Smith was trying to push the boots towards the passage; it is a passage that separates the shop and back parlour from the backyard—there is a partition between the shop and parlour, and the passage runs along by the side of them into the back yard, there is a door leading from the passage into the back parlour; the passage is an ordinary side entrance—Smith said, "If anybody is to blame it is me; take me, Mercy and John had nothing to do with it"—she said, "I took the boots in, a man brought them, and said he would call again at 9 o'clock to-morrow night;" both the Chapmans said, if I went to John-street to inquire, I should find they had been making inquiries about a loan when the boots were brought—Mercy Chapman said so—I do not know whether John Chapman said so; he might, but I very well recollect that it was said—another constable, named Payne, came in shortly afterwards; he came in about a minute after me—Vandenberg came in about five or six minutes after me, it might have been ten minutes—some time after I had been there, John Chapman went out; I went away to the station house to fetch some one else down to help search the house, and he went out in the mean time—he came back again—I do not know how long he was away, it might have been three quarters of an hour; when I went away at night, after searching the house through, I left Vandenberg in the house; that was at Mercy Chapman's request—I heard her ask him to stay—he said, "Well, I shall go home," and she said, "Pray don't go, don't go away and leave me; stop here"—I left him in the house with two others, a man named Matthews and his son—Smith told me that she was a servant out of place, and that she had been lodging with Mercy Chapman—I do not recollect that she told me how long she had been lodging there.</p>

                  </hi> I have been working for Mr. Tatum, on and off, for some time. On Monday, 2nd Jan., about half past 12 o'clock, I went with him to Meeting-house Yard—we did not go inside the houses—there were a goodish many people there, outside—I was inside the hoard when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> began—there was a hoard round the buildings that had been pulled down—when I came outside the hoard, I saw the people all quarrelling and fighting with me and my mates—I did not see the prisoner there at the first begin<lb/>ning—I saw him afterwards at the corner of the street, when they were all fighting; I saw him hit Thomas Sullivan on the head, and then he hit John Sullivan on the head with a poker, and he said, "There is one for you, you b——;" it was a very heavy blow that he gave John, and it knocked him senseless—he went to the hospital with another young man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Tatum. I went with him to the premises in Meeting-house Yard, about 12 o'clock on this Monday—there was a piece of work there—I saw the prisoner there, and saw him inflict several blows with a poker, but in the mob I could not see who he hit, except Thomas Sullivan—I did not see him strike John Sullivan—I had no weapon with me.</p>

On 2nd Jan., I went to the houses in Meeting-house Yard with Mr. Tatum and three or four more, about 12 o'clock—we stood in front of the houses looking at them, to see what the job was worth; while We were there, a noise came to the door, what it was I could not say, and some bricks came towards my legs; a woman came out with a broom</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know that he did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never saw him there—I went there with Mr. Tatum, as we were going to be employed to pull the houses down, providing we came to terms to take them of Mr. Tatum; we thought what they were worth, and we knew we were right, but we would not begin any houses before we saw the police<lb/>man, and saw the paper that Mr. Tatum had in his pocket—we did not go inside the houses, the tenants did not seem to wish us to do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in addressing the Jury for the prisoner, contended that as the persons engaged by Tatum had proved no legal authority to enter the houses in question, they had committed a trespass in making the attempt, which the occupiers were justified in resisting; and that the act done by the prisoner was, under the circumstances, not an unlawful one. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in summing up, said that the law allowed every latitude to persons in defending their persons or property, and they might use all necessary violence to eject those who, without right, invaded their houses; still it must be only such violence as should be necessary for that purpose; the question was, whether there was anything in the present case which justified the act imputed to the prisoner.</hi>

On the afternoon of 13th Jan. the prisoner came for half a quartern of gin in a bottle, which he brought with him—he paid me with a counterfeit shilling—as soon as he put it down I said, "This is a bad one"—he said a woman gave it him in Seymour-street, and he was to have a penny for fetching the article—he went out, and I sent my lad after him—after they had been out some time they returned, and my lad said they could not find any woman—I sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—this is the shilling—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house as the prisoner and his wife. On Christmas morning last, I was awoke between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, by hearing some person cry out; it was Mrs. Willis's voice—my name was called out loudly—I put on my small clothes, and went directly to her room; I found her in bed, leaning over the bed, and bleeding very much from a wound in the ear and neck, and likewise a cut on the hand; there was a great deal of blood about—there was no one else in the room—from something Mrs. Willis told me, I afterwards went into the other room, where I found the prisoner on the bed, wrapped up in the clothes—I asked him what he had been doing, and why he did it—he said, if she was not dead, his hand must have been nervous—on looking more closely at him, I found that he had cut his own throat, or partly so; there was a great deal of blood all down his dress, and on his shirt—my son went into the room with me, and when I found the state they were in I sent him for a police officer, and likewise for a medical man; he very soon came back with both—I stopped in the room where the prisoner was, till he returned—I did not say anything further to him, nor did he to me—these parties have lived in this house about five years; they have quarrelled a great deal at times, and very frequently—it appears that the prisoner had been drink<lb/>ing in the afternoon part of this day, but I did not see him—I believe him to have been in a sober state.</p>

On the morning of Christmas day, a little before 2 o'clock, I was called by a son of last witness, to go to the back room second floor of this house—I there found Mrs. Willis in bed; she was undressed—I saw a great deal of blood about the floor, and found her wounded—I then went into the front room, where I found the prisoner sitting up in the bed, and the front of his shirt all saturated with blood—his throat was cut two ways—I got him out of bed, and found this razor (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) in the bed, just under where he was lying—it was lying open,</p>

               <p>and there were marks of blood on it which are on it now—I asked him what he had been doing; he said he was sorry that he had not done it effectually—Mr. Jones dressed his wounds, and he was taken to the hospital—I had seen the prisoner about an hour and a half before this happened, going towards his house—I considered him drunk at that time.</p>

I was called to see Mrs. Willis, about 2 o'clock, on the morning of 25th Dec.—I found her lying in bed, her dress covered with blood—I found a wound in the lobe of the left ear—it was a punctured wound; it had passed right through the ear, and wounded the side of the neck just at the angle of the jaw—there was a cut on one of the fingers; it was not a very bad out; it seemed as if a portion of the skin had been sliced off, as it were, but it was not very deep—this knife would be a likely instrument to do it—it was not found that night—I was shown ft razor that was found in the next room, and I did not think that could have done it—I went into the front room, where the prisoner was; he wag sitting on the side of the bed, bleeding very much from a wound in the neck—it was a jagged wound, and appeared as if it had been cut from right to left, and from left to right, both ways—he had lost a great deal of blood—the wounds were superficial, not very deep—the wound upon the prosecutrix was not a dangerous one as it was—it was in the neighbourhood of the carotid artery, about a quarter of an inch, or so, but it might be influenced by the position of the neck—that is a very dangerous position for a wound.</p>

About a quarter past 4 o'clock that afternoon I was coming up Seething-lane, and saw the prisoner and two men standing just at the top of Seething-lane—there was a wagon standing at Mr. Cross's warehouse, which had chests of tea in it—I watched those persons for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I moved round the corner in such a position that they could not see me, but I could see them—I saw one man get in the wagon, lift a chest of tea out, and put it on the prisoner's back—the prisoner came down Seething-lane to Mark-lane—I gave information to the officer, who took him—I never lost sight of him all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, at Birmingham. On the evening of 3rd Jan., I was walking in Holborn, towards Oxford-street; I felt a jerk at my pocket, I turned round and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—directly he saw me he dropped the handkerchief, and I took it—I do not know whether it was out of his hand or not, but he let go of it—he then appeared staggering like a drunken man—I followed him—he did not say anything for some time; he then turned and asked what I wanted with him; I said for taking my handkerchief—he denied it at first—he then said he did it for want, and begged my pardon—he said he did it to get a breakfast, and that he was a tailor, which I might see by his finger—he then said he did it for the sake of his mother—I said I would not forgive him—he was then very abusive, and he said would I go back with him to his father in Holborn, who was a respectable tailor; I went back with him, and some persons came round—a policeman came up and took him; had he not come up, most likely the prisoner would have got away.</p>

About half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, on 4th Jan., two foreigners came in my shop—the prisoner was one of them—the other man bought a hat—I served him, and he paid for it—the prisoner was behind him, trying on hats, and while I was serving him, the prisoner went out of the shop—when I had served the other man I missed a hat from the counter—it was a second-hand black hat—I went after the prisoner the moment I missed it—I overtook him, and found him with my hat on his head, and his own <hi rend="italic">wide-awake</hi> hat under his arm—I charged him with taking my hat, and he knocked me down, and ran away—in running he threw my hat away, and put his own on again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My countryman bought two hats; I was coining back to your shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, he was not, he was on the other side, going the con<lb/>trary way—he did not run before I came up to him, but after I charged him with the robbery, he knocked me down, and ran away.</p>

On 16th Jan., about a quarter to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb/>soner came for a pint of porter; it came to two pence, and he gave me a six-pence—I gave him change, and put it into the till; there was no other six-pence there—I went to the till about five minutes afterwards, nobody had been to it in the meantime, and there was no other sixpence there; I found that it was bad, put it on the hob by the fire, and watched till it melted—he came again, about a quarter to 6 o'clock in the evening, asked for three-halfpennyworth of gin, and gave me a shilling; it was bad—I went round the counter, shut the door, and sent for a policeman—I asked the prisoner if he was not ashamed of himself to come twice in one day—he said he had not been near the house before—I am certain he is the man who had come in the morning—I gave him in charge with the shilling.</p>

On Saturday evening, 7th Jan., at 20 minutes to 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing by the pitching block, at the corner of the Old Bailey—I saw them come from Newgate-street, and followed them into Skinner-street—Moss had something done up in this wrapper (99<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his back, and his left hand was on Burn's right shoulder—I asked them what they had there; Burn said it was meat—I asked him where he was going to take it; they both replied, "We are going to take it to the bottom of Holborn-hill," and that a man had engaged them to carry it close by the pitching block, and was going to give them 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told them they had better stop and let me see who the man was who had engaged them—Moss said "Take it off my shoulder; I cannot keep it on my shoulder if I am to wait"—I took it off his shoulder, and placed it under the wall—he said, "I will go and get the man, and bring him for you;" he went away, and I kept Burn and the beef—I waited twenty minutes; and finding he did not return, I took Burn and the beef to the station house—this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was skewered to the meat, which led to its being identified—Moss was apprehended by my description of him, and was brought to the station on the following Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 366 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On the morning of 24th Jan., I had information of a robbery at Mr. De Berranger's, Old Park-farm, Enfield; in consequence of which I went on the road between Tottenham and Kingsland, the main road, not the Green-lanes—about 8 1/2 o'clock in the morning, I saw a pony and cart in the Kingsland-road, near the Alms-houses; "George Hart, dealer, Edmonton," was on the cart—a man named Joshua Staker was with it—it was going in the direction of London—Miles, another constable, was with me—we followed it down to Mr. Campbell's 200 or 300 yards; he is a marine store dealer—I know the Queen's-head, in the Green-lanes; it is in Tottenham parish, about five miles from where I first saw the cart—that would not be an unusual place for the cart to be in, going from Enfield to London; if you go by the Green-lanes you would pass it—there are two ways—the driver got out at the marine store shop, and stood on the pavement some few minutes—the two prisoners came out of Campbell's shop, and entered into conver<lb/>sation with the driver for some few minutes—I then lost sight of the driver, and did not see which way he went, but Clinker took hold of the pony by the head, and moved him from the gutter, where he was drawn up, into the middle of the road—we stopped at Mr. Campbell's, and Miles spoke to him—the prisoners were not there—we followed the cart, and saw it stop at the White Hart; they both went into the house, and before we got to the door Clinker came out, and Miles took him into custody—I went into the house, and apprehended Pinnuck—we searched the cart, and found these two coppers and this lead, with some sacks covered over them, and a quantity of hay sprinkled over—I know the lead by this mark, something like an arrow, which I put on it twelve months ago, when there were a great many robberies—the coppers were fixed to the building, and the lead was placed round them—there is about 170 pounds of lead—I took the coppers back, and they both fitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Walker, a corrugated iron merchant and contractor of works in different parts of the country. He bad servants engaged on the execution of works at Gravesend, for which he had contracted at Christmas—the prisoner was in his employ at Gravesend, as superintendent of the works—his duty was to pay the men wages—he had to send a statement of the money he should require for wages, every Friday—on Friday, 6th Jan., I received from him, in the ordinary course, a statement of the money he should require—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in his writing—on the following day I gave a clerk of ours, William Neary, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take to the prisoner, and it was the prisoner's duty to send up as</p>

The prisoner had the superintendence of the workmen at Gravesend, and had liberty to hire a portion of them himself—Mr. Walker allowed him to have whatever number he thought necessary, and to arrange their wages with them; but he had to leave it for Mr. Walker's approval—the accounts are sometimes sent to Mr. Walker, and sometimes to me—it is very probable that this paper was posted on Friday afternoon—it is not directed to me—he may have had some private communication to make to Mr. Walker with respect to the works—to the best of my recollection, one of them was addressed to me—this endorsement is mine; I made it some little time after I had the paper—the amount here is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that would be the amount to pay the men for a week's wages, but I do not know whether it was up to Thursday night or Saturday night—it is usual for us to pay them up to Friday night—we sometimes send by crossed check, but on Friday night the amount was sent down by a clerk in money—he changed the check—the prisoner ought to send us on the following Monday an account of how he had expended the money, but sometimes it came on Tuesday—the second appears to be a mere copy of the first—they some<lb/>times differed—he puts down at a rough calculation the amount he thinks he shall require for expenses, and we send him the sum he requires by the paper—if the expenses are more, he would pay it out of his own pocket, but that has never happened, according to our books—I know he has always had a balance in hand belonging to Mr. Walker—he has never overpaid—I am certain of that—we should know the exact amount on Monday or Tuesday, when he sends to us—if there was a balance in his hands, I should give him credit for it in the next account—the first paper means, "I want so much money;" and the second, "I have paid so much money"—in the corner of the paper you will see that the prisoner was allowed three guineas salary besides other expenses—(<hi rend="italic">the papers being read, were both alike; they were headed</hi>, "Week ending Jan. 7th," <hi rend="italic">and contained the following entries</hi>—"Hotchkiss, 5 days and 7 hours, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Mullander, 7 days at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" "Wren, 7 days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" "Blackman, 7 days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Wheeler, 5 days at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" <hi rend="italic">then followed the names of other workmen</hi>—"Bagshaw,"" Rhodes," <hi rend="italic">&amp;c., amounting to</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to which was appended a paper containing charges for "hire of boat</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; loan of ladder, 8 days, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; lodgings, travelling expenses, stamps, paper, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">making a total of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")</p>

Williams and Clapham's, and when he came back to the brougham he missed the parcel—I did not see anything more of Floyd or Symes that day—I saw Symes the next morning, about 10 o'clock, at the Yorkshire Grey—he gave we half a crown, and said he was going away for a day or two—nothing more passed at that time—I saw him again about the Wednesday week afterwards—he was away four or five days—I saw him again at the Yorkshire Grey—during his absence I saw his wife; she came to me at the Yorkshire Grey—I received money from her while he was away; I cannot say how much; I suppose I received 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at different times—she used to come there every evening—when Symes returned, on the following week, I saw him at the Yorkshire Grey—he did not say anything to me or I to him about what had happened between me and his wife during his absence—he did not say much to me in the evening, but he said in the morning he had sold the property for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave the man for selling it, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for melting it down, and he said he had got my share of the money, and he would take care of it, and he would buy me a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and two horses if I would say nothing about it—I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him in money alto<lb/>gether, in a pound or a couple of pounds at a time, at his house—that included the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to his house; he lives at No. 35, Liquorpond-street, Gray's Inn-lane, in a room up stairs—I went there one evening after I came home from driving my master, and I found the things all scattered about in the room—the lock was turned; the bolt of the lock was shot, but the door was open—there was no one at home—I did not see him or his wife that day—I went up to his place the next morning, and his wife was at home—she said something to me about the room—I went again in the evening, and found Symes there—he directly turned round and abused me, and accused me of breaking his place open, and taking what money there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go anywhere else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes: I went with Elizabeth Pullen to Floyd's place, No. 43, Woburn-mews, Woburn-place—I saw a boy there—Floyd was not at home—I saw him walking in Woburn-place—I told him that Symes had accused me of taking the money, and breaking his place open—Floyd said, "If you don't say anything about the robbery, I have got two horses, and I will give you one, and you shall work half my number"—that I should work half the day—Floyd then told me that the pro<lb/>perty sold for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for selling it, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for melting it—he said Symes was a scoundrel, and he thought he would <hi rend="italic">do it</hi> for us—I thought he meant that he would give information—Floyd then came with me to Symes's place—we saw his wife at the door; the said Symes was ill, and in bed—we did not see him: we made an appointment to go the next morning—I did not go—when Floyd told me what the property was sold for, he said he filled the bag with stones, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it over Southwark Bridge—I did not see Floyd after that till he was in custody—I saw Symes a day or so afterwards, at the Yorkshire Grey, and he said he would pay me an equal share of the money after he got to work, if I would say nothing about it—after that Symes and I were in the Strand; we met Elizabeth Pullen and Susan Kelly—we went with those two women to the George public house, in the Strand; we had a half pint of gin—we then all four came out; Kelly, I believe, stopped in the Strand, and Symes, and I, and Pullen went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Gray's-lane—Symes spoke to Pullen about showing his two rings—he said she had been showing his two rings to a parcel of people—she said she had not shown them to anybody—he then asked her for the duplicate of a pin—she said she had not got it with her, she had left it at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Pullen at any time say anything to you about seeing a lot of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I said to Symes, "Pullen says that you showed her a lot of money in a bag"—he said he had not—I said Pullen had told me that he had—he still said he had not—I saw Symes afterwards, up to the time when I was taken in custody, which was this day four weeks; the 6th Jan.—I was remanded to the House of Detention at Clerkenwell—my brother came to see me there, and Mrs. Symes came twice—my brother's name is Charles Boyd; he has been a seaman—I went to the House of Detention on a Saturday, and I saw my brother on the Monday—I made a statement to him about this transaction—when I saw Floyd he told me the property had fetched 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said they had taken it to <hi rend="italic">Jog</hi> Wood, who had offered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. t and they would not take it, and they took it to a place called the <hi rend="italic">Stew</hi>, in Petticoat-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman and shipwright, of Sunderland. When I am in London, I live at Poplar—on 6th Jan. I was discharged at Lime-house from my ship—I left there about half-past 1 o'clock, with a young man named Thomas Lamming—I had with me 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was seven months' pay which I had received, and also some money I had received in the West Indies—there was upwards of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and gold—I was inquiring the way to a tailor's shop, to buy some clothes, as I wanted to change my sailor's dress; and between the Highway and the Commercial-road we met a man, who took us to two or three tailors' shops, and I bought a jacket and a pair of trowsers—I wanted to put on the clothes, and he took us to a public house, which I have been told is in Skinner-street, the Weavers' Arms—I changed my clothes—there is a room up stairs—I was standing in my drawers, with my trowsers off, in the room, when three gentlemen came into the room where I was, and in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came in—the man who took me there was a stranger to me, but I should know him again if I were to see him—he was there when the three gentlemen came in—the prisoner wanted to sell a muffler or handkerchief—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but he would not take it—at last he said, "I will do it this way;" he pulled out some cards from his pocket, took three cards from the pack, and I put them on the table; he turned one of them, and said, "If you will lay the money opposite this card, and lift it up, you can have the handkerchief; but if you do not, you will lose if—it was the queen of spades or clubs; the colour was black—he then changed the cards, and put them all three down on the table, with their backs up—one of the others laid three or four shillings down on the table, and lifted the right card, and won the handker<lb/>chief—the one who took me there then bet a sovereign or a half sovereign, and lost—I was the next; I put down a half crown or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first; I do not know which; I then selected a card, and lost—he had changed the card before that, from the queen of spades to the ten of spades, saying,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300065"/>
               <p>"I will change them"—I betted a second time—I put down half a sovereign or a sovereign, and lost—(I had drunk a glass of rum with the gentleman who took me into the room, in a public house on the road which I was not acquainted with, but I did not feel any particular effects from it—I went into a coffee shop after buying the clothes, and had two cups of coffee)—I put down a sovereign a second time, and lost that; I then put down a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and lost that; then I put down two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and lost them—I laid the money down on the table, and the prisoner took it up—I did not take notice of what happened next—I knew I had ruined my wife and family through my foolishness—I next saw him take the notes and money out of his pocket, and give them into the right hand of another man—I knew them to be mine by their being crushed—it was one of the three who had come into the room, and who had betted—when the money was handed to the man, he went away, but not immediately; he left about half a minute after he got the money—I asked the prisoner not to go, as I wished to speak to him—he said what did I want with him—I followed him down stairs, got him into a corner, and told him I had been wrongly swindled out of my money; he said I had not—I then went to the door, and asked Thomas Lamming, my Mend, to come in, as I wanted to speak to him—he did not come in—the man who had the money then went out of the room—the prisoner then made the attempt to go out, and succeeded—I followed him down stairs, and shouted, "Stop thief!"—he ran, and was turned by three or four men—he attempted to run past me, and I caught him, and told him he had robbed me—he said, "Don't give me in charge, and you shall have your own notes back again"—I kept hold of him till a policeman came—he told the policeman that if I would wait a quarter of an hour, I should have the money—I waited between the street and the public house—he took us to a public house, which I think they call the Pheenix—we waited there about a quarter of an hour, and then went to the police station, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at Prince's-square, St. George's in the East. I am a shipmate of the last witness—I was paid off early in Jan.—I recollect being in Forson's company somewhere in Whitechapel—we met a man, who took us to a public house, which I do not know the name of, where Forson changed his clothes—while he was doing so, three persons came in, and about five minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and pulled out a handkerchief to sell—I think he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; Forson offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he would not take it, but said, "I will do it this way," taking out a pack of cards, and shuffling three of them—I do not understand cards—the three men bet, and then Forson bet; he put down half a crown first; he lost, and then put down 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lost that; then he put down half a sovereign, and lost it, and then he put down two sovereigns, one after another, and lost them, and then a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; he lost that, and then put down two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and lost them—the prisoner took up the money, and I saw him hand the notes to another man, who said as soon as he had got the money, "I am off now"—Forson said to me, "Come, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, let us go," but I said, "Stay still"—that was when he had lost part of the money—when he said, "Let us go," I thought he meant, "Come along, let us both go together," but he says he did not—the man got away with the notes, and Forson ran after the prisoner, and caught him—they all rushed out together—I was not in the street when the prisoner was caught, I remained in the public house; I was not able to go out—I have had a fall from aloft, which broke my foot, and I am lame—I did not bet at all—when Forson got hold of the prisoner, he said, "Don't give me in charge, and you shall have your own money back"—that was when he was brought back into the house—he was kept there pretty nearly two hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear anything said about a card being marked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one of the party said that one of the cards was turned up at the edge—the game still went on—I suppose the edge was turned down again—I do not know whether it was put into the pack, or whether he went on with it—it was one of the three who came into the room who said that—it is impossible for me to tell whether he went on with that card, because if it was turned down again, it would be like the rest—I am pretty certain that there was cheating in the matter—I know the cards were changed once, the three he played with first—most likely that would be after it was said that one was marked—I do not understand it at all—I know they were changed once, three were put back, and three taken out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I am a tailor—I have been com<lb/>mitted for safe custody as a witness, and now come out of the gaol of Newgate. On 12th Oct. last, I was living at the house of the prisoner, Mary Chapman, and had been lodging there about three months—I knew an old man named John Reader, who lodged in the upper part of that house—I know Mr. Pidcock, a solicitor, who has an office in Woolwich—I went there with the prisoners on 12th Oct., in the afternoon; I do not know at what time—Mrs. Chapman took a paper with her—we saw Mr. Pidcock, and the paper that Mrs. Chapman took was shown to him; he disapproved of it, and drew out another will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper which Mr. Pidcock drew; I see my handwriting at the bottom of it—he gave it to Mrs. Chapman, and he marked in pencil where the witnesses were to sign their names and places of residence, and also a mark where, the now deceased man had to put his mark—we then left Mr. Pidcock's office—we went across the churchyard—it was very dark and wet, and we went into the tap room of the Mitre—a waiter was there when we went in, nobody else—he left the room, after bringing in half a pint of rum—Mrs. Chapman ordered that; it was drank, another half pint of rum was then called for, which was also drank—the waiter left us the room to our<lb/>selves—there was then nobody in the room but Mrs. Chapman, Higgins, and myself, and Mrs. Chapman's little son, who is about thirteen years old—I was warming myself at the fire, as it was cold and wet, when a pen and ink was brought into the tap room, but I did not see who brought it in, and Mrs. Chapman said to the prisoner, Higgins, "We may as well save a little time, as the evening is wet, the will has to go back again to night, we may as well mark our names and places of residence"—Higgins marked his name and place of residence, and I did so also—that is Higgins's name and address, which he wrote in my presence, and this is mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper</hi>)—after I had signed my name, I went to the fire to dry and warm myself—the table was, I suppose, about three or four feet from the fire—we were all standing up at the time; Higgins's back was to me—I could not see what he was doing—Mrs. Chapman said, "As there is nobody here but ourselves, you may as well put a mark to it, and get it done at once"—she said that to Higgins—he made no answer—I did not actually see him put the mark, because I was at the fire, but he brought the paper over to the fire and dried it—my writing was thick, and wanted a little drying—I did not look to see whether a mark was there—I saw him with the pen in his hand; not after Mrs. Chapman said, "We may as well get it done at once," but previous to that; when he wrote his own name—I saw nothing done after she made that observation—I did not go to the table afterwards; I remained still at the fire drying myself—the last I saw of the paper it was with Higgins—we then went to the bar, and had a quartern of rum there, which Higgins and I drank; Mrs. Chapman drank none of it—she paid for it all—we then proceeded to Mrs. Chapman's house—we went up stairs into Reader's room, where he lay</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Woolwich; I am surgeon to the parish of Woolwich, and to the union, I was desired by the parochial authorities to attend John Reader—I first saw him on 7th Oct. last—he was then in a comatose state—I attended him to the time of his death—he never rallied in my presence—I saw him every day—he never appeared to recognise me in any way, or to be conscious of anything that was going on around him—he never spoke—I saw him on the 12th, near upon 1 o'clock; he was then in a worse state, he was rapidly sinking—he showed no appearance of consciousness whatever—he had paralysis of the soft palate, what we term <hi rend="italic">stertor—stertor</hi> indicates difficult or loud breathing—it is a symptom of approaching death—it indicates pressure on the brain—I noticed his eyes; from the commencement the pupils were contracted—they did not dilate at all; they appeared in about the same state on the 12th—that indicated pressure on the optic nerve, and very great pressure on the brain—he died on the 13th—I saw him on the 13th during life; it must have been in the forenoon—he was still in the same state, sinking rapidly—I understand he died in the afternoon—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the vessels of the brain were greatly congested—there was effusion, the lungs were congested, and charged with carbon,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300075"/>
               <p>and the heart contained venous blood; the whole system was under the influence of carbon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Judging from the appearances after death, and from your own attend<lb/>ance on him during the six or seven days before his death, in your judg<lb/>ment was he, on the 12th, in a state of consciousness to transact any busi<lb/>ness, or to understand it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my judgment, I should say decidedly not—on the 11th, when I was there, a search was made of his clothes by both the prisoners—a savings bank book was brought into the room; it was not found in his pockets—I cannot say who brought it into the room—5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Was found in his pocket, and a half sovereign and some silver fell on the ground—Mrs. Chapman took possession of the book and of the money, I being present and offering no opposition to it—I did not see the book found—I believe it was Mrs. Chapman who brought it in, it having been deposited (as it was stated to me) in the deceased hat—nothing more was said or done about the boot on that occasion—when the churchwarden, Mr. Morgan, accompanied me, he wanted me to look at' the book; that was on the night of the 11th—I do not recollect anything being said or done about the book on the 12th—Mrs. Chapman stated to me; on the 12th, that Reader had made a will in her favour—I do not recollect making any observation to her upon that—in a very early stage of Reader's illness, she said if anything happened to him she hoped I would be her friend, or she must look to me to be her friend—that was perhaps on the 8th or 9th Oct.; it might have been after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she explain in what way she wished you to stand her friend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she did not; I did not ask her—that was before she told me he had made a will—I first went to attend him on 7th Oct, in the evening—I cannot recollect how long I stayed on that occasion; as for as I can recollect, I think I went about 6 or 7 o'clock; I cannot speak positively—I should say I stopped a quarter of an hour—I will not, on my oath, say that I did—I should say that I stayed a quarter of an hour—I will swear that I did—I went again the following day—I cannot say at what time, I have a very large parish to attend to—I cut some of them as short as I can; I am obliged to drive about from one to another as fast as I can—I cannot say whether my second visit was in the morning; afternoon, or evening—I do not know how long I stayed, but sufficiently long—I went again the following day—I have not kept a diary of my visits, and cannot tell at what time I went on that occasion, or how long I stayed—I have stayed longer than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I did not perform any operation, with the exception of putting a blister over the right lung—I gave directions to Mrs. Chapman what she was to do—I found that she attended to those directions—in my judgment she attended to him properly and carefully, as far as I saw—I paid about eight visits altogether—besides, the blister over the right lung, he also had a blister at the back of the neck, and purgative medicine—he had bronchitis when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the producing cause of that which you call paralysis of the soft palate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The palate being supplied with nerves, and he having paralysis of those nerves, of course paralysis of the muscles is supplied by that—those nerves ramify across the palate generally—stertor is difficulty of breathing arising from the soft palate—we generally find when persons are ill that they are worse in the evening—he was sinking when I was there on the 12th—I think I looked in there on the 12th, about half past 12 or 1 o'clock, and I dare say I left a little after I; I cannot speak positively some cases a person may be deprived of speech, and yet</p>

My husband keeps the Mitre, at Woolwich—there is a tap to the house—I recollect some persons coming there, but I do not know the time—the witness Fitzpatrick was one of them, I knew him before by sight—a man, a woman, and a boy were with him—they went into the tap room—I think it was about 6 o'clock in the evening, as near as I can recollect—they called for half a pint of rum at first—that was taken into the room to them—altogether, they had two half pints of rum and a quartern before they left the house—I do not remember who paid for it—they had a pen and ink from my bar parlour—I do not recollect who took it into the tap room—I knew Fitzpatrick before, I do not recollect either of the prisoners—I know the office of Mr. Pidcock, the solicitor—any one coming from there to my house, must come through the churchyard.</p>

                  </hi>. I believe John Reader, who died at Woolwich, on 13th Oct., to be my uncle—my father's name is Robert Reuben Reader—on hearing of John Reader's death, I went down to Woolwich—I received the letter on 19th Oct., and went on the Sunday after—I went to the house he had occupied, and afterwards to Mrs. Chapman's—I there saw the prisoners—I said I expected to find my uncle lying in bed, but he was dead and buried—Mrs. Chapman said she had done everything for him that was requisite, and had been at a great expense and trouble, and my uncle had left everything to her—I did not ask anything about a will, she told me that my uncle had left a will leaving everything to her—I asked to see the will—she said she would produce the witnesses of the will, but she did not offer to show me the will—Higgins said, that everything was left to Mrs. Chapman—I said I was not interested for myself but I was for the children, and if they could not prove satisfactorily that they were entitled to the money, I should take proceedings against them—I then returned to town—between a fortnight and three weeks after that, Higgins came up to town, but previous to that I received a letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), it came by post—I sent no answer to it, and on that Higgins came up—he saw my father, myself, and my wife together—the letter was pro<lb/>duced, and Higgins stated that he had written that letter by order of Mrs. Chapman—what passed was to the same purport as the letter—we said we could not answer it until we had an answer from my cousin—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>, "Woolwich, 7th Nov., 1853. Mr. Charles Reader, Sir, I avail myself of this opportunity in communicating this note to you, trusting the same may meet you and your father enjoying good health, and return you many thanks for your kind proposals in offering your aid as well as that of your father in enabling me to recover the effects of the late John Reader your uncle. You will remember, I acquainted you of an elderly man and woman of middle age, coming to me, the latter representing herself as daughter of the deceased; I have further to acquaint you, that some-person or persons are striving to disinherit me of your late uncle's effects bequeathed to me prior to departing this life; whether you are acquainted with the proceedings</p>

               <p>now going on I cannot say. I am informed by Mr. Pidcock, the solicitor, that there is a caveat thrown in Doctor's Commons, as a preventive of my draw<lb/>ing any of the moneys invested in the Woolwich and Plumstead Savings Bank; whether it has been through the medium of any of the deceased's relatives, or that of the parish authorities I cannot say. Should you be acquainted with any steps that may have been taken with any of your relatives, you will greatly oblige me by favouring me with the required information, and should the same be done through the means of any of your family, I am ready to resign all further attempt or claims to the will and the bank book still in my possession; but should my antagonists be any of the parish authorities, I am determined to maintain my rights by retain<lb/>ing the above book, should it cost me every farthing through law, as they have been the means of endeavouring to persecute me, first in calling on a Coroners Inquest and having a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on your late uncle, and secondly, when they found your aged and infirm relative met with his death fairly, through an old pleurisy and a case of bronchitis, they, I have every reason to believe, are now striving to deprive me of your dear uncle's last will and testament. As I before stated, should it be any of the family striving to recover the same, I am content to resign all further claims, on the grounds that all my expenses are remitted to me You will do me a great favour by acknowledging this as early as possible, signifying your opinion; by so doing you will confer a great favour. "Signed" John Chap<lb/>man" and "Mary Chapman." "P. S. You are acquainted with the respect<lb/>able manner I had your late uncle interred; I also acquainted Mr. Pidcock, the solicitor, of your calling on the Sunday, and gave him your address, Blenheim-place, Blenheim-steps, Oxford-street"—I did not see Mrs. Chap<lb/>man after Higgins came and spoke to me about that letter.</p>

On the Friday before the 19th of Jan., my father sent for a constable; he came, and soon after I went into a room occupied by the prisoner—she was there—I saw the constable with two bottles of wine in his hand—the prisoner was taken to the station—I went afterwards, and saw some bread and butter, and flour, and candles—I only know this wine by the seal on the bottles—this bottle has on the seal, "Jones, 28, Mark-lane"—I cannot speak to the other bottle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Sydenham Gas-works. Between 10th and 13th of Jan., the prisoner came to the Gas-works; he came two or three times—he came to me in the office, once or twice, while I was there, and once or twice in my absence—at first he told me he came on a friendly visit, but afterwards he said he was out of work, and he applied for relief—I had known him some years ago, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I had in my office a spirit level on a shelf—I mused it one evening, to the best of my knowledge on a Wednesday—I think the prisoner had been there on the Monday or Tuesday, and on the Wednesday in the same week I missed the level; I have seen it since—after I missed the level, the pri<lb/>soner came again on Monday, 23rd Jan., I told him I had lost a level out of the office, and asked him if he had seen it—he said he had seen no level, and none he wanted to see—I asked him if he would walk to the Bell with me—I told him that I had heard that he had shown it there—he still denied having the level—he told me he had a level, but it was his own; and he had sent it with other things to London—I asked him to go up the village, and we went up; and he wanted to go in the Red Lion—I told him I did not want him to go there, but he went and I followed him—he went to a back yard—he then came out of the public house, and he <hi rend="italic">shot</hi> into the next yard, Mr. Standen's yard, and he went to a closet there—I wanted to stop there till he came out, but he pulled the door to—I waited till he came out, and we then went on—he said, "Where now"—I said, "Come on to the Peacock"—I then gave him in charge, and the policeman took him back to the closet—this is my level, to the best of my belief; I had two of them—this is the same size and pattern.</p>

                  </hi>. In the first week in Jan., I was in the employ of the Sydenham Gas Company, as a collector—I saw two levels in the office on the 12th or 13th Jan.—I examined them both; I found one of them was not quite true, and I filed one of the screws down a little—I left the marks of the file on it—I did it to lower that side to make it true—this is the level—I think these are the marks of the file; these are very similar marks to those I made—I believe this to be the same level.</p>

               <p>back in a military costume—I am sure it was the prisoner—they went in the back way of the Canteen—I left the window, and came on the stairs—I saw them pass the window of the Canteen; I followed them to the barrack yard, about sixty yards from the Canteen—I stopped the prisoner, and told him I took him on suspicion of stealing wine from the Canteen—I called the sergeant to my assistance—the prisoner said, "Very well, that will do"—I found on him three bottles of whisky and two of sherry—he had a large military great coat on, which went over all—two of the bottles were in his trowsers' pockets, and the others in the military great coat—these are them—the corks of the sherry have a black mark on the top—I took the prisoner to the police station—the other man got away then, and was not taken till the Monday following—the Magistrate thought as he had been at work, he might be drawn into it by this man, and he was discharged—his name was Martin—after the prisoner was taken to the station, I went to Martin's room in the Barracks, and found the prisoner's coat there—in the fireplace in that room I found several bottles broken, and the corks marked with black stripes just the same as these are—I found eight men in that room, in bed, drunk—they had all been throwing up from the drink they had taken; and likewise the corporal was drunk—I afterwards identified Martin—I went to the coal cellar on the same evening, about an hour afterwards—I there found a bottle of whisky corresponding with those I found on the prisoner; I also found that the back gate was locked, and had been locked previous to the time that I went to watch, so that no one could come to this back place unless by going through the house—I ascertained it was locked before I went to the watch—it is supposed to be locked by the provost sergeant every afternoon at 4 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 17). The prisoner was a police constable in the same division; he has been a good many years in the police force—I should say, nearly sixteen years. On the morning of 13th Jan., he was on duty in Bermondsey—it is part of my duty to go round the beats, and see whether the constables are on their beats—between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I went round the beat in Bermondsey-street—I know the house of William Carpenter in that street; it is No. 101—it is in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey—as I approached the house, I saw the door standing partly open, about half a foot open, I should say, and there was a light proceeding from between the door post and the door—I should say I was not more than a yard from the window shutter of the house at that time, I was walking very near the house—as I passed by I saw the light, and I looked in and saw a man standing in the shop—he had a light, standing against the partition with it in his hand; it was a lighted piece of paper—it went out—I was not aware at first that it was a policeman—I looked in again, and I saw him then light a piece of paper from his lamp and put it against the partition—the paper on the partition caught light; it was not very much that was alight—the paper that was on the partition did not appear to burn freely; the paper that he had in his hand burnt the most; however, I saw the fire on the paper go up between the crevices in the partition—the partition is here—when I saw that, I cried out, "Woods, what are you about?"—I knew then who it was; I saw his number reflected from the light that was in his hand—when I spoke to him, he put his hand and knocked the fire out, the light that was on the paper—(<hi rend="italic">producing the partition</hi>) this is where the fire was going on—this is where I saw the paper, and the fire went up here—I only saw the light going up here (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—when I called to him, he put the light out—he knocked the fire out with his hand; it was out in an instant—when I said to him, "Woods, what are you about?" he said, "If I had not come in, the house would have been on fire"—I asked him if he had called the inmates; he said he had, and shortly after that I heard a voice from up stairs, and Woods then cried out, "Carpenter!"—that was all I heard him say—Mr. Carpenter then came down into the shop—I was outside all this time; the prisoner was inside—I saw Woods showing Carpenter round the place with his light in his hand—it was his lantern that he had in his hand—he was not with Carpenter in the shop above two or three minutes, I suppose: not</p>

               <p>five minutes at the outside—after he had shown Carpenter round the shop, I took him to the station house—he came to the door—I asked him what he had been doing; he made no reply, and I then said I should take him to the station house and state the case to sergeant Reed, who was on duty, which I did—the prisoner did not say anything—I took him to the station, and told him, in sergeant Reed's presence, what I saw, and then sergeant Reed desired me to go and acquaint inspector Branford of the circumstance—I told sergeant Reed, in the prisoner's presence, that I saw him put the piece of paper in the lamp, and set alight to the partition—the prisoner did not make any observation on my stating that—I afterwards went back to the house of Mr. Carpenter—I examined the street door, and saw that the hasp had been forced out of the door—it was picked up and given to me by a witness; I did not see it picked up—inspector Branford knocked the partition down in my presence—it was a fixture, nailed up; we had to use a hammer to knock it down—I saw a parasol in the shop—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>ducing it</hi>)—it was standing on the opposite side of the partition, at the back—it was not close to the partition, it was standing about a foot from it, or it might be more—there is a window, and the partition divided it—one side is where Carpenter works, and the other side is a window, where he puts his umbrellas—the parasol was on the work bench—it appears to have been burnt; there are marks of fire on it—I saw it after I came back to the shop—I did not notice it in the first instance—this is the piece of the paper that was on the partition (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was taken off in my presence; it is burnt—it was taken off after we returned—I saw it removed that same night, when I came back from the station—these are the ashes from the paper that we picked up afterwards, that had dropped underneath.</p>

               <p>second time I had been round on that night—it might have been just before 11 o'clock that I had seen the prisoner before—it was as near about 11 o'clock as could be—Bermondsey-street is a thoroughfare—it is a considerable thoroughfare in the day time—it is a thoroughfare at all times—there are a great many more persons pass through in the day time than at night—I have been in the force, I should say, fourteen years last July—the prisoner has been in the force longer than me—he is entitled to a pension after fifteen years service if he is passed unlit by the surgeon—the amount depends upon that—his would be 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for life, if he was passed as disabled—some men only get 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might be entitled to 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for life—I do not know whether he has made any application about a pension—Mr. Carpenter sells combs, and different things, besides umbrellas—the outer door was open, so that I could see the prisoner—it was not wide open, it was pulled about half a foot open, or it might be a little more—you have to go down a step to reach the door—it is a small house, and it has got a ware-house <hi rend="italic">overneath</hi> it where they keep wool, a kind of loft—it is a very old house, one of the <hi rend="italic">ancientest</hi> buildings in the street—the prisoner has been in the same division as I have ever since I have been in it—we have done duty together for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember that in 1848, in capturing a burglar, he received a violent blow on his neck with a brick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard so; that is the tradition of the force—I have heard that at another time, in 1849, his head was broken, and that he was laid up about six weeks in the hospital—I believe he has had a great many blows from first to last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser and umbrella maker, in Bermondsey-street. On the night of 12th Jan., I went from my shop up stairs to my bed room, about half-past 9 o'clock; I did not come down again—I left the boy, William Webb, up in the house when I went up stairs—he was up stairs when I went there—there was nobody down stairs, only my father, who was in bed, in the back room ground floor—there was nobody left in the shop at the time I went up to bed—one of the gas</p>

               <p>lights in the window was left burning—the fire was not alight; there had been a fire in the day time, but it had gone out—I cannot say to a minute or two when it had gone out; but I observed that it was out, and that was why I went up stairs to my room—there are two gas burners in the shop, but only one was alight at the time I went up stairs, that was the one in the window; it was within, I suppose, three or four feet of the partition—the gas is usually turned off when we shut up; but on this sight I went up stairs about that time, and sent the boy down a conside<lb/>rable time after to shut up, he was doing a little for his mother—we were shut up when I went to bed, not at half past 9 o'clock; I sent the boy down after that to put out the gas, and to shut up the shutters; that was after 10 o'clock—about 12 o'cloak I was awoke by my wife—I heard a noise in the shop, once, and only once; I thought it was the transparency that had fallen down; I thought the cat had knocked it down—my wife went to the head of the stairs, and I heard her call out three times, and after that I heard a voice call once "Carpenter"—on that I went down; I had not any light with me up stairs—I did not take any light down with me into the shop—I found one policeman in the shop, and one at the door—I now believe the prisoner is the man that I found in the shop; I was not aware of it at the time—he had a light with him; it was a lantern or lamp like policemen usually carry—I did not observe any other—I spoke first and said, I would kick my boy's backside for leaving the door open; seeing the door open, and the two men there, I thought it was so—the policeman said, "What for?" I said, "For leaving the door open, and troubling you and disturbing me"—he said "Is that all? or, "Is there anything else?"—I cannot say the exact words, it was one or the other—I said that was all that I knew of did he know of anything? And as I made that remark, I observed a sheet of <hi rend="italic">Lloyds Newspaper</hi> that had been tacked over a broken square, was out, and the transparency standing sideways down—I said, "This has been torn out since I went to bed, but it is of no consequence, I did not set any value upon it"—the policeman made a further remark, I believe, and then he made the obser<lb/>vation about fire; that there had been a fire, or there was fire, one of those two he mentioned—he threw the light upon the burnt partition as he stood, and I observed it on the moment, and then went up and saw it, and clapped my hand upon it, and found it warm—I saw that some of the paper had been burnt, it was black, charred—this is the partition—none of the paper on the partition had been burnt at the time I went up to bed, on the night of the 12th—upon seeing the paper burnt, I remarked, that I conceived I had not an enemy in the world to do me such an injury as this; and I said it had been done wilfully—I said, "Whoever has done this, it has not been done accidentally; God knows who could have had such a spite against me as to do me such a wilful injury as this"—at the same moment I saw this parasol on the bench on the other side of the partition, part of it seems to have been burnt—it was not in that state when I went up stairs on the previous night, it was sound, we were going to hang it outside the shop the following morning; it had been only painted the pre<lb/>vious day; it was not folded up—it was standing open on my work bench; my wife had only had the fringe tacked on that evening, and I told the boy not to lay it under the bench, because it would get dirty, and he put it on the bench—it was at one end of the bench, nearest the partition; it was put there about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening—I called the policeman's attention to the parasol—he remarked that it might possibly have been done by the</p>

               <p>gas pipes, not by the gas lamps, but by the pipes; he said there was no gas on at the time he was in—the pipes are plain to be seen along the ceiling—the policeman turned his bull's eye on to the pipes when he made that remark; I replied, with all due respect to the Court, "D—d nonsense"—I said that, because I considered it was an impossibility to be fired that way—the policeman made no answer to it; the other policeman was still standing at the door at this time—he called to the one that was in the shop, "Woods, come here;" and he went out immediately—when I was going to close the door after he had gone, I found that the bottom catch, the hasp of the door, was off—I then dressed myself; the boy came down, after me—I was down first after I had dressed myself, and the boy and his mother came down together just afterwards—I did not see the boy pick up the hasp, I was at the other part of the shop—I had known the prisoner a good while before this as a police officer—I was never much acquainted with him, but I had spoken to him, and had seen him on the beat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am single—I was residing at Willow-cottage, belonging to Lady Amelia Shaw, at Twickenham; she is a widow—I superintend a school, which is under her management, near her house—William West was a pupil in that school—on 18th Jan., there was no one residing in Willow-cottage but myself—I left it a little before 2 o'clock to attend to the school—all the doors and all the windows were then fastened—there is a kitchen separate from the dwelling house; I fastened that—when I got to the school, William West was there as usual—before the school was over, he was sent for—I do not know who fetched him—I allowed him to go, and he did not come back—I went back to the cottage between 4 and half past 4 o'clock—there are two front gates, one of them was wide open—I had left it shut—it could not be opened from the outside—there is an iron gate which opens from the outside—the oilier gate that I found open, must have been opened from the inside—the palings I suppose are about four feet high—this boy, William West, could have been lifted over them, and then he could open the gate which I found open—I opened the iron gate, and got in the house by the key which I had—I went in the kitchen, and saw a basin on the dresser with a piece of glass in it—I presumed that the cat had jumped through one of the windows; there was a pane of glass broken, and the glass was lying about the kitchen—I afterwards missed a pair of my own boots—I then had suspicion—I went in the drawing room, and found one pane of glass broken there; there are some steps close to the window, and by means of that broken pane a person's hand could be put in, and the fastening of the window could be undone, and the window could be opened—I missed two dresses, a black cape, a shawl, a shawl pin, and a bag; I have seen them all since.</p>

In consequence of information, I went on Thursday morning, 19th Jan., to a house in Windmill-lane, New Hampton, about 10 or 11 o'clock—I went to a room kept by a person named Middleton—I found the two prisoners there, both sitting on a bed—the first thing I saw was West had this pin sticking in her breast—I took it from her, and behind Cranstone I found this bag, and in it was a dress—I took Cranstone into custody, and she said, "I will tell you all about it"—I had not said anything to either of them before that—she said, "Louisa (meaning West) came to me last night at Hampton-court, and I asked her where she got those things from; she told me she brought them from home, and the dress she wore on leaving home she changed, and the dress she wore at home she had thrown away"—shortly after she said, "That shawl Louisa has got on is not hers, it is one she has stolen"—Louisa West did not hear this, because they were separate—we kept them separate as much as we could.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, V 322). On 19th Jan. I apprehended the two prisoners in a room in a house in Windmill-lane—I found this bag there—it was lying on the bed, close by Cranstone—I examined it, and found a dress in it, and a pair of gloves, which contained four duplicates—one of them is for a pair of trowsers—in going to the station, as we were on the road, we got near Lady Shaw's house, and we made a stop there—West then said, "You have a pair of gloves in that bag, with some duplicates</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300112"/>
               <p>in them belonging to me; one of them is for some trowsers which I have pawned, belonging to my father"—(I believe Cranstone could hear this)—when we were at the Court, West said, "Give me them duplicates that belong to me, and I will burn them; or give them to my mother"—in the course of inquiry I found that these trowsers had been stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a pawnbroker's shop, at Twickenham. I know the prisoner Cranstone—on the evening of 31st Dec. I recollect her coming to my shop a little before 6 o'clock—there was some other girl with her, but I cannot say who it was—Cranstone produced this pair of trowsers to pawn—she asked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—they were taken in, and the money paid to her for them—she gave the name of Eliza Brown—this is the duplicate in my shopboy's handwriting—I have the counterpart of it.</p>
