            . The Prisoner brought a light Dun Gelding, on the 2d of December, to my Mother's, at the Plough in Princess-street, by Leicester-Fields . - She keeps an Inn there; he offered it to me for Sale; I asked him how he came by it; he said, he had it of his Father to set him up in a Way of Business, because he could not give him Money: He asked me nine Guineas for it; I bid him six Guineas that Night, but he would not take it; it stood all Night at my Mother's: The next Day he came again, and then I bid him seven Guineas; he would not take it then, but he came afterwards and took the Money. About a Week afterwards it was advertis'd in the Papers; upon which I went directly to Esquire Wright's, and two of his Servants came to our House; the Horse was show'd them in the Stable, (this was the Thursday after) and delivered to them directly. - I never saw the Prisoner after the Bargain was made.</p>

I am a Tayler, I had a pair of Black Cloth Breeches sent me to mend by Mr Keckwick, I hung them carelesly over the Shop-Door, and on Tuesday the 14th of December, the Prisoner snatched them off the Door, and run away with them: But having no Shoes on, I did not pursue him: The next Night, I hung a Waistcoat over the Door, to see if I could catch him, fastened a String to it, and nailed it to the Door, and on Saturday Night he came again, took the Waistcoat off the Door, and pulled it as far as he could for the String, so I run after him, and took him. I am sure, he is the Person that took the Breeches; because I saw him very plain, he had a Cap on, as he has now, when he took the Breeches, but when he came for the Waistcoat, he had a Hat on. <rs id="t17430114-4-verdict22" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mr Blakey. On the 22d of December, about seven in the Evening, I was going by Somerset-House, and heard a Gentleman say, the Fellow has pick'd my Pocket. I said, Sir, secure him, and I will take care no body shall come behind you to assault you. There was a Handkerchief lying upon the Ground just by the Prisoner's Feet, said I, Sir, is that your Handkerchief, he said it was, and I think Mr Mills took it up himself, he carried the Prisoner into a Hosier's-Shop, by Somerset House ; and he was afraid of being insulted by others of the Gang, so sent for a Guard from Somerset-House, who carried the Prisoner before Justice Frasier. - The Handkerchief lay very near him, and there was nobody else near, who could possibly take it. - There was another Fellow about two or three Yards from him, who I suspected to belong to the Gang.</p>

Serj. Temple was sent for, and the Hat was found there. This is the Hat (it was owned by Mr Blackwell) As I was carrying them in a Coach to Newgate, Fennell said, that Bland did propose to them both, to take his Hat off, as he said, to get them a Drink. - As near as I can remember, these were the Words; Let us go and take the Gentleman's Hat off, to give us a Drink.</p>

Ever since he has been in my Company, he has been in the Barracks in the Savoy; and by that I have a better Opportunity of knowing a Man's Behaviour than out of them. They are not confined all Night there. He was present when the Roll was called over, but he might go out afterwards.

            . There were two Nans. Then they both laid hold of me, the Prisoner with her Right-Hand , and the other with her Left. The Prisoner had one Arm round me, and dived with the other into the left Pocket of my Breeches; and she pulled my Shirt out before she got to my Pocket. Then they both cried out for George, but George did not come. I cried out Murder, but no Soul came. - When she found my Shirt was not a Bag, she put her Hand into my Breeches Pocket, and took hold of the Bag. There was in the Bag 35 s. She got the Bag out. I got hold of the Bag as well as she: But she had got hold of the Money part. She gave it a Jerk out of my Hand, and gave it to the other Woman, and she run away with it. Then I takes fast hold of her. God gave me more Strength then, I think, than I have had for some Years. She cried out for George ; but, thank God, George did not come. I cried out, Murder, and dragged her quite down the Alley. And just at the end of the Alley stood three Men. I said to them, Gentlemen , I am robbed by this Creature, and beg your Assistance to help me to the White-Swan-Inn at Holbourn-Bridge, where my Horses were. Two of them would not. They asked, what I would give them. I told them, I would give them what Drink they would; but as to Money, I had none. One of them said, he would take the Country Man's Part, and he went along with me; I never let go my hold of the Prisoner, 'till I came to the Tap-house at the Swan ; and there I gave him part of two Pints of Beer. I thanked him, and craved his Name. But he said, he dared not tell it me, for he should be knocked on the Head by her Bullies if he should. She was that Night carried to the Counter: And next Morning, when she came before my Lord Mayor, she said I was suddled, and that my Shirt hung out of my Breeches; and that I took her up without any Reason. - My Pocket was then buttoned up, as it is now, that one would have thought it impossible for her to have got her Hand into it. - I looked in the Bag two or three Days before, and the Money was in then. I have had no Occasion to open it since, and I am sure the Money was in it. - I always lay my Breeches under my Pillow, so that no body could get to it. - I am sure the Bag was in my Pocket when she came up to me. - The Man that assisted me said, he lived in White Fryars . I enquired at 20 Houses, and could not find him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The Man came running down the Alley with his Shirt out, and said he was robb'd ; says he to me, you are the Woman that robb'd me, for I can find no Body else. I did not touch the Man.</p>

He had hold of her by the Arm, and cried out Murder; says she, you hurt my Arm, what would you have with me; he said, she had robb'd him, and he would give any Body a Dozen of Beer to go to some Inn with her. - He was hawling her into that Part of the Alley that comes into the Market; there was abundance of Mob in two or three Minutes, and there was a Gentlewoman that came down the Alley, and said, Master, do not murder your Wife. - I saw their Faces very plain; I took Notice of her, because she is a black Woman, and so the more remarkable; and I thought it a little strange, that an old Man should want a Woman. - It was about a Quarter after eight at Night. - I did not see the Man till he cried out Murder; I was among the other Mob; there was a Lamp which he hawl'd her up to, which was as nigh as the Candle is to you.</p>

They were first under the Lamp; and as the People came down, the Women mov'd backward and forward, and the old Gentleman stood with his Back to the Corner: I only speak this to show that there were two Women with him, and his Shirt hung a little indecently out of his Breeches; I had no Business to see what they were doing of, because it was immodest: I had a Candle in my Hand at my own Gate, and I had a thorough Sight of the Women, and I heard somebody say, Do not murder your Wife. Said he, G - d d - n her, I do not murder her. - You, honest Man! can you deny these Words?</p>

I will give you a Gallon of Beer to take her away to some Place; where he said, I cannot tell. - The Woman he was pulling up the Alley was a black Woman. - There were abundance of People, black-guard Boys and Girls: Her Arm looked very big, as if it was swell'd.</p>

            . On the 27th of December I went to open my Bureau, which stands in the Kitchin, and found it unlocked. The Prisoner was my Servant, and was by me at that Time. I told her I missed some Money. There was a Piece of the Walnut-Tree broke off, and some Rust upon the Place where it was forced open. She said, she knew nothing of it. But after some Time said, If I must tell you, I left the Street-Door open last Night, and found it unlocked this Morning. I told her, That must be a Story; for I heard her bar it at Night, and unbar it in the Morning. I told her, I would send for a Constable: And then she said, If I must tell you the Truth, I am married. - My Husband lay with me that Night; and he had a Friend who sat up in the Kitchin all Night by the Fire, and she was afraid he had taken it. She told me, she knew nothing of the opening it: But, if I pleased, she would go with the Constable to the Place where these Fellows were, and would get them apprehended. And she, with the Constable, went to the Thatched-House , by Temple-Bar. When they came back again, she said she could not find them, and believed they were gone to work at Deptford . She said, she was sure her Husband had not taken it. <rs id="t17430114-15-verdict77" type="verdictDescription">

            ; after this was found out to be a Forgery, Mr Frogget and I went into Wapping to enquire for Phillips, and after a long Enquiry, we found him on a Sunday in the Afternoon, I think it was on the 30th of May, shaving at a Barber's in Cable-Street, in Rag-Fair; I knew him before, so I asked him whether he would not go and drink a Mug of Beer, and we went to the Hay field; while we were there, Mr Frogget asked him this Question: Pray where was you on the 13th of May at Night, Phillips said he did not know; says Frogget, was you not at such an Alehouse, naming the Sign, at Fleet-Ditch, Phillips asked why: Says Frogget, you can tell whether you was there or no, and he said he did not know but he might be there; Frogget asked him if he had any Company there, and he said he believed he had; Frogget said, did you see me there, and Phillips replied he did not; then Frogget asked him if he knew him, or had ever seen him, and he said not as he knew of; Look at me again, says Frogget, and see whether you know me or not; (this was in a publick Room, where there was a good Number of People) then says Frogget, how can you be so great a Villain, to swear you saw me receive such a Sum of Money, when you never saw me: Says Phillips, I saw none paid, says Frogget, you have made an Affidavit of it in the Court of King's Bench, it is a surprizing Thing, you should not know me when I have the same Cloths on, and every Thing just the same as I had then; and Phillips said, I will say no more about it, I have sai d too much already. If you want to know more, go to Mr Adams, the Pawnbroken, in Faulcon-Court, in the Borough, and be will inform you of all the Transactions. - There was a Talk of a Paper that he signed, and the People of the House said it was a strange Thing, he should be guilty of such a Thing as to sign such a Paper, when he did not know the Man. On the 13th of May, when we came from the Master's Office, it was so dark that he could not see to do it that Night, so he bid the Attorneys cast it up. Shearsmith was not there, Tigh and Herbert, and Frogget, and Goulder, and one Bladen, and I, went to King's Coffee-House, by White-Fryers-Gateway , and there Herbert cast the Bill up once, and then Goulder , and they gave the Bill to Mr Bladen to cast up, while he was casting up the Bill, Tigh said he had no Money, pulled his Pocket-Book out, and said he had a Draught upon the Bank, but the Person that drew it was dead, and the Bank would not pay it; Herbert says to Goulder, (Frogget's Attorney,) What do you design to do in this Case, you ought not to be over hasty in making out your Judgment against my Client, and he said he could say nothing to it, he must take the Course of the Law, and said he did not know whether he should make out an Execution, or bring an Action upon it; when we came from King's Coffee-House, Frogget . Goulder, and I, went to the Sun-Tavern, in Fleet-street; we drank two half Pints of Wine, and parted at ten o'Clock, Frogget and I came down Fleet-street; the Bill was taxed on the 14th, Tigh said at the Master's Chambers, that he had paid the Debt and Costs, tho' he suffered the Bill to be taxed; Pob, poh , says he, I do not value what you are doing, I have got a Release - I do believe Frogget's Name to the Release is not his hand Writting, I have seen him write several Times.</p>

               <p>Herbert. Was Mr Stokes, upon the Taxation, before the Master.</p>

               <p>Burnford. He came in, but staid a very little while, and left you to go through the whole Taxation.</p>

               <p>Herbert, Tigh was there on the 13th, but he was not on the 14th.</p>

               <p>Court. You should be very cautious what you say, when People are trying for their Lives; you said it was on the 14th, and that Tigh said he had got a Release, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Burnford, I thought it was Tigh; I took it to be his Voice. - I heard such Discourse pass, but I will not be positive who said it. - I took it for granted to be him, as they were all standing together. Coun. Are you sure to the Day you went to look for Phillips.</p>

               <p>Burnford. It was on the 30th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

               <p>Burnford. In Half Moon-Court, on Ludgate Hill .</p>

               <p>Q. What do you do for a Livelihood? -</p>

               <p>Burnford. I officiate as Clerk to the Persons in the Fleet, and my Character never was impeached on any Thing.</p>

               <p>Tigh. He swears I was at the Master's Office on the 14th, and my Attorney says, there was no body there but Mr Goulder, and Herbert; ask him whether he does not find Money to carry on this Prosecution.</p>

               <p>Burnford. Upon the Oath that I have taken, I never was one Shilling towards the carrying on the Prosecution.</p>

               <p>Tigh. You have acknowledged that you have lent Mr Goulder Money.</p>

               <p>Burnford. Yes, I did so in the Office, but I had the Money again.</p>

               <p>Mr Goulder. - On the 13th of May I attended the Master for Mr Frogget , at the King's Bench Office ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140014"/> on the Taxation of the Bill; there was Mr Frogget, and one Mr Burnford, and Mr Tigh, Mr Stokes, and Mr Herbert attended: We staid at the Master's Office till it was quite dark, and then Tigh, Herbert, Frogget , Burnford, and my self, and one Bladen, went to King's Coffee-House in White Fryers , to cast up the Deductions made by the Master off the Bill. I cast the Bill up first; one of them said to Mr Bladen , You are a Man of Figures, do you cast it up, and I believe Mr Bladen did; and as the Costs stood on this Deduction, it came to 24l. 15s. I attended that Evening to have the Alligation signed, and we agreed to meet the next Night between 4 and 5 - Stokes staid but a little while at the Office; he did not go to King's Coffee-House - Stokes said to Herbert, I will leave the Taxation to you; I will have no more Concern in it.</p>



               <p>Q What passed at King's Coffee-House ?</p>

               <p>Goulder. After the Costs were cast up, Mr Tigh put his Hand in his Pocket and pulled out a Piece of Paper, which he said was a Draught on the Bank. That the Gentleman who drew that Draught was dead, and the Bank refused to pay it. - I think he said it was about 20l. - He said he was disappointed of Money, and had not Money to pay the Costs, and I think Mr Herbert asked me what Time I would give him? and I asked Mr Frogget, and he said he would give him no more than the Law would allow him. Herbert said, It will be for your Client's Interest to give him four or five Days. In the Walks I said to Herbert, I did not know whether I should sue out an Execution, or bring an Action of Debt upon the Judgment, and then we parted: Tigh, Herbert and Bladen went towards the Temple Hall ; Frogget, Burnford, and my self, went directly up the King's Bench Walks , through Mitre-Court, to the Sun-Tavern in Fleet street, where we drank two Half-pints of Wine; it was past nine o'Clock when we came from King's Coffee-House ; and when we came out of the Tavern Mr Frogget looked on his Watch, and it was then about ten o'Clock. - There was no Talk of a Release then, and it was almost impossible that he should pull out a Release, when so many People were in Company, without somebody's seeing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done on the 14th?</p>

               <p>Goulder . On the 14th of May, as I was going down Chancery-Lane, I met Mr Stokes , who wished me Joy of my Client's having received his Money. Said I, I am very much surprised at it. I wonder he did not tell me. Says he, why he has given a General 
               <persName id="t17430114-18-person243">
                  Release

                  </persName>
            . Herbert, Frogget, Burnford , and myself, met at the Master's Office by Appointment; I am not certain whether Tigh was there or not. I told Herbert, that Stokes said Mr Tigh had got a General 
               <persName id="t17430114-18-person244">
                  Release

            , and Herbert declared he knew nothing of it; and yet this Release is all filled up by him; the very Day of the Month is filled up by him - I had no Discourse with Tigh after that; I always avoided their Company as much as I could; I did not care to go into a Room with them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in the Court of King's-Bench when the Release was first produced?</p>

               <p>Goulder. Yes, I was - Mr Tigh produced it: My Lord Chief Justice asked him where the Release was, and he took it out of his Pocket-Book, and said, Here it is, and it was handed to my Lord. And when the Court said it must be left there, Tigh said, If I leave the Release I have nothing to shew for my Money . Herbert in Court confessed his drawing the Release.</p>

               <p>Herbert. When the Bill was cast up at King's Coffe-House , and handed to Mr Bladen to examine, did not he take 20 Shillings off that was miscast?</p>

               <p>Goulder. No; to the best of my Knowledge Mr Bladen's casting up agreed with ours.</p>

            , I did not publish it, and am no ways concerned in the Forgery: It appears to your Lordship that it was published by Mr Tigh. What I did was in conjunction with Mr Stokes. And if this can be alledged against me as a criminal Fact, I am sure no Gentlemen of the Law can be safe in what they do, if the filling up a Deed should subject them to a criminal Prosecution. I recommend this to your Lordship's Consideration, and submit myself to the Court.</p>


               <p>Eliz. Davenport. I never saw Mr Tigh 'till I went in his Coach from Gravesend to Chatham . I had been to see one Mrs Green in Golden-Square. (I live at Christ's Church, on the other side of the Water, and go a Nurse-keeping and ironing) And as I was returning home, I went to White-Fryers to see for a Boat; and there being ne'er a Boat ready, I went into a Coffee-house for a Glass of Wine. I cannot be positive as to the Day, but it was the middle of May: I saw the Prisoner at the Bar (Tigh) paying down some Money upon the Table, and there was a Man whom they called Shearsmith: I heard him say, For God's sake follow Frogmill, and pay him this Money, for this Law will ruin me. - And I saw that Man go out while I was drinking my Wine.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the Man's Name he was to pay the Money to?</p>

               <p>Davenport. I cannot tell justly; it was something of - Frog : I saw the Man take up 23 Guineas and some Silver. - I am sure the Man's Name that took the Money was something of Smith; but I think it was Shearsmith . - I did not speak to either of them. - I thought I knew one of them by Sight, and that made me take the more Notice of what they were doing; - and when I had drank my Gill, I went away: I think it was about 10 o'Clock. -</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it since you were acquainted that you were to come and give Evidence?</p>

               <p>Davenport . I believe it is six or seven Days.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to hear of it?</p>

               <p>Davenport. I had been to see Mrs Green, and she asked me, Whether I heard any thing of a Forgery? And hearing Mr Tigh's Name, and that he was in Newgate, says I, I do remember a Coachman I went from Gravesend to Chatham with, whose Name was Tigh. - it was in the News; she takes in the News - then I remembered I saw Mr Tigh at such a Time, and that I saw him pay a Sum of Money. - I had a Subpoena to come.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you heard of this in the News, Was it Summer or Winter?</p>

               <p>Davenport. It was since May last. - It was more than a Fortnight. - I believe it is three Weeks. - It may be a Month - or Six Weeks. - About three Weeks ago, I was at Mrs Green's, and told her I saw Mr Tigh pay some Money, and she desired me to go to him in Newgate. When I came to him, he said, Did not I carry you to Chatham? Yes , said I, you did: I was with Mrs Green, and she was telling me of your being here, and desired I would come and do you what Service I could; and he begged , that I would come and speak what I knew of the Affair when he came upon his Trial.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were in the Coffee-house, did you say any thing to him, or he to you?</p>

               <p>Davenport. Our Acquaintance was so slender, I did not care to speak to him.</p>

            . I was down at the Ditch-side on the 13th of May at the Shepherd and Goat; I went in between 10 and 11 at Night, and called for a Pint of Beer: There was that Man Phillips, and one Jacobs sitting at a Table; and Jacobs asked me, whether I would drink with them: I told them, I had called for a Pint of Beer, that it was late, and I should soon go home. I sat down over-against the Fire-place, by the end of the Boxes; and I saw two Gentlemen come in: Said one of them, Mr Frogget. why want you take the Money Mr Tigh has ordered me to pay you? Said Frogget, I will take the Money now, if you will pay it. And the other said, I will pay it now. And he put his Hand in his Pocket, and pulled out a Parcel of Gold and some Silver, and a Piece of stamped Paper: Then he called for that Man ( Phillips ) and one Jacobs, to come and witness it: Then Frogget wrote his Name; then Phillips he wrote his Name: And then the Gentleman asked Jacobs to write his Name; and Jacobs said, he could not write, so he made his Mark: After he had made his Mark, the Gentleman put a couple of Dots, and wrote his Name. - Jacob's Name: and then Mr Frogget took off the Seal, and delivered this Paper to the Gentleman as his Act and Deed.</p>

               <p>Court. Call for Frogget; look at him; Is that the Man?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. That is the Man: I am sure that is the Man . - I have known Phillips and Jacobs a great many Years.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a Man was this Gentleman you speak of?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. A tall, pale Man, pitted with the Small-pox.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he his own Hair, or a Peruke?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. He had a Peruke. - I do not know what Clothes he had on.</p>

               <p>Coun. You were in a Hurry to go home; so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140016"/> being in a Hurry, you staid and saw all this.</p>

               <p>Hulbert. They did not stay above a Quarter of an Hour.</p>

               <p>Coun. You are very particular; you remember the very Dots. Hulbert. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Coun. What sort of a Mark did Jacobs make?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. It was a Cross, and I think there are two Dots on one Side, and two on the other. - Phillips wrote his own Name.</p>

               <p>Coun. Who signed first?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. Frogget signed first, after him Phillips, and then Jacobs made his Mark.</p>

               <p>Coun. Was the Seal Wax or Wafer ?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. It was Wax. - I do not know who put it on. - I keep House in Bell-Alley in Golden-Lane. - I am a Leather-Seller by Trade. - I work for myself. - I never saw Tigh in my Life.</p>

               <p>Coun. Where have you been ever since this Paper was executed? Hulbert. At home.</p>

               <p>Coun. Did not you make an Affidavit of this in the Court of King's-Bench, when it was so much controverted there?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I never was in the Court of King's-Bench in my Life. - They came to me about a Fortnight ago; never before that.</p>

               <p>Coun Who wrote the Name of the Person that was to execute it?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. What Name? Frogget's Name?</p>

               <p>Coun. Yes. Hulbert. Frogget himself.</p>

               <p>Coun. How is it spell'd?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I cannot spell. - I cannot read any Person's Name but my own, if you would give me a thousand Pound.</p>

               <p>Coun. Then how can you say the Name of Jacob's was wrote there, if you cannot read Writing at all?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. Well, if I cannot read Writing, I saw it wrote.</p>

               <p>Coun. Then how can you be sure it was Jacob's Name?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. By seeing him write it.</p>

               <p>Coun. Look on that: See whether it is his Writing.</p>

               <p>Hulbert. If I was to be hanged, I cannot make out any body's Name but my own.</p>

               <p>Coun. You know Jacobs, When did you see him?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I saw Jacobs about a Fortnight ago at my own House.</p>

               <p>Coun. How came you to be so particular as to the Day you met the People?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I remember the Day very well, because the 13th of May was my Wife's Birth-day.</p>

               <p>Coun. How came you to attend so closely to what was done?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. Why, if a Man is sitting at a Table where any thing is doing, he must see what is done, unless he was blind.</p>

               <p>Coun. Did you look over it as they were writing, so as to know what it was.</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I look'd upon it, as I do upon that now, [a Paper in the Hand of a Person near him,] but I cannot read that if you would give me a million of Money.</p>

               <p>Count. How much Money was there paid?</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I think there was about 16 or 18 Guineas, and about 30 Shillings in Silver.</p>

               <p>Frogget. I desire he may be asked whether I wrote my Name at Length, or in Short.</p>

               <p>Hulbert. I cannot tell.</p>

On Tuesday in Christmas Week he had been out to carry home a Coat which he had to mend, and when he returned he was very much in Liquor; as soon as he came up Stairs, said she, What have you done with the Money that was to fetch Mr Gent's Coat home? with that he damn'd her for a Pitch ; then she called him vile Villain; with that he slew at her, and pulled her by her Topping, (the Fore-part of her Head) and they had a Struggle; he cried out immediately , Oh Will! Will! I am a dead Man , for I am stabbed. She had one of my Knives in her Hand, cutting a Piece of Bread. I jumped out of Bed and caught him in my Arms, and he died immediately; but whether he run against the Knife, or whether she thrust it to him, I cannot tell - there was a great deal of Blood: The Wound was just above the Pap of the Right Breast. She had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140018"/> the Knife in her Hand when he entered the Room; this was the Knife. [It was produced in Court; the Blade was about 3 Inches long, and very narrow and sharp at the Point.]</p>

               <p>Q. Did she shove her Arm, or make use of any Violence towards him?</p>



               <p>Sanders. Not at all; there were no Curtains to the Bed, and the Candle was burning, so that I could see very well what passed .</p>

             , Surgeon. At the Coroner's Inquest, Mr King (the Coroner) did insist on the Body's being opened, and the Churchwarden sent for me. I found a Wound penetrating into the Breast; I examined the Thorax , and found the Cavities all filled with Blood ; there was a Wound, as big as that Knife is capable of going into, in one of the Ventricles of the Heart - It was impossible he should survive above 2 or 3 Minutes after the receiving of the Wound.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think the Wound might be given by a Man's running against the Knife, without any Violence from her?</p>


               <p>Snowd. Really I cannot tell what to say to that; it must be left to the Jury; a little Matter would push that Knife in, it is so very sharp: The Wound penetrated the Breast-Bone.</p>

             said then, that the Prisoner had killed her Husband; that she went round the Bed to his Seat (he is a Shoemaker) and took up that Knife and stabbed him with it; I never heard that Circumstance of cutting Bread, or falling on the Knife, till I came before my Lord-Mayor - I would have had three other Witnesses examined by the Coroner, but I could not get it done. I was abused in a very opprobrious manner, and so was the Coroner; there were some noisy Fellows there, who minded drinking and smoaking, more than the Business they had to do - I did not contradict their Evidence, either before my Lord-Mayor, or the Coroner - he gave much the same Evidence then as he does now.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to contradict him, when he gave his Evidence so different from what he declared the 28th Dec?</p>

You must take and send me to Newgate. There was nothing named of cutting Bread that Night the Mischief was done; but Sanders said then, that she got off her Seat, went round the Bed, took up the Knife and stabbed him. I live in the same House; when I was called up Stairs, she had stripped him naked, and laid him on the Bedstead.

               <p>Court to Sanders. You have said now, that the Woman had a Knife in her Hand, and was cutting Bread when this Quarrel happened, some of the Witnesses say, that you said that Night, that she came round your Bed and took up the Knife; was it so in Fact?</p>

               <p>Sanders. They tell me I said so that Night, but I do not remember I said any such thing - She had the Knife in her Hand when he came into the Room, cutting a Ha'pworth of Bread which she had bought just before. As to the other Affair now mentioned, the Case was thus; he had pawned a Pair of Breeches, and came Home vastly in Liquor; she called him Rogue, and he gave her a Slap of the Face with the Back of his Hand, and made her Nose bleed; she took up a Case-Knife, held the Blade in her Hand, and hit him on the Shoulder, and so cut her own Fingers.</p>

I went in search of her, and found her in Kent Street the Monday was se'nnight following: She came quietly with me; and when I came within the Liberty of the City, I secured her. She had get on a white Cambrick-Gown, a Lawn-Cap, Stockings , Shoes, and Garters of my Wife's. She did not leave my Wife a Pair of Shoes to put on.

            . On the 18th of December, as I was going home, in company with Mrs Jackson, at half an Hour after 11 at Night, two Men came out of an Ale-house in the Strand, near Southampton-street , the Prisoner came to the left Side of me, untied my Cloak, took it off my Shoulder, and run away with it. - I saw him do it; he looked me in the Face all the time, but I had not Power to cry out, or make any Resistance, I was so frightened. I am sure the Prisoner is the Person, because there was a Light at the Door, and another in the Entry. The other Man ran away. The Prisoner owned the Robbery the next Morning before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Would you have sworn against me, if you had not carried me back to the Ale-house? -</p>

               <p>Bailey. Yes, I would: I said you was the Man as soon as the Watchman brought you up to me.</p>

               <p>Winisred Jackson. The Prisoner came behind Mrs Bailey: I saw him at her Shoulder, and he pulled her Cloak off in a Minute. I cannot say whether he untied it, but he gave it a Tug, and it was gone: He run away with it. I cried out, Stop Thief; and he was taken. - When he was brought up to her, she said, That is the Man.</p>

               <p>Court. Did not you, or she, doubt of his being the Person, 'till you went to the Ale-house and satisfied yourselves?</p>

               <p>Jackson. I knew him from the very first. I said, as soon as he was brought up, he was the Person; we went into the Plume of-Feathers Ale-house , because he said he had not been there; and the Mistress of the House, the Drawer, and two or three more Persons , said, he had been there, and had been gone out of the House but a few Minutes.</p>

             . On the 18th of December I was in the Strand, and saw the Prisoner running along with a Scarlet-Cloak in his Hand; he turned into Southampton-street : I made a Blow at him with my Stick, but missed him: I run after him and cried out, Stop Thief ; and a Watchman asked , Where is he? And I said, On the Bedford Head-Side. A Chairman had stopped him before the Watchman took him: He had no Cloak upon him when he was taken, so he must certainly have dropped it; he never was out of my Sight till he was taken. The Watchman said, he was a Thief; and the Prisoner told him, he would learn him to take his Character away. Says I to the Watchman, Hold him; I will see whether his Character is good or no. When he was carried to Mrs Bailey , she said she saw him come out of the Alehouse ; and he said, You lye, you Bitch, I have not been in the House To night.</p>

               <p>[His having been in the Ale-house just before was confirmed by the other Witnesses.]</p>

The Chairman delivered him to us, I went into the Strand to find the Gentleman, who cried out stop Thief, and the two Gentlewomen challenged the Prisoner directly, and said he was the Thief; he abused them very much for pretending to take away his Character, and would have charged the Constable with them, for he said he was going about his Master's Business.</p>



               <p>T. Manning. I am a Watchman, and stand next Door to the Bedford-Head ; hearing a Cry of Stop Thief, I took to the middle of the Way, and dogged the Prisoner; I found him two Doors from my Stand, walking, and he was fumbling about his Pocket, and I thought I saw him fumble something out of it, and I believe it was the Cloak, and that he dropped it down one of the Areas.</p>

I saw him take a Stock off his Neck, and put it into his Pocket, and then I heard him say, He has took my Stock, my Clasp, and my Money . - I saw five Persons in all, no more.</p>

Said I, You Villain are you going to rob me? The Man who made the Stop first, had a Stick in his Hand, which came up to his Chin, and he said, If you say a Word more, I will knock out your Brains. I said no more, but took particular Notice of the Man that fronted me, whose Breast was close to mine, and likewise the Prisoner, who was at my Left Hand, and another Person, who was at my Right: They were some Time before they could get the Things out of my Pockets, they were so fast in, and when they had, they walked gently up the Hill; said I, You Villains you have robbed me of such and such Things. Then one of them said, Do you hear the Country Cull ? he says he has lost a Shirt . I went into the Rainbow Coffee-house , staid about two Minutes , and then went to the Brush-maker's opposite to it, and told them I had been robbed, and said I would stay there a little, for I was apt to think they would come that way presently. I had not staid long, before the Prisoner and the Person who first stopped me , and another, who took the Things out of my Pocket, came by; I followed them by the Door of the Three Tuns, they were robbing a Gentleman: I took hold of two of them, and said, Sir, if you will draw your Sword, and keep the third Man from me, I will secure these two ; but the Gentleman went away. The Man who stood in the Front, gave me a violent Blow on the Head, which obliged me to quit one of the Men; I did not tumble, but it was with a great deal of Difficulty that I kept my Legs, and was again in the Middle of 10 or 12 Villains. I said, Gentlemen, I know nothing of you , I desire I may pass ; for I was afraid of my Life; the Prisoner, and two others, stood in the Front of me a second Time: A Man came up, and said, Sir, what have you lost? upon that the Prisoner and another Person run towards Field-Lane, and as they began to run, I run, and cried out, and Mr Clarke, who asked me what I had lost, got up with one of them , and was stabbed an Inch and an half in the Head. I went Home, and did not come out for three Days, I was so much out of Order from the Blow I received . The Wednesday following, just as I came out of Mr. Harris's, on London-Bridge, I saw the Prisoner, the Man who was in the Front, and the other, who was on my Right when I was robbed; I went back-to Mr Harris's, desired him to go with me, we pursued them, and at the Bottom of Fish-street Hill I got up with them, one of them goes by the Name of Black Sam: I struck at his Legs, but could not reach them, but I came up with the Prisoner, and got him into a Fishmonger's Shop. - I am a Carpenter and Surveyor to the Hand-in-Hand Fire Office,</p>

Then he run away, and the Gentleman and I after him; when he came near Field Lane , he said, Damn you I am at Home now. He went into an Alley, and I would not follow him any farther: I went about two Doors down Field-Lane, and was stuck with a Knife in my Head; I believe I bled a Quart of Blood; it was God's Mercy, I did not lose my Life.</p>

I have known the Prisoner 22 Years: I went to School with him. - I was with the Prisoner on Friday before Christmas-Eve: I remember it for a very particular Reason, I am sure: I called at Mr Wish's, the Corner of Hanover-Yard , over-against Great-Russel-Street, in Bloomsbury, facing Tottenham-Court-Road : The Prisoner at the Bar, and another, brought in some Pork-Stakes; and Mr Cummins (the Prisoner) asked me if I would eat a Bit: I sat down and ate a Stake; I had not seen him for four Months; and we drank, I think, to the Tune of six full Pots, and paid Sixpence-Half penny a-piece. We staid there till between eight and nine; and just as I parted from them, by a Barber's Shop in Monmouth-street, I made a little sort of a Slip, and hurt myself, so that I did not go out of my Room till the Holiday-Week: He was not five Minutes out of my Company all the While, except going into the Yard. - I keep a Chandler's Shop in Peter's-street, the Backside of St. Ann's. The Prisoner is a Vintner by Trade, and follows that Business I believe now; he does not keep a House as a Vintner, but goes to Tunbridge, Bath, and other Places, as a Drawer or Waiter: I've heard he was Apprentice in Fleet-street.</p>

On the 18th of October, between twelve and one in the Morning, I was going my Rounds with my Partner; when I came to this Court, I heard a Whispering: I went softly into the Court, imagining something of this Kind was transacting ; to Appearance, at first, I only saw the youngest, whose Name is Deacon, for he was full against the other, and seemed to hug round him; his Breeches were down, and his Shirt appeared: I then thought it was a Man and a Woman, for the youngest was in the same Motion as a Man is when he is embracing a Woman; they were so close, that if I had had the Presence of Mind to put my Hand between them, I could not have done it. I called out, and said, In the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140026"/> Name of God, what are you doing? Who, or what are you? They seemed to jostle before they could get from one another; and, seeing they were two Men, I called out for Assistance : They were both of them with their Breeches down. When my Partner came, I told him they were a Couple of Sodomites, and he laid hold of them: Then I went and called the Watchman, and carried them to the Watch-house. I asked them, what they did there? Blair said, he went to ease Nature. I think, said I, it is in a very odd Way . D - n you, Sir, said he, if I must tell you, I was at S - te . [The Witness went up to the Prisoner to look at him]. I am sure he is the Person, he has a long Beard on now; I suppose that is to disguise himself; he was well dressed and genteel then. As he said he went to ease Nature, I order'd a Watchman to take a Lanthorn to see, and I went myself, and there was no such Thing. I asked him what he had to say for himself? he said, he was a Gentleman, and Master of Languages, and I used him ill: He sent for some People to come to his Character, but no body came; and the other had but an indifferent Character: So I committed one to one Compter, and the other to the other. I carried them before Alderman Calvert, and he examined them separate: I was present at their Examination, and they did not agree in their Accounts; Deacon said he went to piss, and Blair said he went to sh - te. Blair said he never saw Deacon, but Deacon said he saw Blair, and that he went to piss, and said he would piss there; and that Blair said to Deacon, he might, if he would. Blair begged of me, as he was going before the Alderman, that he might speak to me in private: Says he, It is in your Power to ruin me for ever, or to save me: Says I, I will say nothing but what I saw, and that I will upon Oath.</p>



               <p>Blair. What Posture was I in? Was I not easing Nature?</p>

               <p>Pert. He did make a Motion of squatting two or three Times when I first saw him. - He was not sitting down, he was standing up, shuffling to put up his Breeches. - I could see them perfectly by the Lamp, though they got to the darkest Corner of the Court.</p>

               <p>Blair. I will speak as modestly as I can. Ask him whether he saw the Flesh standing to this Abomination.</p>

               <p>Pert. I cannot say any thing to that - I had no Light of my own, there was a sufficient Light of the Lamp - I was within a Quarter of a Yard of them when I called out, and then I drew back.</p>

               <p>Blair. I did not move from the Place where I squatted down, till he took me by the Collar.</p>

               <p>Pert. I did not touch him by the Collar.</p>

               <p>Blair. This one Question will be found material: I do not know whether that honourable Gentleman is upon the Bench that I was before; I told him the same Story, that I was easing Nature , and this Gentleman made the same Objection then as he does now, that he could not see it: I said, Mr Alderman , what I am going to propose is not cleanly or decent, but if you will please to order any Servant to go along with me into some back Place, I will convince them that I put that into my Breeches, by his pulling me away in a Hurry, that I should have left behind me: Ask him whether I did not say so?</p>

               <p>Pert. He did propose that; but he might easily have done that in the Night-time, I should have smelt him in the Watch-House, if any such Thing as that had been then, for he sat close to me a great while. As he was going from the Compter to Guild-Hall , he said he hoped the young Man had not confessed any thing; I told him I should not trouble myself with what he had said, he would hear that when he came there.</p>

            . The 17th of Oct. last was my Watch-Night ; Mr Pert and I watch together, and we usually go two or three Times round the Ward of a Night; as we were going our Rounds, Mr Pert went into the Court behind the Chapter-House; after he had been there some Time, he called out, Hip, Partner; What's the Matter, said I; he said he had caught these two Chaps, so and so; that this young Fellow , Deacon, was next to him, and his Shirt was out of his Breeches, they were so close together that he could not draw his Stick between them; that he stood over them the best Part of a Minute , and then he called out, and asked them what they were about, and they said they came there to ease themselves. I took Blair hold by the Collar, and Deacon by the Arm; Deacon was buttoning his Breeches at that Time; Blair's Breeches were down , and he said, D - n your Soul Mon, let me put up my Breeches; but I would not let him, and brought him half way to the Toy-Shop with his Breeches down; Blair would fain have got away, and if the young Man had endeavoured as much to get away as he did, I believe we could not have held them; he sent to several Persons to his Character, one in particular was his Landlord, a Baker, in St Martin's le Grand , but none came.</p>

               <p>Blair. Did not I say what I was doing of, and that you hindered me from doing a particular Thing?</p>

               <p>Line. You did not then say so, you did afterwards in the Watch-House, and I went with six or seven Watchmen, and we looked all the Way we came, and you said, It is not there, it is on the other Side; but there was nothing - we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140027"/> all going to the Compter then - He did tell the Alderman, the next Day, that I had occasioned him to soil his Breeches - When he came to the Watch-House, he said he had been doing so and so, but he did not say any thing of that when we took him.</p>

            , Watchman. On the 17th of October , as I was going my Rounds, about Ten o'Clock, I saw the Prisoner, Blair, in the Place where he was taken; at half an Hour after 10 he was there, at 11 he was there, and at half an Hour after 11, alone all the Times, and just after the Clock struck 12, as I was calling the Hour, the Constables called out, and I run to their Assistance, and found this Blair with his Breeches about his Heels; Oh, said I, you are the Man I have seen so often to Night; he had a Handkerchief about his Head to tie his Hat and Wig on; says I, I know you by your Handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Blair. It is impossible for me to disprove this now; but as sure as God is in Heaven, I was not on this Side of St Clement's Church at half an Hour after Ten.</p>

               <p>My Lord, that Sunday in the Afternoon, I went to the other End of the Town, to wait on some Gentlemen, and was in Company with several of them from between Three and Four till nigh Eight at Night, and after that had been in two or three Companies between Eight and Nine; I was thinking of coming Home, and it was a pretty heavy Rain then, which obliged me to stay longer than I did design, and I went into a House in the Strand, called the Moor-Cock, to drink a Tankard of Beer in that Time; with drinking Beer after other Liquors, Wine and Punch, it gave me a Looseness, which has occasioned all this Trouble and Ignominy, and I was obliged to go into a Lane in the Strand to ease myself; as for the Watchman's saying I was there at Ten, he is mistaken above an Hour; when I came by St Bride's Church it rained again; I went into the Sugar-Loaf, and it was past Eleven before I got out of that House; I had a Friend with me, who would have kept me longer; said I, It is Sunday Night , and my Landlord is an honest, sober Man, and I keep him from Prayers; and if there is a God Above, I speak sincerely; and it is in the Presence of my great God, who sees me, I declare I had no more Thought of committing that accursed Abomination, than I have of blowing up this House; and as to that Man, I did not speak to him, and I do not know, as I hope for Mercy from God, whether he is a Man or not: I was obliged to squat down in that Place , and had done it two Times by the Way before. Besides, I solemnly declare, that if I was one of the greatest Villains, or most profligate Wretches upon Earth , and had any Inclination that Way , I could not have committed that Abomination, I was so much in Liquor; Do not you think I was too much in Liquor to have committed that Ahomination?</p>

               <p>Mr. Pert. He was in high Spirits, not any ways drunk; he talked very well .</p>

               <p>Blair. This Imprisonment has almost cost me my Life; I have almost lost my Limbs, my Legs are swelled, and my Feet almost numbed and dead; so that if I was to lie as much longer I should be dead; as to being disguised, I have lost my Clothes and Linnen, or I would not have presumed to have waited on your Lordshipin this Pickle.</p>

               <p>Deacon. I went that Night as far as the Cross-Keys on Snow-Hill; the Gates were shut up, so I made the best of my way Home again; and coming through this Place, I stopped to make Water, and a Person came close to me, and said, By my Leave he must sh - t by me, and while he was there, I heard somebody coming very softly; somebody cried out , What are you doing here? I said, No Ill: Said he presently, What, you are two Buggerers here , I suppose. Said I, There is no such Thing; and presently there came another Person; I was so surprized, that I could not tell who laid hold of me - but they laid hold of me, and said I should go to the Watch-house, and I went very willingly.</p>

On Sunday, January 2. between 10 and 11 in the Evening, I was coming from Temple-Bar, and I saw the Prosecutor upon his Back, and the Prisoner, whom I very well remember, had hold of this Cane by one End, and Mr. Emmerton had hold of the other as he lay upon the Ground, and the Prisoner was pulling it from him with great Violence, but Mr Emmerton held it as fast as he could, the Prisoner dragged him some Way upon his Back, in order to get it from him, and before I got near enough to lay hold of him he had jerked it out of his Hand, and was turning about to make off with it, but before he could get into a Run I was close enough to collar him, which I did, and charged him with robbing the Gentleman: Says I, You Villain you have robbed the Man: What I? says he, and clapp'd the Cane behind him, as I believe, with an Intention to drop it; but I took hold of the Cane, and then he held it pretty fast, and it was with some Difficulty that I wrenched it from him; then I took him by the Collar and insisted on securing him; presently a Woman came up and asked, What I did with him? and an ill looking Fellow or two came up, and behaved in such a Manner that I thought I was in danger of of having him rescued; and having an Oak Stick in my Hand, I was forced to make use of it in a resolute Manner, or he would have been rescued from me; when I got him to the Sign of the Cock I shewed him into the Entry and secured him. - I am sure the Prisoner is the Man, he was never out of my Hand till I got him into the Alehouse. - This is the Cane I took from the Prisoner, and what I believe he took from Mr Emmerton ; I have had it in my Custody ever since.</p>

               <p>Emmerton . This is my Cane, which was taken from me.</p>

               <p>Mr York. I asked him at the Cock, What made him do it? he said, He did not do it. - he said in general, I did not do it; I did not do it; but I am sure he is the Man; I was afraid of the Gang that was there, I am sure they were very bad People by their Expressions.</p>

I thought she had a Guinea in her Mouth, but I can't be sure of that; one Guinea and nine Shillings were found upon the Bed. - The other two Guineas I can give no Account of.</p>

            . On Thursday last I was calling the Hour at four o'Clock, and a Man came out and called, Watch! He desired me to come in, and said there was a Robbery committed - He said, there was a Man and a Woman in Bed: that they had not been long there before the Man missed his Money: I saw eight Shillings in Silver, and a Guinea, upon the Bed, and one Shilling upon the Floor, and one Guinea was found in her Stocking; she had her Finger in her Mouth, but whether she swallowed the other two I cannot tell.</p>

            . I have known Cavenagh and his Wife about 7 Years, and Kelly and his Wife about 2 Years; I lived with Cavenagh on and off about 6 Years, he is a Smith, and in order to make himself be thought an industrious, hard-working Man, he often got up at 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Morning to go to work, and about 8 o'Clock he came to Breakfast, and then he made Shillings out of Halfpence, and Sixpences out of Farthings; he files them and she rubs them upon a Leather, with Brickdust, to take out the Scratches of the File, and then he bends them, and rubs them over with a Paste, made of Burnt-Silver, Cream of Tartar and Aqua Fortis ; the Aqua Fortis dissolves the Silver, and then with the Cream of Tartar they make it into a Paste, that changes the Colour at once, and makes them look white [the Experiment was shewn in Court] we make use of common Salt to clean before we colour them. - Kelly is sometimes a Labourer, sometimes a Haymaker, and sometimes a Coiner. - I did not coin, but I have been concerned in defacing the King's Coin - I was sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell the 16th of December, and on the 8th and 9th of December I saw Kelly and his Wife, and Cavenagh and his Wife, make Halfpence into Shillings, and Farthings into Sixpences, I can swear to twenty that they were at Work upon in those two Days; they worked at his Brother Kelly's House, I lodged there at that Time - When they were made, the two Women used to go and put them off among the Country Folk of a Morning.</p>

               <p>King's Council. Do you know any of the Coin when you see it?</p>

               <p>Graham. I believe I do [there were two of the Farthings produced] there is a great deal of Difference between the two; I believe this is Kelly's - it is not so clean made as Cavenagh's Cavenagh has practised it a great deal longer than Kelly - Cavenagh used to call him a dunderhead Fellow, because he did not make so good Work; I take the worst to be Kelly's for that Reason - I believe this is Cavenagh's [the Box of Paste, and the Tools , (two Files, and a Pair of Pinchers) were produced] I have known this Box these two Years, it was Cavenagh's - these are the same Tools they all worked with, they were Cavenagh's - Kelly lived in Church-Lane, in St Giles's, and Cavenagh lived next Door to the Horse and Groom, in Cross-Lane - I can swear to this Leather, because I cut a Piece off the Corner, to put between the Vice and the Halfpence and Farthings - Sometimes one coloured, and sometimes another; the Men generally filed, and the Women smoothed them, because they had not Strength to file them - Cavenagh has done it these 5 Years, and Kelly about 2 Years - I can swear to these two Sixpences - Graham and Laycock were concern'd with them.</p>

               <p>Pris. Counc. What is the Reason that Cavenagh<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140031"/> chose to make these at Eight o'Clock in the Morning, when it was Day-light, whereas he might have done it at Three in the Morning, when he would have been more private?</p>

               <p>Graham. I shall come to your Question presently, if you please to let me; for you are enough to drown 20 People: I told you he did it to make People believe he was a hard working Man. - I do not know that I ever saw him work at making these at eight o'Clock in the Morning. - I did not impeach first, Cavenagh's Wife impeached before me, - I was sent to Bridewell for a common Assault upon a Quarrel. - I was in Prison 12 Months in the Year 1738, for uttering false Coin. - I heard that Cavenagh's Wife was to give in an Information against me; and finding she had not done it, I took Care to do it before her: So I sent to Mr North , and made my Information.</p>

               <p>Cavenagh. How can all four be at Work at one Time, with two Files and one Pair of Pinchers?</p>

               <p>Graham. I will tell you; one filing, another smoothing, another pulling down, (that is, filing down the Edges of them to the Letters) another polishing of them, and a fifth may be employed in bending of them.</p>

               <p>Honor Cavenagh . How came you by those Files?</p>

               <p>Graham. Why, they are yours, my Child. - I know them, because I have worked very often with them.</p>

               <p>It was the Opinion of the Court, that every Act of Parliament ought to be taken according to the Intent of it; and that the Act mentions Halfpence and Farthings; and that there is no other Brass-Money within the Intention of the Act of Parliament.</p>

I said, Yes: Said he, I know you very well: So we went together. There was a great Style in Tyburn-Field , and he asked me to hand my Bundle over for me: I said, No, I thank you, I can get over with it very well : Please to go along; so he did; and at the Style at the other End of the Field, he offered the same, which I refused. When I came to the Black-Lion at Bay's Water . I met with a young Man, who was going with a young Woman, whom he was going to delude away, but another young Man came and took her from him, and carried her home to her Friends; and the Prisoner said, that Man deserved the worst of Punishments, to delude such a Child away. When we came to the Bridge where the Black and the Soldier hang in Chains, there was a great Style, the Prisoner was foremost, and he wanted me to go over the Style first; and there being a great Ditch of Water on the other Side, and the Wind pretty high, I was afraid to get over first; I said, Pray get over first; he would not: Said he, Do you get over first, and damn'd me for a Bitch. When he found I would not get over, he hit me on the Side of the Head with a knobbed Stick which he had, and took me in his Arms and holl'd (threw) me into the Bush-Hedge, which was very prickly: He said, he wanted to ravish me, and swore he would. I begg'd him, for God's Sake not to do it, and asked him why he should do such a Thing to a poor honest Girl, as I was, who never did him any Harm, or wished any. I struggled with him a great While , and then was forced to kneel in the Dirt in order to get up; and I pray'd to God to turn his Heart: Then he damn'd my Blood, and said, if I made any Noise he would kill me. I got off my Knees, and then he holl'd me on the Bush on the other Side; then he came to me again, but he had not so much Power over me as he had on the other Side. Then he took me in his Arms again, and holl'd me on the Bush-Hedge on the Side I had been before; then he threw me on my Back, and damn'd my Soul, and bid me lie there till he had done what he pleased with me. I prayed to God Almighty to be my Assistance, to get me out of such a Rogue's Hand. I gave him all the good Words that ever I could, and yet he all the While damn'd my Blood and Soul, and swore that he would kill me: Then he put his Hand up my Coats, and holl'd my Clothes over my Head , and pull'd out what he had: I wrung my Hands and was frightened, and prayed to God for Assistance, that such a Rogue should not have his Will of me: He swore he would ravish me, or have my Life. I fought with him a good While upon my Back, and was almost too strong for him; then he kneeled upon my Stomach, and pulled a Knife out of his Pocket, and put it to my Throat, and swore if I spoke, or stirred, or made any Noise, till he had done what he pleased with me, he would cut my Throat. And<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140035"/> I, Do you think I will lie in this Manner, and in Danger of my Life, and not make a Noise? Yes, I will for somebody to be my Assistant . He put his Hand upon my Mouth , and said, G - d d - n your Blood, you Bitch, will you speak? I will have your Life, or ravish you. I said, I will make a Noise and hollow as long as I have a Bit of Breath in me. So he put his Knife up again, and said, G - d d - n your Blood, you Bitch, as you serable with me so, and pray to God, I will take your Bundle away from you. With that he took my Bundle away from me, and run away with it to the Bottom of the great Grass Field, and damned me, and bid me come after him to fetch my Clothes; No, said I, do you think I will follow you into that bye Field to fetch my Bundle, I am very glad I can get off so ; said I, I know you very well. So I made the best of my way Home, I do not know which way I got over the Stile, and when I came to my Friends , my Hair was all torn off my Head, and my Face bloody and dirty. When I went in, I had my Petticoat under my Arm, it was torn off in scrabbling with him in the Bushes; here is the Apron I had on, it was made bloody with my Arm's being torn in the Bushes; when I got to my Unkle's, they were quite galletted to see me, and when I sat down I swooned away:

They say I went out at the Back-Door, I was obliged to do it; for there was a Warrant out against me, and I could not stay within Doors, it was not upon the Account of the Bundle; I said to Miles, Do you think I would offer to take her Bundle from her, as she knew me, and I know her? and he cursed and swore, and said, Yes , I would; and they said they would hang me.</p>

            . On the 8th of Dec. about 11 o'Clock in the Day, the Prisoner and one Caushet came to my House, and told me they had two Pieces of Brass to sell, and if I would buy them, they would fetch them. Stevens staid in the Shop, and Causbee went to fetch them. While he was gone, I enquir'd where he lived; he said, in Wood's-Close, and Causbee in Clerkenwell-Green: They asked me 6 d. a Pound. I told them it was coarse Brass, and I bought them at a Groat a Pound: There were 52 Pounds; it came to 17 s. 4 d. and I paid the Money to Causbee, and that Afternoon I sent the smallest to Mr Newton, to know what he would give a Pound, and he sent me Sixpence per Pound. I sent the other, and Mr Newton said, that such Things were lost; that he supposed they belonged to Mr Bishop, for he had advertised them. Mr Newton acquainted Mr Bishop with it. I went to Mr Bishop's House, and he desired me to produce the Persons that brought them. I told him I would use my Endeavours; and without much Difficulty I found the Prisoner; he told me the right Place where he lived, I informed Mr Bishop of it, and he got a Warrant backed, and took him on the 28th of January, and on New-year's-day I saw Causbee go by my Door, and apprehended him.</p>

No, said I, Madam, I have bought them, and so I gave her the Money, and she gave it to the Man who brought the Basket; and when I came to Tutik-Street , the Man went away, so that I saw no more of him; said she, I will carry you to Mr How's in Pye-Street , whom I lived with, and he will satisfy you as to my Character: Mr How was not at home, but Mrs How came and gave her a good Character; and when Mr How came in, he said, he believed she was a very honest Woman; but still she did not care to let me know where she lived; she said, that she owed her Landlord some Money, and must not let him know she had received any; I told her, I would be satisfied; then she spoke to Mrs How, and they went into a Room together, and while I was talking with one Mrs. Waters about it, (that I would secure her if she did not make it out, that they were her Property ) she was gone; said I, Where is Mrs White? they said, She was gone to the Little-house; and so she made her Escape though those People heard me threaten her with a Constable: In 2 or 3 Days there were some Hand-Bills delivered among the Booksellers, to acquaint them, that such Books were stole: These are the Books I bought of her, they are very remarkable; when Mr Thompson came to me, I went to Col.
