She had not been gone three Minutes but I miss'd a Quart Silver Tankard, which stood on a Table Bedstead in the Place where she was sitting. She had laid her Cloak and Stick down by it, and I am positive that I saw it while she was there. The Prisoner had enquired the Way to Charing-Cross, and my Wife directed her to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150003"/> through the Temple; so I pursued her up Glass-house-Alley, but could not overtake her: I then advertis'd it, and on the Monday Night following, Mr Gosling came and told me had bought it of such a Person as I had described.

I met her in the Street the Tuesday following, and took her. She said when I stopped her, that she was not the Woman, and that she knew not the House.</p>

            . On Sunday Morning, the last Day of August, the Watchman (Falconer) brought the Prisoner to me, and charged me with him. I desired him to confess who was with him, when he took the Lead. He said that one Brown, and one Ford, took the Lead from the Alms-houses, rolled it up, and carried it behind the School; that one of them gave him this Lead, and bid him go forward with it. I carried the Prisoner to the Gate-house, and went to look for the other 2 Men; but we never could take them: There had been Lead stole from the Alms-houses, and some of this Lead match'd with the Place; but he never would tell us where the other came from.</p>

               <p>Charles Steward. On Michaelmas Day, between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, I was sitting in my Kitchen, and heard the Hatch make a Noise; I went to the Door, and saw the Prisoner turning up the Street, with something in his Apron; I stepped into the Parlour, to see if I had lost any thing, and came out again immediately, and ran after the Prisoner: Coming into the next Street, I got Sight of him; he turned under a Gateway, and some Neighbours went before him, stopped him, and found the Cloaths upon him. When I came up to him, I asked him, how he came by them; he said, a Gentleman had given them to him to scower; but there was no body at all on that Side of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150004"/> Way, between him and me. Before the Justice he was search'd, and the Castor found upon him.</p>

I felt it go, and I immediately cry'd out; the Villain has stole my Watch; I had a Friend with me, who pursued the Prisoner up Cannon-Alley, into Queen's Head-Alley; he fell down, we seized him, and saw the Watch lying within a Yard of him. I am sure the Prisoner is the Man; he never was out of my Sight 'till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether he was sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Swift . I was; that declares itself, otherwise I could not have missed the Watch so soon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, if he did not say, he could not tell which of the Men took his Watch?</p>
               <p>Swift . No, I always said he was the Person; I saw his Hand go down to my Pocket, and when he drew it out, I felt him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. By what Circumstances is he sure that I am the Man?</p>

            . I was with the Prosecutor when this happened, and saw the 2 Men come along; I gave Way to them: The Prisoner ran against Swift, and he immediately said, the Villain is gone with my Watch; I followed him through an Alley, and half Way up another, he fell over two or three Steps, and then I laid hold on him; he cry'd out he was robbed of his Hat and Wig, which were lost in the Fall; the Watch was found lying not a Yard and half from the Prisoner. I am sure the Man that came up to the Prosecutor is the same Person I took; for there was nobody between him and me all the Pursuit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether it is probable that I could throw the Watch away, when he followed me so close?</p>
               <p>Thompson. By the Force of the Fall, the Watch might fly out of his Hand.</p>

I was standing at the End of White-Horse-Yard, and saw the Woman run out of Clare-Court, toward Wych-Street, and the Man after her; he called Watch, I immediately pursued her, and took her, and when the Prosecutor came up, he charged me with her; She is the same Woman that I saw the Prosecutor pursue, and a good Pair of Heels she has; I believe she would make shift to run 20 Miles before I could run 15.

I fetch'd a Constable, and carried her before Justice Poulson , and then she owned where they were. We found 2 Sheets at Mrs Hall's, and a Blanket at Mr Eyre's , according to her Directions.

I went out in the Morning, the 1st of September, and left him a-bed; and when I came home, my Trunk was broke open, and my Money gone. The Prisoner was taken the 26th, and confessed the Fact before Justice Frazier, but would not sign any Confession. I saw it in the Trunk, and told it before I went out that Morning.</p>

When she had taken it, she went down Stairs, but none of the People of the House offered to stop her. After I had taken her, and she was in Prison, I went to her to get my Watch, some of her Friends came to me, and said, if I would sign a Note of 10 l. they would tell me where I might find it; this done, they told me it was wrapped up in a Piece of white Paper, in the Cellar. I should not have prosecuted, but that I found afterwards that I was bound in a Recognizance of 40 l.</p>

               <p>Blundell. I did tell her, I would not appear against her, if she would tell me where it was: there was no Indecency passed between us, and I had very little Conversation with her, for I had not been with her above five Minutes, before she took my Watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Man in all my Life, till he came to the Goal, and offered me 5l. to tell him of any Body that had got his Watch; I have had my Friends here these 4 or 5 Days, but they are gone now. <rs id="t17401015-13-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Peter Rode. On the 16th of September, I went to Bed, and cross-barr'd the Door. I got up again at 3 o'clock, and found 2 Bundles pack'd up ready to be carried off: I call'd my Wife, and opened the Bundles; the Goods which were in them are mine. I directly called Mr. Shumaker; we looked about, and could find nobody; at last we went to the little House, and saw that the little Seat had been broken; we opened the Boards with a Pick-Axe, and found the Prisoner hid in the Vault; with much ado we got her out: she said she came with 2 Men and a Boy, that they opened the Window and put the Boy in, and gave him Directions to open the Door, and that our Men getting up at 3 o'clock, disturbed them.</p>

             . Mr Rode came that Morning to me, and said, he was near being robb'd; I went with him, and he shew'd me some Things; and a piece of Beef ty'd up with them, and several other Things: He told me the Vault had been broke open; we went down, and found the little Seat broke; I put my Head in, and could see nothing; but it smelt very strong. I went Home again, and between 8 and 9 Mr. Mason came to my House; I returned with him, and examined the Bundle again, which lay ready to be taken away. We got a Pick-Axe, opened the Vault, and saw the Prisoner stir, and then one would not take her out, and another would not; so I pull'd her out , and got her some Water. To bring her to herself , we gave her some Brandy, cut off her Cloaths , and put her into a Sack to clean her. She then owned, that there were 2 Men and a Boy, whom she knew not, with her, that they put the Boy in at the Window, and gave him Directions to open the Door to them.</p>
               <p>Mr Mason. I went with Shumaker into the Kitchen, and saw these Things ty'd up ready to be gone; there was a piece of Beef in one Parcel, and Bread, Butter, Cheese, and all Manner of Things, and Candles with them. I went into the little House, and looked down with a candle, but saw nothing; I got a Pick-Axe, and opened it, and then we saw a Body; we pulled it out, and laid it on the gravel Walk; it seemed to be without Life or Motion; we got some pails of Water, and threw on it, when it moved, and we then perceived it to be a Woman: we got some Brandy for her, but we were obliged to force her Mouth open to make her take it, and then she came to herself. Some Neighbours came in, and cleaned her, and brought her to her Speech. The Prisoner had lived with me as a Servant about six Weeks, when I lived in this House. I left it in July, and have never spoken to her from that Time to this. She confessed before Justice Dennet, that 2 Men and a Boy were with her, that the Servants coming down at 3 o'clock surprized them, and the Men made out at the Door, and she went backwards; whence not being able to escape, she chose rather to perish in the Vault than be taken.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150009"/>The Counsel for the Prosecution set forth, that the Prisoner was a Member of that Set of Men, who go under the Denomination of Gamblers; the most dangerous Community to the Publick; that in the Schemes they lay to trap their Neighbours, Providence takes care they shall be ensnar'd themselves, and fall into that Pit which they dig for others; and that the Prisoner had now brought himself into the Commission of a Felony, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>William Silver was called and sworn.</p>
               <p>Couns. Go to the Bar, and see if you know that Man.</p>
               <p>Silver. That is the Man: He met me by Milford-Lane, and gave me a Bobb on the Shoulder; I turn'd to see who it was, O, says he, I beg your Pardon. I thought it had been somebody else; but I can hardly believe my Eyes: Pray, What Countryman are you? I told him I was Berkshire; Why, says he, I came from High-Wicomb myself: Pray, Who do you know there? Said I, I know Mr.

            , said he, I know him very well, he was the last Person I drank with, may , the last Person I spoke to: What Part of Berkshire? I came (said I) from Walgrove ; Did you, said he? I want to send a Letter to a Person in your Parish, who had a Debt owing him from one in Town who paid him but 2 s. and 6 d. in the Pound, and is now in such Circumstances, that I believe I can get him the remainder; and if you will carry it, I will give you half a Pint of Wine; so we went into the Feathers-Tavern, he asked me if I would not smoak half a Pipe with him, I said, I did not care if I did; and as we were lighting our Pipes, he stooped down, and took up a Paper; he then said somebody had had very bad Luck, and wished the Owner had it; Don't carry it away, said I, but leave it at the Bar; then, said he, I'll pawn it for a Pint of Wine. In a little Time another Man came, and peeped in at the Door: the Prisoner asked him what he meant by coming into a private Room; I ask Pardon, said he, but I had the Misfortune to drop a Paper here just now; What is it, says the Prisoner? It is a Receipt for 200 l. Why, says the Prisoner, I was just going to mortgage it at the Bar for a Pint of Wine; the other Man immediately threw down a Shilling for it, and was going away, but the Prisoner stopped him, and said, he should take Part of the Wine; on his Persuasion he sat down. He said he had been at a Cock Match, that the Landlord of the House told him one particular Cock was better than such a one, and persuaded him to lay a Wager on it's Head, which he did, and lost; but the Landlord was his Friend, and laid down the Money for him. Before we had drank the Wine out, the Stranger turned himself about, and took a pack of Cards out of the Window, and he and the Prisoner sell to shewing Tricks with them; the other Man pulled a Card out of the middle, and said, Now I will tell you what that Card is before I see it, and I'll lay you a 100 l. that I tell any Card in the Pack; the Prisoner thereupon fetched 20 l. and told it down on the Table, and called me out, and desired me to lend him some Money to make his up; There will be no Damage, (said he) only tender it down, and keep it in your own Hand; for I may as well win the Fool's Money as another. I told him I had not above a Shilling in my Pocket; he asked me if I could not borrow some to lend him, I told him, No; but he over-persuaded me, and I went to one Davis's, where I got 25 l. 12 s. and 6 d. and to Mr Ford's, and had 30 l. Coming back he desired me to go in at Bishop's, at the Fleece below St Paul's, that we might tell the Money, and see how much was wanting to make it up 80 l. There were 10 l. wanting, which he said he could borrow of a Friend just by; he put his Money into my Bag with that which I had borrowed, and I put it on the Table by me. I happened to turn my Head, and in that Time he changed my Bag for another like it, and left me under pretence of going to get the Remainder of the Money. I waited some Time, and he not returning, I examined the Bag, and found in it only Half-a-crown's-worth of Halfpence, and some pieces of Lead.</p>
               <p>Couns. Who was to have the Bag, before the Wager was laid?</p>
               <p>Silver. I was to keep the Money, and had it in my possession till it was taken away. When he had put his Money into my Bag, I put it on the Table before me, and I am sure there was nobody else in the Room, but the Maid, who brought in a Pint of Beer.</p>
               <p>Couns. What became of the Stranger?</p>
               <p>Silver. We left him at the Feathers, while we went for the Money. I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was you to have any Part of this Wager?</p>
               <p>Silver. No: The Wager was between the Prisoner and the Stranger, I had nothing at all to do with it.</p>
               <p>Couns. On your Oath, Was your Money ever in the Prisoner's Custody?</p>
               <p>Silver. Not, till it was taken away by him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. How came you to borrow Money for a Person you knew nothing of? Suppose the Stranger had won, Who was to have had the Money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150010"/>Silver . The Prisoner said it was impossible he should; but if it had happened otherwise, he ought to have made it good.</p>
               <p>Couns. What was the Prisoner's Money, Gold or Silver?</p>
               <p>Silver. There was some Gold, and some Silver, but I can't say what Pieces they were. His Money and mine were mixed, and told together.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the Prisoner, here made an Objection in Point of Law. That as the Money was borrowed to serve the Prisoner, and as the Prosecutor depended upon him for the Re-payment of it, this Fact could not be deem'd Felony.</p>
               <p>In Answer to which it was urged, by the Counsel for the Prosecution; That this was one of the worst Sort of Felonies, and a Case in which the Publick are greatly concern'd: That this Money never having been lent to the Prisoner, nor was to have been entrusted in his custody, it must be deem'd a felonious taking. That a Person having taken a Ring off his Finger, at the Request of another, for him to see it, his going off with it had been adjudged Felony.</p>

I asked the Prisoner whether she had been in the Parlour, she said only to sweep and dust it, and that she saw the Bureau open. I told her, I had lost Money; but she said, she knew nothing of it, and persisted in a Denial of it, till the 20th, and then she own'd that she had taken the Money, and had filled the Bag with Stones, and thrown it down the Vault, where it was afterwards found by one of my Servants. After the Little-house had been search'd, and nothing but the Bag found, she confessed that there were 3 different Pieces of Gold; but she could not tell the Value of any of them but Guineas, and that she had hid it in a little Place I have in my House; but would not shew us whereabouts it was hid, though I had her up into the Place.</p>

             . Mrs Hewitt sent for me on the 18th of September, in the Morning, and desired me to see if her Money was right. I went to take the Money, but both that, and the Bag were gone. In the Evening of the same Day, going to the Little-house, I saw there were Women in it, and heard them say, hold the Door fast; in a short Time after this, I got a candle, and look'd down the Vault, and I saw a Place , where I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150013"/> something had been thrown in, I searched it, and pulled out this Bag full of Stones. On the Sunday Evening following, being in the Kitchen, I asked the Prisoner about the Money, she told me that she first threw in the Bag, and afterwards dug a Hole and hid the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Why did not you charge the Women, who were in the Vault, with this Fact?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. They had no Business in the Room, from whence the Money was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Were there not some odd Methods made use of to discover the Thief?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. I did cover a Table with Soot, and made all the Maids come in, and lay their Hands on it, and told them, that the guilty Person would be black'd; but all their Hands were footed. I imagined that the Person that was guilty should pass by without touching the Table, for fear of being blacked. This was done without Mrs Hewitt's Knowledge.</p>

             . The two Prisoners and I, one Night about five Weeks ago, were in King street and saw this coat hanging on a chair , through the Window; we attempted to open the Door once or twice, but there was a Woman in a Back Room, who prevented us; at last we did get it open, Beale went in, took the coat, and brought it out; Bristow stood at the Door, and took it out of his Hand. We went with Intent to get some Hats, but could not. I was just come from Work, and met Beale, in Wardour-street , and knew that they intended to go out. When Beale went into the Shop, I was on the other Side of the court; it is a new court, and this House is the corner. We carried the coat that Night to Bristow's House, and they said, that in the Morning they sold it to Mrs Chandler for Half-a-crown. Beale is a Shoemaker, the other is a Carman; I have been with them before on these Occasions.</p>

             . On Monday Morning, the Prisoner and another brought 3 Pumps to my House, in Thames-street, to sell; 2 Porters had them in Baskets on their Backs, they sent the Porters to the Alehouse, and then I suspected that they were stolen. I asked them how they came by them, and told them I must stop the Goods; they said they would fetch somebody to their character, and went away. I went immediately for a Constable, but he not being at home, I went to a Ware-house by the Water-side, and these Men, and 2 others with them, came to me there; but when they heard that I had been for a Constable, one of them escap'd, and the Prisoner we lock'd in and secur'd. When we were before the Alderman at Guildhall, the Prisoner had 2 Hours allowed him to send for his Friends, but to no purpose. There were the Dates of the Year on all of them, one was mark'd 1729, R.F. another 1738, and the other 1689, W.S.I. The Prisoner said, that his Brother had them from another Brother at Gravesend; but if they had been honestly come by, they would not have been brought in Baskets; besides the Person who own'd them, could not think of taking up a Pump which was put down in the Year 38.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Ask him, if he did not order his Sister to buy a Hundred weight of Lead of my Brother?</p>
               <p>Machen . I do allow my Sister to buy Lead in the Shop, but not knowing it to be stole.</p>
               <p>Richard Seller. One of these Pumps is mine, I lost it out of my Yard on Saturday Night, or Sunday Morning; it is mark'd 1689, W.S.I. I saw the Prisoner about the House at 10 o'clock that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Billingsgate, and met this other Man, and the 2 Porters; he asked me to go with him to sell some Lead, and said, he had it from Gravesend, but he is run away. I knew nothing of it's being stole.</p>

I paid her Half a Guinea for the use of it; and was to take them away, when I came up again. Before I went, I fastened the Door with 3 Locks, left all my things safe, and desired her to take care of them; but when I return'd, I found one of my Boxes broke, and my Goods gone. The Doors of the Room were not broke, but, there had been 2 or 3 Boards taken out of the Wainscott between her Room and mine. I had lost so many Things, that I did not know what to do, but the People advised me to get a Warrant to search the House: I did so, and found some of them; my Petticoat, and a Piece of my Gown the Prisoner had on, and she said before the Justice, that they were her own. I lost Cloggs, Shoes, Sleeves, Caps , and many other Things.</p>
               <p>Constable . I searched the Prisoner's House, and found these Things up one pair of Stairs, in the Room where she lay; the Wainscot was a little crack'd, but I did not take much notice of it.</p>

               <p>John Stanborough. On Wednesday the 17th of September, I was at work in the Strand , my Wife came to bring my Dinner, and staid all the Afternoon with me. We went home at 7 o'clock in the Evening, and found the Door open : my Wife ran to the Drawers , and said John ! I have lost my Gown! I went all about, and could hear nothing of it, till a little Girl told me , that she had seen the Prisoner on the Stairs, and that she had given her a Halfpenny to go to her Lodging, and enquire, if her child had not been left there. I immediately went to her Lodging, and taxed her with it; she at first deny'd that she knew any thing of it; but afterwards she own'd that it was pawn'd to Mr Glover, in Sharp's Alley, for 3 s. 6 d. there I found it, and knew it to be mine.</p>

             . I was going to carry my Husband part of a Neck of Mutton , and the Prisoner came up Stairs, to beg a Mess of Broth, but I bid her get down Stairs, and would not give her any. I never had no Conversation with her, and - Lord bless me, - this child said she had been on the stairs, and had sent her on an Errand to her Lodging. I went to see after her, and found her with a Full-pot of Beer before her; she said that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150016"/> she knew nothing of my Gown : but we had her before Mr Justice Pralson , and there she owned that she had taken it for want of Bread.</p>

I immediately went to him, and desired him to let me have it, but he swore that he knew nothing of it; he came Home with me, and my Men would strip themselves to be searched, but the Prisoner refused to do so, and went away.

He went home with Mr Potter, and came back again presently, and the next Morning I found the Bottom of a Box by the Prisoner's Bed side; when he saw it, he swore he thought it had been Brass, when he took it; he would have broken it to pieces, but his Sister pulled up some Stones by the Fire-side, and hid it. She afterwards gave me some Bits, and desired me to ask, whether they were Gold or Brass, and I am sure they were the same that she hid.</p>
               <p>Mr Davis. I bought some Gold of a person, who said he lived in Shoe-Lane, and the next Morning Mr Potter's Man came to me, and said, his Master had lost a Gold Repeating Box. I knew this to be a piece of a Gold Box, so I gave it to Potter, and left Orders with my Wife, to send for him, if any Body should come with Gold. One Juniper came with it, and not the Prisoner; Mr Potter took him up, but he was afterwards discharged.</p>

               <p>Jane Simpson. I went out of Town, and left my Things safe at my Lodging, and when I came home, I saw my Gown and Stays lying on my Trunk. I sent the Prisoner into my Room, to turn down the Bed, and she came out seemingly very much frighted, and said, that she had seen a Man go out at the Window. I went down Stairs, and told the People, that I believed I was robbed, and they said it was impossible any Man could get out there. I went up again, and looked into my Trunk, and missed other Things; so I had the Prisoner taken on Suspicion, and she confessed the taking them. She lodg'd in the same Room with me, and had been there Half a Year before I came.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown, Constable. The Prisoner brought a Pair of Stays to me to pawn, on the 2d of October, and a Gown the 3d. Mrs Simpson came to my House and own'd them. I afterwards took the Prisoner, and she own'd that she had taken them, and had given the other Things to a Woman to sell for her.</p>
               <p>Mrs Simpson. These Things were taken off my Trunk, and were the first I missed, after she had said there was a Man gone out of the Window. <rs id="t17401015-42-verdict221" type="verdictDescription">

The next Day, considering it was Water Day, and that the Water's running would overflow the Yard, I went down about 5 o'clock in the Evening to plug it up: As soon as I had done it, this Man came to me, and, said he, I have taken the Thief, and he would not say any thing to me, but is gone to a Publick-House. I directly went to him, and asked him what he had done with the Pipe? he did not offer to deny the taking of it, but said, that he had carried it into Church-Lane, and sold it for a Shilling.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I live in the House, from whence the Pipe was taken, and coming home between 6 and 7 at Night, I missed it. I went down Stairs, and asked the Woman of the House if Mr. Stent had taken the Pipe away; but she not telling me, I put my Head out into the Yard, and saw the Prisoner sit there all on a heap; I call'd for a Light, and saw him in the Vault: I lifted up his Hat, and when I saw his Face, I knew him, for it happened to be my Wife's own Brother. I said nothing no farther, only asked him how he could do such a thing? he making me no Answer, I went to fetch the Owner of the Pipe, and the Prisoner was carried to the Alehouse , where he own'd that he took it,</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Pipe loose, or was it cut from the House?</p>

               <p>Jane Richards. She robbed me the Day after Michaelmas-Day; I left the Key in my Kitchen-Door, she opened it, and went in; it was between 4 and 5 in the Afternoon, to the best of my Knowledge. I lost 2 Gowns, one was Linnen, the other was a Danjan, a white Dimitty Wastcoat, 2 Holland Shirts, 4 little Boy's Shirts, 5 Aprons, a Lining of a Gown, and a Hat. I can't remember any Thing else, though I have lost a great many Things which are not set down. The Prisoner came to help her Mother, who is a poor Labourer's Wife, in with some Goods, and while I was gone up into my one pair of Stairs Room to make my Bed, she broke the Lock of the Door, and took my Goods: her Mother saw her carry them away in her Lap. I found nothing upon her when she was taken, for she dropped these Things; I did not see her drop them, but I afterwards found them in the Castle-Tavern Back-Door-Passage, in Fleet-Street, which is just by my House. The Prisoner was taken the Wednesday Night following, in Fleet-Market; I charged her with robbing me, at first she deny'd it, but afterwards confessed, and and said, that the Devil hope (helped) her to break the Lock.</p>

The Woman, who bought the cotton, had not Money enough to pay for it, but borrowed a Shilling of Mills; first they disputed about the Price, and were going away, but came back again, and found an Opportunity to take this piece of cotton away. I had shewn them this very piece among others, and did not miss it 'till the Prisoner Hall was brought back; Mills was taken at the Door, but the other Woman crossed Bloomsbury-Market, and got off.

            . I keep an Herb-Stall opposite to Mrs Cunningham's , and saw the Prisoner Mills, and another Woman, in the Shop, looking over divers Goods, and seemed to be very difficult: they both came out of the Shop, made a Stand, and went back again, the other Woman towards the Shop-Door, and Mills went towards a Gateway. The Prisoner Hall was then standing on the other Side of the Way; Mills beckoned to her to go under the Gateway; she did so, and Mills followed her; Hall immediately held up her Apron, Mills turned something into it, and went back to the Shop to the other Woman, who still remained there. Hall was going off, but I slipped after her, took hold of her, and said, she must come back with me; she asked me what she must go back for, I said, she had got something in her Apron, she said, she had not; so I took hold of her Apron, and found this piece of cotton in it, before several Neighbours. I carried her back to the Shop, and saw the Prisoner Mills waiting at the Door for the other Woman, a Constable was sent for, and the 2 Prisoners secured, but the other Woman walked away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mills. Ask her if I offered to go away.</p>

               <p>Hall. I was newly come out of my Time, so I went to get me a Place; I met this Woman (who is gone off) in Holbourn, and she hired me, and said, that she bought and sold old cloaths. She went into this Shop, and brought out this thing to me, and when Cresswell came up to me, to ask me what I had got, I told her, nothing but what my Mistress had given me. - I have not one Friend to come near me, to speak for me.

I saw the Prisoner run a-cross the Yard, and we took him. When we had seized him, we went up Stairs to see what had been done; and found that Lead had been cut out of the Gutter, but how much I can't tell.

Bromley, Bradley, and I, went to the House, and as soon as we were got in, the Prisoner try'd to escape over the Pales. I heard a Noise of something running, and threw a Bit of Wood at him in the dark; but that not hitting him, I ran up to him, and took him, just as he was getting over the Pales to go away. After he was sent to New Prison, we searched the House, and found Part of the Leaden Gutter cut away; and the next Morning going into the Yard, I saw that the Main Pipe was taken from the Front of the House, in the Yard.</p>

I was coming from a Place, - what do you call it? - by Fleet-street, where they sell Saloop, my Ship-mate met me, and we went into a House, and drank 2 Full-pots of Beer; he gave me these Handkerchiefs, that my Wife might wash them for him, and that Man took them from me: I know no more of them.

I asked my Neighbours, whether they had seen the Prisoner go out? and was told, that she was gone, and had carried a large Bundle out with her. I immediately gave notice to several Pawnbrokers, to stop my Goods, if they should be offered to pawn, and accordingly, Mr Johnson, in Wych-street, stopped 2 Coats, which were brought to him by a Woman, who had them from the Prisoner.

               <p>John Clack. My Place was broke open the 17th Day of last Month, while I was a-bed. When I arose, I was in a great Fright to see what was done; I found the Door broke open, and I am very sure it was shut fast, and double-locked over Night, with a Padlock on the outside, and a good Stock-Lock on the inside. These Men will make you sensible that I found a great many of my Goods again, though not all. The Goods which are here are mine, I am on my Oath, and I would swear a hundred Oaths that they are mine, and that I lost them at that Time, for I left them in my cellar when I went to Bed. The Prisoners were taken the same Morning at this Man's House; there were four of them, but one is made an Evidence, and the other is got away. When they were apprehended, they owned that they had a Hand in breaking my Place open, and here is the Adz they did it with. There is a Woman, who is out on Bail, has got part of my Goods, and when I was called out of Bed, I went with the Officers to her House, suspecting that the Man, who got away, was there; we desired the People of the House to open the Door, but they said they could not find the Key, and kept us on the outside a Quarter of an Hour before they would let us in, and in that Time I imagine they let him out. When we got into the House, I found a Wastcoat of mine, and a great many other Things tumbled down the Stairs, and those I took away. I have been very badly used, for they have taken away my Substance, and ruined me.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Will he swear that we did it?</p>
               <p>Clack. No; I can't swear that any one of them did it, but here is their Accomplice.</p>

We went to the Prosecutor's, and the Man who is gone broke the Door open with this Adz, there were two Locks to it; I stood by while he did it; the biggest of the Prisoners went down into the cellar, and brought up the Goods, and that little Man and I carried some of them to Harman's House, and some to Mrs Carlow's, who is out on Bail. When we went to Harman's House, he said he would fetch us some Bread and Cheese, and Beer; but instead of Victuals he brought the Watch and Constable.</p>

He came with me, and when they knocked at the Door, I shut him into a closet that they might not see him; they came in, and laid down their Bundles, and said one to another, Let us go to Carlow's, and fetch the Things from thence, for there are as many there, as there are here; they were going again, but that little Man said, let us have some Victuals and Drink first; I told them, if they would go up Stairs into my 1 pair of Stairs Room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150027"/> I would knock up the People at the Anchor; and then I let my Friend out of the closet. I went immediately to the Watchman, he got me an Officer, and we secured three of them, and carried them to the Watch-house; but the other Man went away, pretending to call his Wife. We called up Mr Clack, and went to Carlow's, suspecting that he was there, and when we got in, we saw several Things lying about, which Mr. Clack owned.</p>

            . I was the Constable. Between one and two in the Morning, Harman called me out of Bed, and said, that he had got some Goods which were left at his House by Thieves. I went home with him: He shewed me as many Things as a Horse could carry, and on going up Stairs, I saw the 2 Prisoners on one Bed, and the Evidence on another. I took hold of the Evidence, and after we had searched him and the Prisoners, and found nothing on them but this Adz, we sent them to a little Place we have, called the Bail-Dock. There were as many Cloaths afterwards brought to the Watch-house, as would load a Horse, they were shewn to Clack the Prosecutor, and he owned them.

               <p>Benjamin Parish. On the 8th of October instant, about 12 o'clock at Night, I was going to enquire after my Wife's Brother, at Mr. Fulman's, in Windsor-Court, Drury-Lane. I went close by the Door where the Prisoner and the other Woman were standing, and this Woman at the Bar said, Countryman, I want to speak with you; I could not refuse, as I was so close to them, so they laid their Hands, one on one Arm, the other on my other, and with the Assistance of somebody behind, pull'd me down on my Back, into the House of one Edmund Cahoe, which is a Den of Thieves. As soon as I came into the Door - the House is not above 8 Paces long - I was no sooner within the Door, but it was shut on me, and, as I am inform'd, Butler was the Woman who kneel'd on my Breast, and held my Arms, I am sure some Woman did. The Prisoner kneel'd on my Legs, so that I lay like a dead Man; she forced open my Breeches Pocket, as you see, [they were Leather Breeches, and torn down the Side] and took out about 23 Guineas in Gold, and some Silver, my Watch, and a Pair of Silver Knee-buckles, and out of my Great Coat Pocket, a Pair of Breeches, and a Holland Shirt, my Hat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150028"/> Wig from my Head. When I first came in, I could discern a great many Men in the House, I cried Murder! as loud as I was able, but none came to my Assistance. As soon as they had robbed me, they opened the Door, and I went away, designing to go to my Inn; but I met a Watchman who pretended to shew me the Way thither, and instead of going the right Way with me, carried me to the Cart and Horse, in St Giles's, where some Irishmen made me drunk, so that I did not get to my Inn till Morning. After this I went to Fulman's, in the same Court where I was robbed, and they advis'd me to be easy; Mrs Fulman told me that there was a Person who would give me 15 Guineas, and my other Things should be laid down in the House, if I would be quiet, but she would not tell who it was. When I found that I could not command any thing, I gave a Fellow a Crown to discover the People who had robbed me, and I took the Prisoner, and charged her with the same before the Justice, as I have now. She own'd that she was in the House; but that Butler had the Money, and one Shields the Watch, and she was innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Hour of the Night was it?</p>
               <p>Parish . About 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He swore before the Justice that it was between 8 and 9. I beg you would ask him in particular, whether I was the Woman who brought him into the House? I don't deny that I saw him him in the House.</p>
               <p>Parish. She was one of the Women who was standing at the Door, and pull'd me into the House.</p>
               <p>The Justice. The Evidence which the Prosecutor has given now, is exactly the same Word for Word, as that which he swore before me. He said that it was between 11 and 12, and that the Prisoner was the Person who rifled his Pockets. When she was before me, she acknowledg'd that she was present; but said that she had no Part of the Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is proper if I took the Money, that I should have some Share of it. There is a Man in the Gate-house, and I think he ought to be brought before my Life or Liberty is taken away. My Friends are not here, and I have not a Half-penny to save me. <rs id="t17401015-60-verdict324" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>James Thomason. I live with Mr Parker in Aldermanbury.

I was on a Bay Mare which belonged to William Davis. The Man who stopped me, presented a Pistol, and swore he would shoot me through the Body, if I did not give him my Money; I was very much terrified, and he took from me a Half-Guinea, two Half-Crowns, 6 d. and a pair of Silver Buckles; he likewise took the Mare which I rode, and left me his in the Room. After this was done, he went toward the Right-hand of the Common; the Mare was advertised, and the Prisoner taken upon her; but whether he is the Person that robbed me, I can't tell. I can't say but the Prisoner may be about the Size of the Man who attack'd me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He advertised the Mare, and I picked her up.</p>

            . On the Thursday after the Robbery was committed, a Boy at Barnet told me, that a Man had stolen a Mare, and was upon her about 200 Yards off; I went after him, but missed Sight of him, and coming back I met a Man, who was likewise in pursuit of him; he desired me to go with him, I did so, and we met the Prisoner on the Mare. We seized him with the Assistance of one or two more, and pulled him off the Mare, down on his Back. When we first took hold of him, he swore he would shoot the next Man that touched him; upon that we searched him for Arms, and found 2 Brace of Pistols loaded in his Pockets, and a Hanger concealed under his coat; not visible to any Body. I did not see his Pistols before he was taken, if I had, I should have been cautious of touching him. We tied his Hands, and carried him to Whetstone , and sent for the Man who was robbed, but he could only swear to the Mare. The Prisoner said, before the Justice, that he was in Debt, and carried those Arms about him only for his Guard. These are the Pistols, and one of them we found loaded.</p>

               <p>Kerton. When he was pulled down on his Back, and could do nothing, he said he was in Debt. The Man looked to have no Harm in him. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150029"/> Pistols were in his Pockets, the Hanger was under his Coat, and not visible to any Body.</p>

He was with me on Sunday about Noon, and said he was going to a Christening to his Wife. On the Monday he din'd with me at Haggerstone : he left me between 1 and 2 in the Afternoon, and said he was going to Enfield . I know him to be very honest, but in Debt. He was very shy of the Bailiffs, and I know that he has had a Hanger and Pistols a pretty while, but I saw none on him when he was at my House. I have seen him have them sometimes, and when he has come in, he used to lay them down, and take them up when he went away. I take him to be very honest, as far as I know.</p>

               <p>They were a second Time indicted for publishing the said Will, knowing it to be forged, false, and counterfeit, April 7.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the Prosecution set forth, that the Prisoners were indict ed on a late Act for Forgery; and that this Prosecution was set on foot, to bring to Punishment two Persons, who had offended against the Act, in publishing a Will for a true one, which when it was looked on, would appear to be a manifest Erasure.</p>
               <p>That there was no positive Evidence against the Prisoners, of their forging this Will; and without that it would be hard to say they were guilty of it; but that the Crime of publishing it, knowing it to be forged, is equally the same; and if the two Prisoners should happen to be guilty of that only, it would be within the Meaning of the Statute.</p>
               <p>It was farther observed on the same Side; that as transactions of this Nature are of the worst Consequence to the Publick, where People are so hardy as to alter Mens Wills, to alter the Sums, to increase or diminish them; so there was an absolute Necessity for putting a severer Punishment on the Crime. That a Will was made by Mr. Sandys , and the old Gentleman having had Prosperity in the World, did intend to make an equal Distribution of his Effects, and consider all his Relations. That it happened some Time before this, that Mr. Sandys was afflicted with Blindness, so that he could not write: I hat he was got into the Hands of an artful Woman, one of the Prisoners, and nothing was done without her Consent; and that the 2 Prisoners prevailed so much over him, that he made them Executors of his Will. That some little time before his Death, as his Relation Mr Grimes, was a Man of worth, he had taken an Affection to him. and had promised him a Legacy; and that it would be proved, that the Old Man declared before his Death, that he had left Mr Grimes 50 l. That Mr Sandys dying soon after, no one was privy to it, but the 2 Prisoners, and they never gave notice of it to any of the Relations; but Mr Grimes afterwards hearing of his Uncle's Death, went to the Prisoners; that he asked them, why they did not let him know, that he might come and search; that the Prisoner Thomas Bates reply'd, '' there is '' no Occasion for that, for I am one Executor, '' and here is the other, (meaning Mrs Bates) he '' has left you 5 l. and here is the Will.'' That Bates then produced a Will, and on Inspection, there appeared to have been a manifest Erasure , and in another Hand, a 5 put in the Place.</p>
               <p>It was again observed, that the ink on this alteration was fresh, the Sand was on the 5, and crumbled off when touched. That Mr Grimes was tender of what he did, and went to Curtis, who was then in Goal, and enquired of him whether there had been any Directions given about the alteration of the Will; that Curtis owned, that he had some time before made a Will for this Mr Sandys, and that it was a Rule with him, when he made an alteration on an Erasure, he always made a Memorandum on the Back. That this gave a strong Presumption, and put Mr Grimes on sifting into the thing, and when the Man came to be buried, a Person came to Mr Grimes for Wine, and entered into Discourse with him about this Will, and said that Mr Bates sent for him, the Day after the Man died, to break open a Box; that he did open the Box, and saw the Will in the same Condition, as when given to Mr Grimes.</p>
               <p>It was likewise offered, that on examining this Will, it appeared that the 5 in several other Places was wrote in a different Manner, which could not be done by Mr Sandys himself, because he was blind; that notwithstanding this, it was insisted on by the Prisoners Thomas Bates , that the writing was all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150031"/> same, but it would be proved that he saw the Sand fresh on the 5, and must know that somebody had made an Erasure. That as this was a Case wherein Life was concerned, it required the strictest proof to be given, and it was presumed that what should be offered against the Prisoners, would be a sufficient Proof of the Publication, and within the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Mr Grimes sworn.</p>
               <p>It was here urged on the Part of the Defendants, that it appeared from the Face of the Indictment, that Mr Grimes was a Party interested in the Cause, therefore could not be a legal Evidence.</p>

               <p>* See his Trial in the Sessions Book for April last, p. 133. No. 231.</p>
               <p>In Answer to which, it was said by the Counsel for the Prosecution, that the Cases which had been mentioned were quite different from this, for if Mr Grimes should give Evidence, it would be to over-throw the Will, then consequently he could have no Part of the Man's Estate, and would swear to his own Prejudice, therefore must be allowed to destroy his own Interest.</p> 
               <p>On the Part of the Defendants it was offered in reply, that this was not an Answer to the Objection, for, according to the Tenour of the Indictment, his Testimony would be to prove that there had been an alteration in the Will, from 50 to 5, to his Prejudice; and if that should be proved, the Court of Equity would give him what was originally intended him.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, it was the Opinion of the Court that Mr Grimes was a Party interested, therefore could not be admitted a legal Witness.</p>
               <p>Couns. We call Mr Justice De Veil to prove that the Will was produced before him, and that the Prisoner

             , insisted on it, that it was a true Will.</p>
               <p>Mr De Veil . This Will was produced before me, in order to take out a Warrant for the Prisoner, but he came without. Mr Grimes brought the Will.</p>
               <p>Couns. When the Prisoner was before you, did not he say that it was a true Will?</p>
               <p>Mr De Veil. Yes; he said he had no concern in it; Mr Grimes produc'd the Will before me, and the Prisoner said he thought it was in the same Manner as it was left, and insisted on his Innocence. There came 2 Neighbours, and told me he was incapable of this thing. I saw the Will, and it appear'd just as it does now; I took a great deal of Notice of it, and thought some Part of it to be fresh done, because the Sand appear'd to me to be still on it.</p>
               <p>Couns. How did Mr Grimes use the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mr De Veil. Mr Grimes treated him with deal of good Nature when he was before me.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did you see the Prisoner Mrs Bates ?</p>
               <p>Mr De Veil. I think she was before me, and said it was the same, but I can't be positive.</p>

               <p>Couns. Look on that Paper.</p>
               <p>Mr Needham. I saw it about 5 or 6 Months ago; I live opposite to Mr Grimes, and he told me his Uncle was dead, and he was going to Long-Acre to see what was left him. When he came back, he shew'd me this Paper.</p>
               <p>Couns. Look on it where those two fives are wrote.</p>
               <p>Mr Needham. I observ'd it then, and it appear'd just as it does now. I did not observe any Sand, but Ink appear'd to me to be fresher in that Place than in any other. Mr Grimes shew'd me the Will within an Hour after he came from Bate's, and after he had been to Mr De Veil.</p>

               <p>Couns. Did you draw all this Will?</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Curtis . I believe it was so when the Will was made; there was a Paper which was wrote by Sandy's Order found with the Will, wherein all the Legacies were set down.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not Mr Grimes come to you about an Erasure?</p>
               <p>Curtis . Yes; I told him I knew nothing at all of it; it had escap'd my Memory. I commonly made a Memorandum if any Erasure should happen. They shew'd me the Will but I could not charge my Memory with it.</p>
               <p>Couns. On your Oath, did not you say that those two fives were not your Writing.</p>
               <p>Curtis. I said nothing at all like it, to the best of my Remembrance; I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Couns. On your Oath, are they your Writing or not.</p>
               <p>Curtis. I do believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150032"/>Couns . How came you to write that Word Five with a small s?</p>
               <p>Curtis . I said I could not charge my Memory with it ; I could not be positive in it so long as ten Years.</p>
               <p>Couns . Are they your Writing or not .</p>
               <p>Curtis. I do believe them to be mine .</p>
               <p>Couns. On your Oath, were they wrote on an Erasure?</p>
               <p>Curtis. It is an Erasure plain.</p>
               <p>Couns. How came that Word Five to be in a different Ink?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I can't tell that; there was something I believe wrote before the Word Five was there.</p>
               <p>Couns . Did not you declare, that when an Erasure happened, you always made a Memorandum on the Back?</p>
               <p>Curtis . I did not say so, I usually did, I could not say I always did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did you mention to Mr Grimes, when he apply'd to you, that there was another Paper?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I did not at that time. After Mr Bates brought me the Paper, I said it was my Writing. The Testator desired me to make a Memorandum of the Legacies.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Was not Mr Grimes at the Expence of a Rule in Easter Term last, to bring you to Westminster?</p>
               <p>Curtis. Yes; I went in a Coach; the Tipstaff's Man paid for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. For what Purpose was it?</p>
               <p>Curtis. I can't tell what; to be a Witness on his Behalf I believe, but I told him then that a Paper of all the Legacies was found, and I could not be a Witness for him. Upon that he gave me some opprobrious Words, and I walked back again. I believe it was the Day before Term ended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did he say any thing to you about an Indictment?</p>
               <p>Curtis. There was a Parchment Writing at that time produc'd, but he did not tell me what it was. We had a great deal of Talk, and I said there was such a Paper found, it is my Writing by the Testator's Directions , and it settles in my Mind that you have no more than 5 l. left you. Here is a Man that has a Copy of the Will, I prepar'd the other from this; the Alterations here are my Writing; this was a former Will, dated 1729.</p>
               <p>Couns. How came you not to write the 5 l. in this Will, as fair and plain as the other Words?</p>
               <p>Curtis. There was a Mistake but how I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was that Paper which was found, your Instructions to draw the Will?</p>
               <p>Curtis. No; I wrote it by the Testator's Desire, that he might know how much the Legacies amounted to.</p>
               <p>Couns . Did not you copy that Paper from the old Will?</p>
               <p>Curtis. No, I took it from the new one.</p>
               <p>Couns. Your Memory is very good in every thing, but you can't tell us, whether there was an Erasure made.</p>
               <p>Curtis . I can't remember, but there must be a Mistake.</p>
               <p>A Witness . I was present drinking with Curtis, when Mr Grimes came in with the Will. I will tell you how it was. On Easter Monday I was with Curtis; Mr Grimes and Mr Bambridge came in and wanted to speak with Curtis; they laid the Will down on the Table, and ask'd him if he made that Erasure; they bid him look carefully over it; and he said he could not remember that he did. The Question was asked him, whether he made that Erasure, and he answer'd he knew nothing of it; he could not charge his Memory with it. He said nothing of there being a Paper that would set Things right, but that the Alterations were not his own Writing. This was in the King's-Bench, and I always call'd to see him when I went that Way.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not Curtis say that he could not charge his Memory with Facts?</p>
               <p>The Witness. I can say no more than I have told you.</p>
               <p>Couns. Did not he say that it was a great while ago?</p>
               <p>The Witness. Yes, 10 Years ago, and he could not remember so long. I believe Curtis to be an honest Man, and I do not think he would be guilty of Perjury.</p>
               <p>Mr Bambridge. Mr Grimes came to my Chambers in Easter Holidays, and said there had been an Erasure made in a Will to his Prejudice; he desired me to go with him to the Man who made the Will; I went with him, and we found Curtis with two Men; I called him out, and told him what we came about, but he did not remember any thing. We went in and opened the case before them all, and then he said he did remember the making of the Will; are the Figures which stand on that Erasement your's (said I) or not? He said, I think not, and gave us a Reason, that he always made a Memorandum on the Back; and he made no Hesitation. I cannot be so particular, as to remember whether he made use of the Word usually or always.</p>

               <p>Couns. When was it that you heard him say he had left Mr Grimes any thing.</p>
               <p>Webb. He dined at Mr. Grimes's House, and Mr Bates was there at the same time.</p>
               <p>Couns. Was there any talk about a Will?</p>
               <p>Webb. Mr Sandys told my Master, that he had left him 50 l. and it would be the last time he should see him; he said he left Mr Grimes's Sister 50 l. There was no mention made of Mr. Grimes's Mother, what Sum he had left her, only that he had left Mr Grimes and his Sister 50 l. Our Bar-keeper was present, it was the 22d of February.</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes; he died the latter end of February, and was at our House the 22d. He had fell down in the Dirt, and my Master asked him if he had hurt himself, and why he would not take a Coach when he came out; he said if ever he came out again he would have a Coach, but he believed he should never see my Master any more. He said he had left him and his Sister 50 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Do you live with Grimes?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I have lived with him as a Bar-keeper about 2 Years; and Mr Sandys said at our House, that he had left my Master something to remember him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. How came he to say afterwards 50 l.</p>
               <p>Smith. After Dinner, my Master asked him how he did, he said indifferent, and that he had left him and his Sister 50 l. a piece. The Conversation was almost the same as before Dinner.</p>
               <p>The Evidence for the Prosecution rested here; and it was urged on the Part of the Defendants, that what has been offered to support this Indictment could not in the least affect them with respect to the Publication of the Will, knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Juryman. The Will had been some time out of Mr Bates's Hands; a five might have been erased, and another wrote thereon. <rs id="t17401015-62-verdict335" type="verdictDescription">

On Monday the 29th of September, I had some pieces of Cotton brought home from the Calender's, and missed them out of the Shop on the Thursday following. I went out to see after them, but could not find them; I blamed some People that I have in the House, and making a Noise about them, I was told on the Friday Morning that one of my Pieces were in a Shop in White-Lyon Yard, bought for 8 s . which we never sell for less than 16, and there I found it. I took up the Prisoner on Suspicion, and charged her with the Fact; I asked her where the other 2 Pieces were; at first she denied that she knew any thing of them, and that she bought this Piece which I found, of one Cross; but at last, she said it I would go out with her, she would tell me where they were, and said that they were pawned at two places. When she was before the Justice, she confessed that she came into my Shop, and asked for some Checque for a Gown, that we could not agree about the Price, and when I turned my Back, she took these 3 Pieces of Cotton off the counter. I found the other two Pieces according to the Prisoner's Directions, pawned in the Name of Britannia Wood. She said if I would let her go I should have my own again; I was apprehensive that I had lost a great many more things, so I made her no Promise of Favour. This Letter I received from her while she was in New-Prison; she told me she sent it.</p>

She came again the next Day and ask'd me for her Wages, and desir'd my Wife to let her fetch her Bundle down, for when she went away, she said, she had left one behind her; my Wife said, I don't know of any Bundle you have here, pray let me see what is in it. We open'd the Bundle, and found these Things in it, which the Prisoner said were given her by a former Mistress; but they were my Goods, and had my Mark on them. She brought them out of the Garret, and would have gone off with them if we had not stopp'd her.

There were in the Bundle a piece of Silk, 2 Pillow-biers, a Hatband, and several other Things of Mr Trueman's; I knew them to be his by the Marks; some of them were mark'd with 2 T's, and some with M and M T.

               <p>Prisoner. How came he not to prevent me, if he felt my Hand in his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. She was too quick for me. When I found that my Money was gone, I held her fast against the Wall, and a Fellow she call'd Husband, came up and insulted me. The Watch was called, and we went to the Watch-house; when we were there, she said she never saw me; but I am sure she is the very Woman. She was not searched, and I have not had my Money again. I am a Snuff-Box Maker, and live on Clerkenwell-Green.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it in the Street, or whereabout was it?</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How far from the Watch was it?</p>

               <p>Le Cour. A Man insulted me, and said she was his Wife; but I did call the Watch, and held her fast against the Wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you charge no other Woman with taking your Money?</p>
               <p>Le Cour. No, none else; the Constable was present, and knows that I charged no body but the Prisoner.</p>

            . On the 26th of April, I was informed that a Leaden Gutter, and several Pipes, were stolen from Mr Frapwell's House. I thought fit to get a Warrant to search proper Places, and just as we were got to Marybon Turnpike , a shower of Rain came upon us, and we stood up in the Turnpike House. While we were there the People were talking, that a Man was taken in a Brick-Field with Leaden Pipe upon him, and that he was carried to the Bell at Paddington . We went to the Bell, and found the Prisoner with some People, who had secured him, in a little Room in the House, and a Bag of Lead on the Table. I took Dimensions of the Lead, and went to the House from whence it was taken, and it fitted exactly. I then charged a Constable with the Prisoner, and carried him before a Justice, where he said, that he found it in a Pond. When he was taken he was asked where he found the Bag, and he said in the other Field, behind the Bush; and that there was a Lock of Straw on it. I was not at the first taking of the Prisoner; I was going to the Gravel-Pits, but hearing at the Turnpike that a Man was taken with Lead, I turned back again. When I charged him with stealing it, he behaved very cooly, and said, that he found it in a Pond, and the Bag behind the Bush. There was a wet Shirt in the Bag beside the Lead, and before the Justice he said, that he went to the Pond to wash his Shirt, and then found the Lead. There was about a Quarter of a hundred in the Bag, and the wet Shirt. The Shirt was produced before the Justice, and was very dirty.</p>

            . On the 26th of April, I was informed that some Lead was found in Spruce and Baker's Pond at Paddington . I went with them to see it, and a Storm of Hail occasioned us to go to a Hedge 40 Yards from the Pond for Shelter. In the Interim the Prisoner came into the Field, and went towards Bay's-Water, I did not suspect him by his Dress; he came between us and the Pond, and I took particular Notice to see if he looked towards the Pond, but could not perceive that he did. We set a Man to watch, imagining that the Lead would be fetched out of the Pond in small Quantities. I put the Lead, which had been taken out of the Pond, in again, after the Prisoner was gone out of the Field towards Bay's-Water . I then went away, and sent a Man to watch; he came running back to me, and said, he saw a Man come to the Pond with something in a Bag; I went after the Prisoner, and when I came near him, I saw that he had a Bag in his Hand; he went over a Ditch into another Field, put the Bag into the Ditch, and then retreated from it 3 or 4 Yards. I ran up to him, imagining it to be the Lead, and asked him how he came by it; he said, he found it in the Pond. We then carried him to Paddington, and he answered all the Questions that were put to him, in English, very distinctly; he had the same Coat on then as now, his Shirt was not so clean, and he looked a little rough. There was a Shirt found by the Bag, and he said he went to the Pond to wash it; but there were many other Places more private where he might have done it.</p>

            . I am Mr Frampton's Gardiner, and lie in the House. On the 26th of April last, I heard a Noise between 1 and 2 o'clock in the Morning; I got up and looked out at the Window, and saw a Ladder against the House. I did not go to Bed again, but looked about the House, and found that a great deal of Lead had been taken from the West End; there were leaden Pipes, and part of the Gutter gone. The Lead was pretty substantial, and required some Work to take it down, and the Noise waked me, but I heard no Voices. The Ladder belonged to a Carpenter at Kensington, and he lent it to a Bricklayer.</p>

            . On the 26th of April, between 8 and 9 in the Morning, I was sent for to watch at the Pond, and while I was there, I saw the Prisoner go from the Pond with the Lead in a Bag; he did not take the Foot-path, but crossed the Road, and seemed to run with it. I then called Gays, and he ran after the Prisoner and overtook him, and when I came up he had hold of him; the Bag and a dirty Shirt lay by him; I asked him what he designed to do with the Lead, he said it was to make Shot, to go a shooting with, and that he was going to wash his Shirt, and found the Lead in the Pond.</p>

I went out that Morning in order to wash a coarse dirty Shirt; I was ashamed to be seen doing it by any body, because it was torn and ragged. I went to one Pond, and saw People there, so I went to another, and as I was washing it, I saw Lead in the Pond. I hung my Shirt up to dry, and walked to and fro while it was drying, and saw two Men walking about; I threw the Shirt from me least they should laugh at me, and imagining they would come and find the Lead, I thought I might take some of it too to make Shot, and finding the Bag, I took a little out and put it into the Bag.</p>

            . The Prisoner came into England with Esquire Burrard, who had serv'd as a Voluntier in the Russian Army, against the Turks. When the Prisoner first lodged with me, I liv'd in King-Street, St. James's, but now I live in Leicester-fields. On the 25th of April, the Prisoner went to Bed at a little after 10, and I lock'd up the Doors and took the Key with me. I deliver'd the Key to my Maid a little after 6, that my Lodgers might go out to Work, and I did not see the Prisoner afterwards. I take him to be very honest; he always kept the best Company; but never gam'd at Cards, or any thing like it. He had washed his Linnen often himself, and used to wash his Master's, when in the Russian Camp .</p>

            . I know the Prisoner; ed with him in that Gentleman's House all the Winter. On the 25th of April he lay with me all Night . I awak'd several Times in the Night and found him abed, and we 'rose together at half an Hour after 5 in the Morning, but I went out and left him at Home. I don't know any thing about his going out that Morning in particular , but I know he frequently used to go into the Fields to wash his Shirts, because he did not care that any Body should see them.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prtia. How far is it from your House to Paddington .</p>
               <p>Prtia. About half a Mile.</p>
               <p>Mendel. He never lay out all Night, but behaved very civilly, and frequented no bad company.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrard . I have known the Prisoner since last June was Twelve-months, I had leave from his Majesty to make a Campaign under Count Munich, in 1738, and he came from abroad with me. He lived in my House, and behaved himself as a diligent Servant, and I always thought him as honest a Fellow as ever I knew in my Life. My Brother gave me a Character of him, and he had 'trusted him by himself through Poland with his Baggage, where he did not meet with a House, or an Inhabitant for 100 miles. I really believe the man to be as innoceent of this as myself. He propos'd to go into the India Service, if this had not happened.</p>
               <p>Mr Bromfield. I have known the Prisoner about 12 months; I have been frequently in this Gentleman's House, and never heard a better Character of any one in my Life.</p>
               <p>Mr Burrard again. When he has been with me, he has not had his Cloaths off for 3 Weeks together, and if he had had a mind to have wrong'd me and gone off, I could not have enquired after him, because I could not speak the Language of the Country. He has had frequent Opportunities in my House, to wrong me, if he had been so inclined. He has the best of Characters, I never saw him drunk in my Life.</p>
