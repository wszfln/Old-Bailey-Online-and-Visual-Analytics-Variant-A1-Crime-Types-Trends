               <p>Court. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who brought the spoons to you? - To the best of my knowledge I think it is the same man, I believe he is the person.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - He was not in this dress at all.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether it is the man or not? - I think I have no reason to doubt but it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Do you doubt? - No, I do not doubt but it is the same person.</p>
               <p>(The spoons produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Did this man, coming a second time with five more spoons, give you no suspicion? - Yes; on that account I went to Bow-street, thinking he lived in our neighbourhood, but I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very unguarded to buy such things of strangers? - It is very often done.</p>
               <p>It ought not to be done, and you should bear in memory the case of the silversmith in the Strand; your business ought to be conducted with great caution, in buying old silver, both for your own sake and the sake of the public.</p>

               <p>I have two shops; on Monday the 4th of May, the prisoner brought this spoon into my front shop about noon; he offered it to sell; I gave him two shillings and three-pence for it; then he went into my back shop and produced this watch to one of my young men, that he wanted to buy a watch exactly like that; when I went in, I asked him what he pleased to have, he held the watch at about a yard distance; I said, let me see it; as soon as I opened it, I asked him where he lived, and how he came by it; he gave me the watch into my hand, and I asked him if he knew the maker's name of the watch; he said it was made in Dublin; I asked him some more questions how he came by it, and in a passion he snatched violently at the watch, but I did not part with the watch; I stopped him immediately, and sent down to Bow-street, I took the watch to Bow-street, and found Sir George there; the prisoner was immediately taken to Bow-street, he never got away the least in the world; Sir George immediately owned the watch.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury; I shall tell the affair what gave rise to it, and also to my taking it; I received permission on a certain Sunday from Sir George, to visit a certain number of friends, being obliged to quit their company at 7 o'clock to put the young boy to bed, I made a promise to return again to the company; having occasion to go into my Lady's room, I saw this watch hanging up, I judged it might be convenient for me to put it into my fob to know the hour of returning, I went to them, we happened to stay out longer than I imagined, then it was too late for me to return back to Sir George's; in consequence of which we were about to spend the whole night drinking and revelling; in the morning I was so drunk I did not know what I was saying, but that my taking the watch did not proceed from any villainous intention, can easily be seen from certain circumstances that attended it and my apparel. At the shop I sold a little tea-spoon which I found the morning before in St. James's-street, the pawn-broker never asked me whether that spoon was found by me, or whether it was my property, or whether it was stolen or not; or if I had any intention of selling the watch; however I never offered to sell it or pawn it; it may easily be seen from that circumstance alone that my intention was not either to sell it or pawn it; I could have no great diffidence at the time with respect to the pawn broker's buying it, for he bought the spoon; secondly he asked my address which I readily gave him; if I was any way apprehensive, I should have given him a wrong address, but I gave him my right address: I have not many acquaintance in this country; Sir George<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030005"/>had a very good character with me, and that person that gave him the character, is the only person that knows me.</p>
               <p>Sir George. I know nothing of him except from the character that an usher at an academy wrote to me of him. The prisoner appeared very distressed when he came to me, and as I knew that men may be very honest though very much distressed, I was cautious, I wrote to a man the name of Lawrence, an usher at Greenwich, and he wrote me a letter that had very much the appearance of candor, and said he doubted not but he would behave very well, unless he got into the company of some of his own countrymen, who were great cormorants, speaking of some of the lower sort of Irishmen that were in London; I understood he had been bred in Paris with intent of being a priest, but did not chuse it, he speaks latin very well.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman, the pawnbroker, says I made a violent snatch at the watch; I never thought of it; besides he allowed that I never offered either to sell or pawn the watch, nor asked the value of it; all that I said of it was, had he such a thing in his shop.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. You have been convicted upon the most clear and satisfactory evidence of a crime, attended with such circumstances of aggravation, that if, as from the circumstances of the crime, you had been indicted and found guilty of the capital offence, I certainly should not have recommended you to any mitigation of that sentence which the law would have inflicted; and it is highly probable, from his Majesty's attention to justice as well as to mercy, that your life would have been forfeited. Most unquestionably humanity stands foremost in the list of virtues; yet I cannot give entire approbation in this case to the conduct of the prosecutor, arising from that motive; I think Sir

Under these circumstances most unquestionably the sentence of justice must necessarily be the severest the law will permit; had you been capitally convicted, I should most undoubtedly have recommended it to his Majesty to have ordered you for immediate execution; as that is not the case, it is my duty to go as near it as I can, and you are therefore sentenced to be</p>

               <p>I drive a hackney coach, I was taken from Bishopsgate-street, between one and two in the morning, by a couple of young men, I asked them where they wanted to be drove to; they said they wanted to go but a very little way; one got into the coach, and the other got on the box, he on the box told me to drive fast to Holywell Mount, and then to St. Giles's; after I drove him to Holywell Mount, I asked him whether he was going to put any thing into the coach or no; he said yes, they were going to put some parcels into the coach; I told them it was a very unseasonable hour to put property into the coach, and that nothing should be put into the coach that night, for there had been instances of people putting smuggled goods into a coach, and then seizing on the coach and horses; they declared it was nothing of that kind; and in a little while I let them put it into the coach; after they had put it in the coach, one got on the box, and the other into the coach again; I asked them where they chose to be drove to; one of them never left the coach, while the other fetched two bags and put them into the coach, he was not gone above a minute or two; where they fetched the bags from I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the men by sight? - I cannot positively say I do, for we hackney coachmen carry all kinds of people, and I had been drinking that night, and I cannot say that these are the men, I believe they are the men, but I cannot swear positively to them, they ordered me to drive them to Conduit-street, I knew of no such street, but I was rather frightened with the men, and I told them I would drive them there, they told me to drive as fast as I could; when I got to Holborn they told me to stop, and they broke the glass of the coach; they said they were very sorry, and asked me if I would not have something to drink; I suspected it was smuggled goods, I persuaded them to stop at a house that I use; but they told me to drive to the Old Pilgrim in Holborn, which is a house that I never use; there they took the things out of the coach, then they asked me the damage of the glass, and I told them half a crown; they asked me what my fare was, I told them two shillings; they said, here is five shillings for you; in the mean while they ordered a pot of hot, I went into the house, it was very full of company, I stopped about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030008"/>minutes, and I came home and went to bed, and two of these gentlemen here came down to me; they had taken the number of the coach at the Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. When you came to this Pilgrim, the house was full of company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know the number? - No.</p>
               <p>The persons you took in your coach, whom you cannot swear to, one of them never left your carriage at all, and the other was not gone above a minute or two? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I beg leave to address your Lordship and the Court on this last evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. If we are to have comments on the evidence, I desire all the witnesses may go out of court.</p>

               <p>I was an officer then, but I am not now; on the 31st of March last, between six and seven, I was called out of bed to go to the Pilgrim in Holborn; I met the landlord in Holborn, he told me there were some things in his yard, and there I found two bags with starch and blue, and some other things; I went into the tap-room, and when I went out, the two prisoners walked out of the tap-room into Holborn; I followed them, and took them on suspicion; the landlord's name is Stapleton; I took the two prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Bailey. How late did the prisoners stay at your house? - I cannot say what time; from between two and three, to seven; it was light when they went away.</p>
               <p>When was it that they gave you this crow? - It was between five and six when they gave me the crow.</p>
               <p>Who were the men that came in the coach? - I did not see them come out of the coach, but it was the tallest of the prisoners that came in and ordered the pot of hot, there were four or five coaches there besides, the coach could not come close to the door; the other man gave me the crow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There were several coaches at the door? - Two or three besides, I did not see any body get out of the coach, there were four or five coachmen in the house besides; it is a night-house, a watering-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you carried the first pot of hot to the door, was any body in the coach at that time? - They were not in the coach, they were standing by the side of the coach, and the coachman with them.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I searched the prisoners, and on the prisoner Cookson I found this flint and steel in his pocket; I went back to the house, and Bailey gave me an iron crow and cutlass, which he said he received from one of the prisoners; in one of the bags I found this iron crow, which I have had in my custody ever since; and that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. If I understand you right, the things you found were in the open yard? - They were, I cannot be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030009"/>positive whether any body can go there from the street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You belong to Justice Walker's office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you know that any instrument of that size would make exactly the same impression? - If there was one cast in a mould of that size, it would make the same impression; there were two instruments made use of, and these two instruments at their two ends exactly correspond, where the shutter was broke; one raises the shutter up with a smaller purchase, and the other raises it with a larger purchase, and both these instruments fitted to the places.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; on the 31st of March I went with Mr. Kendall to find out the coachman, after we secured the property we found in Old-street-road; we found him by the number of the coach, I do not know who took the number of the coach, whether Mr. Kendall told me the number or no, I cannot be positive, I went to take them, and this handkerchief out of the prisoner Davis's pocket, and by this handkerchief we went to enquire after the person that had been robbed; there is the full name of M. Sutherland on it; the handkerchief was bloody, we enquired for the name of Sutherland, we thought the person's name that was robbed was Sutherland, but it was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Bailey. You said you was the waiter at this public-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you went to the coach, who did you find there? - The two prisoners and the coachman.</p>
               <p>Should you know that coachman again, if you was to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Phipps stand up.</p>
               <p>Court to Phipps. When the liquor was brought out of the public-house, was you standing at the coach with the prisoners? - No, I was giving my horses some hay.</p>
               <p>Which of the prisoners was it that went for the liquor, and which stood by the coach? - I do not know which, I do not know these were the men.</p>
               <p>Did the two men you brought in the coach, one of them go into the public-house, and the other stop at the coach? - No, they went into the public-house and ordered the liquor out, one of the men; the liquor was brought out by this man the waiter.</p>
               <p>What kind of a bag was it that they brought the things in? - They seemed to me to be two sacks of things, they were carried towards the house as far as the door, I saw them carried as I stood feeding my horses.</p>
               <p>Court to Bailey. Did you see any thing that contained the things that were brought by the prisoners? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us just now that they wanted to leave some lumber? - Yes, when they ordered the first pot of hot; but I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030010"/>see either the bag or any thing belonging to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these things, and for whether you can swear to the property? - Here is the die which I am going to produce to your lordship, which this blue was made from; this dye has a stamp upon it, but I suppose it is so defaced now there is no seeing; this is made from this dye, and it is marked with my own initials, from that I can swear to its being my own property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any impression on that blue? - There is a little, but it is almost defaced now; this trial was put off last sessions, on account of the illness of the prisoners; here is a paper of starch which was found on the floor, which I marked with the same hand-writing, which corresponds with those that are taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Who wrote it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You are, I understand, a very capital manufacturer? - Ah! there is no occasion to ask whether I am a very capital manufacturer or not, the gentlemen of the Jury will judge between us; I make blue, that is what you wish me to answer, I do not wish to have that put upon me, that I do not make; I am not a very capital manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any thing of a tinder-box any where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - Upon an iron in the room where the men seal up those papers of lamp-black.</p>
               <p>Was that tinder-box yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the flint and steel with it when you found it? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>There is nothing else that you can swear to, but that blue from your stamp, and that paper which was in your mill-room? - No.</p>
               <p>It is Stonard's starch, he is a capital manufacturer of starch? - Yes he it.</p>

            , on the 20th of December last, I was going to Mr. Clempson's, the glover, in Berkley-square; about half past nine at night to take home ten dozen of fine head kids, to make ladies and gentlemens fine kid gloves; they are called head kids for fine, best; I had them then in my possession in a canvas bag; as I was going down Long-acre, I thought I felt somebody behind me, but I did not turn back; but as I came to this first end of Piccadilly, I was sure some somebody felt the leather, as the ends of the leather turned down; I did not turn back then, because so many people were in the street; I carried them under my arm, the bag was tied, and I turned the bottom of the bag under my arm and the ends of the leather hung down.</p>

               <p>At that time when you saw the prisoner, had any body plucked at the skins? - Yes, that moment.</p>
               <p>Was there any body near you at that time but the prisoner? - No, nobody at all.</p>

               <p>When the skins were taken from you, you did not see the person that took them? - Yes I did, the prisoner is the man that picked up the property; I did see him then, it was not a dark night, and the lamp gave a good light.</p>
               <p>And you are sure that the prisoner is the same person that you saw opposite St. James's Church? - Yes, I verily believe I am right.</p>
               <p>You verily believe; but you must swear properly? - Sir, I have proper witnesses, but I verily believe him to be the man: four men surrounded me;

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Leach: and the case by Mr. Knowlys, as follows,</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship. - Gentlemen of the Jury: you have heard the indictment opened by my learned friend, which contains the charge of murder, and when I am addressing myself to a Jury, who have discharged their duty so well this sessions, I need say nothing to you to call your attention to so important a charge; you well know what is due to publick justice upon a satisfactory conviction of such a crime; you likewise well know how immense a stake a prisoner has who stands under such accusation: gentlemen, I will state the case to you, as shortly as I can. It happened on the 6th of May, a famous battle was expected to take place at Stilton, between two men, of the name of Humphries and Mendoza, it was a matter of much public conversation, and on the day preceding, the Lincoln coach was passing through Enfield to this place; on the outside was the prisoner at the bar, when the coach stopped, the prisoner cried out what odds? not addressing himself to any person particular; the deceased happened to stand near the coach; he immediately said I will take thirty-five shillings to a guinea; meaning on the event of this battle, upon which the prisoner looked at him, and said to him, what are you a fighter? the deceased immediately said yes, I think I am able to fight you; upon this, Ward came from the box, and there was an offer at that time to fight for a guinea; it seems that the deceased was after this informed, that the man who offered to fight him, was a man known as a fighter, and more experienced than himself; upon this occasion the deceased rather failed in point of courage; then the prisoner finding him reluctant, offered to change that bet for a half crown bowl of punch; the deceased declined the fight; the prisoner went up and used several aggravating words, and put his fist in his face; a person of the name of Badder endeavoured to prevent it, but the deceased turned round to a man of the name of Peacock, and said this is too much; they had two rounds; they fell twice; on the second fall the deceased was accused of pulling the hair of the prisoner; when they got up, the deceased said I will fight no more; he left the prisoner, and moved round a cart, saying he had enough and would fight no more; the prisoner went round on the other side, met him; and I understand some attempts were made to prevent his striking him, but he almost at the same instant hit the deceased, who was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030023"/>then in the attitude of fighting, with his left hand in the stomach, and with his right almost in the same instant a blow on the temple; upon that the deceased fell, and in almost an instant appeared dead, and never shewed the least signs of life afterwards. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances attending this business; the deceased declined to fight, he was provoked to it, and at one time had given up the battle. If it appears to you that at the time the deceased declined to fight any more, and had left the prisoner; the prisoner had sufficient time to cool from the heat of the engagement, and went round the cart purposely to meet him, that he went to give him some very violent injury, even though he did not mean death, that he went deliberately to do an injury; even though he might think it short of death; then, under my Lord's direction, I shall hold it was murder; but if you think he did not go round purposely and deliberately, but that having once set his fighting talents at defiance, the prisoner acted under the impression of the rage which that occasioned, then I think you cannot carry it any further than manslaughter. Gentlemen, I shall call all the witnesses; you will hear the whole of the case fairly and impartially, and I am sure the decision that you will give under the direction of the Court, will satisfy all the world.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Leach.</p>
               <p>Where did you happen to be on the evening of the 5th of May last? - I was at Enfield highway when the Lincon coach stopped.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar there? - I remember seeing a man of the name of Ward there; that may be the man, but I am not sure: the passengers asked what was the odds on the battle depending at Stilton to morrow; with that Mr. Swain said he would take thirty-five shillings to a guinea, but of which party I am not sure; and I believe one of the passengers, I cannot tell which, asked him if he could fight; he said he would fight him for a guinea; upon that, the gentleman came from the coach, and went to him, and I put my stick to him, and said Swain shall not fight; then Swain asked the other if he would take the law of him, and he said he would not; then some person asked me what I had to do with it; then Mr.

                  Ward

             I believe hit Swain on the head, whether he fell to the ground I am not sure; people came in between him and me, and they set to it to fight, and they had a round together, and fell side by side as nearly as possible, and in the rising, some man, but who it was I cannot say, went to the assistance of Swain, and he got up with his hand in Ward's hair, and when he was got up, he said he would fight no more, and Ward held his hair towards the passengers in the coach, and said it was not fair; with that one of the passengers said Swain ought to have his liver cut out, or something of that nature, for fighting unfair; Swain went round the cart and stood there, and Mr. Ward met him, and he drew back and said he would not fight any more; Mr. Ward then hit him twice, and he fell and never got up any more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Leach. Was Swain in a fighting posture when Ward gave the two last blows? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not see that he was? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Swain after he received these blows and had fallen in consequence of them, shew any signs of life? - No, I never saw him stir afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Blows were given on both sides? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Then they fell down both together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Swain the deceased, with one hand had hold of Ward by the hair? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And with the other hand he was pegging him? - I did not see him strike, he had hold of him, but I did not see him strike.</p>
               <p>Ward was pretty much beat? - I do not know, I did not take any notice of him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030024"/>I did not see him; but as he came to the coach with a handkerchief up; my attention was about Swain.</p>
               <p>These men did not know each other? - No Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>They offered to try their manhood for love, I believe at one time? - I believe they did, I never saw the prisoner before; nor Swain never saw him before; Swain was an intimate acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Swain was a pretty goodish man in your part of the country? - I never saw him strike any person in my life; I looked upon him to be a strong lusty hale man.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him, when this coach came up, talking very largely how he had challenged a man of the name of Johnson? - Yes Sir, I have often heard him say that; he was often romancing that way, but I never knew him to fight anybody in that way.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull off his apron, and swear he would whip Ward; did you hear him say he would smack his backside? - He might say so, but I did not pay any attention to it.</p>
               <p>He was a blacksmith? - He was so; I remember something of his pulling off his apron.</p>
               <p>He was a stouter man than Ward? - Much so.</p>

             the prize fighter; upon that, Swaine changed very white, and he said he would not fight; with that Ward said thus? says he, what will you not fight, you country hawbuck, and with that he tapped him, and said, I could have you here, and I could have you there, and slapped him over the face; with that he says no I shall not fight you now; but another time I will fight you for twenty pound; but now I will not; with that he said, what you will not fight me now? no, says he I will not; with that he kept tapping him; I could have you here, I could have you there; the blacksmith said I cannot put up with this any longer, and with that the blacksmith told him that he would knock him down if he could; with that they had a little bit of a hold, then they had a bit of a skirmish, and the little cart stood, and the blacksmith got hold of Ward's head of hair, he pulled some hair off his head; they were down both together, and the young man that is along with me now, he parted them, like one parted on one side the cart, and one on the other; different parties parted them and lifted them up; when they came up, the blacksmith walked up to the Black Horse bar window, and going in this man says will not you stand another round? they went one on the one side of the cart, and one on the other; the horse and cart stood facing the door way; with that, when they were going up there, he said, you blackguard I never had my hair pulled before in my life, will not you stand another round?</p>
               <p>Did Swain make any answer to what was said by Ward? - He said he would fight no more; and as he was going up he hit him over the shoulder, and Swaine the blacksmith made to go into the house, and Ward hit him with his right hand in the belly, and with his left hand on the side of the head, and down the poor man dropped.</p>
               <p>At the time he received these two blows, one of which you say was on the head and the other in the belly, was Swaine in a fighting posture? - No, he was not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of Prisoner's Counsel. This was the Lincoln coach, and he went into the coach he came in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought the doctor had the worst of it, and had better not fight any more? - Really I did so.</p>
               <p>Did you know the doctor much? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Except the hair it was all fair? - No, asking your pardon, it was not two fair rounds.</p>
               <p>I confess I am not much of a fighter, and if any shame belongs to that confession, I must take it; all the rest was fair except his getting his hands into his hair; that is not fair? - No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>It is still less fair to tear off a man's hair? - No, it is not; to be sure he did pull some of his hair off.</p>
               <p>These two men were strangers; this prisoner was a passenger on the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had so little supicion that he was dead, that you advised the doctor to lay snug? - I did.</p>

               <p>I was present when this matter took place; when we stopped at the Black Horse to water the horses, Ward sat at the back part of the roof of the coach with me; this blacksmith was standing down against the window, and he offered to lay a guinea to thirty-five shillings on the fight at Stilton, that was Swaine, I never saw him before; Ward upon the coach asked him what he knew about laying at fighting, and told him he had not a guinea to lay; and Swaine said he would fight Ward for a guinea, and make it up the twenty; Ward got off the coach, and they had some words between them after he got down, and Swaine pulled off his apron, and threatened to whip him with it; in a little time they fell to fighting, the blacksmith catched Ward by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030026"/>hair, and bent him back a great way, and they both fell down together; and after they got up again they set to fighting again, and I did not see any more; I did not see the blow struck, when the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then you say, that from the time of Ward's getting down from the coach, and the time of their beginning to fight, there were some words past? - Yes, there was, but I do not know exactly what it was.</p>

Swaine said, d - n me, I will fight you for a guinea or twenty; he took the guinea out in his hand, and held it in his hand, and threw it on the ground; Ward got down off the coach, and Swaine took his apron off, and said he would whip his a - e with it; a few words passed between them, and they went to fighting; Swaine had him held by his hair, and he hit him while he had hold of his hair, and the gentlemen that were there, cried out foul! foul! and they both fell down together; Swaine got up, and Ward got up, and Swaine stooped a little bit back, and they got fighting again, and fought till the very last moment; they stood up hitting at one another till the last moment the accident happened.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Tell us as strictly as you can, what you saw pass on this occasion? - I was at the Black Horse at Enfield Highway when it happened; the Lincoln coach came up to the door, and Swaine was standing drinking a pint of beer, and some of the people upon the roof of the coach called out, what is the best odds for tomorrow? I do not know who it was that said so; and Swaine said he would take thirty-five shillings against a guinea; with that there were some words between the parties, and Ward got down from the coach; there were a good many words passed between them both, but I do not know what it was, Ward came up and held his fist in his face, and asked him if he was a fighting man, or would he fight; and Swaine said no, he did not want to fight, but he did not think Ward was much of a fighter; Ward said he would fight him for a guinea, or a bowl of punch, if he chose it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Ward say that to Swaine, or Swaine to Ward? - Ward said so to Swaine; there were many words passed after that, and then Ward struck him, and Swaine had his apron in his hand, and a guinea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030027"/>and he flung his apron down, and gave the guinea to me; I was standing close by, I did not hear him say any thing at all about his apron, any more than flinging it down; then they went to fighting; after some blows they got hold of one another some way, and both fell down to the ground; when they got up again, Swaine said he would fight no more; there stood a cart in the road, and Swaine went round the cart one way, and Mr. Ward came round the cart the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any thing happen about Ward's hair? - I cannot say that he hung in his hair, I heard people say so, but I did not see him; Ward met him at the head of the horses again, and struck him again; I saw him strike one blow on the head, and he fell to the ground; Swaine was standing by the cart, going with his hands in this form (folded).</p>
               <p>Was he at all in an attitude of defence? - No, he was not, he never stirred hand nor foot after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They went round the cart, and as soon as they met he struck him a blow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear the people call foul, foul? - I heard some of the people call foul, but I do not know what they meant by it.</p>
               <p>Was not it explained at the time to mean that Swaine had fastened in his hair? - I do not know, I heard people say it was foul play; hit him again, I heard several people say that.</p>
               <p>Upon which the smith went round one way, and Ward went the other, and instantly he struck him, and down he fell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him take off his apron? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you hear him say that he would whip this man with it? - I did not; I was within three yards of him.</p>
               <p>Other people might not hear that which you heard? - No, they might not.</p>
               <p>You will not swear that he did not say, when he took off the apron, I will slap your backside with this? - No, I will not swear it, he was no particular friend of mine.</p>
               <p>A good strong man, was not he? - A strongish man, I do not know the strength of the man, I never tried his strength.</p>
               <p>Was not he a very strong labouring blacksmith? - He was a stout built man.</p>
               <p>Was not he a remarkable stout man? - No, I do not think he was, he was a stouter man than the prisoner, and taller.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, I saw the deceased, I believe it was the 5th of May, he was dead; I examined the body, I was informed what happened, but not particularly.</p>
               <p>In your judgment was the death owing to blows? - That is beyond a doubt, that his death arose from the blows he received.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You opened the body, I take it of course? - I did not, I was once reprimanded by Mr. Philips the late coroner, for opening a body before he had seen him.</p>
               <p>What external appearance would there be on a body, to convince you from the inspection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030028"/>of the body, that there was any blow to occasion his death? - A blow he received on the temple.</p>
               <p>That is not always the occasion of death? - Not always, it very frequently is.</p>
               <p>A person falling down may occasion a concussion of the brain? - It certainly may.</p>
               <p>But you never opened the head to see? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then there was no concussion of the brain, no fracture of the scull? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man had been fighting, got a black eye; would you tell from that what was the cause of his death? - No further than from the bruises.</p>
               <p>But bruises are not mortal in general; some subjects turn black much sooner than others? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Men who live hard, do not turn black so soon as you or I would? - No.</p>
               <p>You was not examined before the coroner? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon, I saw the body the day after the accident.</p>

               <p>What do you think was the occasion of the death? - I do not know, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Were there any external marks of injury? - There was a bruise on the left cheek bone, the only external mark of injury; I saw none else.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body throughout? - I examined it externally as well as I could, I did not open it, I did not think it of consequence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you observe any thing externally, that could distinguish it from a death by apoplexy? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>You have been long in the business? - Yes, more than twenty years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, we make no defence.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury, and then added:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen; this is the evidence against the prisoner; the crime charged is murder; as to that, there does not appear from the evidence, to have been any circumstances from which you will be at liberty to infer that he has been guilty of that crime; for in order to constitute the crime of murder, it must be done with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied; express malice is, where there has been any previous enmity between the parties, where there has been threats made use of, tending to shew a malicious intention in the mind, and some bad feeling of resentment which induced him to take vengeance for a supposed injury; malice implied, or constructive malice, is where the party is either in the prosecution of a felonious illegal act, and murder ensues; the law in that case, will impute malice though perhaps he had no actual antecedent malice against the party; so again, constructive malice may be where a person is acting in defiance of the law, or in opposition to the law, there the law will infer malice; but there is no pretence of any thing of the kind in the present case; neither is there any evidence from whence you can infer actual malice; for they were utter strangers, and this happened in course of words that fell between them, upon which they fell to fighting; therefore the utmost that this crime can amount to in point of law, is the crime of manslaughter; but there is another consideration which you must take into your minds, whether the death of the party happened from the blow that was given; or whether from any extraordinary exertion he might have died of an apoplexy or in a fit, or by breaking a blood vessel; so that if it is not imputable to any blow given from Ward, then you will find him not guilty; but if you think that death was owing to the blow he received, then you are to consider whether or no you will, or will not, find the prisoner guilty of manslaughter: as to that, where people happen to have words, and any sudden quarrel ensues, and death takes place from the blows; yet it can amount no higher than manslaughter, if they fight on equal terms and with equal weapons; and that was the case here; you find from some of the witnesses that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030029"/>deceased was the aggressor, and first all challenged the prisoner to fight for a guinea; but whether one way or whether the other way, does not make any material difference in the consideration of the law, for it can amount no higher than manslaughter in this case: most of the witnesses seem to say that the first challenge came on the part of the deceased, and not originally by Ward; in that case Swaine was most to blame; you find they fought perfectly on equal terms, and if you believe the witnesses, the deceased was the stronger man of the two, therefore they fought on equal terms; one or two of the witnesses have said, that before he hit him the last blow that he declined fighting any longer, and that he was not on the defensive; now whenever there has been time to cool, it has been said by the counsel, that in that case it shews malevolence by the party continuing to shew his resentment, when the other had declined the combat; but I do not think much about that, for you find the interval was exceedingly short indeed between their actual fighting and Swaine declining the combat; one of the witnesses has said that they fought to the last, there was no interval, but that of of merely going round the cart; another matter is the aggravation on the part of the deceased, by catching hold of Ward by the hair; now that in this science, which I am very sorry prevails so much in this kingdom as it does at present, it is not any honour at all to the civilisation of this country, and I wish it was laid aside; but if in the science of fighting, it is looked upon as unfair, it might be looked on by the prisoner as a strong aggravation on the part of the deceased, and must naturally raise his resentment; now supposing that to be the case, the interval was so very short; it is not such an interval as the law will consider sufficient for a man's warmth of temper to cool: the law makes that allowance for human frailty; (though to be sure every man ought to keep a guard over his passions) that when a thing is done in heat, and before a man has had time to cool, if death happens, the law will not impute it to any higher crime than manslaughter; therefore there does not seem to be any ground to infer upon that very short interval, if any there was; that he had sufficient time to cool; especially after receiving that fresh provocation of taking hold of him by the hair, which was almost the last thing that was done previous to giving him that blow; therefore at all events this crime cannot amount to more than manslaughter: Gentlemen, if on the other hand, you are of opinion the death was not owing to the blows and bruises he received; you will find the prisoner not guilty.</p>

               <p>The prisoner had missed his duty, and I was desired by Palmer to bring the prisoner to his house, on the 27th of April, the Sunday after the things were missed; when I brought him there, I asked him why he missed his duty; and he said Duckworth had told Palmer of the affair, and that made him afraid to return back.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He said they were not his stockings; I did not see them taken off, they were taken off next day.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Palmer deny the property to be his, when Mrs. Banks said she thought they were Palmer's? - He did not say positively either way, but that he had such a pair that his brother gave him.</p>

               <p>Do not the filings sometimes exceed in weight what you would expect, and sometimes fall short? - Sometimes they exceed, but very seldom; if there is not enough to answer the weight, we send them back to sweep the board to make up the weight.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the prosecutor, I melt the filings; for ten months past, we have found three ounces deficient in twelve pounds weight more than usual; when it was melted it was five pennyweights worse by assay, it should only be two pennyweights worse, because it had passed the hall; in consequence of which I put every man's work separate, I melted them afterwards, and every man's was right but the prisoner's, both in quality and weight; the prisoner's was half as much more waste than I expected, it was owing to some base metal that was put in it; the quality from one assay master was nineteen pennyweights worse in quality in one pound weight, besides the deficiency; I then made another assay by the Goldsmith's Company, and they made it, one ounce one pennyweight and an half worse; we then thought proper to watch. The prosecutor and his son were in the shop, I went down the shop and was close to the prisoner, he was looking at the prosecutor and son, and I saw him put something in his pocket from the hubbing-box; the prisoner turned and saw me, and looked confused; (describes the manner in which the prisoner did it); I called Mr. Burrows and son into the compting-house directly; when the prisoner's work came in that day, I examined the filings, and saw a quantity of lead or pewter in it; I then weighed him out some more; after tea time, about six or seven, he went to sweep his filings up, he took some oil from a crucible, and held it up in one hand, and

               <p>Is not melting silver into the form of an ingot the most saving way? - No.</p>
               <p>Were these filings produced to the magistrate in the state of filings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they now in the state of filings? - No, the magistrate said they had better be melted to prove the assay; these were not found upon him, they are what was produced from his work.</p>
               <p>How much were found upon him? - Four or five ounces at his lodgings, and six pennyweights on him.</p>

               <p>Cout. Do you keep any account of the number of those diamonds that you lay before your workmen? - No, it is impossible to do it; one of our young men was by, and I left him to attend him, a shopman, his name is

            ; on my return he said he had seen him take a diamond, and put it into his left hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Was this in hearing of the prisoner? - Yes: on which I said to the prisoner; it is a very odd thing, one of our people says, you have taken a diamond, and put it into your left hand waistcoat pocket; now turn out your pocket that we may see whether it is true or not; upon which he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and after fumbling about some time, he pulled the diamond out, which he threw on the table, and said there it is; he said he hoped I would excuse it; he made an open confession.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that diamond? - It is very difficult to swear to loose stones; but there is something particular in that diamond which makes me swear it is my diamond; there is something in the stone of a particular colour.</p>
               <p>Court. There was nothing passed between you and the prisoner, to induce you to believe from any thing he said, that it was not your property, but the property of another person? - Not the shadow of it, he confessed, and he said he had often robbed us.</p>
               <p>Had you previous to this confession made him any promise to shew him any favour? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Or threatened or frightened him into such confession? - No, nothing of that sort passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Jones, how long had this man worked for you? - A considerable number of years.</p>
               <p>Every body knows, Mr. Jones, that in your house you do a vast quantity of business, particularly in this way; how many thousand diamonds do you think might be produced to him for his choice? - I suppose in point of number there might be some thousands; but they were principally very small ones.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Jones, this man had been induced very much by the encouragement of your house to go into the business? - He was a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>I understand he was established in that business before your house employed him? - He was not confined to work for us, but he did a great deal for us.</p>
               <p>Did it ever happen to you to pay this man in any other way than by cash? - He frequently wanted diamonds, which he said was for a correspondent at York, and we sold him loose diamonds for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Then he was in the habit of buying loose diamonds for his own use? - Occasionally he did; whenever he took diamonds, they were immediately placed to his account.</p>
               <p>Upon this occasion had he any more diamonds in his pocket than the one that was produced to you? - Not loose, that I know of; but I suppose that he had diamonds to the value of seven hundred pounds to repair.</p>
               <p>I need hardly ask you then, whether at that time he was a man of good character, and in your confidence? - He was a man that we had confidence in, certainly, or we should not have done it.</p>
               <p>I observe that upon your coming in from the lady, who wanted you, you stated to him what had passed from Tate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Tate's conversation to you was not in his hearing? - I believe it was so low that he could not hear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Very few people have more experience in this trade than you have; I believe that unless there is a flaw in the stone, neither you nor any body else would venture to swear to a loose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030046"/>stone? - This has a colour which distinguishes it.</p>
               <p>Therefore it would be of the same class with others of the same colour? - There is something that would distinguish it, I mean to say that I had observed it before.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, as a man conversant in the trade, that it is your's? - I mean to say that I frequently have occasion to six loose diamonds; that to the best of my judgment I have more than once taken up that stone for different pieces of work, and found it so incompleat in colour that it would not do; I do not take upon me to say-positively to it, and yet I say there is something particular in the stone, by which to the best of my judgment I knew it to be mine; there was not any of my other workmen present at that time; I have many others, and they are all supplied in the same manner.</p>
               <p>I believe that occasionally the different shopmen, and other persons in your shop, shew those diamonds? - We keep the key of them, either Mr. Jefferies or myself; he is not here; he very seldom is in the shop, he does not attend much; he does sometimes.</p>
               <p>In point of fact he has access to that drawer? - Yes, but he had been out of town; he was in town at that time.</p>
               <p>Then it is quite impossible that you could swear he had not been there half an hour before.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner at this time make any pretence that he had taken this diamond with a view to set it in the ear-rings to supply the place of those that were lost, or any thing to that effect? - He did not.</p>

               <p>I live in Kingsland-road, I am a jeweller; the prisoner served his time to me, I have known him ever since the year 1765, he was bound apprentice to me, I had four score pounds apprentice see with him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030047"/>sustained a very good character I assure you; when he had served three years and a half of his time, I had occasion to go to Paris, and I had so good an opinion of him that I employed him to pay all my workmen, and he had the liberty of my iron chest, and all my diamonds, and every thing; and he went to my bankers in order to pay and receive money, and he conducted himself faithfully; and after he had served his time I employed him as a journeyman four years, till he set up for himself; I would intrust him now with a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Was he a man likely to pilfer a diamond out of a drawer? - I have not the idea of it; and I do not believe he would have taken a grain of gold, much less a diamond.</p>

               <p>I live at Walworth, I was formerly in the jewellery and goldsmith business in the Poultry; I have known the prisoner eighteen years, he bore the best of characters, I have employed him, and with very great confidence, I have always found him a man of very great integrity; I never found any of the workmen that I employed stricter or juster in their accounts; at this present moment, was he out of this situation, I would entrust him with any property whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I need not ask you if he was a man likely to steal a small stone out of a drawer? - Very far from it; I could not have suspected him or doubted him; I would intrust him with any sum at this present time, if he was extricated from this.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Are you sure that this is all that you know about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now in the first place; what is this young lad? - A coach carver.</p>
               <p>Your husband is in the same business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In whose employ is this young man? - One Mr. Harris, in Shoreditch; he was his apprentice, my husband had known him some time; my husband works at Mr. Savage's in Queen-street; he never worked for my husband; he was not in my husband's employ.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively, or only to say that you do not know he was not in your husband's employ? - He was not, positively he was not.</p>
               <p>How came Mr. Harris, his master, to call upon your husband to threaten him for detaining his apprentice? - He never called at our house.</p>
               <p>And told him that if that young lad did not quit his employment, he would bring an action against him? - He never was in our house in his life, nor I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your house this day? - Most part of the day; from ten o'clock in the morning, till four o'clock in the afternoon; it was his own fault; you know; my husband asked him if he was going to work; he went out with my husband that day.</p>
               <p>Do you know the christian name of the person you rent the room of? -

               <p>How long was it before you went to your drawers? - Immediately as I went up stairs; the drawers were open, and a gown and petticoat of mine that were in the same drawer were left, and the clothes were gone; my husband and me knew where his master lived; he was taken up Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>There was no search after the young man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You have had some little squables with Mr. Harris? - No Sir, never in my life; Mr. Harris objected to this boy being out of work.</p>
               <p>Did he accuse you with that? - He could not.</p>

               <p>I lost this wine out of my house, from my cellar; it was sometime past, I missed a very large quantity of wine; and on parting with my butler, I desired a particular account might be taken of every bottle of wine to be given in charge to the new butler; the prisoner came into my service the 24th of January last; the account was taken whilst he was in my service; on the 1st of May, when I went into the country, the prisoner (after he had been discharged my service, not for any fault or suspicion of the kind) I told him he might stay in my house till the Monday, when I should return to town to dinner, and in the afternoon I would pay him his wages before I went out of town; on that day I ordered a pipe of port and a pipe of madeira to be bottled off; when I came back on the Monday, this man was to receive his wages; on the Monday he did not stay in my house, but went to see some friends; he did not return on Monday, but on Tuesday morning I ordered him to be detained; I went down stairs and insisted on having his box opened, he said he had not the key of his box, but he would go and get it; I would not suffer him to go, and the box was accordingly opened by force, and he took all the things out himself, clothes, shirts, and different things, and at the bottom of the box there was a good deal of hay, and among that hay were eight bottles of wine which he took out himself; they were all wrapped up in separate papers, waste paper which I had sent into the kitchen; one had a seal upon it; in consequence of this, I took him to Bow-street; at the desire of the prisoner, I saw him up stairs in my parlour in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030050"/>presence of my servant; I promised him favour; I said, as I have been robbed of a great deal of wine, very like you may turn King's evidence, as it will be better for you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I collect Sir, from your sending your servant to see if you had any wine of that kind, you did not know whether you had or not? - I did not, I had a very good opinion of the prisoner; I meant to keep him in my service, and I told him when he would go away, I should give him a a very good character; he did not go for any misconduct at all.</p>

               <p>I am butler to Mr. Lushington; I found some wine in the prisoner's box, as described by Mr. Lushington, there were eight bottles.</p>
               <p>Could you tell all that by the appearance of that wine, to whom it belonged? - In my opinion to my master.</p>
               <p>Why do you think so? - The bottle of claret was the same as some in the cellar; nobody but me had the key of this cellar that I know of; I had been in the house about two months.</p>
               <p>Had you such an account of your master's wine as to tell whether any was missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find the wine correspond with that book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any wine missing in the cellar? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was the same quantity of wine missing in the cellar as described in the indictment? - A great deal more.</p>
               <p>Was there any claret missing? - I cannot say there was any missing from the claret binn, there was not; I found in one binn port, claret and sherry intermixed; and I believe madeira also in the same binn; the late butler might have done that; I took the stock regularly from binn to binn; this man had nothing to do with the cellar.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon it all as one wine? - I did not know that it was mixed, I reckoned it all as sherry, I have always accounted for it as sherry, but there were some odd bottles that were intermixed, which would have come at the last.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty, whether any bottles of wine were missing from this binn? - Yes, there were, but I cannot say how many, I believe there were nine bottles missing from this binn, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Had that the seal of Shallico's claret? - I believe it had, I never

               <p>Prosecutor. This has the seal of Shallico upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say Sir, you apprehend you are able to state that wine was missing out of that binn; you are not able, by your account to state that any claret was missing? - No, I am not; I took account of it as sherry.</p>
               <p>Your claret in your other cellar does not appear to have any taken from it? - Not any, that is Shallico's claret and is all right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to leave it all to the counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Calton. I keep the key of the cellar, they are open binns; the lock of the cellar has been examined, and it does not appear that it has been broke open at all; I never suspected the man of being a dishonest man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had you and this young man lived together? - Six weeks.</p>

               <p>How often had you quarrelled in the the six weeks? - We had not quarelled above once; that was a good while before he left his place.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he gave warning to his master, because he and you could not agree together? - I do not know that he gave warning; he did not bring down his box to be searched; he was taken in Grub-street, within a few hundred yards of my master's house; a milk-man who was speaking to him, came and told us.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner waited till you and the milk-man came back to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might that take? - It took about a quarter of an hour to come and go back.</p>
               <p>He was where the milk-man had described he left him, he was standing by a publick-house? - Near a publick-house.</p>
               <p>Was this room locked up usually in which you and he slept? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>It is a publick tavern that you live at? - Yes. Both my boxes were locked.</p>
               <p>They were not broke open? - I found them locked, and a difficulty to unlock them again.</p>
               <p>This comb is worth a penny I see by the commitment? - It is worth six-pence.</p>
               <p>Have not you quarrelled more than once? - No more than once.</p>
               <p>What was that about? - I do not know indeed; I made a complaint one morning about the fire not being made, and the water not being boiled; he continued in service a month after that; I was neither pleased nor displeased.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Going on nine months, and he six weeks.</p>

               <p>These two lads were both servants to me, the prosecutor and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Rowe going out on Sunday the 10th of May? - I do.</p>
               <p>After he went out, do you know what became of the prisoner? - The prisoner came to me about an hour after the prosecutor went out, and he said, I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030052"/>be glad to know Sir, whether you intend to continue me in your service; for if you will, I will send into the country for my clothes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had there been any talk of his going away before? - None at all; only I told him a fortnight before, that if he did not mend, I should not keep him.</p>
               <p>For what fault had you reprimanded him? - For staying of errands and being lazy, and laying in bed of mornings, by complaints of the bar-keeper, and other servants; I told him I did not mean to continue him, he did not suit me; he said he had another place, to go to be a book-keeper to a carrier, and he must leave my place directly, in order to be there on Monday morning; I told him I thought it was an extraordinary manner of leaving his place at that time, and I should not discharge him then; he went up stairs and brought down a bundle, in the space of five minutes he brought me a piece of paper with figures on it, and said his wages came to so much; I threw it back, and said I should not look at it; he said he knew how to get his wages, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Then you understood by him, that if you had been willing to continue him in your service, he would have staid? - Perfectly, from what he said; when the prosecutor came back, he missed his money; the prisoner was brought to my house on Friday following, I was present; he did not seem to say any thing; I saw the constable search him, and a leather bag was found upon him, with a few shillings; I did not pay any attention to what he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you recollect which of your servants complained most of this man? - I believe the cook.</p>
               <p>He was porter in the house, therefore it was his business to have eased the work of the others? - It was his business to have done every thing that was required of him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner and the prosecutor never had a quarrel that you heard? - I have heard them have some words, but never any that I took notice of.</p>
               <p>He never complained to you? - No, that I am quite sure of, he never complained at all.</p>
               <p>After this money was lost, it was mentioned to every body about the house, and all the trades people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect the expression you used to him about a month before? - I told him if he did not do his business better, if he did not mind better, I should discharge him.</p>
               <p>You did not examine his bundle? - No, I did not, he said I might look into his bundle, for he had nothing but his own. The prisoner had been sent out and received a guinea or two.</p>

               <p>I was bound over, but I was subpoened on the part of the city yesterday, and I could not attend, and I know nothing but ordering him to be searched.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any thing remarkable in the money you lost? - No, it was all new gold, excepting two guineas, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>What sort of a half guinea was the half guinea? - It was a new half guinea of the last coin.</p>
               <p>Strait or crooked? - I believe it was crooked.</p>
               <p>What sort of a comb was it that you lost? - A large comb like a mane-comb, quite a wide tooth comb, there were two of the teeth broke out.</p>
               <p>Where were they out, at the middle or one end? - At one end.</p>
               <p>Was the end broke off? - Only the teeth.</p>
               <p>Both ends of the comb then were entire, but two teeth broke out at one end? - Yes, it is the thick end tooth, and the one next to it was broke; I put the comb and the razor, and all the things together into my box; it was locked up, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your razor and the comb were together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your razor was worth as much again as your comb? - I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>That was left behind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that comb, and tell me whether you know it or not? - Yes, it is my comb, I am sure of it; it was in the same box with the money; it could not go into the little box, it was in the large box.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever lend him that comb? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury; I shall take it as a particular favour, if you will be kind enough to permit me to read my defence.</p>
               <p>Court. By all means, but you had better let your Counsel see it first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030054"/>The prisoner then read his defence as follows:</p>
               <p>With respect to the comb, it was taken out of my pocket either by a gentleman or the constable, when searching me at the Globe Tavern, in the room with and in the presence of the waiter, my prosecutor, and then and there returned; it was again taken out of my pocket, together with a knife by Mr. Leicester, the turnkey at the Poultry Compter, and there returned; a gentleman, then present, he who took it from me at the Globe Tavern, when returned thereto, asked the waiter if he had lost any articles besides the money; for he observed I had two combs; immediately the waiter, my prosecutor, answered, that he had lost one, and in consequence thereof came down to the compter a second time, and on its being re-produced, instantly laid claim to the same. Now I would ask him, why he did not lay claim to it either the first or second time it was produced, as well as the third time? if he says that it was not found and produced, how could that gentleman see it, and inform him thereof, as he acknowledged, if I mistake not, at Guildhall? and if he replies, that he did not see it; I would ask him if he was not present every time I was searched? and why the chief person concerned could not see it as well as another stranger thereto? But again, suffer me to enquire as it is of the utmost importance; if, on supposition I had stole this money which I am charged with, may we not reasonably suppose that where he deposited such an amount as fifteen or sixteen guineas, that other articles of value would be deposited? and I would ask, as we had the whole room for our own use, and as he had other boxes larger than that wherein he says these articles were deposited; if it be agreeable to reason or common sense to suppose for a moment, either that I should fix my inclination on nothing but an old broken comb, scarce worth noticing, being valued in my commitment at only one penny; or that he ever would deposit in the same place with gold and silver an old comb. There is another circumstance I would beg leave to remark, and that is, supposing I was guilty of taking this comb out of his box, when it was produced and re-produced, can any person suppose I was so destitute of common sense, as to keep it in my possession, when I had such opportunities of destroying it, especially if I had been guilty of such an offence? it must of course occur to my mind that, in case it was found upon me, it would be a certain means of my conviction; but, on the contrary, is it not more reasonable to suppose that it fell into my hands, in the manner described by my honourable friend Mr. Garrow, (and as such at the awful day of retribution it will be found); especially as the contrary supposition proves to a demonstration, that to take an article, such as it was, out of others of infinitely greater value, that I was the veriest fool in nature, and that I stole for stealing sake. Permit me now to say a few words in explanation, with regard to calling no person to my character; permit me in few words to explain: it is little more than half a year since I came to this city; and during the time I have been here, I have formed no acquaintance with any, save with those who were absolutely necessary in transacting the common affairs of life; but I appeal to Mr. Herd himself, my prosecutor, friend and master, whether in any single instance, during the time I was employed by him, I ever wronged him of the value of a farthing, or ever in transacting his affairs, such as carrying out wine, and giving receipts for the same, I ever behaved in any other than an honest, sober, and upright manner, and what was agreeable to the strictest honor, justice and morality: indeed if any thing detrimental to my character could have been found since I came here, it would not have been wanting, as the utmost vigilance, which the most inveterate malice, rancour and revenge could effect, have been used in order to bring to light any thing which might be of prejudice to me at this day: but I bless heaven, that from my youth up to this day, my life has been such, that no person ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030055"/>could, or ever did (save in this instance) charge me with any thing contrary to justice and morality. Gentlemen of the Jury, permit me in the last place to address a few words with the greatest deference and respect to you: I thank you for thus candidly hearing me so far; and I bless God and the legislature, that Englishmen are permitted to be heard: as a man, and a member of the constitution, my life is very very dear unto me; and I flatter myself, that in consideration thereof, you will from motives of pity and humanity, condescend to heat me a few moments longer: see me a stranger in a strange place, unknown to every one that can be of service to me in this awful situation; cut off from my friends by a long and inseparable distance; no persons in this city who know me, that can speak in my behalf, I mean they are not qualified so to do, for I am told that none but house-keepers can; else I could procure many of unsullied reputation, who would be glad to do it. In this deplorable situation, it is easy to conceive how acute, how sensible the pain must be which preys upon the vital spirits, and at times almost robs me of reason: In consequence thereof, to his lordship, and to your consideration, I submit with the utmost humility, what I have already said; and to God and to you I trust for a verdict consonant to my uprightness and innocence. Let not wealth and power triumph over poverty and weakness; nor rancour ever crush and consign the innocent and helpless to destruction and oblivion: Conscious of the rectitude of my conduct, I conclude with resting my cause upon him whose tribunal is founded in infallible uprightness,</p>
               <p>"where the wicked</p>
               <p>"cease from troubling, and where the</p>
               <p>"weary are for ever at rest." Denying having any more money, if he did ask me, was owing to the confusion.</p>
               <p>Court. Hand me up your defence.</p>
               <p>(Handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. He refers to the manner described by you, Mr. Garrow; I have not heard you.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you state the manner in which you became possessed of that comb?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when I was porter to the Globe Tavern, in the place assigned to me to clean the knives, my master's shoes, and every necessary article, the waiter used to come into that place to dress his hair; he generally made use of a comb, one part wider and one smaller; this comb lay there from the time I first came to them, within a day or two of my departure; I never saw any person use it, I thought that comb was the property of the other porter; when I saw it laying about for some time; one time I picked it up out of the street, I had swept it out, and I took it as my own, not thinking it was the waiter's, because I never saw him use it.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand from what you have stated, that you have no witnesses here.</p>

               <p>Do you cut the skin off the neck of all you kill? - I do, all that I leave at that slaughter-house; I swear the two sides to be mine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the whole, or only a part? - I found the whole in four quarters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This was not an intire sow? - No, Sir, the intrails were taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you sell a dead sow with the intrails? - No, I sell only the hog or sow dressed for sale; I buy a live hog or sow, and kill it and sell it as other pork butchers do.</p>
               <p>Suppose you sell a sow dead, do you call it pork or a dead sow? - I call it a dead sow, because she was too heavy to be called pork.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This cannot be called a dead sow, being robbed of its intrails, it is no longer an animal; the feet and ears, head and entrails were all cut off; therefore it is no longer an animal; if you were to bargain with a man, would you ask for a dead sow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you think that I performed my contract to sell you a sow without a head, ears, feet and intrails; was it a part of a dead sow, or a whole dead sow? - It was only a part of a dead sow.</p>
               <p>When had you seen this last? - On Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Did you cut it up yourself? - I took the entrails out myself, when I first saw it; the two fore quarters were found upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Where did you shew the prosecutor these parts of the sow you found? - In the watch-house; he said there was a bit cut out of the skin of the neck, and out of the hind quarter and off the tail.</p>

               <p>On the morning of the 27th of May, I received information that Mr. Salt was in town with a cart with something in a sack, and that he had gone with his cart to Mr. Pellett's, an ironmonger in St. John-street; I went there to know what he had brought, and they said he had brought a quantity of lead; I desired to see it; I saw a quantity of lead laying wet and dirty, which the man said the prisoner had brought there; I saw Mr. Pellett, and told him my suspicion; Mr. Pellett ordered it to be marked and brought to my house, then I went to Barnet and enquired, and was further informed; I met the prisoner and the cart on Finchly Common; I secured him; coming along to town in the coach, he asked me if I could get him admitted King's evidence; the next morning he jumped out, and endeavoured to make his escape; and he endeavoured a second time to make his escape, and struck at me several times; he then asked me if I could get him admitted an evidence; I took him before Mr. Justice Trignet; the Justice asked him how he came by that lead; he said he had had it in his well a year and a quarter, that was the reason he gave for its being so wet, when he sold it; I then took the lead down to Mount House in the chaise, and in the presence of Mr. Lambert, and Butler the gardener, I fixed it to the place from whence it apparently came from; it is the same length and width as the premises, and the same nail-holes and hold-fast holes; upon a second examination before the magistrate, the lead was then again produced, Mr. Salt said that it did not come off of the green-house, and that he bought it, but refused to give any account to the magistrate where; I have the lead here.</p>
               <p>You knew Salt before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Fifty such men as he could not have caught me, if I had had a mind to run away; I want to ask him whether he did not swear wrongfully? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>- LAMBERT sworn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know him.</p>
               <p>I live near the spot; I was present when the lead was compared; I wish not to pay the same compliment to the prisoner, that he has to me, of knowing me, for I do not know him, but by hear say; I went to see if this lead did match; and it matched so particularly well, that in my opinion I have not the least doubt, but it came from that green house, in every particular; and sometimes, I know in a court where constables come to be examined, that their evidence is not always right; and I was determined to go and see, I took a ladder and went on top of the green house and measured it myself, and I marked it, and the lead is here, so far as I suppose, with a deal of modesty to the prisoner, I think it is the lead.</p>

               <p>My Lord, on the Wednesday as Lucy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030060"/>took me, I had been buying some clothes in Rosemary-lane; I keep a broker's shop; I am a taylor, and deal in all sorts of rags, linen, and every thing; I got out of the cart to rest the horse, as my wife is very heavy, and Lucy came and tapped me on the shoulder; says he, I want you on suspicion of stealing lead; says I, I never was a thief in my life, nor stole any lead; says he, you must go with me; Mr. Tarling, the hay salesman, says, do not you make any reflections; Lucy has used you very ill, and if you want me, I will come and speak at the Old-bailey; and I would not have come with him, if he had not said so; he knows I never stole any property; I never was tried or apprehended at a bar in my life; as for them two men, one is a tallow chandler; he makes candles at twelve o'clock at night; I told him I had some moulds to sell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambert. My Lord, I would not have mentioned it otherwise, but this man has been on board the ballast lighter before, and he says he never was tried before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was caught making candles in the night; my lawyer does not know the bill is found; or Mr. Tarling would have come, Counsellor

There is only this one pattern of this lace, I had it to shew Captain Campbell, I left it on my parlour table, and I am sure this is the same lace, there were about twelve yards of it; this cloak was part of the property she took away; the prisoner fell on her knees and asked my mercy.</p>

             sitting at a table, and before them this paper book, and these two cards; it appears on the face of them that they had been casting up some stock or another, where it is mentioned, all that I can explain in them papers, bulls and half bulls are crowns and half crowns, in coiner's language, and a bob is a shilling, flat is metal; but I do not know of my own knowledge, only from informations and confessions.</p>
               <p>Court. By what means have you known that those phrases, such as bull and bob, bear a meaning so very different? - By experience in court, and by a number of people that I have heard so use them; I have heard them from five hundred people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit whether this is admissible?</p>
               <p>Court. There is no way by which a man can acquire the knowledge of language but by information; originally all our knowledge of language must come from the information of others; I do not know that bull signifies a horned beast, otherwise than by information; we have heard the word traps given in evidence a thousand times, and never objected to, and a variety of other cant phrases that are as well understood among a certain set of people, as the common words of the English Language; all language is arbitrary; I think it is admissible evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. Supposing a piece of metal is as thick as my two fingers, and we wish to reduce it to the thickness of one of these blanks, it is taken to the flatting-mill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And flat has nothing of criminality annexed to it, because it may be used for buttons to a coat, or for a variety of other purposes.</p>

            ; I asked him where he lived, and he refused to tell me; I saw all the things found, and I can describe them: upon the prisoner Denton, when he was searched, there were found a latch-key, and a key that opened the door of the three pair of stairs, and some good shillings and half crowns; two half crowns, one sixpence and two shillings, appearing to be reduced on one side, nothing else that I recollect on his person; there is a temporary door at the end of the passage, one was the key of that door, which prevented access to any part of the house but the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you go through the back-parlour at any other door? - No; to go up stairs you must come into the shop and into the passage, and open this door; and the other key belong to the three pair of stairs back-room; in that back garret was found a cutting-out press fixed, dies and all fixed; the cutters were withinside ready for work; there was a large quantity of blanks, some only cut out, and some edged; there were these two turn benches, I believe they call them so that use them; one of them was fixed; it is what the watch-makers use also, any thing where nice turning is required.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030065"/>Court. Was there anything fixed in the turn-bench when you found it? - No, I do not recollect there was; there were two of them in the garret, I found an instrument, it is used for two purposes, one for making, and the other for closing the edges of the metal; I do not know the name of this instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this last instrument used in the mint, or is it an instrument new in the mint? - It is the first I ever saw of the kind.</p>
               <p>Then it is not a known instrument? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Nicholls, Monier of the Mint. It is not an instrument used by us.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clark. Is there any machinery belonging to it, or does it work by hand? - It works by hand; there was in the garret eight or ten pounds weight of cecil, and some counterfeit dollars, and three half crown pieces; they are counterfeit, but they are plated on both sides, from that it is turned over and put into this tool, that closes it, the other makes the impression on the edge after it is closed; there were some finished half crowns in the garret, but the plate was taken off at the edge, it was in the same state.</p>
               <p>Court. This appears to be broke by some accident? - Here is two of them finished, and one perfect; one is that with the groove in the edge, the other finished but broke in the edge, and the other quite perfect; the one that is quite perfect I think any body would take it; there were a number of little things that are made use of, and there was a boil that they make use of, I believe, but I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>Was the cecil and blanks that were found of the same sort of metal plated on both sides? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Those blanks do not stand in need of the materials for colouring? - No, not all; I found several other little tools, such as gravers, which are used in other businesses, what they hold at the edge for cutting the grooves; the graver is applicable to the turn-bench; there was some blacking, there was no use for it unless it was to make them look old; these things are applicable to the instrument used for making and closing; I think Denton gave the key of the bureau to Carpmeal; I heard Denton say so before the magistrate; the prisoner Denton acknowledged this key to be his before the justice, with a view of discharging his wire, who was in custody; in that bureau I found these dies, and I found these, which are clearly taken down on one side to make the dies from, they are good coin; in order to make the dies, one raising one way, and the other going in the other, the impressions could not come up; if it was wrought work on each side, it would sink this way, as well as the other, so that the impression is made on one side only of the piece.</p>
               <p>Court. And that piece which you suppose the dies has been made from, then, is good coin? - Yes, the impression is totally defaced; on one side quite smooth; I fancy it is turned or smoothed down before they use it.</p>
               <p>Why is it necessary to smooth that down? - It is necessary to make the impression stronger.</p>
               <p>Have you compared these dies with this piece? - Yes I have, but one shilling being struck from a die of the Tower, is so exact that I cannot venture to swear whether that very die was made from that piece of money, it is impossible, but it evidently appears as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that, is that die made from that puncheon? - It has every appearance of it; here are some shillings which are finished (counterfeits) which I found in the bureau; I have not examined them with the dies.</p>
               <p>Court. Compare this shilling with that die, and see if you can form any judgment? - I can only say, that they have been struck from such another as this, if not from this; I can carry it no further than your sight; they fit in.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these two shillings with that die? - I do not think they were struck from that, they have a different appearance; I found nothing else in the bureau; Carpmeal found a great many things upon John<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030066"/>Jones; two or three counterfeit dollars, and some papers of account, like those found on the table; I do not recollect any coin found on him; there were two keys, one a latch key, that opens that temporary door in the passage, and another key and a padlock key, which opened a padlock which was in the cellar; the padlock was on a vault under the court, and that was on the inner cellar door where there was a stamping press fixed, and a pair of dies in for striking shillings, and several more dies which will be produced for shillings and half crowns; some metal that had been struck up with the impression of dollars, and some with the impression of half crowns; there was no counterfeit shillings found in that cellar, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had the cellar the appearance of being worked in? - Oh dear yes! there is no doubt but they had worked there, the place was all over grease and tallow; but I could not tell when they had been at work there, I should imagine they would be three persons from what has appeared in the court, and what I have seen and known.</p>

             I found several counterfeit shillings, to appearance they were struck from the dies that were found in the cellar; I cannot speak certainly to them, I have not examined them; and there was a broken die found upon him; nothing else but a piece of metal that the die seemingly was made from; in the three pair of stairs front room, which was not locked up, there was some of them tools, which are used in the milling instrument, and there was a lathe; there were several blank puncheons made into dies; in the two pair of stairs back room, there were flasks of sand and every thing for casting, and some patterns of puncheons, the flasks and sand had been used to cast the puncheons in; I do not recollect any thing else material in any part of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, one of the Prisoners Counsel. You say this is plated on the outside? - Apparently so.</p>
               <p>You have not taken off the outside plate to assay whether it is plated or not? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Nor anybody to your knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. This metal is plated manifestly, with a metal having the colour of silver; now the blanks found are cut out of a piece so plated, therefore they have at least the colour of silver; therefore, whether they are silver or not is totally immaterial; the cecils themselves have compleatly the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoners Counsel. If the jury are of that opinion, to be sure there is an end of the objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You admit that this turn-bench is used in several businesses, particularly in watch-making? - The turn-bench undoubtedly is used in several businesses; but there are some things belonging to that turn-bench, that I never saw in any turn-bench before, and I have seen ten thousand; it is those two centers; turn-benches in general run on centres of their own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Still it is but an improved turn-bench, that is all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you found the turn-bench, you say there was nothing at all fixed in it? - Not to my knowledge, the turn-bench is screwed into a vice, and whatever is put in, is put between those two pieces of brass, and then it is turned round, the centres are worked between two points in common.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. For the ordinary purposes of a turn-bench; this is an improved turn-bench? - Yes, a watch-maker could not use it in this state; their's is more nice, that may turn round the sixteenth of an inch on one side.</p>
               <p>You found nobody whatever making use of this press? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door open? - No.</p>

               <p>I went to this house with Mr. Clark and the other officers, and searched William<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030068"/>Jones, and I found upon him this bad shilling, and a piece of metal which is broke, it appears to be part of a broken die; if you look particularly in one part of it, you will find a fleur de luce in one part of it; some good shillings, and two guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Court to Shallard. What metal do you look upon this to be? - I am no judge of metal.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to be silver.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to Mr. Clark.)</p>
               <p>What metal do you take that to be? - I suppose it to be silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Clark. Look at that money? - I should suppose them to be good shillings; four of these are counterfeit shillings, one is a blank, and the other has an impression such as they make the dies from; there is every appearance that that shilling is struck from that die; this part is not so visible.</p>
               <p>Can you say with any degree of certainty, whether that shilling appears to be struck from that die? - I rather think it is; it is rather too much to be positive, but it has every appearance of being so, but I think it is too far for any man to swear to.</p>
               <p>Then your evidence is this, that it has every appearance of being struck from this die, but it is going too far to swear positively? - Yes, it is; I would not swear it upon any consideration.</p>
               <p>These are bad shillings, give me the reverse die that was in this press; can you form any judgement with respect to that? - It is almost impossible, as these sort of gentlemen work at their business, and these sort of dies are not so true as they should be; therefore you see one side may come up and the other not, in the shilling you will find one of the sides is not up.</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is perfectly visible on both? - Then I have not seen it; I have compared the head side (looks at it by a glass), there is a singular circumstance in this, that three of the quarters of the arms are rather visible, and one seems to be weaker; these blanks were found in the garret.</p>
               <p>What metal are they made of? - Why Sir, I have not a doubt, though it has been disputed here, but that it is plated on both sides with silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think there is much reason to doubt that.</p>
               <p>What are these blank six-pences? - I rather think they are silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I think in the explanation you gave of the cant word bulls; what did that signify? - Crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Bobs you said, signified shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I fancy you are not in this case so accurate as to cant language, as to the other parts of the case; let me look at the little book now? - I never looked at it.</p>
               <p>It cannot be as Mr. Clark has understood it to be; it is clear that this part of the evidence can have no effect, unless it is accurately explained; and it is clear that Mr. Clark has misunderstood the language used for bulls, if that has an application of the kind, that it is supposed to have; it cannot mean crowns, but must mean guineas; for here are in both the accounts, the book and the paper; one, bulls 25, and the other, bulls 25 pieces, valued at 26 l. 5 s. then there are bobs which are supposed to be shillings, 970 both in the book and in Jones's paper 970, 28 l. 5 s. 10 d. if they were shillings, it would be 48 l. 10 s. the bobs will not do for any current coin in this kingdom, it will not answer; therefore in whatever sense others have used these words, it is perfectly clear, that these people have not used them in that sense; that takes off the application, it is an account of some business, in which they do not make use of the usual language.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It may smuggled tobacco, and obscene books, or any thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. An unfinished blank which might be manufactured from any other tools of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. This is it.</p>
               <p>Court. How are you able to say that was manufactured from the tools up stairs; - It is impossible for me to say; it is edged the same, and it throws up a ridge, that where ever manufactured, it must have an instrument of that kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It amounts to this; that it might be manufactured with these tools, or with some other tools of a similar sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, and it appears very clearly to have a double edge; it is clear this blank is plated metal joined at the edges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is this counterfeit money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What metal do you conceive these base metal pieces found in the cellar to be? - I look upon them to be a metal of copper and brass mixed together, but merely for trying the dies; when the dies are not level, one bears on the other, and the impression comes up stronger; therefore they take up a piece of metal to try them.</p>
               <p>Therefore this never could be made into silver coin? - No, not as it appears to me; clearly not, as to anything that appears here.</p>

               <p>How are those presses applicable to that business? - Certainly, in cutting out the heads for saddle nails, and striking them and ornaments for saddles, and various other articles of plated goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We shall not trouble you with any witnesses.</p>
               <p>The learned Judge then summed up the evidence, and observed, that in order to convict the prisoners, the jury must be satisfied of some specific act of coining.</p>

               <p>Court. You call them dies or puncheons? - If they were dies, the head would be reversed, the shilling is the puncheon, and that makes the die.</p>
               <p>This which is a good shilling was made use of as a puncheon to make the die? - Not a doubt of it; these two were found in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. If I recollect your evidence right, there were no dies found but in the bureau, not in the cellar? - No; the bureau Denton had the key of; and of the cellar-door Jones had the key.</p>
               <p>Look at that half crown, would that make an an impression? - Yes it would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. One is a good shilling, and the other is a dye which they say is produced by it.</p>

             did not know that these dies were in his bureau; now if you knew that, it is impossible to say, that being in the bureau of his own house, of which he had the key, they were not in his custody and possession; the evidence therefore is, if you are satisfied, first that they have the resemblance, and are satisfied that he knew they were in his bureau, having the key; that to be sure is very strong evidence against him, he knowingly having, in his possession that, which to possess is high treason.

            , the evidence is this; you see it was not the house of Jones that they were found in, but Jones had a key which opened the door which gave access to this place, where they were found; he had in his pocket the key of the cellar in which was the stamping-press with some dies, and in which were other dies answering: if you are satisfied that they do answer the description in the indictment; you are therefore to consider whether they were or were not in the possession of Jones as well as of Denton; they were not in his house; but he had a key which opened the door where they were; now that would be open still to another question, whether Jones knew what was in that cellar; there is no direct evidence that he had ever opened that cellar, or been in it; what he had to do with the key, if he had not, does not appear: in point of fact, he had the key of the place in which these were locked up in his possession; if while he had that key; he was a stranger to what was doing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030072"/>in the cellar; and it does not appear that he had ever made use of that key, nor how long he had had it; nor does it appear whether Jones did or did not lodge at the place where he said he did, there is no evidence one way or the other as to that: now as to the things found on Jones, there is no counterfeit money except dollars found on Jones; there is no counterfeit half crown nor counterfeit shilling; so that there is nothing found on Jones actually corresponding with any of these dies; these dies are produced, you will judge whether there can be any doubt that they have the similitude of the lawful coin, and then you will judge first as to Denton, and then as to Jones. There is an observation stated by the prisoner Denton upon the metal, of which these stamps is made, which he suggests is too soft to make the impression upon other metal; I doubt a little whether that observation is founded in fact; you are to judge of it, but you are to consider this also, that there is a count in the indictment stating, not that this die was capable of making the impression only; but that this die had upon it the impression: now that it had some impression there is no doubt, and you will judge that that impression, is an impression resembling the coin of this kingdom. Gentlemen, you will take the whole into your consideration; if you can find any reasonable ground to doubt, you will acquit one or both the prisoners; but you must convict one or both of them if you can find no reasonable ground to doubt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. All those sheep were your property, Mr. Bennett? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you any persons concerned with you in the trade of drover? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>In driving so large a stock, some of them will get astray? - No, if there was a few it might be done, but being so many together, they will keep to one another, it is impossible they should ever get away one from another; I have had two thousand together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030073"/>and never lost any of them; it is not usual, that I swear positively.</p>
               <p>Who counted this stock? - I counted them myself; I set out from my own house, five miles from Whitechapel-church; my servant when he came to market told me that there was so many; I told them over when I came to market, I counted them when they were at home, and when they came to market; I never trust to my servants, I counted them at home on the Sunday night before they came to market.</p>
               <p>Who set out with them? - My man set out with them, not myself; I came after them with some bullocks to market, I did not come from home till twelve, the sheep set out about eight, my man is here; I have only one man as a servant, I have others that work for me, and assist in collecting, and folding my cattle, and they did on this occasion; they did not assist in counting them, I counted them myself; they divide them and tell them over, and then I tell them over afterwards; I count them at home as they run out of the gate.</p>
               <p>Then you pretend to say that they running through a gate, you are accurate in counting them? - Yes, there were twenty-three score and seventeen.</p>
               <p>I believe in telling, you now and then reckon more than twenty to the score? - No, never.</p>
               <p>You know nothing as to Jacobs? - No.</p>
               <p>You found these in Sillitoe's premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One thing, I confess, struck me a little, you said they were concealed in his place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, on your oath, whether they were in any other place than what his cattle is usually put into, which he receives as a butcher? - It was a little bit of a pound, it is paled up pretty high, that nobody can see them backwards.</p>
               <p>Was not this cattle in the ordinary place in which he keeps his cattle in the course of his business? - I cannot say that they were in any other place.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, whether this cattle, which you state to have been concealed, was in any other place than that in which the man, in the fair course of his business, usually keeps his cattle? - I cannot say no otherwise, only as that place was, they were in that place.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that they were concealed in any place, in which a person going to this man in the course of his business, would not expect to find cattle? - They were in a back place; I can say no otherwise.</p>
               <p>You cannot misconceive the purport of this question; were they, or were they not in that part of his premises in which, according to the course of his trade cattle would be found? - They were adjoining to his house.</p>
               <p>Is that an answer that an honest man would give respecting a man's liberty for fourteen years; were they or were they not, I am sure (it is a pertinent question) in that part of Sillitoe's premises, in which any person's cattle, in the course of their business, would be found? - If we had not had an idea, we could not have found them.</p>
               <p>I put the question again? - I found them in the place where he always puts them as he tells me.</p>

               <p>You lose sheep occasionally? - Yes, we do very often.</p>
               <p>They stray you know? - They stray or are stole; they do not stray in London, they are taken away from us; I never had a lamb or sheep strayed from me in London in my life; I never had none strayed from me; I always drive them, when my master has any to drive; I had two men with me, they are not here; I was behind them and they were before me.</p>
               <p>Of course they could give as good an account of the cattle as you can? - They were only hired men, they had not the care of the cattle; Abraham is a drover, and is employed as such by many people.</p>

               <p>The sheep were in Sillitoe's open back yard? - There was no cover over it; it was open high pales; the people might see out of the window.</p>
               <p>He is a butcher, is not he? - It looked more like a cook's shop, than a butcher's; there was meat there, dressed, in the window.</p>
               <p>Was he at that time? - No, I was in the house when my master saw them.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had your master had these lots? - We went down into the country to gather them on Saturday, and we came up on Sunday, we go first to Stanford le Hope.</p>
               <p>Do not other people collect lots marked in the same way? - My master is the only drover in the country, there is no other drover drives for the farmers that we drive for, unless a butcher goes and buys a lot himself, then he drives them home himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Bennet. Do the farmers in this part of the country usually employ more drovers than one? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a drover? - I call on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</p>
               <p>How many counties do you call in? - Sir!</p>
               <p>Do you know the meaning of the word county? - What, counting them over: oh! I call in one county, in Essex, at Stanford le Hope, about thirty miles from London.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030075"/>How many persons do you deal with? - I suppose four or five and thirty people.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to swear that they do not deal with any drover but yourself? - Yes.</p>

            's; I have seen him drive things, but how can I tell what he follows; I have seen him act as a drover; but not repeatedly, sometimes he is a butcher at Whitechapel; he does drive for any of the people in Whitechapel, he is turned off from Jacky Parrs.</p>
               <p>Have you constantly worked as a drover? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with this Bennett? - Yes, he knows me very well, and with Haden, before this matter happened; he was driving them as hard as ever he could, I overtook him to see where they went in at, the man never saw me, I will be upon oath; I know he did not come by them honestly; I know they were not the kind of sheep that he drives, though I did not see the marks of them; I can tell Dorsetshire sheep by the horns or wool; it was not so dark but I could see the sheep; sometimes I was close to him, and he was on one side of the way, and I on the other.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any watchman on the road? - No.</p>
               <p>How many watchmen did you meet? - I cannot say; I did not tell them; I saw one; I might see more; I can swear I did not see twenty; I do not know that I saw any but this watchman in Kingsland-road.</p>
               <p>If you had found any sheep, would not you have taken them to the person you knew? - No, I should have taken them to the Green-yard, as the proper place: a man may go for miles and miles, and not look for four sheep in a butcher's shop or cook's shop; there was the Shoreditch pound, and the key can always be found.</p>

               <p>Did Wood at that time make any application or any complaint to you about these sheep? - No, not at all; I asked Mr. Sillitoe, says I, master are they yours? he said yes, they were; and he being a housekeeper, I obeyed his orders; I had seen Wood up and down the road sometimes, he lives in the road, about two hundred yards from Sillitoe's.</p>
               <p>I believe Sillitoe bears as good a character in the parish as any man? - I cannot say to the contrary of that; I knew him to be in the butchering line.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was called up by Wood and Mr. Bennet's man, to go to the house of Mr. Sillitoe, concerning some sheep; I knocked at the door and Mrs. Sillitoe was in bed, she answered me, the door was in about five or six minutes opened; in the back yard four sheep were found, and I think there were one or two hogs besides, they were all alive; I cannot describe the marks of the sheep; I went afterwards to apprehend the lad Jacobs in Smithfield, I took him from the room, I said I am come to take you on account of the sheep you left at the butcher's last night in Kingsland-road; says he, I left none; Mr. Bennet has the skins to produce; Sillitoe was not at home; I left word with his wife, that he must come to the justice about five or six o'clock; Mr. Sillitoe sent for Harpur and me, to let us know he was at home; I asked him how the sheep came there, and told him that he must attend the magistrate, which he did; the next day the magistrate had a multiplicity of business and did not go on this; Sillitoe was then ordered to attend again on Saturday, but Bennett chose to have a hearing on Friday; Sillitoe attended, and he was bound over by the magistrate to be a witness on this prosecution; I told him this, that the magistrate was determined to know the rights of the business, and if he had done wrong, he must answer for it, and if not, he had nothing to fear; I thought he must know the consequence; but transportation for fourteen years was not mentioned to him; the magistrate upon hearing how they found the sheep, and how Sillitoe not being at home, and being sent for and coming; he said he thought there was nothing criminal in him, and he should admit him as a witness; he never was committed, but by a certificate after Jacobs was indicted; he always said in the presence of the lad, that he left them there for the use of one Mr. Lee, and Lee was present, and he was bound over as witness: Lee was not a witness.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me what curious hand has contrived to have a prosecution for a felony, subjecting this man to fourteen years transportation?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030077"/>- I cannot tell how he was indicted, but I only know there was a certificate; the magistrate sent for me, I was at home, he asked me what I knew concerning that business; I told him how I found the sheep; for the first word the woman said to me, says she, they are not ours, but left here; I then went after the boy; the boy said he knew nothing of the sheep; but as for Sillitoe, he certainly never was in our custody one hour by warrant or otherwise, till after he was indicted.</p>
               <p>Does not Sillitoe bear a good character? - I never knew him till this time, nor was in his house; I am constable of that very liberty where he lives, and I never knew him till this time; till he sent for me and Mr. Harper to know the business.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the least charge, or the least intimation of dishonesty against this man? - I never knew him till this day; the skins are here; they were delivered to Bennet for him to kill the sheep, and he or his man has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Bennett. Have you kept the skins? - Here is one of the skins; all the ewes were marked with red oker; one is marked head and rump, that is a woolled one; here is one that is marked down the near shoulder; this is the shorn one, marked down off the neck with red oker; this is the lamb skin, it is blued on the face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who advised you to prosecute Sillitoe? - I do not know, I took my own advice; I thought he was as much concerned as the other; I went to the magistrate and asked him for a warrant, and he granted me a warrant; I was advised by many of my friends and my masters; they said I was to blame if I did not.</p>
               <p>Is there no person in Court who advised you to prosecute? - No Sir, only this gentleman, he said he thought we could find a bill against him.</p>
               <p>What is that person's name? - Mr. Dalton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Jacobs called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, as to Sillitoe, I am to submit to your Lordship, that he being before the magistrate, who had a competent jurisdiction to commit or discharge, and he heard the whole evidence; he thought proper in his discretion to discharge this man, conceiving there was no evidence that could affect him in this transaction; but he bound him over to give evidence; he took his examination, he heard all the evidence he had given, and he bound him over; it was decided in the case of Mrs. Rudd, clearly, that where a person is before a magistrate, having a competent jurisdiction, clearly admitted as evidence; that they cannot be indicted for that fact, unless they have given a separate account: it was determined on that principle before the judges, that Mrs. Rudd having been examined, and having told all she knew of the transaction, could not be indicted, excepting that she varied, and on account of that variance, she was indicted; now unless they prove he gave a false account; I take it the magistrate's jurisdiction is competent.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no examination returned from the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner is not to be injured by the neglect of the justice.</p>
               <p>Court. If you do not return his examination to me, I cannot take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no examination taken down; a person certifies that there was no examination; I take it the magistrate not having taken it in writing, should not prejudice this man.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I was present; he was bound as I tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any examination of him taken before the magistrate? - Never, none taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. The magistrate asked him whether the sheep was brought there by the lad, and he said yes; then he asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030078"/>how I found them, and I told him, and he bound him over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it, he is not, after that to be indicted here for that offence; it clearly comes within the case of Mrs. Rudd.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion it is a to be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you think it differs from the case of Mrs. Rudd, which was solemnly argued and decided here; I am bound by that opinion; Mrs. Rudd was called before a magistrate, charged there with the fact; she there gave an account before the magistrate, which was an untrue and false one, and on that account only, the judges were of opinion that she should be indicted: here, there is no pretence that there is a variation from the truth of the story, which the man told before the magistrate; I take it he is precisely within that case.</p>
               <p>Court. I certainly should not permit you now to examine, if there had been any examination returned, I should not permit you to examine him as to what passed before the magistrate; and you did not examine him as to that, in his original examination, and before me there is no evidence of what he said before the magistrate; if you could have made the question so as to have it saved, you could only have made it on the ground of a written examination; or on the ground of what past before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Clearly I make it on the verbal examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall certainly leave it to the jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sillitoe. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Sillitoe called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor.

On the 25th of April I was called on by the watchman, he asked me if I had sent a man out with any nails; he said he had stopped a man on Snow-hill with some, and that he said he had them from me; I went with the patrol to the watch-house and saw the nails; they are my property, they were taken from the prisoner by the patrol; I asked the officer of the night if he had searched him, and he said no, I desired him to search him, and twenty-seven nails were found in his pocket: the prisoner had worked with me eighteen months or thereabouts; but I discharged him before Christmas; I asked him if anybody was concerned with him; and he said no.</p>

               <p>GUILTY, Death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, before the verdict is recorded, as to the capital part of the charge, there is no evidence whatever besides that of the accomplice; early in the case your lordship intimated an opinion, that as to the capital part of the charge it was then done away; in consequence of that a great deal of the evidence was not entered into, and the situation of the case rests quite in doubt, except as to the evidence of the accomplice; because the poor poor woman is not here to give any evidence on the subject, and the evidence of the accomplice negatives it: the probability is that this poor woman, either really being annoyed, or fancying that she was annoyed, ran out of the house; and left the door open; and in a case where the lives of two men are concerned, your lordship will forgive me when I suggest, that this probability, that the wife had really gone out, leaving the house insecure: then supposing your lordship would resort to the evidence of the accomplice, on which your lordship made all those humane, and strong and sensible observations, which all Judges make, taking it on his evidence, it amounts to this, that one of the thieves came to the door, he pushed against it, and that he broke it open; he did not apply any crow to it, he did not apply any false key; no, he pushed against it, and he entered: taking it on the evidence of this accomplice unconfirmed, it stands perfectly in doubt, whether this poor woman had not left her door open; and in such a case, always bowing (as I am sure it is my duty to do) to the authority of the Bench, and to the judgment of the Jury, who I know will always remember mercy is the predominent feature in every verdict, and that it is what your lordship kept in view, particularly in your charge on this trial, I took the liberty to make this suggestion, in order that the Jury, if they see fit, might mitigate this case, and not find these two men guilty of an offence, of which it seems to me there is no evidence; I am to intreat pardon for this, and I know I shall very readily obtain it in a case in which the capital part of the charge seemed to be so much abandoned.</p>
               <p>Court. I am extremely obliged to Mr. Garrow for taking the trouble of making these observations to the Court. Gentlemen, if you can see any reason to vary that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030089"/>verdict you have found, it is always my wish that mercy may be mixed with the exercise of justice: as soon as

             had began his evidence, I did observe there was an end of the capital part of the case; had the man's wife been here, her testimony alone would have supported it; therefore I thought it was unnecessary to proceed any further on that examination; but on the further investigation of the business, finding that evidence was given of that circumstance from the accomplice, then I should have been glad that the prosecutor had been further examined, with respect to any thing he could have said on that subject; though I think he could not have carried his testimony any further than he did, which was, that when he came to the house at four in the afternoon the next day, he found the staple of the street-door had been forced out; he also found the house in that situation in which the woman could not have left it; that coupled with the testimony of the accomplice, I thought it sufficient to leave it to you; so that the testimony of the accomplice did not stand singly by itself, I thought it my duty to leave it to your judgment: now gentlemen, with respect to this case, as to the evidence of an accomplice, the Judges have lately had before them, in order to consider a case tried by Mr. Justice Buller, whether a person could be convicted on the evidence of an accomplice only, for there was no other witness; he respited the sentence, in order to take the opinion of all the Judges, whether or no that person was properly convicted; I was present as one of the Judges, and they were all unanimously of opinion, that, an accomplice is a competent witness to be received, but his credit is to be left to the Jury; and where a person appears under such circumstances, in order to purchase his own life, by giving testimony against those that are on their trial, Juries do not give credit to his testimony, unless it is confirmed; but I do not say in every circumstance; for though that person's testimony is to be confirmed by the testimony of other witnesses, yet if it is confirmed in the material parts of it, that gives it a credit: now this man's testimony has been confirmed with respect to the things found in Pickering's lodgings; and in my apprehension it gives a credit to him; but that credit, how far it will extend, is for your consideration, it is not for the consideration of the Court; but it is not to be narrowed, as the learned Counsel mentions. In my apprehension the accomplice's testimony he gave in the natural story of that transaction was confirmatory of the other testimony; and my wish would have been that you should have found them guilty of the felony, and not of the capital part of the charge; but it is your province and not mine; it is my duty to make such observations to you, as may assist you to form your judgment: if you agree with them you adopt them, if not you reject them; it is your province to decide and not the Judge's: my wishes were that you would have found them guilty of the felony only.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not too late, the verdict is not recorded.</p>
               <p>Jury. My lord, it was the general wish of the Jury to leave the capital part out, but their doubts arose whether they had power.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly you have power, it is entirely in your province; and really in a case so circumstanced as this is, with respect to Merryman, my wish was that you would have acquitted him totally, because there was no evidence against him but from the accomplice only, and I so pointed it out to you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen, the verdict is not yet recorded, and I am sure it will reflect no discredit on the Jury to alter their verdict, particularly after the humane observations from the learned Judge.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. Consider your verdict, gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have collected from my learned friend the charge against the prisoner, which is, that he has forged, or uttered knowing it to be forged, a draught dated on the 22d of September, 1788, being an order for the payment of money to the amount of 700 l. Gentlemen, when I have the honour of addressing myself to a London Jury in this place, I feel it to be quite unnececessary for me, to make any general observation, on the subject of the crime of forgery, or at any length to call for the attention of a Jury in this commercial city, to a subject in which the interest of the Public are so deeply involved: we know you will not let slip any circumstance which may tend to induce a fair and honest, and conscientious conviction of the guilt of the prisoner; on the other hand, if from any circumstance, more satisfaction might be derived from his acquittal, we know, that however small that circumstance may be, tending to acquit one of your fellow citizens, it will have its full weight, and make a due impression on your minds. Gentlemen, I proceeed to state, as shortly as I am able, the circumstances from which, we, on the part of the prosecution, expect that you may fairly infer the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, it will be very necessary that you should attend to make some memorandums of the dates of the particular transactions, because you will have but too much reason to observe, that this which constitutes but one of the many depredations on the property of the banking-houses of this great city, is the result of great deliberation, of much caution, and of a settled system. Gentlemen, the prisoner on the 3d of September, applied at the house of Mr. Moore, whose draught this purports to be, and sold him some light gold, the amount of it was forty-two pounds; and the person who bought it of him, was about to pay him by bank notes, but the prisoner desired to have the checque of Mr. Moore, instead of bank-notes; the inference appears to be but too clear; it is not an ordinary thing for a man to prefer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030091"/>to have the private cheque of any body to a bank-note, for which he has the security of the public, and the whole security of the Bank of England: on the 4th of September the prisoner went to the house of Mess. Grotes and Co. Mr. Moore drew on printed checques, which it is only necessary to fill up the name of the banker to whom it is addressed, and several other particulars of the cheque are already printed; having possessed himself on the 3d of September, with Mr. Moore's character of hand-writing, and with one of the cheques of his banker, on the 4th he went to the banking-house to open an account with them; you know by that, that he becomes possessed of a certain number of those cheques; he has them to make an honest use of; if a bad man, and wants them for any other purpose, he still is provided with the means of drawing on that house. When the prisoner opened an account there, by the name of

                  Joan

            , and paid in 100 l. the manner in which he paid it in, the sums of which it was constituted, will be fit for your attention; the draft he received of Mr.

             the preceding day, was part of the sum; there was a bank-note for 50 l. and 8 l. in cash, making together 100 l. He entered his name as usual in the banker's book, and had some cheques; the clerk in the house, for reasons he will explain to you, if material, from an account opened by a stranger, without any recommendation, an account of 100 l. an account opened by a foreigner, induced him to suspect him; therefore he will tell you he gave him but a very small quantity of cheques; on the 15th of the same month he went again to Mr. Moore, where he sold more gold, to the amount of 45 l. 15 s. 3 d. he there again was offered cash or bank notes for the amount; he again declined, and desired a draft; he had a draft for 40 l. and the rest in cash. I have now stated to you three days, the 3d, the 4th, and the 15th of September; but there is an intermediate day well worthy your attention; that is the 8th of September, upon which 8th the prisoner drew on the house of Mess. Prescotts, and Co. for 55 l. and on the 9th for 40 payable to himself; and on the 16th, the day after he made his second sale to Mr. Moore, and procured his second draft, he drew out the 5 l. remaining: by the 16th he had no longer any money remaining in their hand. It will be for you to judge what induced him to open an account for 100 l. on the 4th, and on the 16th to draw it out. Gentlemen, on the 23d of September, about a week after, a man of the name of Morris, presented to that house a draft, purporting to be Mr. Moore's draft for 700 l. The character of the hand-writing was extremely well imitated; but it occurred to the clerk to whom it was presented, first that Mr. Moore had not cash for so much; next, that he had never in the course of his dealings drawn for so large a sum, upon which Morris was applied to, to know from whom he had received it; he said from a foreign gentleman, at Grays-Inn Coffee-house; for whom he had done several things of the same sort, and for whom he had already been to the banking house of Mr. Prescott; and if they would go with him, he would show him to them; if Morris is believed, there is no possibility of doubt, there is no chance, by which the most humane, the most incredulous Jury men, the most disposed to acquit, can for one moment hesitate about the guilt of the prisoner; therefore it is for you to attend to the character of Morris, and to the manner in which he will give his evidence; it is with that view, I shall be particular in stating what he did on the occasion; one of the partners in Mr. Prescott's house, agrees to go to Mr. Moore, and to be informed by him, whether this was a genuine draft; another person, either a clerk or a partner, was to go with Morris, when they came there, the prisoner was not there; on enquiring of the master of the coffee-house and the waiter, it was found that he had been there, that

             the witness had been employed; in short Morris was, as he will be to day, most<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030092"/>compleatly confirmed; it appeared then that there was an additional reason for the prisoner having procured) supposing him to be this bad man) that there was an additional reason for his procuring one or more of those drafts; for it will appear he sent them by Morris, so that Morris became known at the banking-house; Morris became stripped of every doubt as to the employment he was engaging in; he sends the genuine draft of Mr. Moore by Morris, he sends his own draft by Morris, therefore Morris becomes known at the banking-house, and had a reason to believe the man was acting fairly and honestly; and it will appear that whenever a genuine draft was presented at the banking-house, the prisoner waited in the coffee-room to receive it; there he took the money; but upon other occasions, where possibly there might be reasons to suspect that Morris did not come back alone, upon any other occasion upon which Morris had been successful, which does not turn out to be a true one, he did not continue in the coffee-room, but at a little distance; where perhaps the fair inference is, that he might have an opportunity of seeing whether he came alone or had some unpleasant companion with him: information was given at Bow-street, advertisements were immediately published, and every attempt that could be thought of to apprehend him; it was not however, till a considerable time afterwards the prisoner was taken into custody; when he was taken, Morris was applied to; he was taken in disguise, he was taken under circumstances, that the witnesses will tell you the moment that Morris saw him in company with a great many other persons, he said, that is the man that gave me the draft, but he is not in the same dress; he described with great particularity the dress that the prisoner wore, and I shall shew you that was his dress when he first opened his account, that it is precisely the same dress that Morris has uniformly described; I shall prove that the prisoner lived in Gravel-street, in the neighbourhood of Grays-Inn Coffee-house; I shall prove by the master of that coffee-house, I shall prove by the waiter, that at the first time the prisoner desired to have a porter (the house generally have a porter of their own), he expressly desired that it might not be the porter of the house, but a ticket porter, upon which Morris was called from his stand in Grays-Inn, and was applied to by the prisoner; I shall prove that the prisoner, who lived in Gravel-street, and who had agreed for the lodging for a time considerably longer than the time at which he left it; left it on a sudden, left it at the precise time in which it was important that the man who had delivered to

             this forged draft should abscond; I shall prove he never was seen there again; I shall prove whilst he was there, a great number of persons resorted to him, many of them Jews; I shall produce porters belonging to different inns of Court; I shall after prove his absconding from those lodgings; that very coat described by Morris, I shall prove, was left by the prisoner, together with some other unimportant articles, at the lodgings in Gravel-street; then I shall prove to you beyond all question, that on the 3d of September, the prisoner possessed himself of the genuine draft of Mr. Moore, that on the 4th of September, he opened an account, possessed himself of the cheques, therefore was enabled to draw upon them correctly; that upon the 8th, 9th, and 16th, he exhausted all the money he had at Prescott's; that on the 15th he obtained a new draft; that on the 23d he presented that forged draft in question; the remaining enquiry is only this; whether you sitting there as conscientious men, can safely say you can trust to the story that Morris tells; Morris himself has never been charged or suspected to have been an accomplice in the guilt; Morris was never in custody, Morris comes here to transfer no guilt from himself to another; but merely to state that in his usual occupation of a ticket porter, he had been employed by the prisoner at the bar; if his character should be impeached, I have witnesses of character and credit to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030093"/>point; but I shall shew you by the master and waiter of the house, that he was sent for by the prisoner at the bar, on several occasions to this coffee-room, they will likewise recollect the circumstance of his sometimes waiting till Morris came back, and I am afraid you will have no doubt about the guilt of the prisoner; I mean by that only, that I feel in common, with you and every body, great anxiety and great reluctance that any man should be found guilty of an offence, the consequence of which I am afraid must be the loss of his life; but you owe a great duty to the publick, and if you believe him guilty on the evidence, it is your bounden duty to pronounce him so, if on the contrary, you have any fair reason to doubt about his guilt, or if you have any fair suspicion of the story that Morris will tell you; God forbid you should pronounce him guilty; and I am sure that great body of persons the bankers, for whom I am concerned, have not a wish for his conviction, if any circumstance appears, on which any reasonable, thinking, sober man can for one moment entertain a serious doubt.</p>

               <p>Have you any recollection of the dress of the prisoner, either on the 3d or the 15th? - He was dressed in a light coloured coat, and his hat was flapped over his face, a cocked hat; I had sufficient opportunities to swear to him, I have no doubt at all; I did not see him till he came to Bow-street, which was at the distance of some months; I knew him again as soon as I saw him, he was not pointed out to me any otherwise, than I was in the room when he came, and there was a whisper that was the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose he spoke very bad English; - Very bad, we could scarcely understand him, when we asked him how he would be paid, whether in bank or a draft, he said, a draft, nothing particular past the first time, nor the second, nothing, except the alteration of the draft.</p>
               <p>It did not take up long weighing these ounces of gold? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Many people were there that day? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Both of the days? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Now as such number of people came that day, what was there particular in this man you never saw before? - No, only that he came up in a particular manner, he had a canvas bag in his hand, it was the conversation that past, and the alteration of the draft; the draft was for 40 l. the sum paid was 1 l. 15 s. 3 d.</p>

               <p>At any time subsequent to this, did he draw out any of this money out of your house, and when? - Yes, at three different drafts, on the 8th of September, for 55 l. on the 9th he drew one for 40 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him write at the time he opened the account? - Yes I did, on the 16th he drew for 5 l. that was the amount of the whole hundred.</p>
               <p>Was there any other draft that you recollect? - That finished the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>Have you a draft for 700 l.? - Yes, (produces it.) I received this on the 23d of December, I received this from one Morris; I did not pay it, I asked him in what manner he chose to have it, he said 500 l. in bank-notes, and 200 l. in money, which is a larger sum than we usually paid money; I hesitated to pay it, I went to Grays-Inn Coffee-house with Morris and waited there some time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there? - No.</p>
               <p>At this time had Mr. Moore in your books to the amount of 700 l. - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Are you perfectly satisfied that the prisoner is the man that opened the account? - I am perfectly satisfied of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of a hand did the prisoner write? - Not a very good one, I can shew you one cheque; I never see the prisoner before, nor till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you pay these three drafts? - I paid this 55 l.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay it to? - I cannot recollect that it was Morris, but from a collateral circumstance, of which I was reminded by Morris after, I do recollect that when the 55 l. was paid, I referred to the book and examined the hand writing, and seeing it agreed I paid the draft.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you recollect that that circumstance happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then that recollection leads you to believe what Morris told you to be so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you now, independent of what Morris told you, have you a personal recollection who you paid that to? - No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you always do when it is a new customer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You remembered it as soon as it was told you by Morris? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You took Morris into custody immediately? - I went with Morris and held him.</p>
               <p>Then Morris knew that you had hold of him on a suspicion that it was forged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do with Morris? - I went with him to Grays Inn Coffee-house, not in custody of any officer, I waited there for some time; after I had waited best part of an hour, we called this Morris in, Morris staid at the door to watch for the person that sent him.</p>
               <p>Was Morris left in any custody at the door? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>He might have gone away if he chose it? - We had no guard upon him; then we called Morris in, then I returned home.</p>
               <p>Did Morris go with you? - No, he did not, he was left at large; in the evening I saw Morris at Sir Sampsom Wright's, he was appointed to come there, and he came voluntarily, there was an examination of Morris.</p>
               <p>Was he kept that night, or did he go about his business? - I believe he went about his business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - A ticket-porter, plying in Gray's-inn; I have been a ticket-porter about two years and a half, I know the prisoner, I first became acquainted with him (looking at a memorandum) I made this memorandum at the time I did the business.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to make the memorandum? - I generally do.</p>
               <p>Do you put down every business you do? - No, I do not in particular.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to put them down? - On account of this forgery, I cannot say I put them down that minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you put them down before you went to receive the 700 l.? - Yes, I never put down no money business.</p>
               <p>Then this is a particular instance in which you did put it down.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell me just now that you generally did put down those things? - I do sometimes, and this I did.</p>
               <p>Did you ever put down any other message that you was sent on? - I cannot say particular.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath? - I have made a memorandum, but not in particular to be positive of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever put down any memorandum of any other message that you was sent on? - No, I cannot say I did, I only put this down.</p>
               <p>When did you put that down? - I put it down, it may be a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Before you took the 700 l. draft? - I had been several times for that person.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after you took the 700 l. draft? - After I carried the 700 l. draft.</p>
               <p>Why did you say this moment before? - I did not say before.</p>
               <p>Yes, you did; who desired you to put it down? - Nobody desired me ever to put it down.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath nobody ever desired you to put it down? - Upon my oath nobody ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then go on, and put the paper in your pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did you first see the prisoner? - I believe it was the 8th of September, I think it was, I am not sure; the first time that I saw him I was sent for by one of the waiters at the coffee-house, I was in Gray's-inn, a shoe-black woman called me, it was about nine I believe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - He was sitting in a box in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Were there other persons in the coffee-room? - There were.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and the prisoner the first time you went to him? - Only he gave me a draft for 55 l. upon Mess. Prescotts, and told me to make haste, and he would wait for me till I came back; I made all the haste I could, I received the cash, and delivered it to the prisoner, he was there sitting in the same box, he asked me what I was to have; I said what he pleased, he gave me two shillings; I do not know who that draft was drawn by; I think I saw him again the 17th, I was sent for to the same coffee-house as before, I believe it was the fore part of the day, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the person you was sent for to? - Yes, he was, it was for 44 l. 0 s. 10 d. on Mess. Ladbrooks; he gave me a draft for that sum; nothing passed, he waited till I returned, and he paid me eighteen pence, I gave him the money, I did not see him again till the 22 d; then I met him the bottom of Southampton-building, Chancery-lane; the prisoner says to me, Morris; (he had my name in writing in his book.)</p>
               <p>When had he taken it down in writing? - I think it was the 17th, but I am not sure whether it was the 8th, because he took it off from the badge; he said, Morris, where have you been, I wanted to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030097"/>you? he returned back again to the gate, and to a porter that he had engaged for the next morning job, says he, I shall not want you as I have found Morris; then he told me to meet him at nine at the coffee-house the next morning; if he was not there, to wait till he came, and he would pay me for my time; nothing more passed on the 22d; on the 23d I went up at nine, the prisoner was not there, I waited till he came, he was there about twenty minutes or half an hour after nine, and the waiter came out and called another porter in; he went in and came out, and he sent me in; the prisoner tapped at the window for me, I went in, and he gave me a draft of 554 l. 8 d. upon Mess. Bidulph and Cox; I received that in notes and cash, I brought it back again, and went into the coffee-house, he was not there, I saw him in about three quarters of an hour at the gate of Gray's-inn; I went to my stand not finding him there; nothing further passed; then I delivered him the notes and the money, between the folding doors of the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose draft that was on Cox? - I do not; then he gave me a letter to Mr. Brooks, at Mr. Hughes's riding-school, I could not find him; when I came back again I could not find the prisoner, I did not see him then for I suppose two hours, much about two hours I saw him again at the same place, Gray's-inn-gate, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass between you at that time? - No further than I gave him this letter, he took it, and said stop here; and he walked half way over Holborn, and returned back to me, and gave me a 700 l. draft to go to Mr. Prescott's, I judge it was about two o'clock; he gave me that draft in the street, the corner of the gateway, and ordered me to have 500 l. in banknotes, and 200 l. in cash; I carried it to Mr. Prescott's, they did not pay it, and I returned to the Gray's-inn coffee-house; two of the gentlemen of the house went with me; the prisoner was not at the coffee-house, nor I never saw him after, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did he desire you to bring that money to? - To Gray's-inn coffee-house, we waited there for an half hour, but he did not come; I never saw him again till I saw him at Bow-street; I never was taken into custody about it, I have been in my business of a porter ever since; I have not been from the inn.</p>
               <p>Have you seen a coat at Bow-street that was produced by an officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that was the coat the prisoner wore? - I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Are you quite certain the prisoner is the man that gave you the 700 l. draft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again at Bow-street? - Yes, I did, when he had his beard on.</p>
               <p>Who paid you the 55 l. draft? - This is the Gentleman.</p>
               <p>(Pointing to Mr. Woodhouse.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Woodhouse be so good as to step out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What passed between you and the banker's clerk when you presented the 55 l. draft? - There was a little scruple, but on account of my badge they paid it; they asked me if I knew the person that the draft belonged to; I said I really did not know, but I had done other business for him; they paid me the money.</p>
               <p>Did they refer to any books or papers that you recollect, before they paid you? - No, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Well, Mr. Morris, you are a porter living in Gray's-inn, in the passage there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner before? - Never saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>You knew a person of the name of Laurence Jones, Jonas, or Lazarus Jones? - What, Captain Jones? Yes, I knew him very well.</p>
               <p>Your wife knew him very well? - She knew him so far as that she washed for the family once.</p>
               <p>For these dozen years? - No, nor half a dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030098"/>She washed for the Captain? - I do not know whether he is a Captain or what he is.</p>
               <p>You know the Captain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him lately? - No, Sir, I have not seen him these four years; I do not know that I have seen him since I helped to move his things from Dean-street to the Minories.</p>
               <p>Does your wife wash for him up to this time? - No, not for these four years.</p>
               <p>He knew where you lived? - No, I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>They did not tell you that the captain, knowing you to be a trusly man, recommended you to this job? - No.</p>
               <p>And you was sent for particularly? - I was the first that was found, the waiter came to get a porter; I was walking as we do.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live in Fullwood's Rents, but I was not at home, I was in the court where my business is.</p>
               <p>You were immediately desired, I suppose, to give a description of the person who had given this note to you? - No.</p>
               <p>When you carried this 700 l. note, just describe to me, without looking at the man, the description you gave of him then? - Why I gave a description of a man as I supposed him to be then, about forty-five or fifty, tall, thin, cheeks dented in, with a widish mouth, and black countenance.</p>
               <p>Any teeth? - Black teeth, very black; I believed by that he smoaked a good deal; but he had a wig on.</p>
               <p>Now you know this man is about fifty or sixty, and he has no teeth? - Yes, he has some teeth.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. He had teeth at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Now you never enquired what he was, or who he was? - What should I enquire for? I never enquired any thing at all about him, he paid me for what I did; I gave myself no trouble.</p>
               <p>What time was this draft paid? - I think it was about two, when this last draft was paid, or some minutes over or under.</p>
               <p>What day? - The 23d of September; they told me to go back again, and they would attend me, and if I met him on the road I was to take care of him; they were on the one side of the road, and I was on the other.</p>
               <p>When he crossed Holborn and turned back, did he meet any body? - Nobody, I never saw any body with him.</p>
               <p>You know the Israels, the brothers-in-law of Jones? - I know them all very well, I never saw one with him.</p>
               <p>You did not see them come up to him as soon as you had put the papers into his hand, come up and take them out again? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to be positive that you did not see one of the Israels? - I am positive, I never saw either man, woman or child with the prisoner in my life, either join him or come up to him, or give him any thing, or be about there.</p>
               <p>The draft that you took, you gave no memorandum of it? - No; I have seen one of the Israels.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you? - He never said a word to me.</p>
               <p>He did not advise you to make memorandums? - No, that I am positive of, I never saw the prisoner before in my life.</p>
               <p>Yet you mean to say you knew him again perfectly? - I had been of four or five different messages for him; he had a white coat on in the morning, but not in the afternoon, and there was star buttons and large lappels.</p>
               <p>Had he it on at two in the afternoon? - No.</p>
               <p>What coat had he on then? - I cannot say; it was a loose coat, a brown one, I believe, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>How came you to describe him in your hand-bill, in a whitish coat? - He had a whitish coat on, but he had a brown great coat on at the time he gave me this draft; he had a light coloured drab with star buttons; when he gave me the 700 l. draft, he had a brown coat, and another under it, I believe that was a light-coloured one, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030099"/>under one; he had not that coat on with the buttons, particularly with a star, he had it on when he gave me Bidulph's draft; but he had not it on when he gave me the draft for 700 l. I took notice of the button, because it was a pretty button, it was a new button; I am positive of the man, God forgive me if I should say any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>And you was not advised by Jones, or the Israels, or any of them to do this, to make memorandums, to take notice of the buttons, or to be concerned in this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. These Eastwells, of whom you have been speaking, kept a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Dean-street; Captain Jones lodged there? - He did so, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I see a good many faces here that are connected with him, who would be just as decently and as well employed elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know Captain Jones's lady? - Yes, I knew her before he married her name was Miss Betsy Jones, she was in partnership with Eastwell; I have not seen her for several years; nobody advised me to set down this paper of memorandums, I will be upon my oath it is entirely my own doing.</p>
               <p>Who lives at Brooks-well, near Gun-dock, Wapping, No. 27? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Whose hand-writing is that? - Oh! that is some parcels that I took to the wharf out of our inn to go on board ship.</p>
               <p>Whose hand-writing is that? - This is my hand-writing, the other is not.</p>
               <p>Is not the entries that you made of the memorandum your hand-writing? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>Then whose hand-writing is it? - It is one Metcalf that I got to write it down for me, because I do not understand figuring, and I could not figure down the sums of money.</p>
               <p>Who is Metcalf? - He is a porter belonging to the inn; I had put it down, I will shew it to you, and that is it, I gave it him to copy it, I will shew it you in my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tear it out, give us your book.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Had you wrote this before ever I examined you at Bow-street? - Yes, I produced it there; in one of the pockets of the book you will find the case that the draft was put in to go to Mr. Cox's; there are private memorandums, in this book.</p>
               <p>Was the draft which you received from the prisoner for 700 l. the same you presented to Mr. Woodhouse? - Yes.</p>

             the porter, I have heard him call for Morris, I have seen him and Morris together more than once or twice; Morris was called for the purpose of going on messages for the prisoner several times.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner first sent for a porter? - I cannot say the first time, but I was present several times at his sending for a porter; I do not remember any particular directions; my bar is a good way from the boxes in the coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man at the bar is the man you have seen at your coffee-room? - Yes, I knew him very well in Bow-street; I have known Morris about two years and better, I believe he has been a ticket porter all that time.</p>
               <p>Have you a good opinion of him? - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030100"/>very good opinion of him, I always took him to be a very honest fellow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose he took his turn as other porters do; does he ply any where else? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Therefore if I was to send for a person to your coffee-house, I should find Morris? - Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WINTER sworn.</p>

               <p>I am waiter at the Gray's-inn Coffee-house; I know Morris perfectly well, I know the prisoner perfectly well; I saw him at our coffee-house, he came into the Gray's-inn coffee-house on Monday morning, the beginning of September; he pulled out a pocket-book, and called for a pen and ink, and a dish of coffee, he then asked me for a porter.</p>
               <p>Did he ask for paper also? - No, he then asked for a porter, I was going to call one of our porters belonging to our house; he then said he wished to have a ticket-porter, as his business was money matters, and he should want him again; I went to the back-door and called out porter; I was informed there was not one there, but they would send one, and Morris came in two or three minutes; I said there is a gentleman in the coffee-room that wants a ticket-porter, and I conducted Morris to the prisoner; I saw the prisoner speak to Morris, and give him a paper, the contents of which I do not know; Morris upon that went away; I did not see the prisoner some days, the prisoner did not stay in the coffee-room till Morris came back; he went out, I did not see Morris return, I did not see the prisoner again for some days; then I saw the prisoner and Morris together in a box; at that time I saw Morris speak to the prisoner, and a paper went from the prisoner to Morris; Morris went away upon that, the prisoner went just after; after that I used to see the prisoner different times; but as I had seen him many times before, I did not take any particular notice of him as I did at first; I never took any account of the days of the month, I remember the time that the forged draft was said to be presented, but I cannot say I saw the prisoner that day, but I saw the prisoner several times at the gateway, sometimes underneath the gateway, and sometimes in the coffee-room, that was after the second message; I have known Morris nearly two years, he has been employed occasionally at our house; I am quite positive to the prisoner, I knew him again at Bow-street; as my master and me were going along, we were determined to be very particular with respect to the person of the prisoner, and waited some minutes in the office, and immediately I saw the prisoner come in with many others, and I immediately tapped my master on the shoulder, and said, Sir, I am sorry to say it, but that is the man, I have not the least doubt in the world about it; the man is as clear to me as ever a man was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. On the day when this bustle was, and Morris and the gentleman came from the banking-house, you do not recollect seeing him that day at all? - No, on the Monday night I saw the prisoner, that day before he absconded.</p>
               <p>Court. You remember the day that the gentleman came back with Morris? - Yes, that day I did not see the prisoner at all, I saw him on the Monday, the day before, at Grays-Inn Coffee-house, he sat down and called for a dish of coffee; he threw down six-pence, drank the dish of coffee, and went out; I did not hear him enquire for anybody then.</p>

               <p>I produce a coat, I had it at a pawnbroker's in Baldwin's-gardens, Mrs. Willis went with me, it is the same coat, I was present at the apprehension of the prisoner, 7th of January, at Wapping Dock, he had a long beard and a red night cap, I think, and a morning gown, up in a two pair of stairs back room; I had very little conversation at that time, I brought him away, I never had any particular conversation with him, I searched him, nothing particular was found upon him; this coat has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you apprehend him? - I forgot the number, I think it was 144, it was between Wapping-Dock and Wapping-Old-stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it No. 27? - I think it was a hundred and something.</p>
               <p>At whose do you know? - At the house of one Jacobs, a ship broker.</p>
               <p>Do you know anybody of the name of Brooks there? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Who else did you see in the house? - The door was open, I went up stairs, there was a number of peo-below, the wife was in or upon the bed with her child.</p>
               <p>You had information? - I had.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the information? - Sir Sampson Wright gave the information, I do not know who gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Is not it like it? - It is like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Ifgrave. Is that Mr. Moore's? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it filled up by his son? - No.</p>
               <p>Nobody else is authorised? - No, I should have filled it up, if the son was absent; this is not mine, there were three at the time I was with Mr. Moore, only us three.</p>
               <p>Is that like his hand writing at all? - It is like it, but I am sure it is not his.</p>
               <p>How does it differ? - The hand on the whole, I cannot immediately say.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose it had been a draft for 70 l. instead of 700 l. and you had seen it at his banker's, should you have known it? - I should have known it was not his.</p>
               <p>Now how should you have known it? - It is wrote stiffer, Mr. Moore very seldom paid attention, he wrote generally with a very bad pen, the first that came in his way.</p>
               <p>It is like it? - Rather like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If instead of that being an order to pay money; if it had been an order to deliver goods, should you have delivered upon it? - I think I should not, I am sure it is not his hand writing; I swear positively this is not the writing of either himself, his son, or me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This is your draft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot call Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>Winter. The time I saw him, he had a pig-tailed wig, laced waistcoat with gold spots, and a coat like this.</p>
               <p>(Holding up a coat.)</p>
               <p>Morris. This is the coat I saw the prisoner with; I am looking at the stars on the buttons, it was a new coat and very pretty buttons; at that time I am positive it is the coat he wore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. On account of the button: a taylor may make a coat like this, and a button-maker make buttons like them.</p>
               <p>Woodhouse. I do not recollect the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel to Woodhouse. Is that draft like the hand writing of Mr. Moore?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030104"/>- It is not very unlike it, it is more stiff, Mr. Moore generally writes with a pen that is more furzy at the end.</p>
               <p>Supposing that had been a draft for 70 l. should you have paid it? - I cannot tell, it is impossible for me to say, perhaps under them circumstances I might.</p>
               <p>Court. That might very naturally be, because they might be led to examine it, being so large a sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Looking at it now do you believe it to be Mr. Moore's writing? - No.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It is made in my own shop by Scouton; this lead was concealed when they went with the search warrant, I can say it is mine, I have some to match it; I found this lead with pieces of flat and round iron, concealed under a kind of a bulk; I never saw any of this bore of lead, it is customary to make them of pewter, but it was the publican's own fancy; they are to draw liquors through; I am positive this part of the lead is mine, (The pipe lead deposed to by Scouton), three of these small pieces of pipe are stopped with folder, I saw him stopping them, I cut them afterwards; I cut the pieces that were stopped up out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He never asked me whose watch it was, and my master promised to forgive me, if I would tell him where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Stanley. I offered her fifteen shillings, and she took out a dirty apron and pawned it for a shilling.</p>

               <p>When I went away I went into Rag-fair and pawned the watch for fifteen shillings, and one shilling on a coloured apron which I took off my sides; about a couple of hours after I was taken to the Rotation, and my master said he would not hurt me, and I told him where it was.</p>

               <p>Court. Where had you been all that time? - I had been in the kitchen; I suppose he got up the wall and got in at the back parlour window; I did not hear anything.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the things? - Yes, I know the plate by the marks, and by the figures on them.</p>

I said I want nothing with you; they said I should go with them; I went with them to Bambridge-street, when I came there they asked me up stairs, I went up two pair of stairs; then they must have some gin; I gave the prisoner Miller six-pence to get some gin, she fetched it, and they drank it betwixt them, I had none of it; they said I should go to bed; and one tumbled in on one side, and one on the other; and I put my breeches under the bolster with five guineas and fifteen shillings in my pocket, in less than half five minutes I heard the money chink, and I caught hold of my breeches, and said you have robbed me; I saw the breeches in Miller's hand; after I heard the money chink, I put my hand in my pocket and there was only five shillings, I directly caught hold of Miller, and said, you hussy, you have robbed me; I put on my things, and pulled them out of bed and searched them as well as I could; but I found nothing, I locked the door and fell asleep; and when I waked they were gone, and I found an old woman in the room; it was five o'clock; I was vexed in my mind and I had been walking about before I met with them; I was not drunk, but capable of walking and talking, I am certain I had my money after I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you count it? - I am very certain I had the money when I gave the woman the six-pence, I counted it in my hand, I do not know how I did it, I very often count my money, my hand being in my pocket; I counted it then, and I gave them one shilling a piece; about half an hour after I had fifteen shillings besides them two shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you search the bed head and bolster to see where it dropped? - It never dropped, it was all in a minute, I heard it cannot, and I thought I heard the window go up, but I am not sure; it was day light.</p>

               <p>I live in this court, I know Mr. Fisher, I heard her tell my neighbour, since Grisley was in custody, it would be a fine thing to transport Wade, then my husband will get his place, and get more money than he does now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is she a woman to be believed on her oath? - I should not, if I was a juryman, believe her on her oath.</p>
               <p>What character has Grisley? - A very honest upright man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you lived in this court? - Two years; I lived in Dobey-court before this, I kept a house in Aldersgate-street of fifty or sixty pounds a year; I lived in the Old Bailey, opposite here.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to from the Old Bailey? - I went to live in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030117"/>How long did you live there? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Have you not threatened Mrs. Fisher? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you not said you would do for her? - I do not believe I ever said so.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you never say so? - She abused me, and I might say something in return to her, but I don't know the words.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not? - No.</p>
               <p>You have not had any conversation with that woman? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then you have never said any thing to her about coming here? - I never conversed with her before.</p>
               <p>Then you never had any conversation with Mrs. Fisher about her coming here? - No, I know better.</p>
               <p>Then you was not much acquainted with Mrs. Fisher? - No, not the least in the world, only as a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her in a court of justice? - I once saw her before one of the aldermen.</p>
               <p>Not upon this subject? - Oh! yes, I saw her before my Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Then you had no particular connections or acquaintance with her? - I never spoke a word to her at that time.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with her at that time? - No,</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with her before this time? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>Then how dare you in a court of justice to swear that she ought not to be believed on her oath? - The reason I give is, she is a very drunken bad woman, and I should be sorry my life should lay in her hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Two or three nights ago, it seems you had been abusing one another? - I never conversed with her in private conversation.</p>
               <p>I understand that a night or two ago, you and this woman had some quarrelling on this subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In that conversation you say you abused one another, and you cannot tell what she said? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Grisley called nine witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Counsel to Mrs. Fisher. You know Burgess? - Yes; on the 27th of May I was sitting with two children that I have ill of the measles, and Burgess came home about half past twelve at night; my husband was in bed, he called out Fisher, Fisher; you black-faced b - h, where is your jackass fellow, you b - h? I said in the counter; he said then, you will go to the Old Bailey, you b - h; I said, please God I will; he said then, you b - h, I will do for you; one Mrs. Wood and her husband, that has now the care of my two children, heard the words; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He called you a great many abusive names? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you give him a word or two? - Yes, certainly I did, I called him as he called me; he called me b - h, and I called him dog.</p>
               <p>If I do not mistake you must have the best of it, your tongue seems pretty glib; did not he say he would come and blow you up? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>He would do for your evidence? - No, Sir; he got ground of me.</p>
               <p>Do you think so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I do not think that; was he drunk or sober? - Between both.</p>
               <p>Court to Sleap, the cooper. Do any part of those staves appear to have been sawed? - No, not the staves, the heads might.</p>

               <p>Court to Lowson. What sort of a ring was it you gave the prisoner to look at? - A hair device ring, I never looked particularly at it, but I know it again; it has letters round it, I never read it, I saw the letters round it, it was lotted and had a ticket on it; it says a hair device ring, the letters I know nothing about, it is a lock of hair, I know nothing of it, but from the description of the catalogue.</p>
               <p>Is that the ring (shewing him a ring)? - No, this is not the ring, the ring lost was a larger ring.</p>
               <p>Look at that then? - No, that is not the ring, it had no letters in the middle.</p>
               <p>What think you whether that is the ring or not? - This is the ring; I know it by the hair in the middle.</p>

               <p>I am a physician, I live in John-street, America-square; I have know the prisoner some what about two years, I have attended him in the character of a physician, I cannot speak to his character at all, only attended him as physician; I was called in to him about two years ago, under a great delirium; he had every symptom of insanity; I have not attended him since; but after attending him four or or five weeks, his fever yielded to the treatment we administered; but there was a degree of idiocy which remained, a perfect fatuity, absolute fatuity.</p>
               <p>Court. You attended him; how long did you attend him after his fever had abated? - His fever intermitted and returned with as much severity as at the first: I attended him after his fever was removed, and there was a degree of fatuity remained, and idiocy, and a want of recollection in his conduct that convinced he was not recovered.</p>
               <p>Is it not common for a state of weakness and wandering of mind to remain for some time after a fever, for a delirium to remain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you able from attending him for a week after his fever had left him, to form any judgment whether his disorder was of a permanent nature or not? - From his having been deemed incurable by other professional men, I was convinced his disorder would not yield to the treatment; I believe his disorder was of the kind called idiocy; I frequently met him in the street, and he appeared the same; he had a ticket I believe from St. Luke's, to which I recommended him.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you mean that he was so frightened, hearing that there were thieves on the road, that he lost his senses; did you lose your reason by being frightened? - I know the reason why we were frightened, because there were thieves on the road; I did not lose my senses, but he was frightened out of his wits; I desired him to be blooded, and ever since he was so.</p>

               <p>I attended this young man with Dr. Meyers; I attended him four or five weeks, I found him in a state of delirium, when that delirium went off, he was quite an ideot; it appeared quite a perfect idiotism, I looked upon him incurable, not only me but Dr. Meyers pronounced him so; I have seen him lately, he was then in that state.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him lately did you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - At his house.</p>
               <p>How long were you with him? - Not long.</p>
               <p>How long? - It might be about a quarter of an hour; his wife was ill, and I went on that occasion, his wife sent for me, he was in the room at the time I was there.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with him? - I asked him how he did, and he did not give me a proper answer, and I judged his mind was the same.</p>
               <p>What answer did he give you? - Upon my honour I cannot take upon me to say the exact words, but I know he did not give me an answer agreeable to what I asked him, I cannot tell you what sort of answer.</p>
               <p>How came you to judge it not a proper answer? - I knew he did not give me a proper answer.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I remember it was not, and I have seen him since that in the street.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - None at all, I judged of the state of his mind, by his raving about, jumping about the street; not walking in a manner that a man in his senses should do, he walked in a harum scarum manner.</p>
               <p>Now describe a little? - Just as a madman does.</p>
               <p>I really do not know how a madman walks till you tell me; I want to know? - By his raving and jumping about.</p>
               <p>Did you see him jumping? - Yes, about the street.</p>
               <p>In what manner, do describe a little? - Why, jumping from one place to another.</p>
               <p>By himself, or with anybody? - By himself.</p>
               <p>Where was he jumping? - Why, it was at Bethnal-Green that he was jumping about.</p>
               <p>What to try how far he could leap? - I do not know, I do not recollect that anybody was with me, but I know he was by himself; I had no conversation with him then, the last conversation I had with him was at his own house; I asked him how he did, and I do not recollect what his answer was, but it was not a direct one.</p>
               <p>Do you think that every man that does not give a direct answer is mad? - No, certainly not; I think that the answer he gave me was not a direct one.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell us anything like his answer? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>I was robbed on the 16th of April last; it might be twenty minutes or half an hour after eight o'clock, I was returning from Hammersmith, in the Green park, coming from Hyde-park, towards the corner of Buckingham-house, I saw two men coming towards me; they appeared to come very gently, and I was walking very gently along; they had hold of each others arm, and were as close together as they could be, and as near the rails as they could be, when I first saw them; when they got very near me, they seemed to lean down towards me, I thought they were fuddled; then giving a little way like, I spied a third just as I was stepping round that they should not jostle against me, he was behind them, I could not see him till I came round them, not looking particularly; he was in a red jacket, the other two in light ones; whether they struck at me, I cannot pretend to say, or whether they meant to catch hold of me, but they tore my shirt down the back, and swore, if I made the least noise or resistance they would murder me that minute; then they took my watch and sixpence in money, they took it out of my pocket; the fellow handkerchief to this (shewing one) they took from me; it was in my hand, and with their getting from me, they snatched my handkerchief, and said, d - n him, I have got his handkerchief, or d - n him, it is a d - d good handkerchief; they shook my handkerchief after they got a yard or two from me; then after going a few paces, one of the men in the light-coloured jacket turned round and said, if I made any sort of alarm, they would come back and murder me; I stopped a few minutes, and a young man and woman came up; I asked them if they had seen any body; they said they had seen three soldiers, and wished them a good night; I told them I had just been robbed by three soldiers; and I said at Bow-street I could not swear positively to any of them, the handkerchief was found with my name in it, by the duplicate, about ten days after I lost it.</p>

               <p>Court to Holmes. Why did not you say so? - I did leave it with her, and she gave it me again, at least her daughter did.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the two Vandenburgs go out of court.</p>
               <p>Court to Holmes. You went for this handkerchief, and you took the duplicate that Maynard gave to you? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I gave it to Mrs. Vandenburg.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the handkerchief? - Mrs. Vandenburg; then I went back to Bow-street, leaving the duplicate with her.</p>
               <p>How did the duplicate come into your hands again, and when? - I found I had done wrong in taking the handkerchief out, and went myself back immediately with one of the officers from Bow-street, I got the duplicate back from Miss Vandenburg.</p>
               <p>Where does Vandenburg live? - In King street, Westminster; when I came back I saw Mrs. Vandenburg and her daughter, and got the duplicate from Miss Vandenburg; she came to Bow-street with me.</p>
               <p>Was the old woman present when the daughter gave you the duplicate? - She was, and one Mr. Townsend that went along with me.</p>
               <p>Was the daughter there when you went first, and got the handkerchief? - No, I believe she was not.</p>
               <p>How do you know it to be the same? - I took very particular notice of it, and I know it is the same by a particular crease it had in the corner of it.</p>
               <p>What was the duplicate for? - It was for a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What date was the duplicate? - The 27th of April.</p>
               <p>(The duplicate handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Have you had it ever since? - I have not; Mr. Maynard, to whom I gave it and received it from; he has kept the duplicate and I the handkerchief, I received it in court from Mr. Maynard.</p>
               <p>Court to Maynard. Did you get the duplicate back from this man? - After the examination of this man, the magistrate ordered me to keep it.</p>
               <p>Did you get it from him at the magistrate's? - Yes, I have had it ever since, till I come into court now.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Vandenburg called in.)</p>
               <p>When that man came and got the handkerchief from you, what did he do with the duplicate? - He gave it me, and I gave him the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I believe I put it into the drawer with the rest of the tickets, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it afterwards? - Afterwards that man came back for it, and my daughter gave it him.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - Yes, I think I was.</p>
               <p>How did your daughter find it among the others? - It was easy enough, they was only just put together.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was the same? - Oh! Sir, very easy, there was none like them, nor none of the name.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - They cannot be alike, they are of different dates, and of different things.</p>
               <p>But till you read them, how can you know one from another? - Sometimes I write one, sometimes my daughter writes one, sometimes the man writes one; I can find any particular duplicate, if there was ever so many, they are always matched together, there was one to match it by; the man gave me the duplicate, and I had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030126"/>duplicate and the handkerchief; she found it by the hand-writing, and the things, it was her own hand-writing; I cannot say I examined whose hand-writing it was before I put it in the drawer; I believe my daughter was by when I put it in the drawer; but I am not sure, nor I am not sure whether I put it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Then where was it when the man came back for it? - My daughter had it and gave it to him; I cannot really say whether she had it, or took it out of the drawer from among the tickets.</p>
               <p>How do you know that the duplicate your daughter gave back to Holmes, was the same he gave to you? - Yes, I am sure of it; I knew it by the hand-writing, when he fetched out the ticket he brought it to me, and it answered to the ticket of the handkerchief; then I knew it was our own ticket, I knew it was honestly come by; I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Unless you took particular notice of this before you put it into the drawer, how do you know you took the same out? - Yes, I knew it very well, that I took the right one out; I knew it by the name, and what it was, there was never another ticket of that name in the drawer; there is no other handkerchief for six-pence, I dare say.</p>
               <p>What was the name? - Brumpton.</p>
               <p>Was there any other of the name? - No, Sir.</p>

            , to me; I took in this handkerchief on the 27th of April of one Davis, I believe it is Elizabeth Davis, I gave her that ticket, (the other duplicate handed to the Court) they are both my hand writing.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of 21 on one of them? - The number of the book in which it is entered; that we only put on the duplicate we keep.</p>
               <p>Court to Maynard. When you gave Holmes the ticket to go and fetch the handkerchief, did you take any particular notice of the ticket? - I did not mark it, I did not send him for the handkerchief, only to go and see whether it was marked with the letter; I took very particular notice of it to the date and to the writing, so as to know it again; I could not make out whether it was Mary or Mrs. Broomfield; I can say that the duplicate that was brought back, was the same; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There is nothing particular on that duplicate? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030127"/>Therefore you swear positively to that ticket though there is nothing particular upon it? - No, I do not swear positively.</p>

               <p>Humphries lodges in the same house with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw him take it out of his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What does he lodge in the same house with Humphries? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - Up in Bromfield's room.</p>
               <p>Then you went from that room to the other? - No, I was not in the other.</p>
               <p>How do you know where he took it from? - Humphries's old coat was on the bed in Bromfield's room, and he took it out of the old coat pocket; I know it was Humphries's coat, because I saw him have it on that morning before he went on guard; I saw him have it on oftentimes.</p>
               <p>Did you never see the other man have it on? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know who put the handkerchief there? - I do not know, but Humphries had it in his hand the day before; I lived with Bromfield almost a week; I do not know how it came into the pocket, only I saw Humphries have the handkerchief in his hand the day before, no other things where in the room where I lived; Humphries took the coat into Bromfield's room, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear Bromfield and Humphries talk about this handkerchief? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Bromfield called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Humphries called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. On behalf of Ankle, there was no evidence against him; I do not know why he came here, for there are no less than two surgeons of eminence to prove that he was in the military hospital at the time.</p>

               <p>Was it that Mr. Baverstock? - It was of a man who called himself Baverstock; I gave an order for the money 29 l. the order was upon Martin and Co.

I said yes, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030129"/>is the money in the drawer; he took out the bank-notes and wrote his name on the back of each; I said to him why do you do so, why? says he, I am but a new beginner in business, and I wish my friends when they see bank-notes, may see my name upon them.</p>
               <p>Do you know to whom they were paid? - No, I know no more of them after I saw my husband put his name on them.</p>

               <p>I believe he assisted you in some things after the death of Mr. Butler; he did assist you with money at that time? - He has brought me money to assist me and my children.</p>
               <p>Court. How much? - Five guineas, and ten pounds after, he had weekly wages a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Had he any other mode of getting money? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Then how could you tell what had been in that drawer, if you had not been at it? - We had not money to make a payment, I think it was 49 l. but I am not sure, I can say positively, that we had not six guineas.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a china-man in St. Paul's Church-yard, on the 27th of February Mr. Hill gave an order for some china, and he gave me a draft for 29 l. 8 s. the eight shillings was afterwards deducted, that was upon the house of Mess. Martin, Stone, Foote, and Porter; I had occasion to make use of that draft, after six in the evening, a gentleman from the country called upon me, that I wished to make a payment to, when the bankers being shut, I desired my porter, the prisoner, to get cash for it in the neighbourhood; he went out and got the cash, and at the same time, he brought me a guinea over and above the cash.</p>
               <p>In what way did he pay it you? - In gold, all in cash.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he got it? - He told me, he got it of a Mrs. Barlow, that kept a public-house, near at hand; I begged he would go back to Mrs. Barlow, and tell her to be careful in future, for she had given a guinea too much; I sent him back with the guinea. I remember a draft of a 100 l. which was paid into my house on the 24th of April, the day after the King came into the City; that was a draft on the house of Moffat, the draft was paid into my house, I was not at home at the time; that was on the 24th of April, I knew nothing of that, till I came home and received the cash; I found a note of 50 l. one of 30 l. and two 10 l. bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other bank-notes in the drawer at that time? - No other, I had no other in the house, at that time.</p>
               <p>There was not? - There was no other but what I mentioned; when I saw those bank-notes, I was going to pay them to Mr. Maddock; Mr. Maddock had been at my house; I wished to send them to his bankers, but as I frequently do, I wrote my name on the back of them, it was late in the evening, Mr. Maddock desired me to take them to the house of his banker, at the same time desired me to ask for his book; I did so.</p>
               <p>What payment had you to make to him? The payment of a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did make that payment to him? - Yes, I did, by these notes, and he desired me to pay them into his bankers, Messrs. Harrison's; I paid them in there; I only wrote my name on the banknotes, I am sure these are what I paid into Messrs. Harrison's, the same that I found in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the prisoner write? - Many times.</p>
               <p>You know his hand writing? - Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030130"/>Prisoner's Counsel. You have had dealings with Mr. Maddock the attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both before and since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you made him any payments shortly before this time? - Shortly before, and very near the time.</p>
               <p>To any amount? - Yes, I paid him a bill, an acceptance of mine; drawn by Mr. Maddock, for two hundred and odd pounds.</p>
               <p>How did you pay that? - In cash and bank-notes.</p>
               <p>It was your custom to write your name on bank-notes? - Frequently so.</p>
               <p>To whom had you paid that previous acceptance? - To Mr. Maddock himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maddock gave you something in addition, for that 100 l? - Yes, I do not know what it was, I did not examine the paper.</p>
               <p>But you know the amount? - It was fifty-two, or fifty-three pounds, including my hundred.</p>
               <p>Of course you cannot tell of what that other cash, or money, or whatever it was, consisted? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How many days was it before this, that you had taken up your acceptance? - I cannot recollect; it might be a fortnight, or three weeks.</p>
               <p>You, I suppose, had this entered in Mr. Maddock's books? - It was, I fetched the book way from the banker.</p>
               <p>You say you had not much cash in the house that day? - I had no bank notes.</p>
               <p>Are you certain of that? - Certain.</p>
               <p>Had you any the day before? - That I cannot tell, I cannot say upon my oath I had or had not.</p>
               <p>Had you any the day after? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you any in the drawer, the day before? - I cannot say whether I had any in the house the day before, or the day after.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this 24th of April? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Now how came you to be sure, that you had no other bank-notes in the house, on that day, when you cannot tell whether you had any the day before, or the day after? - I wanted to make Mr. Maddock a payment of 100 l. and upon that score, I am sensible I had no bank-notes in the house.</p>
               <p>Why did you want to make him a payment of 100 l? - Because I was indebted to him 100 l.</p>
               <p>On what account? - If the Court ask me, I will answer it.</p>
               <p>Do you think to get credit, by answering so? I assure I have no improper curiosity on the subject; was it on an acceptance? - It was a bill not due on that day, nor the day before; it was a bill paid to me, which I got discounted.</p>
               <p>Was it a bill that was necessary to be paid on that day? - No, nor on the day before; it was no acceptance of mine.</p>
               <p>Court. The meaning of this question, in this: whether it was a bill you wanted to pay that day? - Mr. Maddock called upon me that morning, and asked me if I could get him cash for a bill of 150 l. or a 151 l. or something of that amount, I told him. I had not cash enough, I got him cash, by a draft and cash.</p>
               <p>Then it was not for a debt, but to accommodate Mr. Maddock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no money due on Mr. Maddock the next day, or something about that time? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Not to any body else, about that time? - I have bills coming due often.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, this was to accommodate Mr. Maddock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did Mr. Maddock apply to you for it? - That morning; about twelve o'clock, I got a draft for 100 l. for that purpose; the amount of that bill was 50 l. and odd, Mr. Yeates let me have it, Mr. Maddock had only 100 l. that day, that was a sufficiency for him, I let him have the remainder again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maddock paid in something to his banker? - There was a check, and a draft.</p>
               <p>You told me just now, you did not know what it was? - I got a bill discounted for him, of Mr. Yeates, and I paid Mr. Maddock this 100 l.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030131"/>When did you give Mr. Maddock the remainder of this bill? - Some little time afterwards, I cannot say how long, I believe to the best of my knowledge I gave him an acceptance of my own.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards? - He drew upon me for the remainder, and I accepted the bill, I did not advance cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you right, you are sure you paid in no bank notes, to Messrs. Harrison's, but those you indorsed, as the produce of Moffat's draft? - I am not sure; I paid into Mr. Harrison's all I found in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you sure you did not pay a 50 l. bank-note, as part of that? - Yes, I am very sure of that, I am very sure upon my oath, that I paid it as described, and no other.</p>

               <p>Have you any entry to whom you paid it? - None at all.</p>

               <p>I understand you not to be sure? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Do you verily believe he is the person? - I do, I looked at him before, and I look at him now, and I believe he is the person, it is not the first draft I paid to him, I believe I have paid two, there was the 29 l. draft of Mr. Hills, I believe I paid it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say this: whether you paid the 29 l. draft, and the 60 l. draft to the same person? - That I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>How was the 29 l. draft paid? - Two 10 l. notes, and 9 l. in cash. No. 3636, 20th of September 1788, 10 l. No. 7507, 12th of December 1788, 10 l. and nine pounds in cash.</p>

               <p>There were many hundred people in your house that day? - No doubt of that; I have No. 406, the note I paid for the forged draft, with Mr. Baverstock's name upon it, three others are not yet come in.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that cancelled note? - From the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive it from there? - I cannot say who, but from the principal manager, who has these cases.</p>
               <p>Court. That will not do? - Here I have 50 l. and 30 l. 7944, 6th of April 1789, 50 l. 8373, 9th of April 1789, 30 l. each of these have the name of Mr. Baverstock, exactly the same as the 10 l. which I paid for the forged draft.</p>

               <p>Court to Baverstock. You have seen the prisoner write? - I have.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with his character of hand writing? - I am.</p>
               <p>Whose writing do you believe that to be? - To the best of my knowledge, I believe it to be the writing of the prisoner; when it was first shewn to me, before the prisoner was taken into custody, I said I believed it to be his, and do think it was the prisoner's, I believe that to be his hand writing to the best of my judgment, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. That is to say, that from all the circumstances you know, you believe it to be his? - From his writing being familiar to me, I do.</p>
               <p>Is it like his usual hand, the name of Richard Hill? - There are several letters that are like it.</p>
               <p>If it was exactly as his hand writing is, he could not imitate the forgery? - There are some letters in it, which is very much like his manner of writing.</p>
               <p>Why surely you do not mean to say, that you positively believe that to be his hand writing? - To the best of my knowledge it is; I cannot say upon my oath, that it is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say any more than this now; that you conjecture it to be his? - It is to the best of my knowledge of his hand writing, and I conjecture it to be his; there is a book in my shop, which he daily wrote in.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing more like that, than a similarity of letters? - No Sir, I cannot say there is, the stiffness in the writing in general, is very much like his writing; he has not been with me above four or five months.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Bezat. Have you the draft for 29 l. that you paid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let me look at it.</p>
               <p>(Handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hill. Where did you write your draft for 29 l. - At Mr. Baverstock's house.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the paper? - I do not remember, it was upon the desk in his inner room.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room when you wrote the draft? - Mr. and Mrs. Baverstock was in that, or the adjoining room; who were in that part of the room, I cannot say, in the bottom part they were both, I wrote it in the inner room.</p>
               <p>Were both, or either of them, in the inner room? - I cannot pretend to say, I gave the payment to Mr. Baverstock himself.</p>
               <p>Was he with you when you wrote the draft? - I was busy at the time, he was in and out of the room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who gave you the paper? - I do not, it was laid before me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030133"/>I was not apprehensive of any consequences and I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the prisoner was in the room? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Baverstock. Do you mean to swear, that this draft is in the usual hand writing of the prisoner Coleman? - It is very much like his usual common hand writing, many of the letters are.</p>
               <p>Is it in general, like his common hand writing? - I cannot say the generality is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at this, and tell me if you believe this to be the prisoner's hand writing? - Yes, I believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Have you the same reason for believing this to be his hand writing, as you have to believe this draft to be his writing? - From the knowledge of his character, and the familiarity of his hand.</p>
               <p>Do you believe this to be his hand writing? - Yes I do.</p>
               <p>Court. How is the indictment, as to the name of Richard Hill? - Richd: with two dotts.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BARLOW sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner very well; on the 27th of February, I remember him asking me for cash for 29 l. I did not see it, for I could not give him change; I told him, I had not change to give him; he sat down in my bar, and gave the change out of his own pocket, all but a few shillings, which he borrowed of me, to the amount of about 10 s. or 12 s. to make up the change.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you on the subject? - No further than he said, he should tell his master, he had the change of me, by reason he did not like they should know he had cash by him, on account they might very likely often want to borrow; I never did change any such note, I have changed several bank-notes, but never any drafts; I delivered a bank note to Mr. Winbolt, I wrote my name upon it; this is the bank-note, I believe I received it from the prisoner, I think I did, I recollect very perfectly changing him a 10 l. bank-note the week before I delivered the note to that gentleman Mr. Winbolt.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that to be the 10 l. note that you changed? - Yes, the note I wrote my name on, I believe it was his, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you any other 10 l. bank-note? - I cannot recollect, I cannot positively swear that I received that from the prisoner, but to the best of my recollection I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to shew that the prisoner received that at the banker's, No. 7507,

               <p>Mr. Garrow. We understand that on the 24th of April you had a money transaction with Mr. Baverstock; did you deliver to him a sum of money to carry with other money to your banker's? - Yes, I believe it might be about the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>What was it you delivered to him to carry to your banker? - The sum made up and sent to the banker was 152 l. to the best of my recollection, I delivered a draft upon Vere and Co. for 42 l. and a bank note of 10 l.</p>
               <p>Where did you receive the 10 l. banknote? - I really do not know, I have not the most distant idea where I received it; the only circumstance that induced me to believe that I took a bank-note and draft on Vere and Co. was, because I had just seen my banker's book; and I wish the Court might understand why I presume it to have been so; for I have it not in recollection whether it was cash or bank-note; I am not positive.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030134"/>Have you any recollection at all whether on the bank-note you delivered to Baverstock his name was wrote? - I have no recollection of that.</p>
               <p>If it had been there, do you think it would have struck your observation? - I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You received some money, not a great while before this, from Mr. Baverstock, for an acceptance? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection whether you received that part in cash, and part in banknotes? - I think it very probable that this same bank note was what had been paid me before by Mr. Baverstock; it might or it might not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner and searched him; I found upon him two keys, the key of the street-door, and the key of the room-door; he was asked what these keys belonged to; he said they were the keys of his lodgings, which was at Wild-street at his brother's; he went with us to his brother's, and searched the lodging, he pretended to lodge there; I forgot the street where he did lodge, but he said he lodged at his brother's since Christmas; I found that neither of these keys answered the purpose; I went afterwards with Mr. Winbolt to King's-head-court, St. Paul's Church-yard; I tried the key to the street-door, and the key opened it; we enquired at the barber's, where he formerly lived.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you find any thing there that he has since claimed? - Yes, the other key opened the one pair of stairs door, there I found a 70 l. bank-note, including one bank post-bill; sixty-one guineas in gold, and two half guineas; the gold I returned, the bank-notes are here.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had these lodgings in King's-head-court? - No, he went with me to Wild-street; he was asked whether he had any other lodgings; he said no, he lived in Wild-street; afterwards he owned the lodgings, and a number of things that were brought from these lodgings were given up to him.</p>
               <p>After the key did not agree, did the prisoner say any thing about the keys? - He said they were two keys that he picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. The tendency of this evidence is to prejudice the Court and Jury by leading them to suppose that the prisoner had something to conceal; if that something he had to conceal was connected with this charge, it is proper evidence; but if it appears it had no connection with this charge, it is then improper evidence, irrelevant evidence, which can have no other effect then to lead the Jury to suspect that he has been guilty of some other crime.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit it is perfectly competent.</p>
               <p>Court. It has been heard now, but I shall tell the Jury it is not to be attended to: I am of opinion, perhaps a little differing from some high authorities, I am of opinion, that if a man files; in order to know what he fled for, it is necessary to know what he was charged with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then pursuing that, he is charged with forgery, the produce of which is found at the lodging of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Which is not any part of that which was received; therefore any other thing would be just as good evidence as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the case of his namesake, was not that evidence, that a great number of guineas were found upon him, not exactly corresponding with the number that was lost; but if, instead of guineas, a quantity of bank-notes had been found in his possession, would not it have been competent evidence?</p>
               <p>Court. This is not money nearly corresponding at all; it is more than double, and where the man is proved to be worth the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I apprehend the duty of a Counsel to be this; if they have a case to conduct for the publick, and illegal evidence is put into their hands, they have no power to suppress it; if the Court say it is illegal, that is another thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you your deputation with you as an officer of excise? - Not here, I have at home, that is Cornwall.</p>
               <p>This was about ten at night when you first saw these persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was totally without any goods whatever? - No.</p>
               <p>How far distant might the other be behind? - As far as to the window; Barkett and Julian were side by side; he said halloo, when he passed by, but when he came up he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not one of you strike this man as he passed you? - No, I did not, till he made a blow at Julian, and then I struck him.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that when he passed by you did not strike him? - I would swear a thousand times, that I suppose he called out halloo, to know who we were; I was provided with a cutlass and pistol.</p>
               <p>Your arms were not at all held by them before you pulled out your cutlass, and began to strike about you? - No.</p>
               <p>That cutlass would have done a little excution, if your arms had not been held - If I could have done it I should, for their behaviour; I thought it was better to kill than be killed, when it came to that.</p>
               <p>You had a good intention then? - I had an intention to save myself.</p>
               <p>Did you at all speak to Williams before you

             the cutlass through his hands so let it go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I believe his hand was not much the better for the cutlass being drawn through it? - I do not know what his hand was, but I believe his fingers were pretty well cut one of them; had the gentlemen here been in my place, they would not have found it a laughing matter.</p>
               <p>Were not his fingers almost cut off? - I saw one of them.</p>
               <p>How was that hanging by the skin? - No, no.</p>
               <p>No! was not it very severely cut? - I do know, I know very well, he was cut in the fingers; what finger I do not know, I cannot say that, I know his hand was cut with drawing it thro', but I know he took my hanger, and I drew it thro' his hand, I know the finger was cut.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe you thought more about yourself than his hand, when you went to the public house? - I tried to take care of myself, I had some brandy to wash my hand.</p>
               <p>What is Williams? - A noted smuggler, he and his three brothers be in the Exchequer now.</p>

               <p>Was you with Mr. Ascott and Mr. Barker, on the 23d of December? - I was; we expected some muggler the way; I was at Chandem, near Penzance Mr. Barket, and Mr. Ascott, and me went out in the evening, between 9 and 10, we saw three men on horse-back, going towards Penzance on the beach, Mr. Ascott and me followed these three men, and Mr. Barket went on to Penzance town, in order to meet, when I came up with them I knew Williams, we got on towards Penzance Kev, and then the three men turned round and met us; Williams was riding a single horse, I called him by his name, says I, Mr. Williams, is it you? or something of that sort, so I passed on, and made up towards the other two men, who had ankers, Williams had no anker; I made up towards him, and after I spoke to him, I passed by towards the horses; says I, gentlemen, you had better give up the goods quietly; they made no answer, Williams turned round his horse, and rode up to me, and struck me.</p>
               <p>Had you struck him before that? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Did you strike him at all? - No Sir, I had not struck at any man, Mr. Ascott was alongside of me, he struck Williams, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030141"/>knocked him off his horse; with that the other two men on the ankers, jumped off, one ran to me, and struck me, and the other to Mr. Ascott, and he struck me several times over my head, and broke a stick over my head, Williams I believe was on the ground at that time, but I cannot say, we fought some time, at last the man I fought with ran away, Mr. Ascott and the man that attacked him, were fighting at the same time, then I secured a horse, and two ankers, and tasted it, and it appeared to be foreign brandy, when I had secured that, I tied the horse to the anker, and went back to assist Ascott, who was crying out, when I came back to Mr. Ascott, there was this Williams and the other person, and Mr. Barkett, and Mr. Ascott; Mr. Barkett came before me, I saw Ascott just before me, when I came back, and I saw Barkett haul off Williams from fighting Mr. Ascott, and he took Williams then, and secured him, and took him to the public house, the other man ran away, the man I fought with ran away, and took one of the horses with him, the anchor and horse that we did seize, we lodged in the public-house, in Penzance town, the horse they tell me was stolen, I know nothing about that, but the brandy is there still.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was the first person that was struck in this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now perhaps you may say, as the other witnesses did; that you had given no kind of provocation whatever to Williams, now I will ask you, whether you did not, in passing Williams, give him some insult, or jostle him, or strike him? - No I did not.</p>

               <p>(Mr. Hodgson, the short hand writer, was then ordered to read his notes, which he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me, that no one of the assignments, which state that Radenhurst swore that Frazier did any thing, are proved. I will tell you my doubts upon that assignment, which struck me upon reading the abstract originally, and I put a query upon it; whether that assignment is or can be a material assignment for this reason, I am inclined at present to be of opinion, that what is in that part of the indictment stated that Radenhurst swore, is not evidence; now if it is not evidence, it cannot, by any possibility be material; as to what the woman swore before the magistrate, it was not admissible evidence, and if it had come out in a state of the prosecution, where it could affect the prisoner, I should not have received that evidence; but on looking over the short hand writer's notes, I find it was not at such a time, but where it was desired by the Prisoner himself; for previous to that I had declared my opinion, that supposing all that Radenhurst swore, to be true, it did not amount to felony at all; therefore it was before that clear that the prisoner was to be acquitted; it therefore became unnecessary for the Court, to watch with any degree of accuracy, whether what Radenhurst said, subsequent to that, was strictly admissible evidence, or not; I doubt even this, whether any thing that Radenhurst said upon examination, subsequent to that direction to the jury to acquit the prisoner, whether any thing he said after the inquiry, whether the Court should give a copy of the indictment, can be considered as material evidence; I have a very clear opinion of that; and the consequence of that on this indictment, will be, that that assignment cannot be brought home to the prisoner; then as resting on the other assignments, it seems to me, that Mr. Hodgson's evidence, as to what the prisoner said, does not support any of the assignments, which charge him to have sworn that Frazier did any thing, for he has in no part of his evidence swore that Mr. Frazier did any act, but that it was done by a person, whom he believed to be Frazier, that it was done by a gentleman like him in green, and assigning as the perjury, that in truth and in fact, he did not believe it to be Mr. Frazier that so did; and in truth and in fact, that the person who so did, is not Mr. Frazier; that will reduce the whole of this indictment, to the first assignment; that Mr. Jenkins did not call a gentleman out of the room, by the name of Frazier.</p>

               <p>Was you called out by Mr. Jenkins at all, to speak to the prisoner? - I was not.</p>

               <p>Are you positive that you was not called out of the room by Mrs. Jenkins? - Most undoubtedly so, clearly so.</p>
               <p>Was any body called out? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was you out of the room? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>At any time when the dispute was between him, and somebody else? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The man was beat by somebody? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Mrs. Jenkins, about the time of that transaction, while Radenhurst was waiting there, call to you at the door of the room, on any occasion? - She did not.</p>
               <p>COLIN M'CREE sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you one of the party who were present at this dance? - I was.</p>
               <p>There was a dispute between the oyster man and somebody? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was you called out by Mr. Jenkins? - I was.</p>
               <p>By what name? - By my own name, Mr. M'Cree; Mr. Frazier was not called out, he had no share in the dispute.</p>
               <p>The dispute was between you and the Prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>It was the other person, that he was desired to look at? - He was desired to look at all that were present, and point out the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frazier had nothing to do in the dispute with him at all? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure Mrs. Jenkins did not call you, by the name of Frazier? - She did not I am sure, he was dancing at the time; he was beginning to lead down the dance, and I was at the bottom; after she called me, she went to the place where the prisoner was; the dispute was not in the place where the prisoner was, the time the prisoner was sitting in the supper room, I was called out of the dancing room, to the supper room; the prisoner was sitting at the table, behaving in a very riotous manner, insulting all those that passed thro' the room, and Mrs. Jenkins came up to me; the dispute began there but the scuffle began below stairs; Mrs. Jenkins did not go down stairs, Mr. Frazier had nothing to do in the scuffle, above or below, the whole scuffle was between him and me, whatever was done, was done by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you were all dressed alike in green, at the trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you green, on the night of the dancing? - I was not in green, I believe they call it, the mud of Paris, it had an edging round, and singular from every other dress in the room: Mr. Frazier was dressed in green that night, as well as at the trial; I believe the very colour he now wears.</p>

               <p>Then you came out, and I believe you struck him? - I defended myself, and of course I struck him; from the appearance of the man, I wished to avoid every dispute with him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the dispute between the prisoner and Mr. M'Cree? - The prisoner was asked up stairs, to have some supper with the servants, and he was swearing and cursing; I asked him who had affronted him, he said nobody; I asked him if he was paid, he said no; I went to the room, I meant to apply to Mr. Frazier, and found Mr. M'Cree at the bottom, and he turned round, and I nodded to him, and did not mention any name at all, and he came and I asked him to lend me 6 s. he asked me what was the matter, and I said the oyster-man is abusing us, I wish he was paid and was gone; Mr. M'Cree came out, and asked him to come out of the supper room, and he would pay him; he not having change, returned into the dancing room again; the prisoner pushed, and tried to follow him.</p>
               <p>Did you call Mr. M'Cree, by the name of Frazier? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you mention the name of Frazier? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner you would fetch Mr. Frazier? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Was not Mr. Frazier master of the ceremonies? - Part of the night.</p>
               <p>Is it not customary for him to pay the bills? - I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>When this man was riotous who was the person that ought to have paid him? - I was going to pay him myself, I generally pay for such things, and am paid afterwards, the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you, at the time understand, was to pay him? - Mr. Jenkins.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Jenkins about at this time? - I don't recollect particularly what he was doing.</p>
               <p>When your husband is employed, who takes care of the management.</p>
               <p>The master of the ceremonies directs the dances, and Mr. Jenkins pays the bills. I was by myself and much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Did you not mention any name? - No, I beckoned Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prisoner your husband would pay him? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what Mr. Jenkins said to him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to call M'Cree particularly? - He had been master of the ceremonies, before Mr. Frazier came, and I had some knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Court. When you found you had not money sufficient, who did you mean to apply to for the deficiency? - Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Suppose you or your husband has not money enough in his pocket to pay, who did he usually apply to? - I don't know he ever had occasion.</p>
               <p>When you found you had not money enough, did you say any thing, and what to the prisoner? - Nothing, I went to the dancing room, and meant to have him paid, and have done with him; and nodded to Mr. M'Cree, he being at the bottom of the room. I asked him to lend me 6 s. he asked what was the matter; I said a nasty man had affronted me; he came out; and called the prisoner to the door, and he put his hand in his pocket, and found he had not enough, and went into the dancing room, and the prisoner pushed and tried to get in.</p>
               <p>M'Cree. When I came out of the dancing room, I asked him the reason of his behaviour, he said he wanted to be paid; I told him if he would go to the bottom of the stairs I would pay him; he refused, I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had not enough, and went into the room, and borrowed some silver.</p>

               <p>Did you mention the name of Frazier? - No.</p>

Gentlemen, I hope you will excuse me for being so bold to speak in the court, but this woman is as innocent as a child unborn; she happened to come into the place where this robbery was done, she asked for the loan of a pair of bellows, and she was cast for death; and after being cast for death, I think to be cast for life is very hard; if this woman's sentence is not mitigated I will freely die with her, I am but a young girl, I am but one and twenty years of age.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. When I appeal to the Court, and observe that the admonition your Lordship has given has had that effect, which your Lordship's admonitions seldom fail to produce, I humbly conceive your Lordship will permit that unfortunate woman to be brought in once more.</p>
               <p>Court. It is only subjecting the King's mercy to insult, to suffer her to be brought up again.</p>

I do not think that the King's mercy should go a begging, or be subjected to insult; the justice of the country is concerned, that the unhappy persons, who have forfeited their lives, should be made examples of; but I can shew no indulgence to those, who treat the mercy of the king with contempt, no application can be heard, that does not come from the prisoner, and an application, even coming from the prisoner, must be now received with great doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I only ask the Court, to consider the order not to be irrevocable.</p>

Sarah Cowden, the only question you have to answer respects yourself; the King, after you had justly forfeited your life to the laws of your country, has been graciously pleased to extend his mercy to you, and to spare that life which has been so forfeited; but his Majesty has thought fit to annex a condition to his pardon; your life was in the power of your sovereign, he has extended his mercy so as to spare that life, and he has persevered so much in his merciful disposition, that though he might justly have doomed you to death, without affording you any further opportunity of benefiting by his gracious favor, he has now with unparalelled goodness, afforded you a second opportunity of saving your forfeited life; you therefore have nothing to do with the case of any other person but yourself; and you are to chuse, whether you will accept of the mercy of your sovereign, and preserve that life which he has put into your power to save, or whether you chuse to be remanded to immediate execution? - I will accept of my sentence willingly, if this woman's sentence is mitigated.</p>

               . Gentlemen, I hope you will excuse me for being so bold to speak in the court, but this woman is as innocent as a child unborn; she happened to come into the place where this robbery was done, she asked for the loan of a pair of bellows, and she was cast for death; and after being cast for death, I think to be cast for life is very hard; if this woman's sentence is not mitigated I will freely die with her, I am but a young girl, I am but one and twenty years of age.</p>
                  <p>Court. You will attend to this; the government of the country will not suffer the mercy of the King to be trifled with; if you continue to refuse his Majesty's pardon, I thing it right to tell you your fate, and also that of your companion, for whom you seem so much interested; I have offered the King's pardon to you; if you refuse it, I shall order you to be remanded; and you must prepare to die the day following; you shall be executed the day following. - I hope I shall have more mercy shewn me than ever I had at this bar.</p>
                  <p>Court. If you are sufficiently prepared to die on Thursday next, the Court will give orders accordingly? - That I am.</p>
                  <p>Court. Let her stand committed to the cells, and let the sheriffs prepare for an execution on Thursday morning; take her away.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Garrow. When I appeal to the Court, and observe that the admonition your Lordship has given has had that effect, which your Lordship's admonitions seldom fail to produce, I humbly conceive your Lordship will permit that unfortunate woman to be brought in once more.</p>
                  <p>Court. It is only subjecting the King's mercy to insult, to suffer her to be brought up again.</p>

I do not think that the King's mercy should go a begging, or be subjected to insult; the justice of the country is concerned, that the unhappy persons, who have forfeited their lives, should be made examples of; but I can shew no indulgence to those, who treat the mercy of the king with contempt, no application can be heard, that does not come from the prisoner, and an application, even coming from the prisoner, must be now received with great doubt.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030152"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>

               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, which is a sufficient Instructor of itself, is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also his Publication, entitled,</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System of Short-Hand;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Short-Hand Alphabets, and</p>
               <p>"two Extracts by way of Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers, and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law and others, immediately attended to: Addressed to Mr. Hodgson, at his House, No. 13, White Lyon Row, Islington, or left for him, at No. 35, Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last sixteen Years, which he will dispose of; or any person wishing to see any particular Trial, may have an Inspection of the same, or take a Copy of it, at the usual Prices.</p>
