               <p>Grey. I shall be fourteen next May. It rained very hard that night; I went below; Mr. Judd bid me see if any body was stealing the butter; I went up; I saw three men stealing the butter. The prisoner was standing upon the gunnel of the lighter; there was a man under the head sheets where the butter was: the third man was in a skuller along-side of the lighter. I saw the prisoner handing the butter firkins into the skuller; there was one firkin left upon the lighters gunnel, they were in such a hurry to get away: I called out directly that they were stealing the butter; a gentleman and Mr. Judd jumped into a boat and rowed after them, but could not make any discovery of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Grey. After they had come back from pursuing them; it was just four o'clock by the gentleman's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the man under the sheets?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; I saw a man there, but I could not take particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get into the skuller too?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; they all did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many firkins did you see them hand over the lighter?</p>
               <p>Grey. While I was upon the deck I saw them hand one into the skuller, then I cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes; the night before he brought a lighter to take away some lead in: next morning I knew him again as soon as I saw him.</p>

               <p>Grey. It was moon light, but the moon was rather under a cloud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see them?</p>
               <p>Grey. Yes it was. I told my master I knew one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you say he was?</p>

            . I happened to be at Mr. White's at this time; his shop woman cried out somebody has stole something; the man ran up Goulston Square; we opened the door that goes into the square and run after him; the prisoner looked round at the corner to see if they were pursued; he pushed the other that had the lace away; I said to Mr. White, will you take care of him, I will pursue the other: he stood at the corner looking back to see if he was pursued. I pursued the other for some considerable time through many allies into Spital-fields; it was just at the duke of the evening. I lost him; a coming back I met the prisoner again; I said my friend, you are one of them; he asked me what that meant; I said you are one of the men that took the things, come back with me and I'll tell you what I mean; he began straggling; we struggled together, I believe, a quarter of an hour. Mr. White heard I had get him again, he came up. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160006"/> prisoner knocked me down two or three times; we took him back to Mr. White's shop.</p>

               <p>They would not give me time to talk for myself before the justice; upon Tuesday morning I went into the country; I walked with an acquaintance from Bow to Goulston Square. I saw two or three men run very fast; there was a wooden entry in the square; the gentleman hearing me go through turned round and said, you robbed my shop, and knocked me down. A gentleman, a brewer, bid him run after the other men that were gone along; he let me go, and went to stop the other man. I went the rest of the way home; I met this gentleman; he said I was the man he run after; he said I robbed his shop; I said, search me; they dragged me all the way; they sent for a constable; the shop-woman gave orders to charge me; they took me to a back parlour, stripped me, and found nothing upon me.</p>

             can tell better than I, I was in the shop a good deal; he went into the shop; then they shut the sash door between the shop and the kitchen, then he went back into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come as a visitor, or customer?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He only came to buy things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell what passed at the time of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I waked in the morning on the twenty-second of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house secure over night?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, my chamber door was neither locked nor bolted; I waked in the morning; I heard the rustling of paper; the lamp I had in the room burnt very bright; I looked across the room and saw the line move a bit of cord that run across the room; I was frightened, then I knew it could not move of itself; I looked a little and saw the line move; I looked, presently a man peeped in at the foot of the bed; I got up an end in my bed, opened the curtains, and looked at the man. I said, very well sir; he said D - n you, madam, if you speak another word you are a dead woman immediately: he stood a little, and did not say any thing; presently he draw'd towards the top of the stairs, and called, Come along Jack, very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said, Very well sir, that seemed to be an expression as if you knew the person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I knew him extremely well; I knew him directly; if I had not seen him I should have known him by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you said, Very well sir, had you a view of his person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are to consider this man's life is depending; you can't be too cautious?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could tell him by his voice or back but I saw his face. I said never a word, only that I would not speak any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he went out of the room?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not stay above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take any thing?</p>
               <p>Nichols. When I first saw him, he had something in his hand white, like linen; he droped it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your room?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, my watch and bag of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you carried up any money the night before?</p>

               <p>Q. What time of night was it you saw the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I had a fancy that it was about five in the morning, my watch being gone I could not tell; there was a bag of money upon the dressing-table by the looking-glass; as soon as I could put a few things about me I got up; I heard somebody going out of the yard door before I could get out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards heard somebody say, Come along Jack; Who was that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The man in the room; he said it close to my bed-side; I could have laid hold of him if I dared; when I came down stairs the yard door was wide open; the kitchen door that goes into the street was unlocked and unbolted, that is locked and bolted with two bolts; the shop door quite open, the lock was unscrewed; the lock was on it the night before, and the key was carried up stairs; I saw the watch the night before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Nichols. All the canisters were empty; there was some coffee and lump butter, one silver spoon out of the till, and there was three shillings in silver. I know the consequence of an oath; I know what I say; I am positive he is the man; they got in at the sash window where the maid lies.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that sash window the night before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find it in the morning?</p>
               <p>Nichols. At first I said I believed he came in at the door; we went up into Betry Brookers's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160008"/> room over the shop, there the sash was up as high as it could go; it used to be fastened down with a nail; the nail was bent in so that we could hardly get the sash down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into this room as soon as you had examined below?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; it was above a quarter of an hour; the window curtain had wet fresh dirt upon it, and fresh dirt upon the table under the window; it was a rainy morning; the curtain was daubed in two places, the table in one place; it was quite wet; there was no mark in the room; I suppose he took his shoes off; I lost three loaves of eight-penny sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first give the alarm of this?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I sent for a gentleman; I went out into the garden to see which way they went with the things; the garden gate was open, unbolted, and the lock bursted: there was a leather bottom chair took out of the kitchen and left in the garden, and a brass candlestick from the mantle-piece; the door of that gate was bursted open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the alarm to your neighbours?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I sent to Mr. Williams; I told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you name the person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I did; he said he would have me get a warrant of a justice; we went, and they would not grant a warrant. In the afternoon we went to Sir

               <p>Q. When did you see Sir John?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Upon Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a warrant then?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I will not be positive; the prisoner was taken up on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Sir John grant a warrant?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He was brought before Sir John from prison before we came there; the constable went to the prison for him, but he had been gone some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before Sir John?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; a little, not much; he asked me but a few questions; what he asked me I answered. He asked me what reasons I had to think that was the man; I said, by his cloaths, his shape, and his voice: he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was he discharged.</p>
               <p>Nichols. The justice only asked me this; Was you in the room alone when you saw the man. I said, no; I had only a young woman in the bed with me, there she is, she was never called. I thought she would have been called; then he said to the man, What have you got to say for yourself? his landlord and landlady both swore (I think it was nine o'clock they swore to) that he was in from nine o'clock on Saturday night, till a quarter after seven next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Only these two; the justice said, Who locks your door; the man said, He locked it himself: the justice said, Who keeps the key; he said, I take it into my own room, and hang it at the foot of my bed every night, I always do it; the justice thought a little while, and said he could not do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you was before Sir John again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I think he was taken up on Wednesday. Yesterday week; I think so, I will not be positive; I went to Sir John again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be committed the second time and not the first?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I told him I thought for want of knowledge, and my being so very ignorant and no witnesses called; that I had been counselled to take him up again for the same fact; he said, Then I hope you will sware positive to him. I said, I did that before; he said, No, you did not sware positive to him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You only swore to his stature, his coat and voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I swore positively according to my knowledge, and the understanding I had of his person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160009"/>Q. Was you positive the first time as to his person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, among other expressions, his countenance.</p>
               <p>Nichols. No; his coat. I said, stature, voice and cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. From the out-set of it, whether at the time you saw him in the room you knew his person?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>

               <p>Nichols. Not in common, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You desired him to go out?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Not I, the maid did.</p>
               <p>Q. He refused to go out?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever refused to go out before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the footing of intimacy with you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I never liked him, I was always afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been afraid of him before this time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He always put a dump upon my spirits, he swore so bitterly.</p>
               <p>Q. All your conversation was about buying of things?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sitting there to sleep knocked like a visitor?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not like him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the feet curtains were open?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you first see him at the feet?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, he peeped in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not say any thing, but turned towards the drawers, he was sorting things over in the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The first thing I heard was the rustling of paper in the little drawer he pulled out.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was sorting things; what did you mean by that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He was picking out the lies I suppose, thieves generally do.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I spoke to him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He had turned away from the drawers. I opened the side curtain and looked at him, and said, Very well, sir; then he said, Madam, if you speak another word you are a dead woman immediately. I said I would not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him from head to foot?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant from the bed?</p>
               <p>Nichols. About so far described, about five foot.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know his voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could sware to his voice among a thousand men.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way is the head of the bed?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Opposite the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. When he passed you, his back was to the lamp?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Side-ways, as he peeped in.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you should know him by his back?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you sware to him by seeing his back?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know him by his back without seeing his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I could know him by his back; I should not chuse to sware to a man that I saw nothing but his back, but I saw his face and heard his voice, which is more evident.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you should know him by the hanging of his arms; you was terrified I suppose?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In this situation you might be mistaken, as to the person, I should think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could not be mistaken, I was as sensible as I am now, my room was as light as it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the young woman in bed with you?</p>
               <p>Nichols.

               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you or did you not mention his name to the justice's clerk?</p>
               <p>Nichols. To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention his name at that time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When before Sir John, you swore you say, to his statute, his cloaths and his voice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not at that time doubtful as to his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No; but they never asked me any thing about his face.</p>
               <p>Q. They asked for what reasons you accused him of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give?</p>
               <p>Nichols. By knowing the man, I said by his stature, his coat and his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned nothing about his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. His face was never mentioned to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked whether you could sware positively.</p>
               <p>Nichols. I was not asked the question as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you, the second time before the justice, the justice said you must sware positive, because you had not before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; he did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect that you had not sworn positive before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I thought I had sworn as positive as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember telling the justice you saw his face?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, another witness was present the first time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell that to the justice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, I did: the justice said, Was you in the room alone; I said, No; he said, Who was with you; I said, A young woman in bed with me, there she is; they never called her.</p>
               <p>Q. This was upon Monday I think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes; the day before Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it before you thought of taking him up again?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I fancy yesterday was a week.</p>
               <p>Council. That was the ninth, then you let him alone above a fortnight; how came you to think of taking him up on Wednesday; What particular reason had you for taking him up at that time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I had not had advice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask advice?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Because I was not satisfied in my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had nothing happened between the 24th of December and the 9th of January? Had you received any letter from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I received a letter from an attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive it?</p>

               <p>Nichols. A day or two before I took him up the second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you that letter?</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. I have a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go to after you received this letter from the attorney?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I went to a friend to ask what was best to do. I went to ask Mr. Madan's advice the second time I had him before the justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you swear to him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Just as the justice of peace ordered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the jury what he ordered you.</p>
               <p>Nichols. He said I had not sworn positively before; now I must swear positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect, as well as you can, what you did swear before Sir

             the second time.</p>
               <p>Nichols. I told him positively, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any reasons?</p>
               <p>Nichols. He did not ask me any particulars, as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any thing else before Sir 
               <persName id="t17710116-4-person84">

            ?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I cannot say I know; I said I would swear positively. He said I did not swear positively before; I thought I had.</p>
               <p>Q. At the first time could you swear positively?</p>
               <p>Nichols. If I had been asked, I would; that question was not put to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked by the justice if you could swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your declaring that you could not swear positively to him the first time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160011"/>Nichols. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you could not swear to him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you express any doubt about him?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I swore to his stature, his cloaths and voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked whether you could undertake to say he was the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I might be asked that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what answer you made to that?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I cannot recollect?</p>
               <p>Court. It seems natural to me that when you said to the justice of peace you swore to the stature, voice and cloaths of the man, did the justice then say, can you be positive to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I don't know. If I heard it, I did not understand it?</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Nichols. It was a coat without a cape, something of a darkish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him in that coat before?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes, many times.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had received this letter whether you did not say, Let him take care of himself, I may hang him yet if necessary?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor words to that effect?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not angry when you received that letter?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I could not receive it with joy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say in the first transport of your resentment?</p>
               <p>Nichols. The boy brought the letter. I said, I believe you have made a rod for your own back-side; but I said nothing about hanging him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been robbed three times, I think?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say you received collections made for you every time?</p>
               <p>Nichols. I never had any collection made for me in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had collections made for you at Mr. Whitefields or Mr. Wesleys?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, I never had, nor never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Mr. Madan's, was it before or after receiving the letter?</p>
               <p>Nichols. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say you had lost a hundred pound on these occasions?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to the value of a hundred pound?</p>
               <p>Nichols. No, not forty, nor thirty.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. You said you was not asked the question, if you could positively swear to the man?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a question had been put, whether you could swear positively to the man; what would have been your answer?</p>
               <p>Nichols. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received this letter, who did you go to upon this occasion?</p>

               <p>Q. He used to frequent your house as a customer?</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you live at this place before this accident?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. About three months.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he come several times to your house?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. He generally used to ask for small beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming before?</p>

               <p>Sparrow. It was the Tuesday before he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that day, what did he do or say?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. He came in and behaved much like a drunken man: he came boldly into the kitchen, and sat himself down and asked for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160012"/> some beer, which was drawn him: and after he had drank part of the beer he desired me to get him some drink, or some sort of liquor. I told him I could not, we sold nothing but small beer; he answered, D - n you, I will have something; after that he desired me to make him some tea; I told him it was inconvenient as we were a washing, and had not opportunity to get tea for ourselves; I desired him to walk out of doors. but he said he would not; I told him he was very much in the way as I wanted to get up our cloaths; after that he got up and went into the shop and shut too the door; he has a remarkable voice, I know it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time this robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Sparrow. I always used to fasten that door every night, and bolt it; but that night I forgot it, and it was not fastened: my mistress waked me that night between four and five o'clock; as she waked me, I saw a man pass down the side of the bed; I only saw him go by the curtains. As he was a going out, he called aloud, Come along Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after he was out of the room?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It was while he was going out of the room; there were other words passed, but I was not sensibly awake enough to understand what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Words? after he was out of the room, as before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Words with Mrs. Nichols.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your knowledge of the voice of the man, was it that man's voice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Positively I can swear to that man's voice. I never heard any man's voice like his in all my life. I could distinguish his voice among ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up was the money there?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the shadow of the man? or the man himself?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. The man himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the foot or the side of the bed?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; I saw him at my mistress's side of the curtains; she had opened the curtains before I was awake, she had opened the curtains by that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The door he went out of was upon the mistess's side of the curtains?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes; the money and watch were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down stairs were other things missing?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes, the kitchen was in an uproar, one thing here and another there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the doors?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160013"/>Sparrow. The yard door and the fore door were open; the fore door was unlocked, and just put to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the yard carried out as you know of?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I did not go into the yard at that time, but I did at day light; the lock was taken off; the screws were put upon a chair; it was unscrewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Seven canisters in the shop; all the tea took out, and the canisters were put down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tea in the shop the night before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any coffee?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. About two pounds of coffee missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs into the room where the other servant lay?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the window?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. When I went up into the room, I saw the window open that used to be fastened with a large nail; the nail was in that night; it was quite doubled: I tried to bring the window down again; I could not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the outside of the window?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. There was nothing on the outside, as I could perceive; but there was the dirt of a man's foot upon the window curtains and the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It rained very hard in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe in the yard next morning?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A chair in the yard by the gate, and a candlestick lay down flat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the candlestick and chair belong to your mistress?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark on the chair of a man having been there?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. None at all, that I could perceive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Sir John Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes, upon Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the justice ask you any questions?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Not one question at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Not by the clerk on the justice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. By nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, was there any question put to your mistress, whether she could positively swear to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I believe it was so far put to her as to answer to all questions that should be put to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect if any question was put to her, whether she could positively swear to the prisoner at the bar;</p>
               <p>Sparrow. To the best of my knowledge it was not: she said, there is the young woman that lay with me; and nodded her head at me.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured coat did this man use to wear?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A lightish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the same coat on that he had the Tuesday before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I cannot be particular as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark colour?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. It was a sort of a drab.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you waked in the morning?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Between four and five.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of a sound sleep?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first thing you took notice of when you waked?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Seeing a man in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The first words you took notice of to understand were, Come along Jack?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the door was he when he spoke these words?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Almost close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only thing you can be certain of, when just waked out of your sleep, is, this man said, Come along Jack?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak that very loud, or only in a middling voice?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. Very loud.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there in his voice that you should know it by?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. A rough, big voice, very remarkable.</p>

               <p>Sparrow. Justice Fielding asked her, what reasons she had for saying this was the man; she said she could swear to his voice, his stature, and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>

            . I lived with Mistress Nichols at the time of this robbery; I laid in the fore part of the house, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. That looks towards the street?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there sash of other windows?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Sash windows to that one room.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened down?</p>
               <p>Brooks. With a double ten-penny nail, that went through both sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty that this window was down and fastened, the night before this accident happened?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; I tried it before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are not mistaken?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was call'd in the morning, how was the window?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you waked by any noise in the night?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the panes of the window broke?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No; the nail was bent double almost; the nail was fastened in the wood; It was shoved out of the hole next the street, but not out of the other in pushing it up; it was fastened to the wood-work of another pane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sash apt to fall of itself?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; for we used to stick a piece of wood in it, in order to keep it up when we wanted it in the day time.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

               <p>Q. What family has she?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Only herself, the other young woman, and I. I have lived half a year with her the 24th of this month; the other about a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What other maid had she when you went?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Never a one.</p>
               <p>Q. She took another servant?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She had a sister alive; the sister was ill, and died after I was there; so she had another young woman come to live with her; in the morning the sash was up, and the nail fastened in the middle of the next pane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any glass broke?</p>

I went to him; and said, You had like to have been in a hobble; he said again, So I had, but I got clear of it; he said, she swore to my stature, my cloaths and my voice, but she could not swear to my face, but I had no more upon my face then than I have now.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he come home?</p>
               <p>Cripple. On Saturday the twenty-second of December I heard him come home about eight or nine o'clock; and about half an hour after nine, as near as I can guess; I heard him in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him?</p>
               <p>Cripple. No. but I heard him; and our partition is so thin, that we can hear each other speak. I heard him speak to his wife in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his going out in the morning?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I heard his child cry about a quarter after four; his wife had laid in but fifteen weeks; one of the children was ill, that waked the other, and their crying waked me. I lay awake from that time till six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cripple. No. He got up about half after seven, and went out; I did not see him, but I heard him speak, and his wife said, My dear shut the street door after you: the landlord always shuts up the street door, and takes the key up stairs.</p>

               <p>Cripple. Twenty-two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the landlord constantly shuts the house up that you can't get out?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the door was to be shut in the day time, is there not a spring lock?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes - he always calls up of a night to know if every body is within.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he locks the door always?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I have found it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, once.</p>

               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you found it so more than once, twice, or thrice?</p>
               <p>Cripple. They are generally up the first in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there a window that looks into the yard which communicates pretty near the wall?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes, the stair-case window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any difficulty to get out at that window?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Some difficulty, because there is no way to keep the window from falling down when you push it up?</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose he was in bed from half after nine till the morning.</p>
               <p>Cripple. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know the prisoner before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160016"/> go out at half past seven on a Sunday morning in the middle of December?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I don't know what business he had; I don't remember his doing so any other Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. From five till a quarter after seven did you hear him say any one thing?</p>
               <p>Cripple. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you hear him?</p>
               <p>Cripple. He is a very troublesome man in his sleep, he snores and groans very much; the children were both very cross about four or five o'clock, which waked my husband. I heard him talk to his wife for about half an hour; I heard him get up about a quarter after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had got up at the time the children cried must you not have heard him?</p>

               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of the street door?</p>
               <p>Cripple. Mr. Bonny, the landlord; he takes it up into his bed-chamber, and if we want to go out in the morning before he is up we ask for the key.</p>

            . I keep the house where the prisoner lodged, he came home that night about eight o'clock; I saw him go up into his room, I did not see him till a quarter past seven next morning going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you lie?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Upon the ground floor even with the shop. I heard him about four, or some time after four, talking to his wife; my wife and I were waked by the children's crying; it was almost seven before we went to sleep. I lay in the room under him. I always lock the door, and keep the key in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the street door fastened?</p>
               <p>Bonney. With two large bolts and a spring lock.</p>
               <p>Q. If your lodgers want to get out how do they do?</p>
               <p>Bonney. They can open the door, we don't double lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never double lock it?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that night?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I can't tell, my bed is within two yards of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person in the night unbolt the door and let himself out?</p>
               <p>Bonney. They could let themselves out; it is impossible but I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out first that morning?</p>
               <p>Bonney. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Council. Then it is plain he could get out without the key. What time does he generally go out on a Sunday morning?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I never took particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe his being at home by his snoring, but by his talking?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I believe he did not snore after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cripple's room nearer the prisoner's than yours?</p>
               <p>Bonney. I lay in the room under the prisoner, they lay in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him snore or groan at five or six in the morning?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Not to the best of my remembrance I was just got up when he came down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160017"/>Q. He has a remarkable manner of snoring and groaning has not he?</p>

               <p>Q. You would have heard him if he had snored or groaned?</p>
               <p>Bonney. Yes.</p>
               <p>- Bonney. I am wife to the last witness. The prisoner came home that night about eight o'clock; I went to bed at a quarter past twelve o'clock, we heard him all the evening; about a quarter past four the child cried, which waked me and my husband; I heard him talk from five till between six and seven; it was past seven before he got out of bed.</p>

            . I was at Sir John Fielding's when Mrs. Nichols was examined the prisoner's brother called upon me and desired me to go down to Sir John's. She said it was about four or between four and five on Sunday morning, and that a man came into her bed chamber, that the curtains were drawn, she raised herself up in the bed, and said, Who is there? or something to that purport; that the man d - d her and told her to lie down, or she was a dead woman. Sir John asked her how she came to suspect the prisoner? she said, there was a lamp burning in her chamber, and by that glimmering light she looked upon him to be the man; she said she did not see his face; the justice then asked her what was the grounds of her suspicion? she said, from his size; the colour of his coat, and his voice; and that she heard him say, D - n you, come along Jack, as he went out of the room. She said a woman was in bed with her; Sir John said, Has she any thing more to say than you have said; I think she intimated, No; or that she was asleep. The justice was very minute as to the circumstance of his face; she said she could not distinguish it.</p>

            . The twenty-ninth of last month my house was broke open; it was fastened by myself the night before; they broke open the kitchen in at the window. I fastened the window at twelve o'clock; the next morning, about half after seven, I got up; I had no sleep in the night. My wife and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160018"/> came down in the morning together; the window was opened; I missed a copper furnace, a few copper coverlids, and a copper tea-kettle. All these things were in the kitchen. The two prisoners were drinking in the room when I fastened the window. I was acquainted with one of them, particularly M'Guire. I know nothing of the other, no further than being there that night. As soon as I found this affair, I suspected these two persons. I then went to Justice Welch, and made information against them. Jackson was taken up on Tuesday morning following. The justice granted a warrant. It was on Saturday he was put in the Round-house. I went to them with the constable, and the man that took them was with me: he offered his service to the man to go to the place where they had sold his things. I was with them. They were taken by Mr. Pomroy. He said he would go to the place where the things were. I made him no promise of favour. He took us to the place where the goods were, Mr. Pomroy, I, and the constable. The things were in Great Newport-street, Seven Dials. I found my things there; I knew them to be my property. [The things produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.] I have not spoken to them since they were before Justice Welch. Having heard a bad character of M'Guire, was the reason of my suspecting him.</p>

He was sober next morning: I asked him where he had sold the things; he told us. Mr. Warren and I went with him to the place. We found these goods; they were owned by the prosecutor. I said it was proper the buyer should be taken into custody. He was taken, and put into the Round-house. Jackson said he would go and shew us where M'Guire lodged. He said M'Guire was the person who sold the things. We took M'Guire in Bridge-street, Hyde Park Corner. He was in bed. We brought him to Mr. Welch's. M'Guire did not say any thing.</p>

We went to another house, and staid till two o'clock. Coming back from that house, M'Guire went back, and got into this house, and took all these things. He went and hid them. I went to an alehouse to have a pint of beer, and some bread and cheese. We went there, and staid till it was late. About six o'clock he gave me the copper, and sent me with it to Mr. Inquant.</p>

I went to his lodgings and took some with; me this was about ten in the morning, he approved of a silver pin with brilliant diamonds; I told him I could shew him some diamond rings in the afternoon; he said he had thirty guineas to lay out for a lady; I went again in the afternoon, between five and six o'clock; he then fixed upon a diamond ring; then he bid me sit down and make a bill and receipt. He called for paper, I sat down to make it, I laid the ring and pin down upon the table I was writing upon; he walked up and down the room, and he took them from the table imperceptibly; he had a couteauon, and I think boots; he walked out of the room, I thought to bring me the money; I sat three or four minutes wondering he did not come in; I looked for the ring and pin, and they were gone.</p>

I went with Mr. Noakes to search the prisoner's house; I saw the prisoner and his wife standing by the fire; I told him I was come to search his house for some goods that were suspected to be there; he said, He knew nothing about it: I went up stairs, and upon the two pair of stairs was a shift which the prosecutrix claimed. I went up a ladder into a place that Miller called his work-shop; there I found the basket containing the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a constable. I have known the prisoner a great while. I saw him at Mr. Morris's, at the gun in St. John's Street; Mr. Morris brought in a saddle, and asked the company what it was worth. On the Saturday morning following. Mr. Morris came to me, and told me, he wanted to take up the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160023"/> for he was afraid of getting into a scrape by buying the saddle. We went to inquire for the prisoner in Clare-street. We found out the cellar where he lodged. We asked the wife, whether he was at home? She said, No. Morris said, Why, I want to drink a pot of beer with him. Upon which it was said he was at home, and he came up. We took him to Clapton. I was exceeding wet, and we had several ditches to get over. We begged he would not run away from us. He said he would not. He could have run away if he had thought sit. He jumped over the ditches, and then helped us over. I have kn own him a great number of years. I never heard any thing amiss of him. When I took him he said he bought the saddle of a man in a blue coat and red waistcoat coming from Highgate.</p>
               <p>- Dewett: I saw Mr. Morris buy this saddle of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said he had bought it of a man that had sold his horse. Mr. Morris gave him twelve and six-pence. He said he got but sixpence by it. I saw the saddle advertised. I went and told Mr. Morris of it.</p>

               <p>I had made a pair of shoes, and mended some shoes for a man that lives beyond Highgate. I went to him for my money, and received half a guinea. In coming back, I met a man in a blue coat and red waistcoat. He offered to sell me this saddle and bridle. Mr. Morris had spoke to me about a fortnight before to buy him a good second hand bridle, if I had an opportunity.</p>

I know the young woman last examined; she has been several times at my shop to buy odd things, spoons, &amp;c. I don't know where she lives. She never did any thing that I know of bad before this. She brought a candlestick to sell about the twenty-fourth of December last; the crest was almost split in two in the middle (the candlestick produced, broke in three pieces.) I told her it was stole, and I should stop it; and said if I did not know you, I would stop you as well as the plate. She said, a young man had given it her to sell. She did not tell me his name. She said, she knew him well, and he should be taken. I let her go, and shops the candlestick; she returned in about twenty minutes. Mr. Gardiner came with her. She wanted my advice, as they thought they were got into trouble. It was thought this Mr. Gardiner lived with this woman. I told them, if they knew the people, it was best to go to Sir

I keep an upholstery and cabinet warehouse in Moorfields, in partnership with two other people; I have got three looking glasses, two of them were bought when I was out of the way by my partners; one of them I bought the tenth of November, or thereabouts; I bid him money for it, he would not take it; he went away, in two minutes he came back and took the money. I have known him five or six years; I have bought goods of him; having bought this glass. Mr. Seddon's man came one day, and afted if we had bought any tea chests of one Edwards; my partner said not; I thought the glasses might he stole; I went to Mr. Seddon's, and shewed him the glass, one of the clerks went up in the shop, and the man acknowledged the work to be theirs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seddon. I know this to be mine.</p>
               <p>- Hitchcock. I keep an upholstery and cabinet warehouse in Moorfields; I bought three of these glasses; I bought one glass and two frames; I have known him five years; he was a master cabinet maker in Baldwin's Gardens, and kept men; I bought goods of him then, and have ever since.</p>
               <p>- Cloak. I am an upholsterer and cabinet maker; I live in Moorfields; I have two glasses I bought of the prisoner the beginning of December; I bought four in all, two of which I have sold; I have known him these five years; I bought goods of him at various times.</p>
               <p>- Abbott. I am a workman under Mr. Seddon, Mr. Russell came into the shop and brought a looking glass, and the clerk accompanied him, and asked me if I had got the back of it; there were particular marks in it that I knew it to be my own workmanship; and several afterwards were so done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I shall leave my defence to my council, but please to hear me a word or two in my defence upon this point. The goods which are now attempted to be proved to be the property of Mr. Seddon, are my own manufacturing. I lived six years ago in Baldwin's Gardens, Gray's Inn Lane. I went to an auction at Crayden, in Surry, and bought the glasses, and other goods to the value of 25 l. odd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160026"/> money. I sent a horse and cart for the goods the ensuing day, In coming home, about half a mile on the other side of Kingston Common, the Croydon stage and the cart met together, and a discard ensued between the people that drove the carriages. The glasses were all broke. and some of the goods injured before they came home. I made the best I could of them. I got new glasses for the frames. Some time after that, I moved into George-street, Southwark; there I continued some years in business. While I was there, Mr. Broker, a sugar-baker in Hog-lane, St. Giles's, informed me that he had got some sugar-chests to sell, that brought sugar from the Havannah, which is the wood these glass are made of. After that I went to live in Peter's-street, Soho, and there the bargain was made for this Havannah chest wood, commonly called Havannah sugarwood, Some were large, some small. In order to make these frames come cheap, I worked some time at it, till I could go no farther on account of want of necessaries. I wrote to a friend that supplied me with money (I shall call him.) I did not finish these frames; I went on with them; now and then; sometimes I made a table, or two or three; I went on, in order to support my family, at other times at nights, when my work was done. It was about November last was twelve months that I came into this Peter's-street, Soho. It was in August; I worked there some time, and made tables, and such things, which I sold to these gentlemen in Moorfields. A little time after that, I think about the month of August, it was one day of August last, I thought I would go and work journey-work. I went to Mr. Lewis in Baldwin's Gardens, to ask for work. He told me, if I could make such and such tables, which brother of mine did that is deceased; if I could make some of that kind of new tables, he would employ me. I went, and was them five weeks. I was inclined to go to table-working entirely. I went to Mr. Seddon's, being a gentleman that does a great deal of business. He told me he would employ me in table-making. I worked there three months successively. About two months ago, I had the ague. I acquainted my master with it. I had not been at work four or five days. He came to my bench, and spoke to me; he asked me the matter; I said, I have the ague. He said, You must get d - d drunk for it. One day I could work, another I could not. I thought I would sell these glasses I had so long by me, and finish these frances, which I did, made out of this Havannah wood, and sold them one by one, two was the most I sold together: If these glasses had been feloniously stolen, I should not have publickly sold them as I did, I employed myself with making up these glasses in this interval of time: the knife case I have been three years and nine months about: the furniture upon it I had from Birmingham, because, when in trade for myself, I had all my brass cabinet furniture from Birmingham: as to the wood in these mahogany frames, I hope the gentlemen of the jury will be acquainted with the nature of the wood; a baker might as well swear, with as much propriety, to a loaf cut one from the other, as a man swear that is his property: it is all straight grain. A carpenter might as well swear to a deal board, as there is no variety in it, as swear to that.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Seddon. Did you not say this was your own writing upon the cover?</p>
               <p>Seddon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fall. There was the same mark upon the case as there is upon the cover. I put my mark over it.</p>

On the 24th of December, about six o'clock, I missed my watch. I had heard the prisoner had been up my stairs about that time, therefore I suspected him; at last I went to the prisoner's room, which was not locked; searching there, I found under a bunch of paper, this my watch hanging up in the prisoner's room. We took him up before the justice.</p>
               <p>- Jefson. Upon the alarm of Rudge having lost his watch, Dalby came to us, and told us where the watch was; that he would shew. us, and he did shew us where it hung, and said, The prisoner put it there. We went for a warrant; while we were gone the prisoner came in and went up stairs; we went up after him to see what he was about. As soon as he came up into the room, the prisoner came in and said, There was a watch, and he had it from a child, and said, she found it upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>- Dalby. I was got drunk upon the day before Christmas day. Lying asleep in the tap-room, the prisoner waked me. I found my shoes were gone. The prisoner said, he had taken my shoes up stairs, and wanted me to go up, I said, I would not; the prisoner said, he had something particular to say to me. I went up, the prisoner took from under the foot of one of the beds this watch, and said, he found it upon that other bed, and said, it was the man's who lay in the other bed: I advised him to put it where he found it. He said, he would not, and then hung it up under this bunch of paper. I went to sleep again afterwards. There was an alarm about the watch. I told them the soldier had took the watch. I shewed them where it was.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced in court, deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not steal it. I was going up stairs. I wanted to get this lad in liquor into bed. Going up stairs, I found the watch. I prevailed upon the lad to go with me. I told him, I had found this watch. Dalby persuaded me to hang it where it hung, and told me, it would be enquired after by and by, and then I might give it the owner. I afterwards hung up the watch, went down stairs, then I heard a watch had been lost. I went up stairs to bring it down again, The people enquiring after it, came up. I told them there was the watch.</p>

I returned again about twelve. I left the prisoner's wife in the parlour. She had an apartment in the yard backwards. Being at my house, he lodged with her; he is a cabinet-maker. He worked for me at the time. The first thing I missed, was a bed and two pictures. I know the bed, the bolster, and pillow, the sheets and counterpane, and two blankets, and two pictures were altogether. They were goods for sale. Then I went into the parlour; there I missed all the pictures, which were six, and a glass. Then I went into the yard backwards, into one of the rooms they lodged in, where my chest was. It was a large chest; there was linen and all my cloaths, four or five coats, as many waistcoats, as many breeches, five or six shirts, some stockings, a pair of sheets; the chest was took away and all the things. The hat, and buckles, and plate, were in a large trunk; my hat and wig, a chest three foot six inches long; my pumps were in the lining of a great coat found upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the watch, and key, and plate?</p>
               <p>Morgan. The plate was locked in a drawer in the shop; the buckles were gone from a room in the yard; they were locked up in the chest; my watch laid upon the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner and his wife?</p>
               <p>Morgan. She was in the parlour when I went out; they were both gone when I came home again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you think they stole your things?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I suspected them. I found them out on the twenty-second; the next day he had conveyed the things on board a ship. He was in Darkhouse Lane, at a public house with his wife, I took them up, and found the things on board a ship; I believe it was the Peggy.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the things were gone on board a ship?</p>
               <p>Morgan. An acquaintance of mine in Rosemary Lane informed me of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she lie?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Just by the Tower wharf; I went do board her, and found a chest there; the captain went with us, and informed us where the prisoner was; we took them both up, and went to the Mansion-house; we attended at the Mansion-house on the Monday following; then we went to Justice Fielding; he was committed to the New Prison, and his wife acquitted; we found the plate and buckles; we found this hat upon the prisoner, he was wearing it, he had a shirt on too; he had a fair of my cloaths besides, and a pair of stockings; I cannot be sure whether he had the pumps on or not; he had one pair of buckles on, and one knee buckle; he had lost the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the chest? was the bed?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No, that was done up in a covering, and the bolster and part of the sheets; a pair of sheets were on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you found the sconce glass?</p>
               <p>Morgan. On board the ship, the glazed prints were packed loose, I believe there was three or four suits of cloaths in the chest; five or six shirts; a pair of sheets; some stockings; most of the plate was found upon the prisoner's wife; the punch ladle was found upon the prisoner; the rest of the plate the wife had in her pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any claim to these things?</p>
               <p>Morgan. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I never knew him before he came to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160029"/>Q. Had he been recommended to you?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I had a sort of a recommendation with him from Newcastle.</p>
               <p>Q. This ship was going to Newcastle; were the things all yours?</p>
               <p>Morgan. The things were all my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe him any money?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever borrow any money of him?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I borrowed two shillings once of his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sign any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Morgan. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of work. I went to seek a job. I met with this man in Whitechapel. I asked him for a job. Next day he shewed me his shop. He was a new beginner. He said, if I would come to him, I should want for no encouragement. I went the day after, and he would not be easy without I would bring my wife, and live in the house. He said, I should have any thing necessary belonging to the house; I being a stranger in London, thought it a pretty opportunity. I went to work for him, my wife laid all her things in pawn to find us in victuals, in the mean time. I worked for him six weeks, and never received a farthing from him during the time; I asked him several times for six pence or a shilling; he never would give it me, to get her any thing to nourish her. He went one day to buy some wood to set me to work. There were some deals and seneers. He said, if I would fetch them seneers out of the yard, he would give me a guinea: he said, they would never be missed. He said, I should want for nothing, if I would fetch them. I would not. He said, I should repent it. I did not know how to get my money. He said, he would leave my wife and I in the house while he went into the country. He said, if he could get a place in the country, I might sell the goods, and pay him the money. I bought these things, the bed and bedstead, six chairs and the pictures. I agreed to pay him half a guinea a week. He came one day to me, and asked me if I would have a suit of cloaths. He said, he had a new suit a making; that I might go, and if they would fit me, I should have them, and pay him a shilling a week. I went; the cloaths would not fit me; the cloaths were made and brought home; people were sending their bills, and he was upon the shifting order, to go into the country. I thought it proper to move these things; I thought he was going to leave me.</p>
               <p>Q. To the prosecutor. How much wages did you owe him at this time?</p>

               <p>Williams. No; he called at my house on the twenty-first of December, and left word, he had been almost ruined by one of his men, and desired I would enquire if this man had taken any place to go to Newcastle. Capt. White came, and told me, his hands had been pressed, that prevented his going sooner. I asked, if he had a man and his wife, with some goods; he said, yes, and described them. I sent Mr. Morgan word, that I believed the goods were on board Capt. White's ship, off the Tower, Mr. Morgan said, There are my goods in the hold. I told Capt. White how the affair was; he said he was to have two guineas for his passage. He took us to Darkhouse lane, where the prisoner and his wife were drinking; Mr. Morgan gave charge of him.</p>

The woman said, she had them from one. Mrs. Johnson in Plumbtree-street. I went there, and asked her where she had them. She said, of the woman in the one pair of stairs, whose name was Pierpoint. She was called down. At last she said, she had them of one Mrs. Welch, who lived over the way; with that she offered to go with me.

I said, I should be glad to see what you have got in your pockets. She said, I should not. I put my hand upon the outside of her apron, and there was something hard in her pocket. In struggling, a buckle fell out, after that her pocket came off. I gave Mr. Drybutter an inventory of them.</p>

I do not know the man, said Welch; but as to you, Hamilton, I have obliged you, and you never failed me; I am very scarce of money; what value have you; if I can oblige you and your friend I will; they made the agreement; they desired me to stand up.

I asked her to set down and wait for the gentlemen, which she did; after she had set some time, she said, the gentlemen had disappointed her twice, and she went out. I had some mistrust of her, for I saw her hovering about the window. I was serving a gentleman with some stockings; she came in again and asked the gentlemen were come. I had seen her waiting about the door all the time. She staid some time whilst a many people came into the shop; there were two pair of stockings on the other side of the shop; I missed one and a parcel from the opposite counter. I went up to her; I pushed back her cloak and found the bundle of stockings, which were seven pair; she was then in the middle of the shop; she ran away to the end of the compter, and dropped a pair of mixed thread stockings.</p>

The prisoner came to my house with a billet as a recruiting serjeant; the billet I have found since was not a true one. He desired to lie that night at my house. He staid in his room the next morning till all the family were come down; after he he was gone we missed the things. On the ninth of January a man gave us intelligence that the prisoner was at a house about a mile and a half off; some of us went in pursuit of him, and brought him to my house about eleven; he had his knapsack with him. I desired to look into it; he readily opened it; there was nothing of mine in it; he had a handkerchief in his hand with something tied in it; he did not chuse to open that. I opened it, and we found a linen handkerchief and a child's cap in it. My maid servant said, they belonged to her mistress; there were two men lay in the same room as the prisoner, but they came down stairs as soon as it was light, and went about their business.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Snelson. The prisoner came and lay at our house on the second and third. My mistress came down in the morning a little before ten; the prisoner did not come down till near three quarters of an hour afterwards. I saw him come down and walk hastily through the passage, upon which my mistress and I went to look in the room; we missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I saw the cap and handkerchief taken out of the handkerchief, (the cap and handkerchief produced.) I can swear these are my master's property.</p>

             No, there was a light in the adjoining shop. A man working in that shop heard the glass broke, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Samual Freeman. I am porter at an oil shop in Whitechapel. I was going by the prosecutors house with a load. I saw the prisoners about the window. I stopt at a wine vault about fourteen or sixteen yards distance; I staid there near a quarter of an hour. There were three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they stand?</p>
               <p>Freeman. About three quarters of a yard distance from each other. One was at the door, another at the window, and the third at the dead wall. I saw one of them hawl the things.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160036"/> out, and put them into the waistband of his breeches. He at the wall said, What, have you done it? The other swore a bitter oath, and said, Hold your wiz. There was no creature passed by at the time; at last a man that carries coals came up; I told him them villains had broke the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the window brake?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No; he said he would knock at the door; then I went about my business. When I came back again, they had shut up the window shutters, I said; Now the steed is stole. you shut up the stable door. My mistress asked me, it I could swear to them; I said I could. I saw them the Saturday following; this was Christmas eve. The Monday night I saw them again; the Saturday following I could see them very plain; there was a lamp over their heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Which stood at the window?</p>
               <p>- Gannon. Hopcraft stood at the door, and Muston at the dead wall; I saw them taking something out at the window, but could not distinguish what.</p>
               <p>Q. from Gannon. Did not you say I had a white waistcoat on?</p>
               <p>- He had a white jacket on, with black spots on it, and he had leather breeches.</p>

            . I am a milk-man: I was going by Mrs. Benjamin's house with my milk pail: I saw the ribbons lay drawn out into the road; I walked a little further, and there I saw the three prisoners and another lad; they crossed the road into Great Garden Street, which is about one hundred roads from Mrs. Benjamin's. The ribbons lay from Mrs. Benjamin's that way. Gannon said, D - n my eyes, how the man after me through the mud, and how the ribbons draw'd along; and clapp'd his hand upon his knee. When I came opposite Black Lion yard they stopp'd, and I passed them; they crossed the way towards Whitechapel church; there was a watchmaker at his own door; I told him of the four boys; he ask'd me why I did not take them. When I came down lower there was Muston and Hopcraft following (I supposed). to Gannon and the other. I put my pails down, and took one in each hand; and when I accused them with being concerned in stealing the ribbons, one of them began a crying; I went for a constable; in the mean time Mr. Cresser took Gannon.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I missed a great many things; I have got a part of them; a great many little articles are entirely gone; here are a parcel of ribbons, some needle boxes, and six rows of necklaces (producing them.) These I found in the street; the others are lost entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The constable searched them, but did not find any thing; he did not search their breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ribbon they stole all loose?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; it was upon blocks; they hung upon a string; they pulled one and they all followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any marks upon them?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>

               <p>Hopcraft's Defence. I was coming to work along Whitechapel; the milkman took hold of me by the collar; I was willing to go with them back to the shop; the gentle woman that gave evidence said, this is never a one of the boys.</p>

               <p>Ball. Yes. I told him we had but a few shillings: I gave him a shilling; he held his hat out, and I put it in his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any pistol?</p>
               <p>Ball. I saw none; nor no stick nor whip.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he the shilling ever in his hand?</p>
               <p>Ball. He took it out of his hat with his own hand, and put it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he at the coach door committing this robbery?</p>
               <p>Ball. He was hovering about five or six minutes, he was close to the coach four or five minutes; the man was very much in liquor I believe, or he would never have stay'd so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he returned the shilling?</p>
               <p>Ball. He swore; then the coachman got off the box, collared him, and took him off his horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you recollect when he first came up, whether he said any thing of asking for your money?</p>
               <p>Ball. He said, gentlemen, I demand your money.</p>

               <p>Witness. I was driving this coach home from Acton. Last Sunday night the coach was stopped by the prisoner, he rode up to the door and opened it himself; he bid me stop three times; he opened the door on horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Witness. He demanded their money; Mr. Ball gave him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>Witness. He went backwards and forwards two or three times; I believe he was so intoxicated, that he did not know what he was about; after the coach was open, he asked me to get off the box to open the door after he had opened it, and after he had taken the shilling and returned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was so drunk that he did not know what he did?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, I do, if he had not he would not have desired me to get off of the box; I unhorsed him, and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared quite drunk?</p>

            . I have known him two years. He lived first of all with a brother of mine. He went abroad with him, and staid abroad, I believe, better than a twelvemonth. He came home, very strongly recommended for his care and industry: (in consideration of that I took him into my service) he recommended him to his agent in London, telling him he intended to take him when he returned to England, and if he got a place for him, to give up that place before he returned to England. He commissioned him to let him have money. I took him into my service when I came to England; I think in the month of June last. My brother was at the West Indies. He lived about four months in my service; in which time he was, seemingly, often in liquor, and that was the occasion of my parting with him; otherwise, independent of that, I had no fault to find with him. He had things of great value in his care, but never wronged me. We parted upon good terms in every respect but that.</p>

            . I keep the Indian Queen at Acton. The prisoner came to my house on the 13th of January, about two o'clock, in company with Mrs. Fisher, gardiner; a lady that lives at Acton. He had been to see Mr. Pickering, a servant of Mrs. Fisher's. He being out, he came to my house. He had said that he intended to dine with him. He stayed at my house till near seven o'clock. He dined there, and drank two or three pots of beer, and then had some punch. He was very much intoxicated in liquor. He rid his horse through my passage, about forty feet long; and there is part of the stairs down. He rid quite through there into the tap-room. The stair-case drops down. There is stairs drop down about ten feet high. He rid quite under these stairs, (they drop down) and so up another stairs into the tap-room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Patterson. I have the care of the snuffers and the snuffers-pan. I missed them the same evening, a little after three, when I went to shut the windows up. I cleaned them in the morning along with the rest of the plate. The drawer was open, and the window was shoved up; that was the butler's pantry. The constable came next day, and asked me if we had lost any plate the day before? He came about ten o'clock. I replied, We had left a silver snuffer-stand, and a pair of steel snuffers, and that was all. He replied,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160039"/> Here is one of the thieves that stole them. He had Wilson along with him. I went and acquainted my master. The constable brought him in to my master. Wilson had given evidence against them, I apprehend, before he came to our house. He said they were both concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen these things since?</p>
               <p>Hays. Yes. Cooper, the constable, brought them before the sitting alderman. I can sware these are my master's property.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 14th of December, I was going to Mr. Sheriff Baker's. The coachman came out. There was Wilson, Mackaway, and Welch, going a little way before me, about a dozen yards. The coachman said to me, There are three bad lads you ought to take. The coachman said they had got some plate; they have robbed somebody. The coachman's name is

            . They went as far as London-wall. Then they turned round by the new church. I saw no more of them till they came to Houndsditch. Then Welch went on the left side, Mackaway and Wilson on the right; Welch seeing us, began to run; accordingly I pursued him; he turned up Constable-street; I hollowed out, Stop him, Stop him. There was a chimney-sweeper coming along; he got hold of him. Welch had this piece of plate in his hand, behind him: he dropped it when the chimney-sweeper took hold of him. I came up to him and secured him. The chimney-sweeper picked the plate up. I took Welch to the Poultry-Compter. We asked him where the other lads were to be found that were with him. He said he had nothing to say till he was sworn and admitted an evidence. The Alderman bid him shew where he had stole the plate. He went and shewed us Mr. Patterson's house. Mr. Patterson asked him after the steel snuffers; he said he had thrown them upon Bethlam-wall. We went and found them where he described.</p>
               <p>Q. From Muckaway. Where did you see me?</p>
               <p>Cooper. At London Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take me?</p>
               <p>Cooper. I thought it proper to take the man that had the plate upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know he had the plate about him?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Mr. Sheriff Baker's coachman told me one of them had given it Welch; and I saw him shuffle something into his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. From Welch. Where did you see me shuffle in my bosom?</p>
               <p>Cooper. Just before Mr. Sheriff Baker's back gate.</p>
               <p>John Torbutt, who is a chimney sweeper, deposed that he took Welch in the manner above described.</p>

               <p>- Muckaway. I was along with Welch and Wilson; I went up to King's Arms yard to ease myself; they walked up the yard to wait for my coming along by London Wall; Wilson pulled out the plate, and said, he gave it to Welch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gordon. On the twenty-ninth of December I was handing some ladies out of the Opera house into a coach. I clapped my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket book. It was in my right-hand coat pocket; there was a twenty pound bank note in it which had been in it about a week. I had seen it in my pocket book, I believe, that very morning. I did not know when it was taken. A little boy, David Roades, came to me three or four days ago with a bill of exchange that was in the pocket book. I stoped the boy, and by that means came at a knowledge of the prisoners. We got a search warrant, and at Hawkes's house we found my pocket book, (produced and deposed to.) The bill of exchange had been paid two month before. I have never seen the bank note since.</p>

            , my brother, with this bill of exchange to Mr. Gordon's. I had it from Hawke the third or fourth of this month. Field was present and said, I night pass it very well, for he had passed a twenty pound note three or four days before. They both came together twice to see if I had got it off; I was confined in Tothil-fields for an assault, and there I became acquainted with them. They asked me for the note again, and Hawke said, he would get it off himself. I gave it him, but he gave it me back again, and said, If you can make any thing of it do, if not, you had better burn it, or we shall be transported. They came to me last Monday at my father's, in Union-street, Oxford Road; they wanted the note. I would not give it them. I intended to send it to Mr. Gordon to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you advised with your father or any body about it?</p>
               <p>Roades. No, my father did not know any thing of it.</p>

            . I am a mason. I have employed Roades's father two or three years, and three of his sons. When Roades was in prison about this note, the father went in search of the two prisoners from his son's information: they desired me to be present at the searching Hawke's lodgings: in the bottom of a drawer we found this pocket book; it was shewn to the prisoners. Hawke said, it belonged to Field: Field said, he lodged at Hawke's and left it there. Hawke and his wife had made use of it, for there were some pawn-broker tickets in it. which Hawke's wife acknowledged belonged to them.</p>

We were several times after him about the money.</p>
