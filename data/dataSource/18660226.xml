I am clerk to Dean and Co., tea-dealers, of 71, Ludgate-hill—the prisoner was their town-traveller—he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week commission—his duties were to take out and deliver goods, to receive the money, and pay it to me the next morning—he has received the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for nearly three years—he has never paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Caratti, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Pyle.</p>

               <p>horse, and giving him water—a boy was not supplied to the cart before the death of Mr. Murray—the prisoner did not complain of property being lost out of the carts, but he would be responsible for it—the customers were all ours and not his; but, by giving him a commission, we made him responsible for them—there is a certain rate on each article—his commission on tea was 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the first twelve months he went out—it was not the same the next year, because he was much more careless, and the trade slackened wonder<lb/>fully—we allowed him to draw 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—there is no commission on sugar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that for 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year he was to be responsible for all the bad debts of the firm's customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, through whom he derived the commission—His returns were about 4,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his commission was about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that is 1½ to 1¾ per cent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he had a burglary and lost 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he told me so—he also told me since his apprehension that he was robbed while riding on an omnibus—I believe that the prisoner, long before these proceedings were taken, instead of concealing the facts, told the prosecutors, and offered to give his brother's bill for the amount, but it was refused—Mr. Dean refused to compound a felony, but the prisoner only mentioned it—his brother had gone to America—the prisoner was discharged, and the prosecutor did not think of giving him in custody then, because his partner was dying, and did die before he could consult with him—during that time, I believe the prisoner was at home with his wife and family—he called three or four times during ten days.</p>

               <p>examined this lock and key—my opinion is that this skeleton would open the lock, when on Mrs. Barrington's door—it was formerly a Bramah key, but has been made into a skeleton—formerly this was a Bramah lock—it is nothing but a sham Bramah now, which this skeleton would have opened with the nib off—there is a little nib on a Bramah key, which is taken off this.</p>

There is not a particle of direct evidence against me; I was not seen in or near the place; no money was found on me; I was taken two days after the robbery, and had nothing to do with it; I gave my right name and address; my name is on the door; the police have been to different houses of the nobility and aristocracy where I work, trying to find out if anything has been lost, but they found nothing; Pettice's dying words were, "I will tell you that a man named Squires, a painter," who is now in prison, "has done it;" my name is not Squires, but Swyer, and from the similarity of name I have been brought here. If you believe the inspector, yon cannot believe Cartridge, and if you believe Cartridge, you cannot believe the inspector. The police have got on the wrong track; but rather than own themselves wrong, they say somebody must suffer; they know the man who did it, but cannot swear to him now, because they have sworn to me; I gave him a description of the two men that came to Kirby's house, but he does not want to apprehend them, because if he does I shall get out of it.

                  </hi>. I was twenty-two years in business in Mortimer-street, and have now retired on my means—six years ago I purchased the leasehold interest in five houses in Bolsover-street, and, about a year and a quarter ago, I purchased the house in question, 63, Bolsover-street—I let the houses out in apartments, and placed a deputy in the parlours of each to let it out for me—in No. 63 I entrusted that duty to a man named Simmonds and his wife from the end of September—the prisoner became the tenant of the front room, second floor in July, 1865; under my previous deputy, Mrs. Walter—he remained there till 23d January—I gave his wife notice to quit on 4th September, but they did not do so—I summoned him before a Magistrate for running after me furiously out of his room, and saying, "Now I have got you I will do for you"—he ran after me to the third floor—the Magistrate bound him over to keep the peace towards me—on 17th January I went there and saw a board five or six feet long and a frame at the end of it about eight inches deep and two or three feet long, out at the second floor front room window, on which was a paper with the words, "Bawdy House" written very conspicuously in the form of printing letters—this is the frame (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got a broker to go and look at it—there were people in groups in the street looking at it, and there was great excitement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 1st January, this year—Mrs. Simmonds, my deputy, came to me at the end of September, with her husband, apparently, and said that they wanted to take the apartments, and that she was a dressmaker and her husband a carpenter—they went to the house together, I believe, but I cannot be sure of anything I have not seen—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—on the day after Christmas day I let John Simmonds, the apparent husband, the room I had let to the prisoner, but Simmonds had been in the house from September—I firmly believed she was the wife of Mr. Simmonds—she was my deputy at the time this happened, and had had the letting of the various rooms from September to January—I did not try to find out for my solicitor where she had gone to—I never saw her since I found she had deceived me, which was at the police-court, when she swore she was not married to Simmonds, having told me the day previous that she would take her oath that there was no truth in the report that she was not married—she was my witness at the police-court—she said there that she had let men into the house to prostitutes; but the very day before she had told me she would take her oath that not a gentleman had been in the house since she had been there—I sent them all off because my confidence was gone, and I should have sent her off before if I had known it—I had a complaint about No. 63 in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260017"/>
               <p>October—Mr. Atchison wrote to me to say that Mrs. Walter, my deputy, was an improper character, and next morning I called on him, and told him that Mrs. Walter had been gone out of the house for two or three weeks—he said, "If she is gone, I have nothing more to say"—I gave him the numbers of my other houses, and said that if he knew anything wrong of them I should be obliged to him to let me know—I have not found out to this day that Mrs. Walter was an improper character—Mr. Atchison is a solicitor, of, I believe, No. 78, Bolsover-street—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his second letter—Mrs. Walter was withdrawn before the first letter was written—Nose. 62 and 63 are my houses—I never had anything to do with No. 65—(<hi rend="italic">A letter from the Vestry of All Souls' Parish was here produced</hi>)—I do not know whether "the abandoned woman" spoken of here is Mrs. Walter—Mrs. Simmonds said she would take her oath that Mrs. Walter had not been there, but that her daughter had come for letters—if I may believe Mrs. Simmonds, prostitutes were living in the house and receiving men up to the time the board was put up—but I cleared out every woman, guilty or not guilty—this letter is dated 29th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us go on: "As these women very frequently return home in open day, followed by paramours, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., I am directed to require that the house be cleared forthwith, and to intimate that any similar complaint will be submitted to the solicitor of the Duke of Portland." Is the Duke of Portland the ground landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mrs. Simmonds was my deputy at that time—I cleared out all the women, and cleared out Mrs. Simmonds as soon as I could—she remained up to the time the board was exhibited—I will explain that; on 1st January I went there to serve the notice to quit, I opened Moran's door, and he rushed after me, and kept me nearly two hours like a prisoner in the house—the law does not allow you to take these women and turn them out—the wife of a police-constable did not complain that there were prostitutes in the house, but when I gave Mrs. Robinson, at No 58, notice, she said that Mrs. Powell, my deputy there, ought to be turned out; but I had known Mr. Powell as a respectable man holding a responsible situation for twelve years—Mrs. Robinson is a police<lb/>man's wife—she is quiet enough—they lived in the front kitchen at 58—she never said that prostitutes had been living in that house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read your statement at the police-court: "His wife made a complaint about the prostitutes living in the house." Is that true, or is it not, did she complain about prostitutes lodging in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, but in her fury, she is such a virago that she really said to me that I was an improper character—I told Mr. Robinson that I would have him for a tenant for years, but as to his wife, it was impossible—I have no distinct recollection of her complaining that there were prostitutes in the house—I never advised my deputies in different houses that no policeman should be taken in to lodge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have again your statement at the police-court, "I have advised that no policeman should be taken into the house." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was about Mrs. Powell, that was confined to No. 58—amongst other ladies to whom these rooms were let, there were some French artificial flower makers—Mrs. Simmonds let the rooms to them—I did not go after the references—either I or my wife collected the rents—persons are sometimes out and leave the rent with the deputy—I waited on these French ladies at 63 and collected their rent, one had the second floor, and the other the Second floor back—they dressed very plain and simple, as you see them dressed in the streets of Paris—they were mother and daughter, and one of them could not speak</p>

I live at 88, Newman-street, and am a commercial man—on 17th January, about half-past 8 or a quarter to 9, I was in Bolsover-street, and saw a frame projecting from the second<lb/>floor window of No. 63, with the words "Bawdy House" on it, large enough for me to read it in the street, but I cannot swear that the words were on each side—I saw the defendant at the window where the placard was put out—there was no obstruction to the traffic at that hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury. Counts two and three charged that the words "Bawdy House" were published of and concerning the occupiers of the house in Bolsover-street, without mentioning the names of those persons, and were therefore bad. Count four, which charged a nuisance by causing persons to assemble in the street and obstruct passengers, was not supported by any evidence. As to the first count, the words did not impute, as the inuendo alleged, that the house was a bawdy house to the knowledge of Mr. Williams, and although it might be a libel on the house, it did not amount to a criminal offence, unless it was also a libel on an individual</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">admitted that the fourth Count failed for want of evidence. He contended that the second and third Counts were good in point of form, if the Jury believed that the libel was directed against the persons inhabiting the house. But the real issue was, no doubt, raised on the first Count; and there was abundant evidence that the defendant, out of spite, and in consequence of being summoned by Mr. Williams for a breach of the peace, intended by the words to impute the charge set forth in the inuendo/—namely, that it was a bawdy house with the consent, and by the procurement of that gentleman</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, cited the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Barrett</hi> (32 <hi rend="italic">"Law Journal," Magistrates' Cases, p</hi>. 36), <hi rend="italic">where it was held that if the landlord of a weekly tenant, using the house as a brothel, received no additional rent, he could not be convicted of keeping a brothel after notice of the immoral occupation, simply because he did not give the tenant notice to quit. The learned Counsel also quoted the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Stannard</hi> (33 "<hi rend="italic">Law Journal</hi>," <hi rend="italic">Magistrates' Cases, p</hi>. 61), <hi rend="italic">where it was held that a landlord, letting the rooms of a house weekly to young women who, to his knowledge, used them for purposes of prostitution, could not be convicted of keeping a disorderly house, if he only went to his house to collect his rents, received no share of the girls' earnings, and had no other control over them than the right to end their tenancies. It was, therefore, clear, from these cases, that the libel could not affect Mr. Williams, who did not live in the house, and who was in much the same position as the defendant Stannard</hi>.</p>

I am the wife of James Hodgson, a bootmaker, of Swan-place, Blackman-street, Borough—on Tuesday night, I was with an old lady of seventy-three and another friend, coming over London<lb/>bridge, and saw the prisoner and two others following me from the other side of the water—the prisoner came in front of me by the Queen's insurance office, Gracechurch-street, and clapped his hands, but finding his companions were not behind us, he left and joined them at Talbot-court—I distinctly heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner put up his hand and knock the prosecutor into the middle of the road, where he remained all the way up Gracechurch-street—he did not quite knock him down, but he reeled into the middle of the road—Morris said, "I charge these men with assaulting me"—each of the others said, "No, sir, not me, sir, for I have just come over the water," which I know they had—the others escaped, and I saw the prisoner taken—I had scarcely lost sight of him, as there was scarcely another man in the street—I did not go to the station, as I had to catch the last train to Blackwall; but I saw the case in the paper on Monday, and thought it my duty to come forward—when I saw the prosecutor struck, it was after what I saw at the end of Talbot-court—I heard the cry of "Police," and we turned and met the three men together, coming from Talbot-court—there was only us in the street at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer of 11, Howard-place, Kennington<lb/>park-road—on 17th July, I met the defendant—I knew that he was an attorney—I had had one transaction with him before—he was the attorney in a bill transaction—he asked me bow I was getting on—I said, "Pretty well, but I am short of money"—he said, "If you want money, I can find you a little"—I said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be of service—he said, "If you will have a bill drawn and accepted, I will get you some money"—a bill was obtained by him—he drew it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I accepted it—he took it, and said he should be able to let me have the money in two hours, if I would call at his office, as he had a friend who had some money, and he could get any little amount of that kind—no consideration for his trouble was arranged at that time; but when I saw him at his office he said, "You must pay me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I called again the next day to know if he had cashed the bill—he said the bill had not been cashed—I called for three weeks, and sometimes three times a day, but could get no tidings of the bill being cashed, or get the money—he said, "I have not got the money for you yet, Mr. Batty; if you look in again, I may have it"—he did not tell me he had parted with the bill—Mr. Bailey afterwards called and pre<lb/>sented the bill to my wife, and in consequence of what she said, I called on Mr. Bailey on Monday morning at 8 o'clock, and acknowledged my signature—that was the first I knew of his having the bill—I arranged with him to meet me at Mr. Weekes' office to give up the bill, or pay the money—we met there, and Mr. Weekes had each of us in separate rooms, and discussed the matter separately—I went in first—he said, "I will see what can be done in the matter"—after that, he called in Mr. Bailey; but I left the room first, and he saw Mr. Bailey in the same room—I heard them quarrelling, and rushed in and found them fighting—I did not succeed in getting the bill or the money—Mr. Bailey is sueing me on it now—when I gave it to Weekes, he said, "If I cannot cash it, I will return it."</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260024"/>
               <p>but he had received no money by the first post, and sent it back to me by my clerk—that is the only transaction that I had with Mr. Weekes—what<lb/>ever my clerk did with him, is unknown to me—it has come to my know<lb/>ledge that my clerk has had dealings with Weekes as for me—I have pro<lb/>perty at Norwood—Mr. Weekes is not negotiating to raise money on it for me—I have not given him a list of the property—I gave him a rough draft to take a copy from for a Mr. Lanbam—that was for a loan which I was negotiating in a friendly manner with a gentleman in the city—he made a fresh copy, because I wanted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you give it to an attorney to copy, when you had a clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He offered to make it—when I called on him, I said, "I want a copy of that Mr. Weekes, can you oblige me?"—that was in July or August—it was about a week or a few days before that matter occurred, that I asked him to make the copy—I mean to say I did not tell him anything about a loan when I went to him—I only said, "I want a copy of this"—he re<lb/>turned the original—I could not get my clerk to do it; I have no clerk—he did not ask me the name of the gentleman who was going to advance the money—I did not pay him for that; he has never made any charge—whenever he pleases, I shall be willing to pay—I have never done other business with him, only in connexion with my clerk—I have speculated very little; my company in the Strand is wound up—I wanted money to carry on my business—I have gone there on Saturday and said, "I must have money at any cost to pay my men to<lb/>night," but that is since this bill—I cannot say what agreement there was at the moment, but within half an hour, there was an agreement for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to get it discounted—nothing was said about his having anything beyond the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or rendering himself liable—I did not ask him to do it—he asked me—I called at his office from that day up to Saturday, 5th July—he told me there was a gentleman coming that day for the bill—I do not know that Mr. Bailey went on the Saturday—I waited there an hour and a half or two hours for the cash, as Weekes said if I waited, the cash would be brought back in an hour—I do not know that Bailey called there that day—a gentleman called on me that Saturday night, who left the name of Bailey, and no doubt it was Mr. Bailey, the now holder of the bill—I was not at home—my wife told me what she stated to Mr. Bailey—she did not recognise my signature on it, but said that she believed it was it—I called on Mr. Bailey at 8 o'clock on Monday, and assured him that it was my signature—he said that knowing it was my signature, he did not return on Saturday with the cash—I ac<lb/>knowledged it as my signature—it was after that, that I heard the scuffling—Bailey is not a strong man; he is a small man—they were fighting about some documents, and some business between them I believe—Weekes said he would send for a policeman, and that he must have the bill back again—I heard nothing of the bill till Bailey sued me on it—my solicitor is Mr. Casen, of Bloomsbury<lb/>square—I believe, from what Bailey has said, he has never given a farthing for this bill.</p>

I would have taken it, but not the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused to have anything to do with it, and put it in the hands of my solicitor at once—the prisoner was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for getting it discounted, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Bailey—I arranged to give him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a photographer, of 38, Camberwell-road Walworth—I hold the bill of exchange for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has been produced—Mr. Weekes gave it to me; he owed me about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had called on him several times previously, and on the last occasion, he said that he had not got the money, but he had a bill if I liked to cash that, and give him the balance, I could have my money; that he got it for money due to him from a Mr. Batty, a gentleman living at 196, Marlborough-road, an engineer, I believe, and who he said was as good as gold—he said nothing about his having it from Mr. Batty to get it discounted, nor did he say anything about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that I was to cash it, and stop my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and give him the rest—this was Saturday, 5th August—I went to Mr. Batty the same day, and saw his wife—he came to me on Monday morning, and we went to Mr. Weekes—we went in together, but were in separate offices—I saw Weekes first; he said that he wanted his bill—I said I would not give it to him until he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he locked the door and said I should not go out until I gave it him—he sent for a constable, but I never saw one—I could have paid the bill, but I thought I had lent enough, and after it became due, I served Mr. Batty with a writ on 11th January, this year—the action is standing for trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who is your attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Chipperfield—he showed me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before the bill became due—I believe it was the same week that I received the bill—I did not read the whole con<lb/>tents of it—it is a bill at two months—when it became due, I got a writ out against Mr. Batty—I could not see him before January—I got the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for nothing, but I could not get anything for it—on the Saturday when I was there, I did not see Mr. Batty—I never saw him in my life until the Monday—I cannot say whether there was somebody there who I could not see—I do not know where Mr. Weekes went to from his office; whether he went to communicate with any body—I went there for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due to me, lent to Mr. Weekes—these are the IOU's—I had not IOU's for the whole amount, only for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an under lease which he drew up just before 25th March—he gave me no acknowledgment for that—I have been dealing with him over twelve months—he managed two actions for me, one of which I recovered—that came off last March—he did not send me in a bill of costs; I paid him as I went on—the last sum I paid him was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot tell you when it was, because I cannot keep it in my head—I gave him a cheque for it—it was in the latter end of last year—it was about March when the action came off—I was there on 5th August—I had been there on the previous Monday, and he told me he would call on Saturday, and he should be able to pay me—he was doing business for me then—I positively swear he said I was to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that bill—I did not take his 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I was authorized by Mr. Batty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260026"/>
               <p>not to do so—supposing the bill had been genuine, I ought to have paid him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but it was not genuine—I called at Batty's house on Saturday night, and he called on me on Monday—he told me not to hand the money to Mr. Weekes—if he had not told me that, I should have handed him over the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known it was genuine, but it was far from genuine—it was not in consequence of what Batty said that I did not pay Weekes the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for I should not like to give Mr. Weekes any 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my money, and I would not do it—Batty said that I was to hand it to Mr. Weekes—I do not recollect that Batty asked me to give the bill up to him—I believe there was some document or authority from Weekes to that effect, but I did not do so, because I was advised not by my solicitor—I did not give him the I O U's—I have got them and the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. still, and now I am sueing him—he managed the action of Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Atherton for me, but not Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Benton, or Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Herries—I have had dealings with him, but never sued him on an agreement—I am not a money<lb/>lender; I have got no money to lend—I forget whether there was an agreement with Mr. Hunt in reference to some furniture in Clare<lb/>market—I will not swear that he did not sue for me on that in the name of Hunt—I cannot recollect the name—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for writing one letter in Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Winchamber, and in Bailey <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Roberts he was paid—he could not send me in a bill of costs, because it was paid at the time—this was all done at a public-house—he never threatened to give me in custody for felony—he gave me some papers from his office—I did not take any papers while he was absent from his office—he gave them to me—I went to a public-house, and he followed me—I do not know whether he sent for a policeman—I did not go away—I stopped there an hour and a half—I never heard that he charged me with stealing the papers—they did not drop out of my coat—they were given to me to draw documents up, and I took proceedings in an action—I heard him say that he had sent for a policeman—I did not <hi rend="italic">mizzle</hi> the moment I heard that—I staid two hours after that, if not more—I took no notice of what he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known Mr. Weekes for some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I wish I had not—having seen so much of him, I would not have trusted any name except Mr. Batty's—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. expressly to get a bill stamped, and I lost the action through it, as the deed was never stamped—the Judge showed it to me in the County Court—Weekes did not offer to pay me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to release the bill—he put me off from time to time, and said he would get it for me—he said nothing to me about not coming as a witness—I have never seen or heard of him in this case—he drew up a document, which he wanted me to sign, not to take proceedings about the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to Batty's on the Saturday, did you go straight from the prisoner's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether he knew where I was going—I rather think he thought I was going to the bank, to cash it at once—I told him I should make inquiries, and see whether Batty's signature was all right—he said, "It is as good as gold—you have no reason to trouble yourself"—I said, "I shall see whether it is good."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case for the Jury to consider. It was proved that this was a bill drawn by the defendant for the accommodation of the prosecutor, and that no debt of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was due by Batty to Weekes. In Byles on Bills</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic">th edition, page</hi> 100, <hi rend="italic">the relation of accommodation-drawer, and acceptor was defined, and it was clear that they were joint owners, under<lb/>taking</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260027"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">mutually to meet the bill, when due, in the proportion in which they received funds from it, when discounted. He contended, therefore, first, that a joint owner could not be a bailee. He could not make a contract of bailment with his co-owner, and whatever agreement they made, must be in the nature of a trust. This accounted for the sections in the Larceny Act, applicable to fraudulent trustees, because, if fraudulent trustees could be treated as bailees, those sections would be perfectly unnecessary. He also contended, secondly, that even assuming that a joint owner could be a bailee, the contract of bailment here had not been broken. A joint owner of goods could not maintain trover against his co-owner in respect of any act of the latter consistent with his ownership</hi> (2 Williams and Saunderson, O. 47), <hi rend="italic">and everything which the defendant had done in this case was consistent with his position as drawer of an accom<lb/>modation bill</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, dwelt on the fact that, if there were any con<lb/>tract of bailment at all, it was to turn the bill into money, in order to produce to Batty</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">There was nothing in that to prevent Weekes getting</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">from Bailey, and supplying the</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">out of his own pocket, to make up the full amount. The negotiation between Weekes and Bailey did not result in the bill being discounted. The prosecutor interposed, and forbad Bailey to carry out the arrangement with Weekes. There was never any conversion which would support an action of trover, and, in the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Jackson</hi> (9 Cox's Criminal Cases, p. 505), <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON MARTIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">ruled that the conversion must be analogous to larceny, and that there were many instances of conversion sufficient to maintain an action of trover, which were not sufficient to support a conviction under the statute</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for the prosecution, argued that there was abundant evidence for the Jury. The bailment was to return the bill to Batty, or</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s in cash. The defendant gave it to a creditor, who was pressing him, in payment of a debt, and put it out of his own power to fulfil the contract. There was, therefore, as much a conversion, when Weekes put the bill into the hands of Bailey, as if he had discounted it for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and put the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in his pocket</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">held that a joint owner might be a bailee, and that the defendant had parted with the bill under circumstances which were not in conformity with the arrangement made with the prosecutor. So far the defendant was wrong; but Bailey was bailee for both Batty and Weekes and if Weekes intended to appropriate the</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">there was no act shewing that intention. The bill was never discounted, and nothing was advanced upon it. Bailey held it wrongfully, and it might be recovered from him by the person who had the right to the pos<lb/>session of it. There was no conversion by the defendant analogous so larceny, and therefore no case for the Jury to consider</hi>.</p>

I was fetched to the King's Head, Little White Lion-street by Inspector Brannan, about midnight on 22d January—that house is kept by Hall—Hall and the other prisoners were in the tap-room—which is separated from the bar by a partition, and there appeared to be a small piece of glass in the wainscot, so that anyone in the bar could see into the tap-room—I said, "Mr. Hall, my name is Brannan, I received information that you were an extensive dealer in counterfeit coin, I also received instruc<lb/>tions from the solicitor to the Mint, to look after you."—I looked at the table where the coin was, and said, "This is pretty good proof that my informa<lb/>tion is correct"—the coin on the table consisted of 5 crowns, 42 half-crowns, 91 florins, 175 shillings, and six I received from my son which it was stated Winter had—on the first occasion I stated that there were 22 half-crowns, that was a mistake—Hall said, "I can say nothing to it," and he repeated that to almost every word I said—I told him we came there with a search warrant, but at that time it was not made out in his name, but that of his predecessor—this came upon me unexpectedly, and I had not time to get it altered—I next spoke to Cummings, I said, "<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, well here we meet again"—he said, "Mr. Brannan, you never had me in custody for uttering a counterfeit farthing"—I said, "I am not aware that there has been such</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Artillery, stationed at Aldershot—about half-past 9 on the night of 13th February, I was going down to the boat at Billingsgate—Simpson came behind me, took me by the shoulders, and asked me if I was going by the boat—I said, I was going that way—he said, "I think you are a countryman of mine"—I said, "perhaps I am"—he asked me if I belonged to Edinburgh—I said, "No"—he said you belong to Dalkeith—I told him I had been there—he asked</p>

               <p>me if I had been to Glasgow before by this route—I said I had not—he gave me information as to which of the boats would be the best—after that he asked several questions, and through his kindness I asked him into a public-house, and called for some spirits for him—while we were there, he said, "Stop a little, there is a friend of mine passing that I want to see"—he went out, and brought in Kelly, and introduced him as a friend who had been an old soldier, who knew the service well—after that we proceeded to a coffee-house, where I left my baggage—it was early in the evening and we went to a place called the Mahogany Bar—when there, I called for a pint of stout, and was about to get change for a sovereign, when Simpson said, "Do not expose your money, there are plenty of people here who will pick you up"—I paid for the stout, and then went into the hall—we stayed there a short time—I made an excuse that I wanted to go outside for a necessary purpose—the prisoners followed, and I went to the bar and called for two glasses of rum for them—I laid a sovereign upon the counter, Simpson took it up, and said, "Have you got no change? do not change that"—I said, "You know I have got no change I want change"—he said to Kelly, "you pay for that, you have got small change"—Kelly put his hands in his pockets, and returned me this Hanoverian medal, saying that he had no change—I de<lb/>tected it at once, and said, "That is not the sovereign I laid upon the counter, I want my own sovereign"—he said, "Whisht, Whisht, it is all right"—I caught hold of him by the coat, two Coldstream Guards came to my assistance, and then Kelly gave me back my sovereign—when I put the sovereign down, Simpson took it up, and handed it to Kelly—I am not quite certain whether Kelly put it in his pocket—he felt in his pocket, and returned me the medal—I remonstrated with him, and told him it was not my sovereign—they were taken to the station, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Simpson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College-hospital, and was so on the morning 21st January—I examined Fitzgerald when he was brought in—his left arm was very much swollen about the elbow—he was evidently suffering a great deal of pain, and there was a mark and a bruise on the near side of the elbow—I suspected the artery was ruptured—I sent for Mr. Moore, the assistant-surgeon, who secured the artery, which was found broken slighty above the elbow—the rupture corresponded with the bruise—everything was done to make him comfortable—I saw him again at 4 o'clock in the morning, and again at half past 11—he died about 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning—mortification of the arm set in on the Monday—he became delirious, and I was obliged to take him down to the refractory ward—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—both bones of the arm were dislocated at the elbow, backwards and outwards, and the main artery was ruptured clean across, the veins and muscles were torn, and the nerves were stretched, but were not torn—the ligaments were all torn—the inner ligament inside the elbow was whole, but all the rest were torn—I thought it was done by a violent twist, the force being given in a direction back<lb/>wards and outwards—it was a most curious injury, but that would account for it, and I think that would account for the bruises from the rupture of any superficial vessel—the cause of death was the injury he received to the arm; but the reason he died then was failure of the heart's action—I think he had the commencement of fatty degeneration of the heart—I suppose that the failure of the heart's action to be brought about by the injury—he had an enlarged liver—the bruises inside the elbow might be caused by a kick.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am senior assistant-physician to King's College-hospital, and pathological lecturer—I made the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—his arm was dislocated, and the main artery torn, but no bone was broken—he died from tormatic delirium and failure of the action of the heart, which was dependent upon the injuries he received.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you call those injuries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The elbow was dis<lb/>located, and all the ligaments and muscles, except one, were torn completely across, but the skin was uninjured—it must have been a twist outwards and backwards at the same time—I do not think any kick could have done it, and I am doubtful if a fall could have done it—if the arm was being twisted outward at the same time that the weight of his body in falling came on the upper arm, it is just possible that it might be done in that way.</p>

If I have done you any harm, let me know of it, and I will apologize; you are taking my life by inches, if it is my blood you are thirsting for, take it at once, and give the ship up to the officers"—they said, "We will give the ship to you, if you will destroy the official log-book"—I said, "The laws of my country will punish me for a misdemeanour, but I will give it to you, and you can lock it up, you can send it to the Board of Trade after we get to London, I shall say nothing about it"—they said, "No, if you destroy the official log-book, we will give up the ship; and you must sign a document that you will net speak of this affair when you get to England"—I said, "I will speak to nobody but my owner, I must tell him what has happened, but if you will behave yourselves, I will do all I can to get you forgiveness, and my word will go a long way towards getting you forgiveness"—they still wished me to destroy the log-book—I looked at it, and found so many pages on the right side, and so many on the left, and said, "If I cut these away, will you do it?"—, they said, "If you tear up the pieces"—I said, "Will you be satisfied?"—they said, "Yes"—I tore it up, and offered them the pieces—they said, "No, we will not touch it, give it to that boy"—I did so, and told him to put it out at the stern window, which was done—this is the official log (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the leaves torn out contained entries of these matters—I ob<lb/>tained possession of the ship again on the 20th, and put her on her home<lb/>ward course, but things did not go on smoothly, they would not set sail for the officers—I gave orders to the officers, and the sails were not set—these men, when off the Cape of Good Hope, looked down at me and said, "There the old b——r lies"—I said, "Cannot you put those fellows away, they are looking at me as if I was an alligator"—it blew a gale there—I was en crutches, and the gale came on so quick that I could not get the sail off,</p>

               <p>without losing the masts—I could not go along the deck, but I stood and could see these men go to the forecastle door—all hands did not come up—the port watch did not come up—Carr, Pillage, and Matthews were some of them who did not come up at all—we had to run before the wind for the safety of the ship, or the masts would have gone over—we then went on to. Ascension, and I there made a report to the Commodore—I tried the men again—I mustered them all on the poop, and the mutinous disposition was still in them—they were sent home as prisoners on board a man of war, and I went into the hospital, and after recovering my health came home by a steamer—the value of the ship and cargo was from 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she has got home, but I don't think 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will put the ship right.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ship at Calcutta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not know Matthews before—I know that he is a Spaniard—he joined at Calcutta—on one occasion the captain asked me if I could use a pistol—I said, "Yes, but I do not know whether I am justified"—I did not remon<lb/>strate with him about putting Smith in irons—I made no observation—I cannot tell you hether the <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi> had spoken with the other ship before that threat—I came on deck at 8, and they had sighted the ship before that, but her name was not given then—the signal, "How is the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>?" was telegraphed from the other ship, but I could not read it—it is usual when a signal is sent, to put up a flag to let them know that you have seen it—I did not know what the messages were, except what I heard from the captain—I do not know whether the captain was intoxicated when he broke his leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw the captain drunk, was that when the pilot was in charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have only seen him drunk once—the threat about the musket, off the Cape, was not when the port-watch refused to shorten sail—it was when they would not set the mizen top, and Carr re<lb/>fused to attend to his duty—the captain then said, "If I had a musket up here I would shoot you"—that was after he broke his leg—he was lying on the poop when he used the strong language to me—the threat about the pistol was on the 13th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not quite understand, was it the rain-water they com<lb/>plained of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rain-water caught from the poop in two casks—that was not the water the captain and I drank, we drank the river water—when that complaint was made a change was made in the afternoon, and then that complaint was gone—they made that complaint on 4th August—though their complaint was set right, they still refused to work the ship—they would not give any reason for that—they wanted to go to Madras, because they were afraid of the captain's conduct, and irritable language—he had threatened what he would do when he got on his legs, "on his pins" was the expression he made use of—he said, "You will see when I get on my legs what I will do"—that frightened them so that they wanted to get into a safe port—I know no other cause of complaint up to 13th November,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260049"/>
               <p>but the rain-water and the captain's strong language—I would not ship with the captain again, because he does not treat his officers in a proper manner—the water was changed to river water—that was not fit to drink, but the men made no complaint of it—I drank it occasionally unfiltered, but the captain did not drink it unfiltered, that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were twenty-eight, including the captain and crew; how came you the chief mate, and the other twenty, to allow the eight to have the upper hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The others were as bad as these, at least not as bad, but they were the ring-leaders, being Englishmen—the others were five Greeks and six Dutchmen—they were all foreigners.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the sail-maker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I sailed with the captain from Calcutta—coming down the river, and before he broke his leg, I heard him threaten the men—they were strangers on. board the ship, but had done their work as men ought to do, as I think, and I have been twenty one years going to sea, and have been in all capacities on board ship—I cannot express exactly what he said, because he had too much talk—he did not threaten them at that time, but he told Liffin and Dixon to take the pilot, put him under the chain on top of the windlass, and let him go over with it—they would not do so—I heard him several times speak to the chief mate about combing his head with a birch-broom after these men dropped duty, they came and got their pound of bread every morning regularly—I saw Campbell on the poop when I was dressing his leg, and he said, "If I had a pistol I would blow all your brains out as you work on deck"—Dixon turned and laughed, and said, "Captain Camp<lb/>hell, you would not do what you say, would you?"—I have seen the captain drunk—he was deeply intoxicated when be broke his leg—Liffin and Dixon told him to keep clear of the hawser, or it would take his leg away—he said, "Don't you think I am as good a sailor as you are?" and at that time the hawser caught him, and away he went—Liffin picked him up, and set his leg—it was about four days after that that he threatened to shoot him with a pistol—I heard him use other threats nearly every day—threatening what he would do if he only had his legs under him, but he did not say what—he said, "If I had only got my legs under me, I would take those men and trice them up, and keep them there till I thought I was satisfied—I did not go out with him—Smith had done nothing when he was put in irons, but he complained of being worked up—the captain ordered him to be put in arrest, and I said, "Captain Campbell, it is fool<lb/>ishness of you; it is your fault—what is the use of your doing it?"—I told him so before his mate, and I told him that if he kept his tongue quiet, every man would work and bring the ship home—he then wanted us to bring the ship into port—he said in the Bay of Bengal, that when he got on his legs, he would shoot every man as they walked along the deck—the men all heard that, and they said, "Let us take our punishment in the Bay of Bengal, or in any port you like, but we will not proceed to England"—I will not go another voyage with him, I would sooner beg my bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are we to understand you that he was serious when he said he would shoot every one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was serious, but he was the worse for liquor—I dressed his leg four times, and he took a dram every time—I took it seriously, but I never thought it would come to this, or I would have made a diary of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>). I was carpenter on board the ship—I sailed from London in her—I often heard the captain use bad language towards the men—I heard him threaten to shoot them after he left Calcutta—one day the men were coming down from getting bread, five or six days after we came from Calcutta, and he said he would shoot them as they went along the deck—he also said that when he got on his legs he would put them in irons, and put a gag in their mouth, and string every man up in the way he described—I have seen him string a man up—that was James Singleton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> String him up with his hands behind him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He put him in irons with his hands behind him, and fastened him to a staple with his toes on the ground—he could not move his hands, as the irons were too tight for him—he was so from 4 in the afternoon till 6 the following morning—he was the chief mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Singleton leave him at Calcutta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he summoned the captain, but they were ordered to go on board again—the Magistrate gave them some advice, and said they had better go on board the ship, and try and agree together—Singleton did not come back with us—I have heard the captain say that Singleton used to take his spirits on the passage out—Singleton stated to the Magistrate at Calcutta what I have stated to<lb/>day—I was there, but was not called on—Singleton followed the Magistrate's advice—he went on board, and stopped some days; but he was anxious to get clear of the ship, and somehow or other he got his discharge—I saw the captain drunk twice after we left Calcutta—I do not know whether this affair of Singleton's was known to the prisoners—I never mentioned it to them—we had rain water to drink till we refused it, and afterwards water which was pumped out of the Hoogley—I seldom took tea or coffee, because we could not use the water; it was so thick that it would not settle, if you drank it, your mouth was full of sand and mud, and yet no sediment would form—the captain drank it after it was filtered—it was only a small filter in the cabin—it did not filterer enough for all the crew—Sullivan died on the voyage home, on the coast of Africa—the captain had made him come up at 8 o'clock in the morning and weigh out the bread to the crew when he was too weak to stand—he was suffering from diarrhoea, and fever, and ague—he made him carry the bread, and said there was nothing but laziness the matter with him—I would not go to sea with the captain again; I would die first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Singleton chief mate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he made a complaint at Calcutta, with the crew—the case was heard—the captain was summoned by Singleton and the crew who left England with us—I did not summon him—he took me as a witness with him, but I was not called—nothing was done about the seamen—Singleton was punished because he was ordered to go overboard and scrape barnacles off the ship, and he refused—I sailed with the captain out and home—I have seen him drunk three times, what I call drunk, on the voyage out, and three times coming home—It was in the River Hoogley on each occasion, and the pilot was in charge of the vessel on each occasion—we could not filter the water for all the crew—I had the same water as the men—it was my duty, and that of the men, to keep the deck clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBIOX</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are they forbidden now to take the water from the river? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—while we were lying there to get our water, there was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260051"/>
               <p>ship called the <hi rend="italic">Blue Jacket</hi> there—Her Majesty's vessel <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> was at the Ascension Islands—I do not know whether the commodore directed all the water to be taken out of the tanks and the tanks cleaned—it was not done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>, Did you come with the same water to England? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took. some water in, but it was put with the dirty water—I say that I would rather die than ship with the captain again—I did not leave at Calcutta, because I had a friend at home who I wished to see, and I thought if I could get home, I should like it; but I would sooner meet whatever comes than go out with him—he has never struck me—he could not—he would sooner tantalize a man to do things that he would be sorry for afterwards than strike him—he never put me in irons—he has used bad language to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it been the practice for years past, to water the vessels from the Hoogley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times from the river, it goes through a filter first, and through tanks, but it was pumped out of the river as they went down—the captain left the vesssel at Ascension, and had no charge of her.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>). I was the second mate—I joined in Calcutta—I did not know the captain before—I have heard him threaten the men—I cannot say the date—it was my morning watch on deck—after the men had knocked off, they were coming up with bread—I was on the poop, and Sommerville, who is dead, is the only person I have to prove it—I heard the captain say that not one of them should come off there if he was on his pins, and something about shooting them, but I do not exactly know how he said it—that was the only time I have heard him threaten them—I saw him drunk once—I do not know whether he was drunk on the day when his leg was broken—I saw him on his back—he treated me badly, but only by abusive language; nothing else—I have heard since about his combing my hair with a birch broom—I heard that on board the vessel—I should not like to ship with him again—there was a filterer going down the companion-ladder, but we did not have water out of it—I sometimes did take the same water as the captain, but it was unknown to him—he had filtered water and I had it unfiltered—it was not fit to drink when better could be got—I do not know whether they are allowed to take water from the Hoogley—it was my first voyage to Calcutta.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you discharged from your previous ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the <hi rend="italic">Essex</hi>—I liked the captain, but I did not like the rules—she was going to stay three months, and I wanted to get home—I had no quarrel with the captain—some of the prisoners were discharged from the <hi rend="italic">Essex</hi> also—it is not the practice for the crew to leave at Calcutta; but if you want to get clear of a vessel, there are many ways of getting clear of her.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CAPTAIN CAMPBELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the last evidence; what do you say about Singleton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He refused duty on the passage out, I put the irons on him, and he took them off—I found them lying on the sofa—I said if he would promise to do his duty as chief officer, I would forgive him—the tears came into his eyes, and he said he would, and I should never find him guilty of it again—what he had done was this: the men were cleaning barnacles off the ship; I said that they were missing them, and not cleaning the ship's side properly, and he gave me some insolent language in the presence of others of the crew—I saw them laughing, and told him I would put him in irons, and carry him to Calcutta for breaking the discipline of the ship—he was next to me on board the vessel—the shipping-master at Calcutta was anxious to have him prosecuted, but I paid him off—there was an inquiry at Calcutta, and a complaint</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260052"/>
               <p>against me, but nothing was done to me—I have never had anything done to me since I have been master of a ship—I did not threaten the second mate with a birch broom—the water that was in the ship went through the same process as when she has been full of passengers—I have two large luggers, each holding three hundred gallons—I have a hole bored at the foot, the water is pumped in, and is allowed to settle—I left it to the carpenter, and said, "You will not draw a single drop of water until it is thoroughly pure"—the water comes through the bottom of them—I wanted to filter my own, and I used to go in the morning and see that it was clear, and not allow them to draw it if it was not—I had a sponge in the hole, in the tub, as the filterer was broken, and if they chose to put in the water it went through the sponge into another vessel underneath; but they never made any complaint of the water, either at Calcutta or anywhere else—I never told Dickson and Liffin to put the pilot on the windlass—I did not threaten to shoot all the men when I got on my legs—I never had a firearm in my hand—the pilot had some bottled ale, the same as I had; but when the ship went on shore, I was rather excited, but I was not in charge then—the men ought not to come on the poop when they are off duty, but they came regularly for their food—I was lying there on my back—they did not come and jeer me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it entirely untrue what the witnesses have sworn than Singleton was strung up from 4 in the afternoon, till 6 in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Entirely untrue—I never strung a man up—I put the irons on him and made fast the string to the staple which was behind, and about two hours afterwards I went into the after cabin (it was like a check on him) and found him released and lying on the couch sleeping, with the irons off—he said that he took them off himself—I said, "Have you been in the habit of having irons on before."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you tie him up with a rattling iron? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I took the piece of stuff through the staple, and made it fast—I tied the irons to the staple, so that he could not get away—his wrists were not swollen next day—I took the irons off him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said that he took them off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I found him sleeping, and I took them off him the following morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that you saw him two hours after he was tied up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and found him from the staple, with the iron off one hand, and on the other, lying on the sofa—he was not fastened in the cabin—I tied him into the cabin, and he unloosed himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that you went in two hours, and found the irons off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had taken one iron off one of his wrists, and was lying on the couch still fastened with one hand—that was not fastened in the way I had fastened it before; he had released himself, and I asked him how he had done it—he told me he had done it with a nail—I did not find him in the position I left him—he untied the string from the staple, and when I went in I found him with one hand clear, I let him lie sleeping—he might have got up on deck and walked away, but he laid himself down on a couch—when I went in in the night, he was still lying there half on his belly—I did not look to see whether the iron was still on him—he could have got away if he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What irons are they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Handcuffs—I spoke to him the following morning, and he said that he would never be guilty of such like again—I said that it was very unbecoming of him to be refusing duty before the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not suppose you had any right to do what you did do; cause</p>

               <p>I should advise you to unlearn it as soon as you can? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was for refusal of duty—I have heard these men say that they would not ship with me again—I do not know how to account for that—two lads named Conolly and Johns want to go back with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Dickson</hi>. All I have to say is, that what we did, we did in self<lb/>defence; there were others to assist the captain; we did not know who were friends, and who were foes.</p>

I carry on business at 22, Austin-friars—I am secretary to the Hallenbeagle, as well as other mines—that mine is worked on the cost-book system—on reference to my cost-book under date 25th November last, I find that 100 shares stood in the name of Henry Withered—there was a call of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due upon those shares—that would be reduced by discount to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was a shareholder in that mine—there was a meeting of shareholders on 16th November, and he was in the chair—I do not remember any proposition made at any meeting to remove the offices from London to the country—I received this letter on 27th November—[<hi rend="italic">This was dated November</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1865, <hi rend="italic">from Henry Ansted to Edward King, Esq. and enclosed a transfer of</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">shares in the Hallenbeagle mine, from Mr. H.

               <p>a certificate—[<hi rend="italic">This was dated Bristol</hi>, 4<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1865, <hi rend="italic">from J. K.

The transfer was from Henry Ansted to Edward King, Esq. requesting him to transfer</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">shares to John Hutchings, and an acceptance from John Hutchings to take the same; witnessed by J. K. Thomas</hi>]—I then referred to the transfer from Clift to the prisoner—this is in prisoner's writing—I have seen him write—my suspicious then fell on the prisoner—I believe the other transfers to be in his writing—I know his writing very well—the form of transfer was by the same printer, but the name had been cut off—the two transfers looked as if they had both been cut by one knife—the genuine and forged transfers were both cut—the name on the forms, was, "Tregaskis, printer, Redruth"—I communicated with the police—I received this letter from the prisoner in June—it is written by him—the water-mark on the paper is "Pierre and Sons, 1862," and it is black<lb/>edged—at one of the meetings, the list of the shareholders was placed on the table, and was afterwards missed—it contains the names and addresses of all the shareholders, with the number of their shares—this is the list; it contains the name of Wethered, 100 shares—this letter signed "H. Ansted," I believe to be in the prisoner's writing—the paper on which it is written, is impressed Rock and Co.—the call upon the shares was made at the last meeting, when the prisoner took the chair.</p>

I am the wife of James Heron, a cooper, living at Brentford—on 12th January, I was in a room occupied by the prisoner and his wife, the deceased—I live in the house, and went to get Mrs. Pepper a pint of beer—I was making the bed, and the prisoner was muttering a few words—he was tipsy, and I did not understand him, but he halloaed out as loud as anybody could hear that he would pull her off the chair—she screamed out—I turned round, and she was on the floor—they were both</p>

               <p>sitting by the fire before that—she was in a chair—she screamed out, "He has pulled me off the chair, and kicked me"—I called the lodgers to assist me—I had to go down to my baby, who was crying, and an hour afterwards I helped to put the deceased on the bed—she died a week afterwards—I saw her about five minutes after she died.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of New Brentford—I saw the deceased on 13th January—she was suffering from fracture of both thighs, just above the knees—she died on 21st January—she had been an invalid for a long while, suffering from general infirmity—she was deformed in her back and her collar-bone—a fall from a chair may have caused those fractures—there was a bruise on the outer side of one thigh—I am of opinion that the breaking of her thighs shortened her life—she had disease of the heart, which I attended her for—she died from exhaustion from the injuries that happened to her occurring in an enfeebled subject—her age was between fifty and sixty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the disease of the heart such as she might have died of at any instant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might, but she did not die suddenly—it was her thighs which were broken, not her legs—I saw her legs and thighs when I set them—that was the day after the fracture—I do not think that would have any influence, looking at the fact that she died from exhaustion—it is the practice of some surgeons to leave fractures unset for a few days—a fall from a chair in such a subject would be likely to produce the fracture I saw—I did not see the chair—I had not visited her for several months, and then I attended her for about a week—I had never seen her walk—I had seen her legs when I attended her some months before—they were so reduced in strength and in size, that they would be more readily broken than the legs of a person in good health, or a younger person.</p>

I live at 43, Southampton-street, Camberwell, and am a general agent—I was in Parliament-street on 6th February, looking at the procession, which was then passing—I felt myself pressed against by some person—I was most cruelly treated—I was pressed at the first onset, on my left shoulder—my eyes were intent upon the beauty of the horses, and I thought the man that pressed me upon my left shoulder was particularly hungry to see the sight, never dreaming that I was in a gang of pick-pockets—I was very much shaken in my nerves, and ought to have been under the care of a doctor—I was suffering for a week after—I had two pressings—the last was a very severe one, and I was twisted over a large form—I was so confused that I did not know what I was about—when I recovered, I missed my silver watch, a peculiar one, which had a musical tick—I would not take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—this is the little ring that it was taken off—it was most ingeniously done, and the prisoner has condemned himself, because when I went to the station, he said he did not get it, but his friend had got it—then, I say, let his friend give it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke on Horseback, at Woolwich—on 2d February May and the last witness were standing at the bar, about half-past 12—May ordered something, and it was drunk between him and the female—he paid for it out of a purse, which he took from his side-pocket—I heard the prisoner ask him to stand a drop of drink, and the sailor said he would not—after that, the prosecutor went into the parlour opposite the bar, and the prisoner followed him, returning in about four or five minutes—as the prisoner came back, I saw the purse in his hand—the pro<lb/>secutor came out, and said he had lost his purse—he wanted the prisoner to give it up; but he said he had not got it—I said, "Why, I saw the purse in your hand; why don't you give it up to the man?"—I found the purse in the bar, afterwards, empty—a constable was sent for—the watch-key was found next morning—I never saw the prisoner before, to my knowledge—he did not try to go away, if he had, he would have been pushed back—there were not many persons in the part where he stood—there were some sailors on the other side of the box.</p>

I am a butcher, of the Blackfriars-road—on 29th January, about 8.15, I was in Church-row, Newington Butts, and saw a little boy run across the road—a horse and trap was coming along at the same time, driven by the prisoner—when the child was three or four yards in front of the horse, somebody called out to him—he was turning round to see if a party was coming after him—the horse knocked him down, and the wheel passed over him—the dog<lb/>cart was going about ten miles an hour—it went on a hundred yards or a little more.</p>

               <p>mare about three yards before be got to the boy—I heard no one else call out—the mare was trotting, but when she was hit with the whip she broke into a gallop—I called out once before he knocked the boy down, and two or three times afterwards, but he did not stop—I picked the boy up and ran with him to St. Thomas's Hospital—I went in the same direction as the prisoner for twenty yards, and then had to turn the corner—he made no attempt to stop—the off-side wheel went over the boy—the prisoner was sitting on the off-side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the L division of police—on 29th January, Mr. Jones, the prisoner's solicitor, called on me to go with him to Kennington-lane police-station to examine the prisoner, and see if I could give him a certificate to get him out on bail—we went to the station at 11 o'clock to examine the prisoner—he was represented to have bleeding piles, which I could not satisfy myself of, and therefore could not give him a certificate to get him out—I was asked to pay particular attention to whether he had been drinking or not—I examined him, and found he had been drinking—he spoke thick, his pupils were dilated, he smelt of drink, and had a flushed countenance and a full pulse; all indicating that he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not all those be symptoms of great excite<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a man's pulse would be greatly accelerated by excitement, but it would not be of that full character—I saw that he had piles, but not bleeding piles—if a man has piles, it is very imprudent to drink—any doctor would tell him to abstain from drink—I had never seen him before—if he was in a state of excitement his eyes would not be dilated—I have been accustomed to all degrees of drunken men, and am quite satisfied he had been drinking—I cannot say what drink he smelt of, you cannot tell after some hours—if a man has been drinking recently you may tell what he has taken by the smell, but in two hours and a half you get a peculiar aether, coming from the lungs only—if he had been drinking porter at half-past 7, I should not have smelt it—I should not know whether it was whisky or porter, but a quarter of an hour afterwards I might tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on Monday night, the 29th January, a boy about eight years old was brought there in a state of extreme shock from injuries to the head—there was a fracture on the right side of his head, and a bruise on the left side—he was in a sinking condition, and died in about three-quarters of an hour—there was a mark of dirt on the right side of his face, and the skin was just knocked off—I was present when a post<lb/>mortem examination was made—the fracture of the head was found to extend to the base of the skull, and on the left side there was another small fracture—there was a pint of coagulated blood in the stomach that had been swallowed, and which was the cause of death—I see a great number of cases of running over—I cannot say whether he had been run over, but it is an accident that running over might produce—knocking down would not do it, unless he fell from a considerable height.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the fracture on the right side cause the rupture of any vessels of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from which blood had oozed at the</p>

               <p>back of the throat, and had been swallowed—if the right side of the head is fractured, the shock may produce a slight fracture on the left side, but not the description of fracture which this was—this was a small vertical fracture of about an inch on the left side—it did not correspond, it was not in the same segment as the fracture on the right side—supposing the boy had been thrown violently down by the shoulder of a horse or a dog<lb/>cart, and thrown on the right side of his head, it might produce the fracture of the skull on the right side which I saw, but not one which would extend so far into the base of the brain—I cannot say that it might not do so, but in the cases I have seen, there has been a contracting force to oppose it—if he was thrown on the road, there would be nothing above his head, and it would rebound—what I say is, that the worst fracture of the two required pressure on both sides of the head—I do not think the injury could have been caused by his being struck by the shaft, thrown violently on the road, and turned over and over, but I do not say that it might not.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did he leave you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After breakfast, 9 or 10 o'clock—he had a little drop then—I followed him, because I was always careful of him, and always liked to be with him when I could for fear he might get more drink—he had only had a drop of beer, not more than half a pint, or a pot between himself and his mate—I cannot say how many that was between—I know the difference between a pot and a pint—I do not know which it was—I did not see him in the public-house, and do not know how many were with him—he had the beer after he went out the first time—he had no drink when he left me—I followed him between 11 and 12—I expect he had had a drop then, like the rest of them—this was Christmas-eve, and everybody had holidays, as well as him, to enjoy themselves—we women had a drop of whisky, but my husband did not like to take short liquor, rum or gin—I suppose short is neat—but my husband had a drop of beer—one or two of the men had a glass of liquor—I said, at half-past 10 at night, "This is Christmas eve, and I do not want you to take anything to drink"—he drank a drop of beer, but no spirits"—he only drank half a pint at a time, and only had it once at a time—he was perfectly sober, and could account to himself all the world over—he often drank spirits, but did not that day—I was in the room a good bit while he was drinking—the others only had one glass of whisky each—when Mrs. Mahoney came out with the poker, she said, "Where is Jack Sheppard, the b—b—? I will run this through his face"—I said that before the Magistrate—she struck me on the back with the poker, and I did not see my husband after that—I did not see him, five minutes after she hit me with the poker, standing perfectly unhurt—I said before the magistrate, that when I came back, I could not see him standing up—I saw him standing all right about a minute after Mahoney had the poker—it was about a minute—I never said five minutes—I did not run far, but round a corner—not twenty yards—I ran after the poker, remained about a minute, and then I came back, and found my husband lying on the ground, bleeding—I did not see who knocked him down—I did not hear Miles say that he would commit wilful murder, but I was told so.

I am a surgeon of Alexander-terrace—on 24th December, between 10 and 11, I was sent for, and examined Shea—I found him lying on a bed suffering from a compound fracture of the frontal bone above the right eye—there was a lacerated wound about an inch and a half long, which penetrated to the bone—I could put my finger between the pieces of the bone—there was also a compound fracture of the left lower jaw; that is, a cut as well as a fracture—a brickbat or some hard instrument would cause it—the instrument need not project to drive pieces of bone into the brain; any instrument will do it—he remained insensible till Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning—he gradually sank, but he rallied a little, and I sent him to the hospital, as he could not afford the nourishment he required—I sent him when he could be moved with some amount of safety—an injury to the lungs which had been three weeks in forming, might be caused by a violent push—he had a slight cough three or four days after I first saw him, but I did not pay much attention to the pectoral symptoms, the cerebral symptoms were so severe—I did not see him after I sent him to the hospital—he might have had diseased lungs then; I did not examine them—the injury to the head was decidedly sufficient to cause death—it was compound fracture of the skull.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 14th January, with a wound on his forehead, and a compound fracture of the frontal bone—he was suffering from disease of the chest, and was in a very debilitated state—there was evidence of an old fracture of the jaw, which was partly united—this was three weeks after<lb/>wards—he lingered to the 25th January, and then died—after his death, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—he had something the matter with his lungs, which had existed some weeks—that might be occasioned in three weeks at least, possibly more, and possibly not more—I think three weeks would have done it—it is not usual for that kind of disease to be caused by an accident, but an external injury might, by debilitating his system, cause</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260099"/>
               <p>sympathy in that part, so as to cause him to be affected by cold—I found a compound fracture of the frontal bone, with three small pieces driven into the brain, pressing between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the skull, and also a small abscess at the seat of injury, caused by the irritation set up by the pieces of bone—he died of chronic inflammation of the lungs, which was the im<lb/>mediate cause—the injury to the brain might, and in all probability would, have occasioned his death, if it had not been caused by the lungs—the injury to the jaw would not do it—the injury to the skull did not accelerate his death; he died from lung disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would he have died as soon from lung disease if he had not had the injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the skull trepanned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is usual if there is a piece of bone protruding on the brain to raise it—that had not been done—if it had been, he would have had a better chance of his life—I think, if the operation of trepanning had been resorted to, his death would have resulted, because it is a very dangerous operation—the wound itself would not aggravate the lung disease, but it would have a depressing effect on the patient, and might accelerate an existing disease; but it not being trepanned made it much more injurious—there was quite sufficient to cause death in the lungs, even if he had been injured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that the injury to the head hastened the mortal effect to the injury to the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It produced a depressing effect, which tends to increase disease in any important organ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a patient died of disease of the lungs, after a three weeks' illness, would not he present appearances of it previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him three weeks previously—if he had had the disease of which I speak previously, I should expect some one to have heard something about it—I cannot say, if he had enjoyed perfectly good health before, that those symptoms were occasioned on that day or afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you say that trepanning would have been a good thing to do to him, but you did not do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not know that these pieces of bone were pressing on the brain—trepanning would have been good if we knew what the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination enabled us to know—he had sufficient chronic inflammation of the lungs to have killed him—he could not have lived for years with that extent of chronic inflammation if he had not met with the injury to the head—I believe the chronic inflammation of the lungs would be aggravated by the injury to the head; it would extend the disease—general depression to the nervous system will affect the functions of all important organs, and render a patient unable to withstand the attacks of disease—when he received the injury to the skull, he might have had some inflammation of the lungs, which might not have been mortal, but which became mortal disease by the injury to the head—he might have had it and not known it, because it was comparatively slight—there was sufficient to cause death without the injury to the head in the condition I found him in—that condition of the lungs was, in all probability, brought about by the injury to the head, more especially when it is borne in mind that the man had not complained of the injury to the lungs before he was struck on the head.</p>
