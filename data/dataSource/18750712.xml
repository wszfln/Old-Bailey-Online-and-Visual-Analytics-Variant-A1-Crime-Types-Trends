The shirt was a dark stripe, a dark mixture of tweed.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an hotel at 76 and 77, Aldgate High Street, City—on 7th October the prisoner passed the night at my hotel—next morning my attention was drawn to bedroom No. 2, by Emma Chick, the chamber-maid—I found the bed cut open, the spring mattreas was also cut open in two or three places, the sheet had been held up and burnt in various places, the. blanket had also been served the same, all the handles of the mahogany chest of drawers had been burnt all over, two very indecent words were scratched on the looking-glass with a diamond, and also on the window, the soap was cut into small pieces and kneaded into the carpet pretty well all over the room, and water was strewed about all over</p>

I am assistant-clerk to the vestry of Hampstead—at the end of December last the prisoner was appointed gate porter at the workhouse—it was his duty to keep the porter's book, which I have here—he would enter there the names of the persons who came in and went out of the workhouse—on 28th January he left the service—a balance of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was then due to him—his salary was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum with lodging and rations—when he left I gave him a cheque for the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed by Mr. Burnaby and myself as clerk—that cheque came back from the bankers on the 9th February, and was duly charged to the guardians—I have here a cheque-book—it was kept in a desk in front of me, or it might be in a cupboard in the same office until it was used—at the time the prisoner left it was complete, not commenced to be used—the prisoner would have access to the office in which that book was kept, it was part of his duty to lock</p>

On 22nd June, about 5.50, I was on duty at Thames Bank near the distillery in Grosvenor Road—I observed the prisoner loitering about for full half an hour—she had a child in her arms—she came and placed herself near the steps leading down to the river—I asked her if she was going to drown herself—she said "I am," and she ran by me and threw herself into the water with the child in her arms—the witness Black who stood close by me immediately jumped into the water and with great difficulty succeeded in saving both the mother and child; there was a strong current at the time—the child was quite exhausted when it was taken out; it was in the water two or three minutes—it was taken to, the workhouse and is there now—it is about twelve months old—I found on the prisoner a letter for the Belgrave hospital—she said that she was going to try to get the child in on the following Thursday—the child is a female; it is a very sickly child, very sore round the nose and eyes, suffering from some disease—it had a starved look—the prisoner told the Magistrate that she had tried to get the child in the hospital but was too late—she said she was determined to destroy the life</p>

I am a cabdriver and live at 18, Johnson's Place—I was passing Thames Bank on this evening and saw the prisoner jump into the water with the child in her arms—I immediately jumped in with all my clothes on and swam out and brought the woman in with the child, with the assistance of a man in a boat—the child was in a very exhausted state; the prisoner held it very tight in her arms, I had very great difficulty in getting it out of her arms in the water—it was about twenty or thirty feet deep there—I did not ask her any questions, I was too eager to get home to change my clothes—the tide was running, very strong, at the rate of five miles an hour—I don't think there is another man in London who could have done it with all his clothes on, I had to swim a considerable distance, but thank God I am a pretty good swimmer.

At 2 o'clock in the morning of the 2nd June I was on duty near Mr. Wilford's premises in Copperfield Road, Bow—I heard the forcing of a warehouse door, I went towards the factory and saw a light in the office; I looked through the window—it was a common candle burning—I stayed looking in at the window from one to two minutes—I saw the prisoner and another man inside—I had seen the, prisoner before.</p>

After I had looked through the window I went round the back on to the towing path of the Regent's Canal, and saw that they had forced the wicket gate open—I went through the gate and went into the factory—the light had then been blown out—when looking through the window I noticed that the prisoner was wearing a cheese-cutter cap, the other man was wearing a billy-cock—I went right through the full length of the factory into the office where the two men were—a scuffle ensued between me and the prisoner, I got hold of him, I could see him by the daylight through the window, it was getting towards daylight; he tried to get away from me—I struck him across the left arm with my truncheon and my truncheon broke in two—as soon as it was broken the prisoner said to the other man, "His truncheon is broken, land him one, settle the b----, and leave him to it"—I was instantly struck on the head with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> that I produce, and was knocked down insensible—when I recovered the men were gone—I then made a search in the office and over the factory, I found this cheese-cutter cap on the floor just inside the office door, also the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>,—it was left just by my side—I then went and called up Mr. Smith the foreman, he lives at 49, Copperfield Road, not many doors from the factory—I then examined the place to see how it had been entered; it was done by forcing the bottom part of the wicket door at the back of the factory—I compared the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> with the marks and they corresponded; there were two marks—on 4th June, I went with Howlett to the ware-house about 10 a.m., and saw the prisoner there among several other men—I pointed him out as the man I had struck across the left arm with my truncheon on the Wednesday morning—he said, "You are mistaken, I have got the rheumatics in my arm"—he was wearing a cheese-cutter cap, which I produce, it is a newer one of the same sort as the other—he took off his coat, and he had a blister on his arm, in about that part where I had struck him—I struck him above the elbow on the fleshy part—he was taken into custody—from something I was told, I afterwards went to the saw mills next door to the factory, I saw a man there, but I would not be positive that he really was the other man, I had a doubt.</p>

I am a M.R.C.S. at Kent House, Bow, and am divisional surgeon to the police—on the morning of 2nd June, about 3 o'clock, I examined Clapp—I found a contused and punctured wound on the forehead, about mid-way between the temporal bone and the middle of the skull—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> would be a most likely instrument to have-caused it; it was cut to the bone—it was a blow that would be likely to produce insensibility for a time—he is still under my care—On 11th June I examined the prisoner's left arm at the Magistrate's request—I found a sur<lb/>face that had evidently been previously a blister; it was above the elbow, about the size of a crown piece—it had been produced by some irritating substance, such as strong ammonia or cantharides—repeated applications of iodine would in my opinion produce suoh an appearance, repeated at short intervals—previous to a blister forming there would be a yellow stain; the blister would take away the yellow—I have heard the blow described by Clapp—my impression is that a bruise would not exist; the staff having broken, would break the force of the blow on the arm, and I should not expect, under those circumstances, to find a bruise, however hard the blow—I did not find any bruise on the arm.</p>

               <p>two children—he went to bed between 9 and 10 that Monday night—he did not get up or go out at any time during the night; I am quite sure of that—six weeks before this occurred he had been complaining of rheumatics in the arm—I know Mrs. Stent—I saw the prisoner in possession of this bottle on the Wednesday night before he was taken when he came home, I used some of it on the muscle of his left arm on the Wednesday night, I put it on with my finger and rubbed it in, I had no brush to put it on with; he had been using it before this occurred, Mrs. Stent had given it to him—he complained to me on the Wednesday night of his arm being worse, he said he had had to fetch a piece of lead from Bishopsgate Church and he had got to Whitechapel Church before he could get any conveyance and that had caused a sprain or made his arm worse—there was a stain on his arm a fortnight before that where he first used the iodine down at the factory, it was a yellow mark—I used the iodine again on the Thursday morning and on Thursday night I gave him some horse oil to rub in; I don't know what was in it, but it caused the blisters—that was on the Thursday before the robbery; no, the Thursday after the robbery, the 3rd of June—I used the iodine first on Wednesday, the 2nd—I know that he had been using it some time before; I had not seen it, he used it at the factory; I had seen the mark on his arm, the yellow—he was in great pain on the Thursday, and it was then that the horse oil was used—I slept with him on the Monday night, I did not miss him from the bed at any time during the night; if he had got out of bed I certainly must have missed him—he slept at home on the Tuesday night, he went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock and he never went out from the time he came home till he went to work on the Wednes<lb/>day morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first time I actually saw the iodine used was on the Wednesday night after the robbery, I used it myself on his arm; he complained of very great pain; I only used it twice, once on the Wednes<lb/>day night, and once on the Thursday morning—I used a good deal on the Wednesday night—I did not use it anywhere but on the arm—on the Thursday morning I used it again slightly, at the same place—he did not go to his work on the Thursday—on the Thursday night I put on the horse oil; it still pained him very much—I rubbed it in well, and wrapped it up in flannel; exactly in the same place, and nowhere else—I had not seen any stuff in his possession before the Wednesday night; but when he came here a fortnight before, his arm was coloured, and he said he had used some stuff at the factory—I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock on the Tues<lb/>day night—I work in the same line as the prisoner, the card-board line; he is the engineer at the cardboard factory; I dont work there, I work in Thames Street, my hours are from 9 o'clock sometimes till 6 o'clock at night—I attend to my household duties, and the children—I go to bed very tired—the prisoner went to bed before me that night—he usually went to bed at the same time; he went to bed between 9 and 10 o'clock that night—I said before the Magistrate that I saw him get out of bed between 5 and 6 o'clock on the Wednesday morning, he was walking about the room because of his arm being so bad—I did not get any rest at all on account of his arm—he got out of bed between 5 and 6 o'clock to go to his work on the Wednesday—I had been asleep all night.</p>

                  </hi>. I served my time with an auctioneer in the country and subsequently I was engaged in the office of Mr. Marsh, the auctioneer—in October last I was desirous of finding a business for myself and communicated with my solicitors, Messrs. Harper and Battcock, for that purpose—a few days before 20th October I received a communication from them and went to the defendant's premises 127, Edgware Road—I said my brother had told me that he was desirous of getting a partner and I had called upon him to learn a few particulars of the business—he entered into a general detail of what he had been doing for the last ten months—he said he had been carrying on business as a house and estate</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120033"/>
               <p>agent and house decorator and he had made about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that'-time I understood him to say, and he then introduced this book (<hi rend="italic">pro duced</hi>) and said all the entries of money was commission that he had made and which made up the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had made during the year—he said where the entries were marked across that was the commission he had received—I did not examine the book carefully—I just went through it—the entries are crossed some with the word "Let" and some "Sold" and "Com" with the amounts—I did) not examine any of those entries in detail on that occasion—he told me that one of the reasons for taking a partner was that he had taken an hotel at Gravesend and he wanted to devote attention to that and wanted somebody to look after the business—I said I would see my brother about it and see him again—I saw my brother and went with him on 20th October—my brother was spokesman on that occasion—the book was again produced by the defendant—my brother took down on a piece of paper the amounts that were in the book as they were read out by the defendant—my brother was taking them from the book, and he said he would call them out—he said the entries were the commission that he had received—we then went away and I wrote this letter to him the same afternoon—I can't say whether this is the original or a copy; of course I took a copy of the letter that I wrote—I received this letter from Marshall in reply: "Dear Sir,—Your letter of yesterday's; date came duly to hand. In reply I beg to state that I accept your offer on the terms, but on condition that the same be completed forthwith. You; know my reason for making this condition, namely, that I want some one here as soon as possible. In going over my books you must please not forget that the twelvemonths is not up till the middle of December, and therefore the business is really more* than you think. With regard to references you don't state what you require to know, but as you have seen everything else I presume you refer to respectability, and therefore mention Mr. A. Brown, 88, Edgware Road, who has known me about fifteen years and also my landlord, but I could not see him to-day, and of course must ask before giving his name. There is nothing to prevent your preparing the necessary deeds, as you will find everything so straightforward that you cannot be otherwise than satisfied. I am faithfully yours, George Marshall." On receiving that letter I communicated with my solicitors and on 29th October I went to his office and gave him a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has been paid—on 4th November we met at the solicitor's office and a deed of partnership was drawn up, which was signed and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by my solicitors on my behalf—I personally made inquiries from Mrs. Stoffell and Mr. Ward, there being those entries in the books—I also went to Mr. Hanscomb and Miss Grabham, Miss Skinner and Mrs. Davey—in consequence of the information I there gathered I communicated with my solicitors—I told them what had happened and left the matter since then entirely in their hands—I was induced to pay the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the commission that he said he had earned during the ten months; the profits he had made, but more especially the commission—I knew more about that than I did about house decorating, as I know nothing about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrates "Believing the defendant's' representation that he had made at the rate of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the business in which I subsequently became a partner I parted with my money—that was the reason certainly—I attended on the second occasion with my brother who is a lawyer—we saw some other books besides the one'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120034"/>
               <p>which has been produced—I saw some books with counterfoils—this is an ordinary auctioneer's book with cards to view; the names of the places and so forth would be on the counterfoils and tickets are torn out and given to the persons desiring to view—I kept a book like that myself during the two months I was there—I. saw this book at the time, some of it is in my writing—it is a full book of counterfoils of people who came to do business at the premises, to view houses wo had to let, and which were on the boobs—it is the custom with house agents and auctioneers for people who have businesses to let or sell, to place their business or premises on two or three auctioneer's books at the same time, so that the same things that were on our books may have been on two or three other house agents' books at the same time, and whoever lets first gets the commission—I have not had any notice to produce a document of arrangement entered into between me and the defendant, subsequently to my leaving the business—I don't know that, my attorney has—I don't know anything about it—I can't say that any agreement was entered into between us—I don't know anything about. it—I left it entirely in my solicitors' hands; they knew how to settle it better than I did—an arrangement was not made at my suggestion that the part<lb/>nership was to be dissolved and a portion of the money paid to me—I never gave my solicitors any such instructions—I can't say what. was done about it—no arrangement was made that I know of—Mr. Marshall never attempted to remove the book, which he first showed me, from the office, during our partnership—he left it there for me to have free access to it, and to do what I liked with—I took the book away subsequently, when I. found out this—some actions were brought in the country in which. Mr. Marshall was the plaintiff—I did not refuse to return the book to carry on the suits—I had not got the book, my solicitors had it—I. took the book away under their instructions and gave it to them—when I went into partnership the defendant had a banking account at the City Bank—my solicitors had possession of the leases of the premises as well as the book—they were with the solicitors from the commencement of the partnership, and I suppose they never got out of their hands—they have got them now—I value the leases at very little—if properly let I should say they-are worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more, certainly—I have not taken any one's opinion as to their value, that is my own opinion—I gave the tickets to view to persons who applied for them and the premises were, all on our books to let—I can't say that there were fifty-eight furnished houses on the books to be let, when I left the business in February 15th, and I can't say that the com-mission if let would be 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or that there were twenty-one properties for sale and the commission on them if all had been sold amounted to 2,670<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say that they are in the book—I don't know how much they would make up altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The houses and properties entered in the book for which I gave orders to view were not all in the book before 4th November—some of them were entered in the book before the partnership and some after—I can't tell you the number of properties that were put into my charge for letting from November to February; I could tell from the list—I should think about thirty or forty fresh properties came in during the time I was partner—in some cases they were brought to me, and in other cases we sought for them—I never let anything at all, and nothing resulted from the orders to view—I paid in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the City Bank, and he paid in 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the leases that I have spoken of is the lease of the offices—I paid</p>

               <p>100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I don't think they would let for any more—then there is the lease of next door, 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the rental of that is 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—it ought to let for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in detachments, and we should have to pay property tax for that—I think the lease has six or ten years to run—as an auctioneer, I say that the total value of the leases in the hands of my solicitors is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have purchased the goodwill of this business for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I had known what I know now with reference to the commissions in the. book. (<hi rend="italic">The deed of partnership was partly read.

I am the prosecutor's brother, and a member of the firm of Harper, Broad &amp; Battcock, solicitors, Rood Lane—my brother com<lb/>municated with me for the purpose of taking a business, and I saw the defendant alone in Edgware Road before I went with my brother—we had a general discussion about his business, and he said he was making at the rate of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he had made that within the previous ten months, and I said I would call on him again with my brother and we would go into the matter—on the 20th October I went there with my brother, and we had a general conversation to the same effect—I asked Mr. Marshall for his books, so that we might see what business he was doing—he produced this book, saying it was the only book he had showing the state of his business—I took the book—he said they were entries of houses in his hands for the purpose of being sold or let, and where the figures were written across, was the commission he had received for the sale or letting of-those houses—upon that, I took a piece of paper to take down the commissions to see what they amounted to—I took down the. first two or three amounts myself, and then the defendant said it would save time if he called them out to me as he knew the book better—he called out the amounts, and I took them down, they amounted to 539<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that' is the commission—he also gave me a list of other sums earned, with reference to valuations, but I did not attach much importance to those—we said we would consider the matter, and make him an offer—we then left, and a letter was written by my brother on the 20th, and the answer was received on the 29th, which has been read—on 4th November 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid at my office, and the leases were deposited with me—I prepared the partnership deeds, and they were left with me as solicitor for the parties at that time—I have them still—this book was brought to me shortly before 12th February, and this letter was written by my firm on the 12th. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "Having been consulted by your partner, Mr. H. T. Battcock, with reference to having secretly drawn cheques in the name of the firm, we, in consequence of being informed that hardly any business has been done since the commencement of the partnership, advised inquiries to be made as to the commission which you stated you had received in the ten months preceding the partnership and on the faith of which Mr. Batt-cock paid you a premium of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The result of those inquiries has been that in almost every case gone into it appears no commission was received by you at all. It thus seems to us that the premium of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was obtained by you under false pretences. But before finally arriving at that conclusion we desire to give you an opportunity for any explanation you may think proper, and we request that you will do this at once, otherwise we shall conclude that you have none to offer.")

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Thomas William Cook, of 8, Clifford Street, a tailor—I have been in his service nine and a half years—the prisoner was a fellow servant, he had been there about seven years—it has recently been my duty to pay the wages on Saturday to the persons working in the shop—it was the prisoner's duty to pay the outdoors wages—I was supplied with the coins necessary to pay both classes of wages—each outdoor worker has a small book in which is entered all the work done and delivered—the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of such books—the book is initialled by the cutter to show that the actual garment has been brought in made up—it was then the prisoner's duty to enter it in this wages book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is all the handwriting of the prisoner—this is the wages book for the outdoor people only—after the initial of the cutter was put to the workmen's book it would be delivered to the prisoner for him to copy into the wages book—it was his duty to bring the book to me and call out correctly from that, the amount to be paid to each person—on the 29th of, May he called out seventeen names and amounts to each one—as each, name was sailed I counted out the amount of money which he called in separate sums and handed them to him—I afterwards received a memorandum from him of the amount that he had expended, the supposed so-called outdoors wages—I have not got the memorandum for the 29th of May, it was torn in pieces and thrown into the waste-paper basket—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my. wages book;—that is Mr. Steven's handwriting—I go through it with him after he baa taken, the wages—the prisoner has nothing whatever to do with this book; it is. made up from 1 to 1.30 on the Saturday, the same day—I look at it between the time it comes up into the shop and the time it is made up, from 1 to 1.30—the foreman likewise goes through with me at the same time to see that everything is correct—that is not Stevens, but what we term the cutter—I can tell by reference to the cash-book what was paid for outdoor wages in that week—the cash-book is in my own handwriting—that is an entry made on the Saturday before we-leave; the entry is 114<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that means both is and outdoor wages—the total paid for indoor is 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was given to the prisoner—I swear it—in his own book the total of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appears made up of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid outdoors and 571.8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid indoors—he enters mine correctly—amongst the names of the workpeople called to me on the 29th of May there were Kearney, Cham<lb/>bers, Wheeler, Dart, Murphy, and Beveridge—in Kearney's detail in the prisoner's handwriting I find the accountant has put a mark; I find an item there of 65. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the entry is "Schofield, W. F." (<hi rend="italic">the name of the customer</hi>), "Waistcoat, basted and bound, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the detail of Chambers in the prisoner's handwriting I find'" Swabey, F., trowsers, side pockets, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in Wheeler's account the item marked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is for a footman's waistcoat—Dart, a dress waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murphy, a waistcoat, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Beveridge a pair of trowsers, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—passing to June 5th I find there the writing of the prisoner in his wages book—sixteen persons were paid out door work that week—the 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on this ticket are the prisoner's figures—after he</p>

               <p>has called out all the separate sums that have been handed to him he gives that to me as the total—looking at my figures I am able to say I paid 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making a total of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there may have been odd pence, but the fragment of paper does not show them—the amount altogether entered in my book is 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that would be in accordance with the ticket—in the prisoner's book the amount for outdoor for the 5th of June stands at 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is the amount according to him due at that time—I find in his book names and figures written over erasures in that week—he enters the amount I pay—he puts in 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as my amount—I have not referred to see if that is correct—looking at the details of the items for June 5th I see there is an item marked by the accountant "Wheeler, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "for a waistcoat—Kearney, waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—George,—waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Murphy, waistcoat, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Chambers, trowsers, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the person whose name is entered as "George," is a person of the name of Cook, but he takes the name of an old porter who was with us for many years—he always went by the name of George, and his daughter makes waistcoasts and she took the name of George—where ever the word George appears it means the daughter of our old porter George whose name is Cook—I say I gave to the prisoner 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and whatever the pence was, and not 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew on Saturday, the 12th of June, Mr. Stevens was pre<lb/>sent to listen to what was called out—the prisoner: was arrested on the Monday following—he was not taken into custody till the 14th—I remember the prisoner calling out "Morris, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; "-her wages appear as 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his book; I did not look at the time to see" what was the figure there—there is a leaf torn out on the Monday following—I will swear it was not missing on the Saturday and I swear that he called' out 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Morris—I paid the money—seventeen persons are entered for outdoor pay on that day, the 12th of June—after the calling had been gone through and the coins put down to correspond he gave me the ticket—that is his ticket and the amount he so received from. me—that is my writing, the date 12th June underneath—the amount is 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he has entered in his book 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as paid outdoor—the total amount of both classes of wages is 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I swear I gave him 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and not the lesser sum of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I receive from my employers a cheque for the purpose of paying wages—the wages must be made up first; taken out in the rough—the indoor and outdoor wages books were in my possession for that purpose—the indoor wages book would be in the handwriting of Stevens, and the outdoor wages book in the handwriting of the prisoner—the paper on which the rough calculation of the wages is made is thrown on one side—the outdoor wages book is left with the prisoner, it is not taken from him—it is kept in the office where the prisoner is supposed to be—when' he calls out, say, Huuter 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I hand it to him—I should think it is not my duty to look over him to see if he calls cut correctly—the amount was supposed to correspond with the small book—I place drimplicit confidence in the prisoner—it was my duty to pay the money, without taking any account at the time of the names or the item or the total—the prisoner brought me his list of what it amounted to) I should—say from a quarter to half an hour afterwards—I did not compare the list with the amounts in the book—my check is the balance of my cash in the was after paying the wages—the total is not drawn down in the book when the rough approximation is made of the wages—the totals are there of each man's work, but not the total</p>

               <p>amount of the whole—I received the prisoner's statement of what I had paid him without any further would have nothing whatever to do with the payment of the indoor workmen—I have no personal memory of what I paid, but refreshing my memory from the book I can state it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I entered the medical profession—in 1866 and qualified in 1869—I have had persons under my charge suffering under mental disease, I travelled two years with a man who was a ward in Chancery, who was subject to delusions, but at times he was quite sensible—when those delusions were on him he was very violent, but "at other times, he vas sensible and could enter into conversation about anything—the generic term for that form of insanity is "mania"—mania involves delusions at times, decidedly—an attack of sunstroke would render the person who had it a likely person for insanity to take effect upon; it would predispose the soil more readily to the growth of insanity—there is no doubt whatever that a sun-stroke has a strongly mechanical effect upon the brain—a patient is at first insensible from sunstroke, and afterwards there is congestion of the brain very often accompanied by delirium—the after effect of sun stroke are intense headache coming on in an uncontrollable degree and under any exciting cause: drink would bring it on—a person who has had sun-stroke ought to drink nothing—I have been in Court during trial—for the purpose of forming an opinion as to whether a person is or is not of sound mind when he commits an act, the question" of motive is a materal one; if I, as a doctor, were called upon to form an opinion for private pur<lb/>poses, the absence of motive would be a most important consideration—it is a well-known characteristic of murderous attacks perperated by insane people, that the attacks are either perpetrated on  a person they do not know or else on a person they are very fond of but I do not say this is always the case—there may be something unusual in the circumstance that  a person, after the attack of mania has passed away, is perfectly calm and collected, but not always; the person would have very uncertain restless eyes, he would not feel after this as he did before—I have often heard such persons say that they have no idea why they have done a thing, and that they were very sorry—another circumstance also which is indicative, is the ferocity with which the attack was made—this was a very ferocious attack and I decidedly consider the ferocity an element in the consideration.</p>

I am a labourer, of 17, St. James Street, Bromley—I have known the prisoner about fourteen years, and he lodged with me about four years up to 28th April, the Wednesday before this unhappy affair took place—I knew him when he was working at the gas works at Beckton—I remember his having a sunstroke there five years ago, and he was away from the works two or three weeks and was very bad—he came back to work afterwards I have noticed him very strange this last year or two—I noticed something about his eyes at times when he was sober, and he has called out to me several nights, previous to the time he went to West Ham, saying that there was somebody going to murder him that was when, he has been in bed and the lights had been out—he also sat before my fire, and he up with his feet and kicked the fire—I said "What are you up to; are you going luney or what?"—that only happened once—he was in work at the Bromley Gas Works for a twelvemonth, up to ten days before he went to East Ham—he was at my house ten days out of work, and then he left me and went to East Ham on 28th April—Becton is, below North Woolwich; he left there some time ago, and has been at Bromley at some gas works, and he was out of work ten days at my house—he then went to East Ham to—work again, and when I came home on Wednesday morning to my breakfast he was sitting on the chair, and he started eating my breakfast—I thought it was something strange and spoke to my mistress about it, and said that I thought there was something wrong with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said "I have noticed he was very strange at times when he was sober during the last two or three years;" he was accustomed to drink sometimes, but when he was sober he would go on talking French and German and I did not understand him—he was given to drinking at times and he would get the worse for it—he has several times had a glass with me in a public-house, but a very little drink affects him—the sun<lb/>stroke was about five years ago, it was before he came to lodge with me—he was not lodging with me at the time, but I was working close to him—I know it was a sunstroke because he lay on some planks on the river side face downwards, and when it was time to go to work he seemed to lie there—some one said "What is up with Mike, is he gone to sleep," and we started him up, but he was regularly silly and had to be led home, and all he said was "I want to see my mother"—I don't know that he</p>

               <p>had a doctor, as I did not go home with him, but we all put it down as a sunstroke—before that he would have a glass at times, but—I was not in the habit of keeping much company with him in the drinking line—in my opinion it was not drink on that day—he conducted himself well for two or three years for what I saw—when he kicked the grate in my room two or three times he had had a drop of beer, but he did not look like a drunken man; he was a little the worse for liquor—he has called me up on four or five nights and said, that there was a man murdering him but I never went up into the room, to see, because I knew there was nobody in the room but himself—he had had some drink before he went to bed on those nights the only other occasion of strange conduct of his was his going into my room when I was away and eating, some of my breakfast—I was present—he bad been lodging with me and had had breakfast of his own in my room before but not mine I do not know—whether he would be able to tell that it was my breakfast and not his—he ate it in a proper way for what I could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was as a rule a very peaceable good natured man—a little drink took effect, upon him—I did not see him on Thursday before this took place—he was going to East Ham to the gas works to work at Mr. George Martin's—I knew Amos Briscoe—it was hot weather when I saw the prisoner ill five years ago, and we all counted that it was sunstroke—we were working at. the gas works by the river side in the glare of the sun—I do not know what time of the year it was because I am no Scholar, but I am sure it was in the summer time.</p>

Rottingdean; near Brighton, when he was very strange, and on one occasion he said he did not care whether he lived or died, and walked out of the house—I followed him and he walked up and down the cliff close to the edge—I caught hold of him and said "Look here Mike, come home with me."—he was very strange and would not answer any questions he was sober—when I pulled him back he did not try to resist me, he went quietly with me—I have frequently observed him strange at other times when he has been perfectly sober—I agree in what the last witness said that he could not not drink much, before he was inebriated—I did not see—anything of him about Wednesday, the 28th—I had not seen him for twelve months, till last Saturday in prison.</p>

               <p>said to that—the chain had not been paid out then, I was helping to pay it out with the rest of them when I came forward—four five of us did it—I then went aft to get some water in a bucket, the prisoner "went with-me—we had finished paying out the chain and the awning too—there was' about a quarter of an hour between the two—as we were passing to get the water, the prisoner spoke to Mr. Beattie, but what he said I can't remember—"Mr. Beattie told him to come back and he would hit him in the mouth; he would strike him if he would not hold his noise—he was not making much noise the was speaking angrily—Mr. Beattie then gave him a push and pushed him down backwards on the top of some spars—he was still speaking when that happened, they were both <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi>—Mr. Beattie was then going aft—the prisoner still kept talking to him, rash words, angrily, and Mr. Beattie went to strike him—the prisoner was then standing up on the top of the spars, standing on deck rather, when George Beattie came back again he turned round and went up to him with the intention of striking him, he was making for Monson, and Monson jumped on the top of the spars and pulled his knife out—Mr. Beattie was lifting his hand up, just as if he was going—to strike him—he was "3 or 4 feet from him, and I believe he was going to strike him,—he was raising his hand, and the prisoner got on the for of the spars just alongside of him, not going away from—him and drew his knife from his breast with his right hand—it was under the waistband of his trousers; I could see the handle of it before he drew it, it was in a sheath in the waistband—it was a clasp knife—when he was pushed on the spars he said "I—will settle this yet" where he drew out the" knife; he stabbed Mr. Beattie in the shoulder—Mr. Beattie ran, at him like this (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), and he took the knife out like that, and put it over the top of his shoulder—Mr. Beattie was coming toward him at the time, he got close up to him, they were breast "to breast—Mr. Beattie then got hold of him and knocked him down on the spars they both wrestled and fell on the spars—Mr. Beattie did not say anything, he never said a word that I heard—I called out that the mate was stabbed, and all hands ran aft to separate them—the captain afterwards attended to Beattie and the prisoner was put in irons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner is about twenty—the hold is not dark when the hatches are off—we were working with as little clothing as we could—we generally take our shirts off, as it is too warm, the mate had got on a thin cotton shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. These two shillings uttered to Chamberlain and Johnson are bad and from the same mould—I have examined the whole of the coins in the case and they are bad—some of the 147 in the bag are from the same mould as the two uttered and there are forty-three of 1856 from one mould, the same as those uttered by Keen to Chamberlain and Johnson—these ten found at the foot of the bed are of 1856 and four of them are from the same mould as those uttered to Chamberlain and Johnson—these sixpences are also bad—here are double moulds for shillings and sixpences—the officer showed me a shilling and &amp; sixpence which came from those moulds—this sixpence uttered to Mary Ann Yarrien is bad—these two shillings uttered to Carr and Freeman are bad but not from the same mould—I have seen the clamps, the battery and the acid, here is every thing complete for making counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Neave's statement was read as follows</hi>:—Horsemonger Lane Gaol, 15th May, 1875. I am desirous of giving some information with reference to the disposal of counterfeit coin. I first began to carry for a man named <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi> in January or February last, and was introduced to a barman near Moorgate Street Station who bought of me and supplied the clerks in the booking-office there. One of the clerks was dismissed or absconded in February I think—The barman then said he would not have anything more to do with it, but took me to Baker Street Station one Sunday morning in the beginning of February and introduced me to a clerk named Murrell or Keen. I then began to supply him with things which I had from <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi>, who was agent for 3 makers, one called <hi rend="italic">Little Ben</hi>, one <hi rend="italic">Harry Drake</hi>, and the other <hi rend="italic">Ted Kelly.</hi> I supplied Murrell with about 200 florins and shillings, which he got rid of himself. I used to go into the office to him, and if anyone was there I would sell him some article of clothing which I always carry with me. He was then at Baker Street Station. I went about three times a week, carrying him sixty or seventy pieces each time. He then asked me to get him some smaller pieces, such as sixpences, as he said he had someone <hi rend="italic">else</hi> who would take them at Victoria Station. I told him I would try and do so, but could not then get any. I got him more shillings and took him about 300 a week. He told me he had a lot of florins by him which he could not get rid of. After going to Baker Street for some time he was removed to several stations, and remained at the Swiss Cottage for about a fortnight, and I continued to supply him at each place. He asked me to get him some sixpences, and when I told him I could not, he said "Why don't you try and make them yourself?" I told him that I did not know how unless someone learnt me. I was on the Dials one day and saw an old man whom I knew to be a maker of sixpences. His name is Cummings, a very old man. I asked him if he could let me have some sixpences. He said "No, but i'll learn you how to make them if you'll give me what is right, because I am hard up." I promised to do so, and the next day he showed me the way to make a mould, and the following day how to mix the metal, and the proper way to make them. He brought with him a battery, some solution, and the whole of the necessary things for plating them over. I did not make myself for nearly a fortnight, but continued to have things from <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi> till I moved away from Blackfriars to. Camberwell, and then I told the clerk (Murrell) I would try and make him some sixpences, as I had learnt how to do it. He said "All right, bring as many as you like." I made some sixpences and shilling and met him at King's Cross two or three days running. He then told me the other clerk who was on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187507120070"/>
               <p>duty with him was all right, and I could come to the office at Edgware Road Station. I think that is about three weeks ago, or may be more. He told me to make as many as I could as there were several of the other clerks doing it at other stations, one at Victoria. I have been taking him about 500 a week for the last three weeks, and he told me he could do with twice as many more. Last Sunday morning I took him eighty sixpences and about forty shillings. I went into the office about a quarter to eleven and remained there till one o'clock. Murrell and another clerk with a thick moustache were there. I handed Murrell the sixpences in presence of the other clerk, who received forty of them, which he put into his pocket, at the same time taking some bad florins and shillings from his pocket, which he handed to Murrell. Whilst I was in the office I rubbed up the edges a some shillings and sixpences for both of them. At about 1/2 past 12 Murrel told me that another clerk was coming to fetch some bad money and said "We shall want a rare lot of things next week for the holidays." He meant bad money. He told me to bring as much as I could by Tuesday, and he would then tell me how much they wanted for the Whitsun holidays. I said "All right" Just before I left another clerk, tall, wearing a light coat, came in. I knew the time that Murrell came on duty. He had told me. On Tuesday, (nth), I went with 146 or 147 shillings for Murrell, but as he was not there when I arrived at 10 minutes to 2, I took a walk, and came back in about twenty minutes, when I went to the window and saw Murrell, who asked me if I had got them. I told him I had. He said "All right, give them to me." I said "Who is that man?" (meaning Campbell), who was then, talking to me of the railway men. He said "I don't know." I then took a ticket to King's Cross as a <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>, so that Campbell should not think anything was wrong. I then went and had my boots cleaned again, having had them cleaned once before, and waited for some time about the front of the station. I asked the porter (ticket collector), to let me go down the staircase to meet a young woman, and he allowed me to do so. I met my young woman (Annie Bolwell), who came by the next train. She was going to her sisters at Notting Hill. I told her there was something up which I did not like, and that I should want her to take something off the platform for me. I had hid the bad money in the watercloset when I first went down. I went and got it at 3 times, and put it into a bag which she was carrying, and told her to go and wait for me in the Edgware-road. She went upstairs and was followed by Campbell. I went up the stairs and into the Marylebone Road to Oxford Terrace and Notting Hill, where we remained till 8 o'clock. I returned to Edgware Road Station and saw Murrell, whom I asked if he had seen that man about since, and he said no. He asked me if I had got the things with me, and I said "No, not likely I'm going to bring the things up here, but if you will come out I'll get them." He said "1 am too busy to come out to-night, meet me to-morrow at the Angel, Islington, about 12 o'clock. I wish to state that had it not been for Murrell I should not have' commenced making counterfeit coin. He pressed me very much to do it, because I could not get from Smith sufficient to satisfy him, Smith having a lot of customers in London and the country. I have never supplied any one but Murrell since I have been making myself. Annie Bolwell is not to blame; she is a country girl, and did not know hardly what the meaning of it was. We were going to be married on Whit Monday. The banns are out at Waterloo church, and we have made all the arrangements for it. I</p>

               <p>Can describe the makers, but cannot give any addresses. Most of them have agents, and they don't give their addresses as they always meet by appointment. <hi rend="italic">Bill Smith</hi>, about 28 years old, height 5 feet 8 inches, sallow sunken cheeks, broad shoulders, lost half forefinger, left hand, makes sovereigns. He lives somewhere in Westminster. <hi rend="italic">Little Ben</hi>, about 3-4 years old, short and thin, black billy goat beard, large mouth, black eyes and hair; dress, pea jacket, tight trowsers; he was living somewhere near Clapham Junction, but is now in a coffee shop which he has taken. I don't know where. <hi rend="italic">Ted Kelly</hi>, aged 50, 5ft. 5in., bloated ruddy face, covered with scars from blows from fighting. Carries his right hand in his breast very often, and dresses in pilot coat and cord trousers, which are ragged. His wife makes as well. She is sallow, with very long face, about 50 years old, 5ft.,2in., dresses in black, or red shawl and black frock, walks quickly. <hi rend="italic">Harry Drake</hi>, age 40, 5ft. 6 or 7 in.

               <p>Keen has been in the service of the company three or four years—I have heard that he was at the Swiss Cottage Station and Moorgate Street, Baker Street, and several stations—I did not make out a list of the times that Keen was employed at the Edgware Road Station for the purposes of the company, but I sent in my sheet weekly—I did not say that the first week in May he was employed from 5 a.m. till 2 o'clock, it was the late date in the early part of May—I find that on May 4th Keen and another man were there from 5.15 ill 2 o'clock—that was quite right; these sheets puzzle me, they are my own—on May 1st Keen was on duty from 2 o'clock to 12.30, I can't say whether he was on duty on 2nd May, but I imagine he was, as I hare his time here—in the return sent to you he is not down at all; in that case it was his Sunday away—on 3rd May he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.20, the 4th May you have; on 5th, 6th, and 7th May he was there from 5.15 to 2 o'clock—he was there on duty on Sunday, 9th May, from 8 a.m. till 11.30 p.m., and on the 10th and 11th he was there from 2 o'clock till 12.30—in the last week in April he began on the 23rd, when he was there from 5.15 to 2 o'clock, and the same on the 24th and 25th—on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th, he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.30—on 16th April he was there from 2 o'clock to 12.30—on 14th April his time is not here, it is a blank, there-fore he would not be there, he was absent from some cause or other—on 12th May he came to the office at 2 o'clock just for half an hour and went away—I told him some one had been to see him—the person asked if I had any<lb/>body there named Murrell—I said "No"—he then said "Any body named Keen?"—I said "Yes, and he would be there at 2 o'clock, and he said he would call again—I told Keen that, and he asked me to describe the man, which I did—I had not then heard that Neave and Bolwell had been taken on the previous day—I am sometimes at the general manager's office and sometimes at the accountant's office—I can't say whether I was at the station on 28th April, I have no reference—if I was away the beer might be handed in without my knowing it—there is nothing to call to my mind whether I was there or not—they may have taken advantage of my absence to commit an irregularity—when I refused to let the officers in four of them were waiting—I had no idea that they came for anything but to apprehend Keen for debt—I did tell them to go to hell when they said they would go to the general manager, I was exasperated—I was auditor of the company at one time; I was transferred and I preferred remaining in the general manager's office—I heard of a clerk being discharged from Moorgate Street about some coin about January or February, I did not know him personally.</p>

I have Pleaded Guilty to this indictment—Bolwell has been living with me as my wife for about seven months—our banns had been published at the church in the Waterloo Road, and we were to have been married at the time I was taken into custody—I arrived at the Edgware Road Station, about 1.45 on the day in question, and saw Mr. Campbell looking at me—I went from there into the Edgware Road—I was there about twenty-five minutes—I came back and looked into the loophole where they take the tickets and I took a ticket—I came out again and went and had my boots cleaned and walked about for another quarter of an hour—I went down on the platform—I had the coin on me and I went</p>

               <p>up and put it into the watering place and waited there about a quarter of an hour, knowing that Bolwell was going to her sisters and I thought if she had a bag with her I would put them in her bag and ask her to take them with her—she arrived there when I had been there a quarter of an hour and I hung about for a quarter of an hour because I saw Mr. Lucas watching me—I went into the closet and brought them out and asked her for her bag and I put them into her bag and locked it—it had a key to it and I said "Take that for me and go and wait for me in the Edgware Road"—she said "I am going to my sisters"—I said "But you go and wait for me in the Edgware Road—Mr. Campbell then followed her and I came up about five minutes afterwards, and Mr. Lucas was following me, but when he saw I was looking at him he turned back and went on the platform again—we then went into the Uxbridge Road, where I took the bag from her, and had it with me until 8 o'clock that evening when I came back to the Edgware Road, and put it under a gateway and told her to go home—I then went to the office window to Keen and asked him whether he would take the things—he said "No"—I afterwards went home to Millwood Road, and when I got to Loughborough Junction X met Bolwell, and gave her the bag—I then went home and found the constables in the house—she came home afterwards with the bag—she did not know what I had given her—the packets were done up in paper and she did not see them when I made counterfeit coin—she generelly used to go to my aunts and while she was out I used to do it—she was in the habit of paying visits to her sister—she knew nothing about the coin which was found under the mattress—the bed was not made—there are two beds besides the mattress and it was under the second one—right in the middle and when I came in I found somebody had been there before me and the constables knew the exact spot where the things were.</p>

I am a wine merchant at 413, Wands-worth Road—about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, 7th July, I was awakened by a noise—I got out of bed, went to the window, and pulled up the blind—I saw the prisoner in Mr. Neal's, the watchmaker, lobby, oppo<lb/>site—I saw her cross the road, towards the house, and smash the windows—she smashed the last window, very high; therefore it was maliciously done, and not for the purpose of taking anything—I saw three bottles at the station, which were my property—they had been filled with water for three years and were in the window—a green blind was drawn down in front of the window, so the prisoner could not have seen those bottles when she broke the window—all three windows were smashed; the whole front was smashed—every pane was broken—the first was smashed low, so that she could put her hand through; the second was higher, and the third very high indeed—I saw the prisoner at the station; I also saw there a dummy bottle of still hock—the prisoner said "Master, you sell very bad stuff"—she was not drunk at the time—I rather felt for the woman, and suggested to Mr. Bridge that she should be examined by a medical man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accoutrement maker, and now reside at Arundel Street—early in the morning of the 7th June I, with my wife and friend, were proceeding towards Waterloo Bridge—we came up Waterloo Steps and were going towards the bridge, when Rolfe pushed up against my wife and she turned round and said "Where are you pushing to?"—I said "Come on, take no notice, let us go home," and with that we walked up towards the bridge—I sent my friends through the tell-tale and paid the toll with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and was taking my change, when Rolfe calls me towards him and says "I want you"—I said "What do you want of me?" so I goes towards him and the moment I went towards he hits me in the mouth and makes a snatch at my chain and run off—I ran after him—he turned round Waterloo Steps and waited, and the moment I turned round the steps he had hold of me just by the ankles and threw me on the back of the head and then he got on me—I was partly stunned then, and he hit me with something over the eye—I could not tell what with, but I could feel something like going into my flesh—it did not seem like a blow with the fist—I knew no more until I found myself in Dr. Farris's surgery opposite—the constable brought the prisoner in there—I recognised him immediately—I fainted twice from loss of blood going to the station—I suffered very much from it—I never laid a hand on him, never said a wrong word to the man, much less struck him.</p>

In the early morning of 7th June I heard a cry of "Stop him?"—I heard some one running very fast—I went towards where he was coming, and heard some one turn in the Chamberlain's Yard—there area great number of stables and workshops there, and in a small stable behind a workshop I saw the prisoner behind a manger and a horse in front of him—I caught hold of him and told him I wanted him—he said "What for?"—I said "I do not know"—I brought him out and from what I heard I took him to Dr. Fair's in the Waterloo Road—he had no coat on, he was in his shirt sleeves, and he had blood on his shirt—I found the prosecutor at Dr. Farr's and he said to him "Why did you serve me like this, what have I done to you that you should serve me in this manner?" or words to that effect—the prosecutor's wife was there and a friend and two or three females and they were crying and making a great noise and I could not exactly catch all the prisoner said, but he said to him "She pushed me against the wall and <hi rend="italic">bashed</hi> my hat in," or "crushed my hat in"—I could not exactly catch the word—I then took off his hat which is a hard felt, and there was no bruise on it, none whatever, and then at the sugges<lb/>tion of Dr. Farr I took him into the surgery, where the prosecutor was being dressed, and there Br. Farr examined his hands—on his way to the station he said "I would have fought them all if they would have come one at a time"—he made no answer to the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in practice at Waterloo Bridge—the pro<lb/>secutor was brought into me early on the morning of the 7th June—there was a large cut wound, a scalp wound, at the back of the head about 1 1/2 inches long—there was a gaping wound over the right eye which it was necessary to sew up, and there was a similar wound over the left eye, besides other bruises about the face, and on the day following when be came to have his wounds dressed there were distinct marks on the throat, bruises, giving me the impression that this must have been caused by a grip of the throat—the wound at the back of the head would probably be caused by a fall,</p>

I was with the last witness when the prisoner came into the shop and called out "Anyone at home"—he knocked several times—the landlady said "No, the governor is not in"—he aid "Where is he?"—she said "I do not expect him in for some time"—he said "I have a bit of corn to take care of, I will be back in about 10 minutes"—he threw it on a stool and left—in about 10 minutes he came back—I then went up to the sack and questioned him</p>

               <p>about it, and found not corn but bacon—he said it had been left for him at the Eight Bells to take it to a house in Lorrimore Square to a man named Benedick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 72, Thames Street, Greenwich—I identify the piece of bacon as the property of my employer by the cut of it—I cut it myself—I last saw it about 4 o'clock last Saturday week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a peculiar cut—we have a large number of sides of bacon in our warehouse—perhaps a hundred, but we only have forty sides of this kind every week—until Sergeant Rock came I was not aware that we had lost any—this I positively swear is one of three sides we had.</p>
