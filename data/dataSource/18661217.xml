                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 904). On Sunday, 14th October, I went with Sergeant Moss and others to search Moses's premises, in conse<lb/>quence of a complaint he made of being robbed—we went to ascertain the state of the premises, and to get evidence of what he complained of—I had been in the next warehouse the day before about the same thing—Moses's warehouse consists of a cellar, a ground floor, and an upper warehouse—it adjoins a warehouse of a similar kind, which was empty—it is in Black Horse Yard, Petticoat Lane—there is a name up, Moses Moses, dealer in marine stores—we examined the warehouse adjoining, and found a hole had been made through the brickwork into Moses's warehouse—we then went to Moses's warehouse to see the hole on that side, and on removing some rags near the hole, we discovered an eardrop and some gold brooches and pins near the hole—we made further search and found two saddles, some silver<lb/>plated goods, military bridles, portmanteaus, and numerous other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—both these saddles were under some tons of rags—here is the name of Whippy and Steggall, North Audley Street, on them, and under the flap is the name of Captain Bradford—they are both quite new, and were then in better condition than they are now—this portmanteau was about two yards from the saddles, under the rags—you could only see the rags—it is quite new—there has been a plate on it, which has been taken off—the strap of the lock has been cut, and it has been forced open—I have tried this plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the portmanteau, and it precisely fits—it bears the name of Edmund Webb—the maker is</p>

               <p>my opinion that the rags had been cleared away by the person who had got into the premises—the articles on each side did not appear to have been disturbed—there was a great deal of pepper put among the rags to keep moths from them, and it was not a very agreeable job—we found this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Moses's warehouse; he said nothing about it.</p>

Whippy and Steggall, but they came into another department—they went to the Docks with the case I sent out—I did not see them go—I know that one case was received—the shipping clerk is here—I ordered this portmanteau from Mr. Southgate for Mr. Webb, and directed him to put "Edmund Webb" on the plate—this is the plate—I put several books into the portmanteau, and some address cards—there were four books in it when I saw it, <hi rend="italic">The Memoirs of Count Gram<lb/>mont, Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful, Ayton's——, and the Douay Bible</hi>, and I find them still in it—I also put into it some glycerine soap, some bottles of hair wash and tooth powder, eleven fancy ties, two soap boxes, three boxes of patent gun oil, and there was a collar box, which was an enclosure for Captain Bradford from a friend of his—I procured those for Mr. Lovett and Mr. E.H.S. Croix, and the different articles are marked E.W., S.C., and C.L.—they were delivered to James Danks to send to the Docks.</p>

Smith and Elder some goods for the East India Docks—the prisoner Blake was the foreman; he had a horse and cart—I remember his return that evening—I did not ask him whether he had left them, but I have booked the cases as delivered, and he gave me this toll ticket—he told me he had booked twelve cases—there were thirteen, but my foreman took one to St. Katherine's Docks, and Blake went with the rest to the East and West India Docks—this is the book; I have written in it from his dictation: "Cart, thirteen packages East India Dock, one St. Catherine Dock, by E. Bowley, toll 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—about the 20th October I said to Blake, "You recollect the robbery of Moses?"—he paused a moment, and said, "I think I do"—I said, "It appears there is some property found there which was in the cases which you took from Smith and Elder's to the Docks, I want you to think it over whether yon gave anybody a ride or stopped to have any beer; think it over and let me know in the morning"—he promised to do so, but I never saw him again till I saw him in custody four or five days afterwards at the Mansion House—I did not employ him regularly—he was only odd man—I used to find him on the stand in Houndsditch—after I spoke to him I did not see him on the stand.</p>

               <p>seven standing there, but I know he is the man I employed that day, because of my entry, in which here is his name, "Blake"—goods sent to the Docks are sometimes two hours, and sometimes three hours before they are shipped—he was away three hours and a half that day—I have booked it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale manufacturing jeweller, of 23, Wilderness Row, Clerkenwell—in October last I had a traveller named George Owen—he was with me six or seven months—on the 18th October I entrusted him with between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery to take out to customers to effect sales if he could—he ought to have re<lb/>turned the same evening with the property, but did not—I communicated with the police, and issued the handbill—his father, who is a very honest man, came to me on the following evening, and made a communication to me as to what his son had done, and restored to me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was all I saw either of the jewellery or the proceeds until the police found these gold chains (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are thirty eight gold chains, and a piece of a chain which has been cut in two—these are some of the property which the lad Owen took out—they correspond in pattern, weight, and in every respect—he had many more than these—he had about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of gold chains—we generally weigh them before sending them out—the value of these is about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 7, Britannia Street, Gray's Inn Road—I am now a milk carrier—on the 18th October I was in the service of Mr. Humphreys—I carried out a quantity of jewellery of his that day on foot—I met with a man I had known some little time, and he induced me to go away with him—he said he knew a party in London that would buy it—I met him at a music hall in John Street—he had said that to me several times before I took notice of it—he knew in whose service I was—in con<lb/>sequence of what he said to me some little time afterwards I went with him to his house where he lodged, and he made an arrangement with two men—they came there while we were there—I should know them again—they had weights—one came in first while the other waited outside—the one that came in first weighed all the jewellery, and gave 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he called in the other man from outside, and he had the money—the man that induced me to go away took up half of the money—his name is Curran—I took the other half—the man that weighed the jewellery took it away—</p>

               <p>Curran went and got a cab, and we went to Ludgate Hill Station and went by train to Dover—when we got there Curran made some excuse, and got out of the train, and I have never seen him since—I stayed at Dover that night, and thought it over, and made up my mind to come back next morning, and go to my master—I went to my father first, and he went to my master—I restored the.50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a quantity of chains among the fifty I had—I know them, because there was one that I wore myself—this is it (<hi rend="italic">selecting it</hi>)—I am quite sure this was among those I sold—when I went to Dover it was with the idea of going to New Zealand.</p>

I am in the employ of the Mint—on 24th No<lb/>vember, about three o'clock p.m., I went to 23, Dunk Street, Mile End New Town, with Sergeant Elliott and Doughty—we were admitted to the front parlour by the landlady, and shortly afterwards saw Dean come down stairs and go out—I followed him with Doughty to the middle of the street, and said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, you are suspected of being in that house for the purpose of coining; what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing; what house?"—I said, "You must come back"—we took him into the house and forced him into the front parlour—I then asked Cowell what she had about her—she held her left hand out, which contained a little leather purse—from the action of her arm under her shawl I seized her right hand, and found this packet, containing seven counterfeit crowns, hot, in an unfinished state—I said, "Oh! this is what you mean, is it?"—she said, "What?"—I said, "This is counterfeit coin, you must account for the possession of it"—she said, "I found it"—I said, "Very well"—I left Doughty and Elliott in charge of the prisoners, went up to the second floor front room, and on the top of a cupboard found this earthenware pipkin, hot, and three warm pads, which are used for holding the moulds—there was a clear bright fire in the room—Inspector Broad said, "Look here," and showed me this plaister of Paris mould, which was hot, and these three counterfeit crowns, also hot, wrapped up in this black rag—there was nothing in the mould—the crowns are un<lb/>finished and of the same date as those we had down stairs—going to the station Carter said, "Oh! Mr. Brannan, it is that villain <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>; you know he has put many a score away"—I said, "What you say it is my duty to repeat to the Magistrate"—she said, "I will tell the Magistrate all about it myself; you know he is a great villain; they sent me out for a long errand, and while I was gone they made these things, and when I came back they were made"—Cowell might have heard that, but to the best of my belief Dean could not, as she did not speak very loud—after they were locked up I went with Inspector Broad and other officers to 19, Gun</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a merchant, and manage the London business of Francis and James Rickett, of Hull, at No. 149, Upper Thames Street—the prisoner was one of our travellers—he was mostly engaged in town, but occasionally in the suburbs and near home—his duty was to receive orders when in town, and to receive orders and money out of town—his salary was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and a commission—I believe his income from us was nearly 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and we also gave him permission to sell on commission for Collier and Sons, the cocoa and chocolate makers—the commission we allowed him was on orders—if they turned out bad he would forfeit his commission upon them—we credited him with his commission upon orders sent in to us, and where the debt was proved to be bad we redebited it to him—he would be away some three or four days on the Oxford journey—it was his duty to pay over the money he received, as soon as he returned, to Mr. Priestman, our cashier—there was a commission account between us—on the 24th October I was sent for by the prisoner to the station—I had previously given orders for his apprehension—I went and saw him—I cannot charge my memory with anything particular that he said—he said nothing about this account of Messrs. Primes, or any other—he called my attention more especially to his wife and children—he gave a sort of general denial of having taken our moneys—Mr. Priest<lb/>man had all the money transactions with him.</p>

Dear Sir,—We are sorry that you did not come to the office, as usual, this morning. The recently discovered irregularities in your practice while conducting our business make it needful for us to dispense with your services. We have left directions with Mr. Priestman to place one week's salary in advance to the credit of your account, so that you are dismissed from to-day from our employ. We have given directions to have your commission account worked up as soon as pos<lb/>sible, and should we not discover any further accounts received by you and not accounted for the difference will not be great; still we fear we shall have to call upon you for some few pounds due to us." It was after that I saw him—the "few pounds due" refers to the commission account—the whole amount of his defalcations is not included in this indictment—there is only one indictment—I am not in the prosecutor's service now—I left because it suited me to go into business on my own account—Mr. Wallis has been aware for twelve months past that I was looking out for a business, and I had his permission to leave at any time I wished—it had nothing to do with these transactions—I left about a month after this was discovered—I am now in business for myself—the prisoner re<lb/>ceived about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the last year he was with us—he had to collect a good many small accounts—he has a wife and children.</p>

I said, "Never mind, I am here, and you will have to go with me"—he said, "Had you been ten minutes longer I should not have been here"—he said he would not go with me, as I had no authority to take him—I told him if he did not go with me I would call in a man in uniform, and he could compel him to go—he then said, "Well, as it has come to this, I will go and see it out"—on the way to Bishopsgate he asked me where I was going to take him to—I took him to Mr. Russell's office, as I did not know what the charge would be, stealing or receiving—he said, "I did not steal it; I know who did, and I knew it was wrong when I had it; I have brought disgrace upon my wife and family, and had I known I should</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a certificate as second mate—I got it in 1863 when I passed my examination at the Board of Trade—on 22nd August, 1864, I joined the <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> as second mate—the prisoner was the captain, Mr. Parker was the first mate, and there were sixteen hands, including the captain and everybody—we were bound for Japan, then to Hong Kong, Singapore, and ultimately for New York—no particular unpleasantness took place till we got to Singapore, but we had words occasionally—the captain did not treat me anything out of the way till then, but he and the first mate were having words every day, and the first mate left at Swatow—the captain then made me first mate, and I served as such till we got to Singapore—when we got there some sailors went ashore and complained to the Consul of the captain's treatment, and the captain came on board in the evening and said that people thought him a good deal in the wrong, and he must think himself lucky if he got off clear—he asked me if I remembered if ever he struck the men—I told him Yes, and kicked them too—he said he did not remember it, and said, "You had better come on shore as a witness"—I said, "I cannot go ashore to take a false oath for any one," and I did not—I do not know whether he made a cross charge against the men, as I did not go ashore, but I believe they were put in prison—I remained on the vessel till we left Singapore; but before we left I had words with the captain occasionally, and he told me I could leave if I liked—that was after I had refused to go as a witness—I told him the ship was going to London, and I wanted to get home to London—when he left Singapore he said that they would not clear the ship out with me as chief officer, because I had not a chief officer's ticket, and I took my second mate's ticket, and Mr. Dyson was put on as chief mate, and After that the captain was breeding disturbances with me every day about something, finding fault with what I got done—on 9th May he told me to alter a seizen that was up on the mizen rigging—I said if he would show me what he wanted done I would take it off, and put it on the way he wanted it—he called me a d—young fool, and said that I was not worth my position, and that I should go in the forecastle along with the men; that is being disrated—we had two passengers on board, and, as I had good papers and good characters, I said that any one could look at the seizen, if it was wrong—the captain called one of the passengers, Captain Clifford, who looked at it, but said nothing—the captain then came and said if I did not apologise I should go in the forecastle—I was to apologise for putting it on in that way—I told him I could not apologise when it was right, and he told me to go in the forecastle—I went there, and was reduced to the rank of an ordinary seaman—that was about a month after we left Singapore—he had been finding fault with me almost every day, and finding fault with my steering—when we were clewing up sails he would give orders for something else, and would call the man down from the rigging and send me up, telling me he would take my smartness out of me—he found fault with me every day till 14th June, when he called me a thief and a</p>

               <p>liar, and said that I had stolen a pound from the ship, a thing that is for putting on the sails, but he afterwards found that it was below—it was my watch below, and he abused me, called me a thief, and said that I had flung it overboard—during that time one of the men was taken sick, who said that he had removed the pound and put it under the companion ladder—I told the mate, and the mate took it out—on 15th June I was on the quarter-deck repairing sails, the captain was abusing me, and told me to put chafing on the foresail, and said that I should get it done before dark—I wanted a pound to do it with, and while some one had gone to get me one he told me to go to Tom for some rope yarn—I asked him which Tom, and he pushed me down and called a man to secure me, as I refused duty—I said that I had not, but I went aft with the mate—the man would not touch me—he said, "He has not refused duty, Sir"—the captain put irons on my hands, and took me by the throat, and knocked my head two or three times against the bulkhead of the cabin, and nearly choked me—he then put me down the lazarette under the cabin floor—there is a hole about two feet square under the cabin table which leads to it—it is part of the hold of the vessel—there were some cases there, and ropes and casks, and part of the cargo—it is about five feet high, I could not stand [upright, and the lower part is about four feet long—there was a cargo on board, pepper, hides, and gambia—the vapour from the hides and cargo came through—it was quite wet every morning, and I could hardly breathe—the hatch was put over me corner ways the first time, so as to leave a very small hole—that was the only mode of my getting air, as I only got air from the cabin—the mate went on deck—the captain kept in the cabin, and commenced abusing me, calling me everything that was bad, telling me that I would not get out of his way at Singapore when he wanted me to, and he did not care a d—if he had to pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my back, he would have a game with me—he had not alluded to that before—he was half an hour abusing me, and I got alarmed—I was fastened in at night, and found the irons were too large large for me, and about six o'clock I took them off, when the steward brought me my tea—I told him I intended to get up when I had a chance, and when I got the irons off I got up by raising myself, and got out and hid myself in the forecastle, and shortly after the captain presented a revolver at my head and said, "You beggar, I will shoot you"—I was behind a water tank then, and the mate was holding a lamp—I heard him searching for me, and calling out—I saw the light when he presented the revolver—I told the mate that the captain had threatened me—the captain said again that he would pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my back—I was frightened, and the mate said, "Come aft, Bryant, I will watch you and protect you"—I then went into the cabin—the captain put the irons on my hands again, took hold of me by the throat again, and knocked my head against the bulkhead—I could hardly breathe, and I sang out, "Murder"—the captain abnsed me, and put me in the lazarette again with the irons, on my hands—he then called the mate, who came and put another pair of irons on my feet—I slept there that night—they put the hatch over corner ways, and fastened it by nails I believe—if it had been put on square it would have been stifling—the best thing would have been to have had it off altogether, and the worst to have had it on square, because it fits like a wedge—I slept on the cases and ropes—I remained there three or four days in irons—the captain had a grating-hatch made on the second day, which was fastened over with a wooden bar, and lashed down—the irons were kept on my</p>

               <p>hands and feet three or four days—I took them off on the second day when the steward brought me my breakfast—I could take them off easily, they were so large, but I could not take them off my legs, they were too tight—the captain came and asked if I had taken the irons off—I told him I had taken them off my hands to eat my breakfast—he said he would find a way to keep them on—he went away, and came back in a few minutes and came down with a claw-hammer—he had a revolver sticking in the waistband of his trousers—he asked me for the irons—I gave them to him—he said, "Put your hands behind you"—I said, "I cannot have that done, Sir, I will not take them off my hands only to eat my food"—I resisted—he called two men down, who pretended to try, but did not succeed, so I had them put on in front—while this was going on the captain struck me on the arm with the revolver, and on the face with his fist, in the presence of Charles Thomberg and Thomas Renough, the second mate, who took my place—the captain said he would lash me up, and he got a rope down, put it round my body two or three times, and one of the men put it round the sternpost and pulled the block out—the captain then got the carpenter to put a staple in—I told the captain I should see what law would do for me—he said there was no law for me, he had the law in his own hands—he put the rope round my body and then went up—I remained three or four days with the irons on, and was down there nine days before I was taken on deck—I complained of my eyes being sore, and then the captain allowed the steward to take the hatch off in the daytime—the pepper and vapour affected my eyes, and they are affected now—I remained in the lazarette twenty-eight days, and during the latter portion of that time I was taken on deck, sometimes for an hour and a half, and sometimes two hours a day—I had to walk up and down the deck in the middle of the day with the sun right over head, when we were in the tropics, and passing St. Helena—the heat was very great there—I was then taken ill, and could hardly walk, and when I went on deck one evening for air the captain would not allow me to sit where I wanted—he caught hold of me and said I should not sit there, and pushed me down—I told him I could not walk, and he said he would lash me up and make me walk—I could only walk by catching hold of the rigging—I was taken to the store-room and confined there till we got to New York, sixty-seven or sixty-eight days—the captain then summoned me to appear before the British Consul—I was not on deck for nineteen days before we got to New York—I told the Consul I had been falsely imprisoned, and that the captain had ill treated me—I came across in the first steamer to get redress, and was put to the expense of paying my passage from New York—I had not been guilty of any conduct more than I have told you of—a log was kept on board the vessel—the captain read something to me from it, and I told him that it was not correct—I contradicted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Singapore, or any other place, did any one of the crew refuse to continue on the vessel with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They offered the captain three months to get away because they could not stop, he kept calling them thieves—they did not refuse to stop with me that I know of—Parker left the vessel at Swatow—I did not hear that he refused to remain on board while I was kept on board—I had words with him, but I did not strike him—the two I struck were discharged at Swatow I believe—I was never drunk on the way out—I swear that I do not recollect Renough going to my birth to call me when I was so drunk that he could not wake me up—I do not recollect the captain giving orders for hauling down some of the sails on the rigging at Singapore—I did not refuse to obey his order—Renough acted as second mate at Singapore—he did not tell me what orders the captain had given, nor did I say to Renough, "Go to b—, and let him come and tell me himself"—the crew were taken out of prison after they had been four weeks at Singapore, and asked if they would go on board again, and they said no, they would not go with that captain—that was not in consequense of me being there that I know of—the disrating was on 9th May—the captain told me to alter two seizens that were put on—I did not refuse to do it in the way he desired—he said they were on wrong and ordered me to go forward—I had put them on to the best of my judgment—I have been at sea thirteen years—I did not use insolent language, I told him that was the way the others were on, and he called me a d—young fool and a b—fool—he said they were not right—I said, "Tell me the way to do it and I will do it," and then he went below for a few minutes, after which he surveyed the seizen and said if I did not apologise I should go in the forecastle—I suppose that was what I was to apologise for—I told him that I had nothing to apologise for that I knew of, and then he sent</p>

We also beg to state, on a great many occasions previous to date he did use most abusive and insulting language to the master, and also constantly made use of the most threatening language to the crew, and on several occasions struck and bit them most unmercifully; that on one occasion he struck the chief officer on the deck whilst on duty; that afterwards, while being re<lb/>primanded by the master for said offences and forbidden to repeat them under penalty of being punished by the British Consul at Swatow, he</p>

               <p>became neglectful of his duty; and whilst at Singapore he stole some brandy and gin from the cuddy stores and gave it to the crew, and thereby made them disorderly, and advised them to refuse duty and demand their discharge, which they did, and in consequence were sent to imprisonment; and also that he went on shore much against the master's wishes, and whilst his services were much required, the vessel being about to haul into dock; that on that evening he was much the worse for liquor, and again returned on shore, and on next morning there was nobody to assist in hauling the ship out of dock; and, therefore, in consequence of all this, and seeing his insubordinate conduct, I, the master, have disrated him as an unfit person to have charge of second mate's duty <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this read over to you, something which happened on 15th June?"We, the undersigned, beg to state that on this day the master was com<lb/>pelled to put A. Bryant in irons for refusal of duty and threatening to strike the master, and for continued insubordination and disorderly con<lb/>duct, and inducing others of the crew to refuse and neglect duty, thereby impeding the progress of the voyage and safety of the ship; that a few hours after his confinement he broke open the store-room, in which he was confined, and by some means got the irons off his hands. On discovery of this I, the master, fearing that he had gone forward to induce the crew to mutiny, ordered the four firearms to be ready, and went in search of him, and after an hour's search (the crew refusing to state where he was) we found him stowed away in the lower forecastle behind a water tank. I then ordered him to be put in double irons, and put him again in the store-room and extra fastened it. He positively refused to give up the irons he had on, and swore he did not know where they were. This morning A.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the charge against you was before the Consul at New York? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not remember hearing the word "insubordination" mentioned—there was a little mentioned, but no specific charge—the name of no seaman was mentioned to me as a person who I tried to make insubordinate—the Consul refused to go into it—he said he was tired out with these things—he said it was very strange that captains and officers could not agree, and recomended me to settle it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi>—on 16th June, between nine and ten in the morning, I was sent for to the lazarette and found the captain, Renough (who acted as second mate), and Bryant, who was in irons—I saw the captain trying to get Bryant's hands behind him, and he asked me to lend him a hand—I did so—I got hold of Bryant's left hand, and the captain tried to get his other hand behind him, but could not—he then took his revolver out of his belt and struck Bryant on the shoulder, and then struck him again with his fist in his face—the captain said that he tried to bite him—Bryant said, "I did not bite you, Sir; you cannot show any mark"—I did not look at the captain's hand—it was a dark place, and I could not have seen if there had been a mark—it was pretty hot down there, I should not like to live there myself—an ordinary<lb/>sized man could not stand upright there at that time, because there were two bales of sugar, two barrels, and a few coils of rope—I noticed a little offensive smell from the cargo, which was pepper, hides, and gambia—the carpenter was sent for and told to drive some staples in the ship's side to make Bryant fast to—I was not out with them during the whole voyage, I joined them at Singapore—I think the captain and Bryant could not agree very well together at the time he was mate—the captain told him if he did not shut up he would send him forward—Bryant said he knew how to do do his work as well as any other man—I heard that the captain struck other men, but I only saw him strike one—they called him Mack—it was about eight o'clock one morning—he was called on deck, and the captain said that they were four points out, and we were close between two islands—it was my wheel at eight o'clock, and we were singing out, "Haul in the fore brace"—we did so, and when we were coming off the captain looked at the compass and said we were four points off the course—he said, "Undo the main brace," and then he struck the man at the wheel with his fist, but when I looked we were two points and a half off—I remember Bryant escaping from his chains and hiding himself behind the tank, I was then in my bunk—the captain came to me—he had a pistol in his hand, and he looked in the bunk—I think the captain struck Mack twice—that was with his hand—I cannot tell whether he had anything in his hand or not, but the man fell down—he knocked him down at the wheel.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>he refused, and the captain, who was behind me, said, "Come out, or I will shoot you"—he came out after the captain went on deck, and I took him to the lazarette—he was then ironed on his legs, but not on his hands, as the irons were too large to fit his hands—he had plenty to eat and drink, and was treated in every respect as if he had been on deck—he had the same provisions as the rest of the crew—he had daily exercise, and was supplied with books and writing materials—he never made any com<lb/>plaint to me while he was in the lazarette of being there—when he came up on deck for exercise his manner towards the captain and passengers was very insulting—I was chief officer, and the captain talked to me about the necessity of confining him, and in my opinion it was necessary for the safety of the ship—I stated so to the captain at the time.</p>

'—Bryant said, 'Yes,' and made some observation about his having been falsely imprisoned by the captain—the captain replied, ‘If I had not done so the control of the ship would have been taken from me'—I asked Bryant's solicitor if he intended to take any proceeding against the captain—he said no; if he were discharged, and his wages were paid, that would put an end to the matter—Bryant made some further observa<lb/>tion about his having been hardly treated by the master—the solicitor said, 'Never mind that; now the matter is settled, we need not go further into it'—I asked Bryant again if he was content to take his discharge, and told the master to prepare his account and his discharge, and so the case ended—the captain wished the witnesses to be examined—I said there was no necessity of going further into it—the prosecutor was in the office some two or three days afterwards, and there was some question about his wages—the captain thought he ought not to pay his wages in full, and I said he ought not to raise any objection now, as the matter had been settled by his solicitor—I had no complaint from Bryant.</p>

I have no one in the world to help me; my father is dead, my mother is a poor woman in the country. It is a shame the father does nothing to the child. It has been in the hands of the lawyers for months, and yet nothing is done. I intended to have stopped with her, I wish now I had done so, and then there would have been an end to us both"—I asked her where she got the alum water from—she said she had it for a long time—she had said in answer to the constable that it was alum water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist—Mrs. Brown brought me this frock and mantle—I examined it and discovered stains—on the jacket there was a white crystalline deposit down the front—I tasted it with my tongue, and found it extremely acid—it was not alum—in my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170051"/>
               <p>opinion it was oxalix acid—I looked at it from a powerful magnifying glass, and from the appearance of the crystal I said it was oxalic acid, but it might have been salt of sorrel—both of those are poisons, and the crystals very nearly resemble each other—oxalic acid is used for cleaning coppers, and salt of sorrel for removing stains and iron-mould from linen—the stains on the frock were consistent with one or other of these poisons—it would produce a burning sensation in the mouth and a strong acid taste—I should say about a drachm, that is sixty grains, would be sufficient to cause the death of a child six years old—the effect of an overdose would be vomiting—I looked at the child's throat, and found it unusually red, and the lips were very dry and parched—she said it had burnt her, but she did not feel it much then—alum would not produce such an appear<lb/>ance as I saw—alum is used for gargles—it would crystallise, but the crystals would be very much larger than those I saw—these were very fine needle-like crystals—crystallised alum would not be at all acid in its taste—it is a natural salt, there is no acid in it—the appearances I saw were quite consistent with the administration either of oxalic acid or salt of sorrel, and likely to be caused by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you apply any test? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the ground of my opinion was the examination of the stains and crystals through the magnifying glass, and also the taste—there are a great many acids, some varying very little from others in description—they have all their own peculiar character—there are many fluid acids, but oxalic acid has a very peculiar and marked crystal, which I detected through my glass—there is another acid a good deal like it, which is gallic acid, but that is so intensely styptic that it would not have produced the effect—I am not prepared to say there is no other acid that would—the crystals of alum are very large and awkward lumps—the stains on the dress were on the front part—they were not crystals—they were red stains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain why there should be crystals on the upper part of the dress, and stains on the lower? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only explain it in this way, that it was the bottom of the vessel that contained the acid, and that the crystalline deposit fell on the jacket, and the fluid on the skirt—the whole of the crystal might not have been dissolved in the fluid—there may have been a deposit in the bottle, and that deposit might have been in the glass—I would not say it might not be caused by some other acid, because almost every day there are fresh acids discovered; there may be many which I do not know—I am a chemist and druggist, not an analytical chemist.</p>

                  </hi>, MDI live at Wellington House, Wellington. Terrace, St. John's Wood—on 16th November I examined this frock and jacket, and the child—I observed some stains on the frock, and a crystalline deposit on the jacket—my impression was that they were crystals of oxalic acid, and the stain on the frock I thought to be the same—in order to solve the doubt, I dissolved a portion of oxalic acid in water, and produced a stain on the frock precisely similar to the one I have seen—I did not try whether I could produce the crystals on the jacket—my impression is that it was undissolved crystal—neither of them could be produced by alum—I tried alum, and it would produce no stain whatever—it would fix a colour, but not remove it—I tasted it, and it had a very acid taste—I examined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186612170052"/>
               <p>the child the following day—her lips were very parched and dry—the lining membrane of the cheek, and the whole of the mouth, extending right to the back of the throat, was very red and inflamed—that would be likely to be produced by oxalic acid, but certainly not by alum water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that alum water and peppermint mixed make a gargle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not—alum water is used for gargle—when I produced the stain on the frock the acid did not crystallise—it is not usual for it to do so—it depends on the strength of the solution—in an ordinary solution of oxalic acid you would not expect any crystals—a given quantity of water takes up a given quantity of acid—there are other acids that would produce the same appearance; sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and muriatic acid—they are liquids—oxalic acid is a very deadly poison if taken in large quantities, a wineglass would be fatal—it is used for the purpose of cleaning coppers—whether the solution would be fatal would depend on the strength of it—I have known death ensue from oxalio acid after vomiting—many take it and their lives are sacrificed without vomiting at all.</p>

I am a labourer, of 21, Daglish Street, Limehouse—on 27th November, about ten o'clock, I was going along the Glengalk Road—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner sprang out from a wall, struck me on the side of the head with his fist, and knocked me down—he called out, "Come on, we have got him now"—five or six men came up and got on top of me, kicked me, rifled my pockets, and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my waistcoat pocket, and my purse and a sovereign and a half out of my trousers pocket—after that one of them kicked me in the side—they then all ran away, and I got up and said, “ It's no use running away, for I know some of you “—several of them then turned upon me and I ran away—the prisoner was one of them—I knew him before, when he was potman at the George—he left there on the Monday before for being drunk, or something of the sort—I found a policeman in twenty minutes, who told me to go to the George next morning—I did go on Wednesday, the 28th, and found the prisoner sitting in the taproom—I then went to the station and gave information, and two policemen came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons at King's College Hospital—on Saturday night, 10th November, Connell was brought there about half-past ten—on removing his trousers I found he had lost a good deal of blood, and discovered a triangular wound in the left groin—I introduced my finger, but I could not feel the bottom of it—I did not use my forceps; it would have been dangerous—he was drunk—I then took him into the hospital and had him put to bed at once—the wound was dressed, and I kept him in some twelve days and then dis<lb/>charged him—in my judgment the wound was formed by the knife being pressed into the wound, and in drawing it out, while still in the wound, it had been twisted—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this knife—it was a very severe wound—I compared the knife the next day with the wound and with the hole of the trousers, and found that they exactly corresponded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 15, White's Yard, St. Luke's, in the employ of Mr. Axford—I know the prisoner by sight—on 1st Decem<lb/>ber, about one o'clock midnight, I went into the Red Lion public-house, at corner of Bath Street, Old Street, with a friend, John Tibbett, who had been drinking, and was evidently drunk—I told him to take care of him<lb/>self, as he was in rather queer company—I did not mean the prisoner, but the woman who was with him—the prisoner asked me if I was a policeman, or a <hi rend="italic">copper's mark</hi>, which means a spy—I said that I was neither one nor the other—my friend was hustled by the two women and tried to leave, and the prisoner put his back against the door—I do not know whether the women were with him—they were talking to others as well—I asked the prisoner to let me go by, he refused and I shoved him on one side—the woman he cohabits with caught hold of me and scratched my face—I tried to get away, she made a kick at me and fell—she caught me by the jacket and pulled me down with her—she was drunk—as I fell the prisoner came behind me and stabbed me two blows—I hallooed out that I was stabbed, and he deliberately pulled the knife out and put it in his pocket—the second blow went through my clothes and a handkerchief into my hip-bone—I fell down insensible—I was taken home and Dr. Jarrow attended me—when we first went into the public-house the prisoner was exhibiting a knife four or five inches long, with a black handle, something like a Spanish knife—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner was not sober.</p>

I am barman at the Red Lion, Old Street, St. Luke's—on 1st December Trahers came in with a friend—the prisoner spoke to him by the private entrance—he came round from the big box into the private box, and forced himself into their company—of course they told him they did not wish to have anything to do with him, they did not want him there—the prisoner said, "I do not wish to have anything to do with you"—Trahers said that he did not care for him, he would fight anybody in the room—the prisoner said, "I am only a boy to you, I cannot fight you"—the prosecutor's friend went out, and he was going to follow him, but the prisoner stood against the door—he pushed it open and they both went outside together, and I saw no more of it—I saw a woman, but she did not interfere inside—I cannot say that the prisoner was exactly sober, he was capable of taking care of himself, and the prosecutor was about the same—I saw no blow struck by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling inspector to the General Post Office—in consequence of communications made to me about the London and Ipswich line, on Saturday, 1st September, I made up a letter containing a half-sovereign put on a card, twelve penny postage stamps, and a written note—I put them in an envelope addressed to Mrs. Wat<lb/>noughby, Scole Inn, Scole—before putting the half-sovereign in I care<lb/>fully marked it, and also the stamps—after fastening up the letter I handed it to Mr. Monro, of the head office, London, with directions to despatch it by the bag to Ipswich—the Ipswich mail train starts from London at half-past eight, and arrives at Ipswich at half-past eleven—the prisoner is a sorting clerk on the railway, and travels on the line between London and Ipswich, sorting the letters in the van as he goes, and he returns to London two or three hours afterwards—he went by the Ipswich mail at half-past eight that night—he was the person to sort the letters on that journey; he would sort the letters for the Scole and Stowmarketdistrict—he would return by the half-past one mail which arrives in London about five—I was at the Ipswich Post-office when the mail cart came in that night, about half-past eleven—the Scole bag was opened in my presence, and the seal broken—it was properly tied and sealed with the proper official seal—I carefully examined its contents, and could not find the letter addressed to Mrs. Watnoughby—I am positive it was not there—I very carefully examined for that purpose; that was the only bag in which such a letter ought to have been placed—I left for Shoreditch by the mail train, and arrived there about half-past five—before I left Ipswich I saw the prisoner coming out of the railway hotel opposite the station, about ten minutes before the train started, about a quarter past one in the morning—I saw him when we got to London in the sorting carriage, immediately after the arrival of the train—I went back by the same train—I said to him, "You know me, Mr. Barrow; I have come to inquire about a missing letter; did you sort the Scole and Stowmarket letters that arrived in the London bag last night?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "Did you sort them all yourself?"—he said, "I did it all myself; Mr. Leal tied up a few bundles, but he did no sorting"—(Mr. Leal is a clerk in the Post Office; he had no duty that night, I think)—I said, "Did you make up the Scole and Stowmarket bag?"—he said, "I did"—I asked where he went to the previous night when he got to Ipswich—he said he went to the hotel opposite the station—I said, "Did you go any<lb/>where else?"—he said, "No"—I asked what money he had—he said,</p>

               <p>"About 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he was searched by Crocker, a constable, who found on him a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and I think 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I said, "What money did you change this morning at the hotel?"—he said, "A sove<lb/>reign"—I said, "Are you quite sure?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Did you not change a half-sovereign there?"—he said, "No, I did not"—I then directed him to attend at the chief office the following morning—I sent Crocker down to Ipswich, and upon his return, and on receiving his report, I saw the prisoner at the Post Office on Monday, 3rd September, about mid<lb/>day—I said to him, "You told me yesterday morning that it was a sove<lb/>reign you changed at the hotel; the barmaid states it was a half-sovereign that she got from you?"—he said, "I am sure it was a sovereign"—I said, "The half-sovereign that I enclosed in the letter that is missing has been found at the hotel at Ipswich, opposite the station, where you were on Saturday night"—he said he knew it was a sovereign he had changed—I then gave him into custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half-sovereign that I put into the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the prisoner's position in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Travelling clerk in the Railway Post Office—I believe his salary is 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I know that he was promoted lately—there are various modes of promotion in the Post Office, for good conduct or by rotation; it is not always by seniority—I am travelling inspector attached to the missing letter branch—it was part of my duty to examine the prisoner as I did—I asked him where he went to at Ipswich—I knew, for I had seen him come from the hotel, I did not know whether he had been anywhere else—it was about half-past eleven when I found that the letter was missing—after that I waited at Ipswich till the train started—I walked about for an hour—I did not go anywhere—I was not watching—Crocker was with me; I walked about till about one o'clock—I was waiting about the station for the train to start when I saw the prisoner come out of the Railway Hotel—I could command a view of it from where I was waiting, that was partly my object—I had not kept the hotel always in sight—I had not seen the prisoner go in—he had not been watched away from the train that I am aware of—I did not go into the hotel at once and see what money he had given, because I did not know then that he had changed any money there; one reason was there was no time, if I had gone I should have lost the train—I did not leave the constable to go, I thought it better to take him with me for my assistance, in case I should find the marked money on the prisoner—it is not so easy to find a constable in London at that time in the morning, I should have had a difficulty in finding one to do what I required of him, he would have required a long ex<lb/>planation before he would have acted for me—of my own knowledge I do not know who went down in the sorting carriage besides the prisoner, but I believe Gurr, the sorter, and Mr. Leal—Mr. Leal was not searched, no suspicion whatever attached to him, he is a man whose character is above suspicion—I believe he got out at Forest Gate—he had been in the carriage down while the letters were being sorted—I believe he was at the Railway Hotel part of the time he was at Ipswich—I have not taken any steps to ascertain what became of a gentleman who slept at the Railway Hotel that night—the prisoner was originally committed for trial, and then the charge was withdrawn.</p>

I am one of the senior clerks in the General Post Office—I have been employed in the Post Office twenty-two years—on Satur<lb/>day, the 1st September, I travelled from Forest Gate to Ipswich in the sorting carriage with the prisoner and Gurr—I had nothing to do with the letters arriving from the chief office—when we got to Ipswich I locked the carriage door, and took charge of the key—that was the last thing I did before going to the hotel—I think I walked there opposite Gurr—I think the prisoner had gone just before me—I had some refreshment there—I paid, I think, a florin—I paid for Gurr as well as for myself—I did</p>

               <p>not change a half-sovereign—I left before the prisoner, and went direct to the mail carriage alone—I unlocked the carriage—I kept the key in my possession the whole time, from the time I left till I went back—the next person that came to the carriage was Gurr, and afterwards the prisoner—we then travelled back to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose it is not the ordinary railway carriage key that you lock the door with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is one of Chubb's locks, a good lock—no one had a duplicate key—I would not be quite sure on that point, at that time, I had a duplicate key myself, but, as a precaution, I never took it with me—I only used the mail office key, so that there was only one key out—mine was at home—there was no duplicate key at Ipswich to my knowledge—there was one at my home at that time, but since that period the locks have been altered, and I have not a duplicate key now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling inspector of the missing letter department—the prisoner was a letter carrier in the northern dis<lb/>trict office, but I do not know for how long—there has been a very large number of letters lost in that district lately—I made up a letter contain<lb/>ing a marked half-sovereign and 58 marked penny postage stamps, and ad<lb/>dressed it Mrs. Delaney, 2, Norfolk Square, New North Road, London—I addressed it so that it would not go into his district—I securely fastened it and posted it at the northern district letter-box at a little before six in the evening of Monday, 10th December—it should be delivered about half-past seven the same evening—next morning I went to the northern district office a little before nine—I saw the prisoner there and told him I was an inspector of the head office, and wished to inquire about a letter that was missing—I asked him if he recollected having a letter for 2, Norfolk Square, last evening—he said, "No, I had so many miss<lb/>sorts I cannot recollect any particular one"—I said, "What would you have done with such, a letter if it came into your hands?"—he said, "I should have sorted it to the blind table or given it to the man on the Rotherfield walk"—I asked him if he had taken any letters back that morning that he could not deliver the previous evening—he said no, he had not brought any letters back that morning—he was then searched by Bingham in my presence, and nothing was found on him—after that Bingham and the inspector of the northern district office left, and returned in about half or three-quarters of an hour—Bingham brought back an old uniform coat, which he said he found behind a door at the prisoner's house, and had found these stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in it—he did not say then where the house was—the prisoner at once said, "I know nothing about these stamps, some one must have put them there"—I asked him if it was his coat—he said it was—I identified the stamps, and said, "These are the stamps that I placed in the letter that is missing"—he said, "I know nothing about them"—these are the stamps, they have my mark on them—I gave the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this letter in the prisoner's district? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand not—persons can send money in letters without being regis<lb/>tered if they please, but we strongly recommend them not to put coin in letters—it was an old coat, with the number cut out of the collar—I should say it was not in use, from its state—I do not know that the prisoner has been twenty-one years in the service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers at the northern district post-office—a communication was made to me, and about six o'clock on 10th December I went to the letter-box there, and found a letter addressed to Mrs. Delaney, No. 2, Norfolk Square—I placed the letters for sorting, and placed the letter for Mrs. Delaney among those to be sorted by the prisoner—I am quite sure this letter was among those I placed before him to sort—while he was arranging his letters I was close behind him—I saw the letter addressed Mrs. Delaney in his left hand, and another in his right hand, which he placed with the one in question on his left side on the table—he left the office about ten minutes past six for his delivery—I did not see that letter after he left—it was not in his district—when he found that the letter was not in his district his first duty would be to</p>

               <p>deposit it in the coin letter-box, in order to compel registration—he certainly ought not to have taken it with him, it ought to have been sorted to the other carrier, McIlwin—it was not amongst McIlwin's letters—I made a report of what had taken place—I examined the registration box, and searched all likely places, but could not find it—it was not the prisoner's duty to return that day, he returned the following morning about 630—subsequently, while Mr. Muloch was in conversation with the prisoner, I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, 42, Foster Street, Hoxton—I saw the officer find an old uniform coat—it was hanging just by the door, at the foot of the stairs leading to the back kitchen—in that we found a small packet, which was afterwards shown to Mr. Muloch, con<lb/>taining postage stamps, enclosed in a piece of newspaper—Mr. Muloch identified them as being marked by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has the prisoner been twenty-one years in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to the exact date—from my own knowledge I can speak from 1855—I cannot say whether he was entitled to a pension some years ago—after a man has been ten years in the service of the Post Office he is entitled to a pension of one-sixtieth for every year's service—the coat was found close to the back kitchen door—any persons passing upand down would have access to it—it was in his apartments—I cannot say that persons going in to fetch coals or water would have access to it—I know that he rents the house—I did not ascertain whether there were lodgers in the house—I did not make inquiries whether people went down to fetch water or coals—it was no part of my duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office—I went with Mr. Hyland to the prisoner's lodgings on the morning of the 11th, and found this coat hanging up close to the back kitchen door, on a peg, against the prisoner's official cape—there were two or three pegs there—it was just outside the door—I found these stamps in the inside coat pocket, and took them and the coat back to Mr. Muloch, at the northern district office, and gave the stamps to him—the prisoner was there—I produced the coat and the stamps, and the prisoner said he knew nothing about the stamps, but the coat was his—I said where I found it—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver on him.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Stevenson, of 1, Young's Buildings, Angel Court, Borough—I knew the deceased, Margaret Burke, by coming to see her brother-in-law, who lived in my front room, upstairs—on a Saturday evening in July, about half-past eight, I and the prisoner came up to my door together, just as the deceased did—she called her brother-in-law, who said to her, "You have got a little drop to drink; you had best come home along with me," and he took her up Angel Court—he came back in a very few minutes, and she came back some minutes after—I saw her in the passage on her knees, bleeding at the back of the ear—there was no one else there then—I had not seen anybody strike her—she was taken to a doctor's—some days after that I saw the prisoner near London Bridge—she tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "I was at your place this morning; how is my aunt, that I struck?" (the deceased was her mother's brother's wife)—she said she struck her with a stone, and the stone I had found in my passage was the one she did it with—I said I had heard she was better—she said, "Well, she gave me my blood to drink the week before, and I only gave her hers in return"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stone I found in my passage—there was some blood on it when I picked it up next morning.</p>
