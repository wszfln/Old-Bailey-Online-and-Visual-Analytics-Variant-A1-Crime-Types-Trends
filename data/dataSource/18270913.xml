On the 12th of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, as I was in the field adjoining my house, I heard the bolt of one of the doors of the house creak, and went round to see who was there, as I knew nobody was at home - my daughter had gone out. I saw the prisoner come away from the house, with a bundle under his arm; he came away from the house - I did not see him come out of the door: he was about twenty yards from the house when I first saw him. I asked him what he had got there - he said what he had got was his own: I told him I knew the handkerchief the bundle was tied up in; he then made his escape into the road, with the bundle: I went up to him - he asked if it was my property; I told him it was- he pulled out part of one of the gowns, and asked me if I knew that; he gave the bundle a shove towards me, and said, "Take it, and say nothing about it;" I took the bundle, and he took to his heels and ran - I ran after him, hallooing Stop thief! some hay-makers in the field stopped him in my sight; I am sure he is the man - he was never out of my sight. I found in the bundle two gowns, a shirt, and a handkerchief; I gave them to the constable; my daughter had gone out of the house after me. I had left it about nine o'clock in the morning, and had not been home afterwards. I went back to the house, and found one of the ground-floor windows open, and the other half open; there was room for any body to get in: I heard the door open as he came out. I fetched my daughter, who had gone out after me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come back, and bring you the bundle? A. As soon as I took it you ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not come back out of my, way to give you the bundle? A. No, you was going that way - you stopped when I met you; I was in the yard, and you was going along the road - you did not come back to me; I did not see you before you came from the house with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. After you went to look for your daughter, did not you see a man, and ask him if he was the person who had been with me? A. No; I never said I saw a man running and asked why he ran, and that he said because he heard a cry of Stop thief!</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. On the 12th of July I went out about ten o'clock, leaving nobody in the house. When I left the house the windows were both nailed down; I bolted all the doors - I went out at the front door, which I locked, and took the key with me- I was fetched back by my father, and found one window partly open, and the other quite so; he had got into the wash-house, and broke the middle door open. I lost two gowns, a shirt, and a handkerchief, which I had seen safe in the drawers that day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Three days before I met this man I was in Oxford-street, and met one Milton, a Devonshire man - he asked where I came from: I told him: he asked if I knew one Milton; I said Yes - he said he was his father, and asked me to go and drink some beer; we went to Hyde-park, and had the beer, opposite Tyburn-gate; he said, "How are you off for blunt?" I said I was rather short: he said he had some money coming to him, if I would go with him to-morrow, a few shillings might be of service to me. We went round to several houses; he came out of a house, and said he had received 1s. 6d., and was to call again on Thursday; he then asked me to go to his lodgings, where he had left some clothes; I went: he said, "I am going across to this house, where I lodge, for my things - you wait there till I come back;" I waited a considerable time, and then went up; the gate was open: I turned to my right, into the little garden - he came out with the bundle, and said, "These are my clothes - I wish you would take them - I will overtake you - I am going a little way;" and as I came out across the yard, this man called to me, and said, "Halloo! what have you there?" I said, "Nothing belonging to you I believe;" he said, "I wish you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130004"/>would bring it back and let me see;" I went back to him, about the length of this Court, and said, "Look at it, and see if this is any thing of your's; take it;" he opened the handkerchief, and said, "Here are some things I can swear to;" I said, "Take hold of them;" he directly called Stop thief; I acknowledge that I ran then, and was surrounded in less than five minutes; he says he saw me coming out of the house.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             - I am confident it is the skin of the sheep I lost the day before; a hind quarter of mutton, a shoulder, and liver were also brought to my house by Kerridge, my servant, on the 29th- I saw a side of mutton at Worship-street on the 30th, I believe; it was on a Thursday. I compared the mutton brought to my house with the skin, and am certain it corresponded. I know Tooley - I believe he carries milk out for his father, who is a respectable man. The mutton was cut up in a butcher-like manner, and the skin well taken off; the head was servered from the skin: I compared the head with the skin - it fitted exactly. I was not present when any other mutton was compared with what was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the person here who fastened your sheep up at night? A. Yes. I had bought the sheep on the 28th, the day before; I always examine them well before I buy them; I bought forty-three - some of them at 6 o'clock in the morning, and some at 11; they were driven to Hampstead; I only had the rest of the day to get acquainted with the marks, but they were my own marks; a ruddle mark across the back is very common - it was done with oakum. I have known Tooley three or four years - he assists his father; I never knew him in any other employ: I never knew a breach in his character before - he has been out on bail, and surrendered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were these sheep part of a larger lot in the market so marked? A. No, my Lord. I marked them myself after I bought them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Islington - my beat is on Highgate-hill. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of May, at five o'clock, I saw the prisoners Edward and John Sadler, on Highgate-hill; John had a bag on his back- I asked them what they had got - Edward Sadler said it was pork; they were in company together: I said I wished to see it - Edward said, "If you will come to my house I will show it to you;" I asked where they lived - Edward said he lived just over the way, thirty or forty yards off; it turned out to be the place where they did live- I accompained them there, and then asked Edward to show me what the bag contained - he asked where was my authority, or had I a search-warrant; I told him No, that my duty was to stop any body I thought suspicious; he then said, "Well, if I must tell you the truth, it is mutton"- he opened the bag, and I saw it; there was a hind quarter and a fore quarter of mutton, and some fat - it was quite warm at the time; I asked Edward where he had it from- he said he had it from Hampstead, and mentioned a person's name. I took the prisoners and mutton to the watch-house.

            's wife had the breakfast things on the table, and before I took them to the watch-house Edward told her to go to Hampstead, and tell the person of whom he bought the mutton, that he was in the watch-house; I proceeded with them and the mutton to the watch-house, and on the road Edward said he expected the man he bought the mutton of was gone to the races, but if he was not there his man must come - he said that to his wife when he sent her. I asked them on the road where they got the mutton from; Edward said that he bought it overnight - I asked him at what time - he said about five o'clock in the afternoon. They both said they had been to Hampstead to pay their club, and spent their money, got drunk, and stopped there all night, and that was the reason they had not got home before; they said they had sold mutton all the winter since Christmas, and had it from the same person as they bought that of - that they were out of work, and got 6s. or 7s. a week by it. I gave them into Grafton's custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Highgate-hill from the watch-house? A.

            . I am a constable of the night of Islington. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of May, Ashby brought the Sadlers to me; they had this bag, containing a fore and hind quarter of mutton, and a long piece of fat. - After the mutton was taken before the Magistrate it was delivered to Mr. Smith; I examined it - it was not cold. I put some questions to the prisoners, and went to the house of Tooley the same morning, in company with Ashby (Sadlers being in the watch-house;) I met Tooley on the road to his house - it was about seven o'clock in the morning (directly after securing the prisoners) - I asked if his name was Tooley; he acknowledged that it was; I asked if he had sold any persons any mutton that morning; he said he had not. I took him into custody, and searched his house between seven and eight o'clock that morning, but found nothing there. I went again in the afternoon, with a warrant, but had searched the house before; nothing was found in my presence at either search, not in the house or any where else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with Tooley after you took him? A. I kept him in custody - he was not out of my sight till he went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was any body at his house when you searched? A. Yes, two persons.</p>

               <p>JOHN BUSTIN. I am a constable of Hampstead. On Wednesday, the 30th of May, in consequence of information which I received, I searched Tooley's house, between ten and eleven o'clock; Eldridge, another constable was with me: we found nothing material in the house, but in a basket in the area I found a gut - it appeared to be a sheep's gut; it was only a short piece of gut; there was a basket of dung and straw in the area - I cannot tell what sort it was. We went into a cellar, and in a rabbit-hutch there we found a piece of suet fat - it was kidney fat, and appeared to me to be sheep's fat; we searched the privy, and among the soil, on stirring it up, we saw some congealed blood; after that, in the kitchen, under the sink, I found this handkerchief, all over blood; I found nothing else there. I had made a search before that; on my first coming up that day, in Golden-square, at the top of Hampstead, about thirty yards from Tooley's house, and on the ground there was a leg and loin of mutton - it appeared to have been taken out of a privy; the privy, there is open to the whole yard - I searched that privy, but there was no blood there; the privy I found the blood in was occupied by Tooley - his wife was present when I found the gut in the basket. I went that morning from his house to a pond, about one hundred yards off - it is called Clock-house pond; Phillips and Eldridge were with me; I saw something laying on the top of the water: Phillips pulled it out - it was a shoulder of mutton, and was fresh. After that I saw Eldridge pull out a piece of suet kidney fat - that was fresh. I saw a lad named Preston take the liver out of the pond - that was also fresh; two or three old sheep skins were found in the pond, tied together with a rope, and bricks tied to them. I was at Worship-street when the whole of the mutton found, and that taken from the prisoners Sadlers, was compared together, and to the best of my judgment, they fitted - I have no doubt of it. I saw a sheep's skin produced at Worship-street; the mutton found by me, and that found on Sadlers was compared with the skin - it all corresponded together exactly; I did not see the head compared. I have not the least doubt they came from the same carcase.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not a butcher? A. No. The privy in which the hind quarter was supposed to be found was common to all the houses - any body might go there; it is about thirty yards from Tooley's: there are a great many more houses nearer to it than his. There is a road right round the pond; Golden-square is about one hundred yards from the pond. I know Tooley - he bore a most respectable character as far as I ever heard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether either of the prisoners have been bred as a butcher? A. I do not, my Lord.</p>

I have seen Tooley killing pigs for himself and other people.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live at Hampstead.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Tooley's house a cottage by itself, or in a street? A. There are a lot of houses together, joining one another, in Golden-square; there are a great many houses nearer to the pond than his. The pond is on the heath, open to every body.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear to the county it was born in, from seeing the head? A. No. The skin was not on the head - I cannot swear to the breed, but suppose it to be Lincolnshire.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at West-end. I was employed by Mr. Smith to count his sheep on Tuesday morning, the 29th of May - there were then forty-two; I had brought them from Smithfield the day before; how many there were then I cannot say: some of them were Lincolnshire sheep; I can tell Lincolnshire mutton from any other breed. On the 29th, I saw at Worship-street a hind and fore quarter of mutton, and part of the caul fat, and am certain it was Lincolnshire mutton. I was afterwards present when the pond was searched, and saw the shoulder and the head, and am quite certain they belonged to the same carcase as the other mutton. - I saw the skin next day, in the prosecutor's presence, and knew it by the marks - it was a Lincolnshire sheep; I saw it compared with the mutton at the office on the Thursday - I carefully examined it, and have no doubt it belonged to the mutton, and it was the skin of one of the sheep I had brought from the market. When the nose piece was cut off a piece of skin was cut off with it, and it tallied with the skin; it was cut sloping down, and if ever it is cut off it is done perpendicularly. Tooley works with his father - he was never employed by me. The mutton I saw was cut in a butcher-like manner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say, if you saw a hind quarter of mutton fifty miles off, you could swear to its<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130006"/>being Lincolnshire without the skin? A. I should pass my judgment on it - I could tell it from Leicestershire, or any other county almost. There may be breeds which I never saw. I could tell Lincolnshire from Leicestershire mutton - if it was cross breed I should call it half breed.</p>

               <p>COURT to T. GRAFTON. Q. Did you search the back kitchen? A.

            ; we live in Rockingham-row, New Kent-road. On the 21st of June I was going to Bedford-square, to pay some money, and had the property stated in the indictment in my reticule; I had received the notes at Sir R. Carr Glyn's bank, about the 8th of June; I am sure they were part of the money - I had put them into my reticule: I left home a little after ten o'clock, and twisted the strings of my reticule round my finger. I came to Charing-cross by the stage; the money was then all safe. I was proceeding up <placeName id="t18270913-3-crimeloc20">George-street</placeName>

I saw a man running immediately before me, round Buckeridge-street; I rose immediately, and followed him; I called Stop thief! two or three times, but no one came to my assistance. I was robbed close to the door of the public-house: I observed nothing against the house; I followed the man who was running - he was the one in the brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to that time had you seen the face of the man in the brown coat? A. I consider that I had, as he looked at me, and I believe the man who was running was the same, I gave information at the office: one Flanagan was afterwards taken, on suspicion of being one of the persons at the post: I stated to the Magistrate, that I believed him to be the person, from his great likeness to the present prisoner: I cannot say that the prisoner is the man, but, as it was proved that the other man was not one, I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You believed the other to be the person? A. At that time I did. I never stated to the Magistrate that the prisoner was not the person- I did not consider him to be the man at that time. I went to Marlborough-street with some officers one or two days after the robbery, and several men were produced to me - I cannot say whether Riley was one of them, but I fancy he was; I did not then think that I had seen the right man. I had a very imperfect view of the man who robbed me; I shook my head, and said I did not see the man as I thought- I had a very imperfect light, and could not distinguish the features of any one of them. Flanagan was afterwards taken by my description, and I said I believed him to be the man - I spoke distinctly to him; the prisoner was committed about a fortnight after I had seen the three men, and he had been produced to me twice in that time I think. I was present when a painter and a boy were examined.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Hems, the painter, present when Flanagan was first examined? A. No; he was at the last examination.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Eden-street, Regent-street. On the 21st of June I was employed in painting Tristram's public-house; I began on the 20th. On the 21st, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was on a ladder painting the lower window in Buckeridge-street, which forms a corner with George-street; I heard a faint voice below cry Stop thief! I got down immediately, and saw Mrs. Macpherson - she went on three or four yards ahead of me; I had seen a person running past me before I heard the cry of Stop thief! - it might be two minutes before - he came running out of George-street from Mrs. Macpherson, at the rate of about five miles an hour; it was as much as he could do to clear my ladder. When I first saw Mrs. Macpherson she was running past me, all over mud, and her reticule strings were hanging down. I can swear that Riley is the man who ran by, before I heard the alarm- he had his hand clasped up to his side as if he had something tucked up; he had a kind of snuff-coloured long coat on, corduroy or fustian trousers, white stockings, and half-boots laced up. I was first examined at the office on the Thursday-week after the robbery: nothing has been said to me by either of the prisoners as to my attending here or elsewhere, but there has been by other persons - the man was in my view a quarter or half a minute; I saw his face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you not afraid of falling from your ladder? A. Yes; I got down directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130007"/>COURT. Q. After this happened did you go into the public-house? A. Not till I went in for my dinner. I then saw the landlord in the bar, and was going to speak to him about the man running by, but a butcher, who was with me, asked if I had seen any thing of the robbery: I said I had. Tristram called me to him, and said the less I said about it the better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the butcher here now? A. No; I think Tristram must have heard me, for I went to the bar to get some beer, and he beckoned to me with his finger, and I understood then that he wanted to speak to me; several people were in the house - I cannot say whether any were in the bar; I did not know Tristram till I went there to work; he said, "The less you say the better - I speak for your own good."</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live with my parents in George-street. On Thursday, the 21st of June, I saw the prosecutrix in George-street, near the Cock public-house; I saw the prisoner Riley go up to her - he caught hold of her by the side, took hold of her reticule, and pulled her down on the ground; he then ran round the corner into Buckeridge-street; he wore a brown snuff-coloured coat, and corduroy trousers: I had seen him along with two more, who went away when he went up to Mrs. Macpherson. I saw him again between six and seven o'clock the same evening, in George-street, in the same coat, and he has it on now. I was was taken before the Justice next day; a person was shown to me there, but that was not Riley. Mrs. Macpherson was there, and I knew her to be the lady I had seen robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you taken to Clerkenwell prison? A. Duke, the officer, took me there - it might be a month after this; Hems was not there; I saw Hems at the time of the robbery; I was very near him, but did not speak about it; I mentioned it the same evening to Mr. Clock, at the coach-makers in Russel-street; I did not know Hems before; he had the same coat on in the evening as he has now, but at the time he committed the offence he was dressed different.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told Mr. Clock, at the coach-makers in Russell-street, of it the same evening; was that the house Mrs. Macpherson was taken to on the occasion? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 21st of June I went to Tristram's, the Cock public-house, in George-street, St. Giles', twice, and saw him both times, but said nothing to him till the second time, which was at night; I told him the Magistrates of our office were very angry at a robbery having been committed at his door at twelve o'clock in the day, and that he seemed to know nothing at all about it; I told him to inquire and learn out who it was, and let me know; he said all he could learn was, that it was a little boy in a fustian jacket: I described the nature of the robbery to him, and said the lady had been robbed of two 10l. and two 5l. notes, six sovereigns, and some silver. Fagan, a patrol, was with me. I called upon him several times afterwards, but never could get any further information. I have two notes which were sent to me by Mrs. Macpherson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not always find him at home? A. I did; he always gave the same account; I did not give him the number or date of the notes; he has been out on bail, and surrendered to day.</p>

            . I accompanied Duke to Tristram's house, and heard him state the amount of the notes lost. I was afterwards sent from our office with a summons for Tristram to attend Riley's examination, and took him there with me; I told him I brought him there about two notes which were traced to him, and had been stolen from a lady in George-street: he said two notes were exchanged at his house on the Monday after the robbery, by a man who had a glass of brandy and water; I asked if he knew him or had taken his address: he said he never saw him in his life before. I said it was a strange thing that he should take two 10l. notes of a stranger; he said he had frequently done so; that he exchanged notes for any one who called there, and never took their addresses.</p>

I observed a man rush right through between the two women, and push my sister up against the wall; my brother-in-law instantly asked him what he shoved his wife for: a man, who was in his company, turned round and struck my brother a blow in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130008"/>eye, and gave him a tremendous black eye. I then asked what he struck him for, and the prisoner then up with his hand, and struck me on the head; he was in company with the rest - there were three or four of them; he knocked my hat off, and with his other hand made a grasp at my watch ribbon and seals; the ribbon broke, and he got the seals - I felt the jerk, and said, "You d-d scoundrel, you have not got my watch!" I instantly pursued him, struck at him, and knocked him down; I laid hold of him by the hand as he was trying to put the seal into his pocket. I took my seal out of his hand, with the ring and two metal keys - they were all in his hand: my wife called out for the watchman, who came up; he began to talk Irish to the watchman; the watchman collared me - he spoke to him in Irish, and then the watchman tried to make me let go the prisoner, and said he saw me strike him, but he was not there at the time. I would not let the prisoner go, and took him down to St. Giles' watch-house. He was never out of my hand- the watchman was an Irishman.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow was it the prisoner gave you? - A. With his fist; he knocked my hat off - there were three or four in company - this was the only one I could secure; I am sure he got possession of the keys, ring, and seal; I took them out of his hands - they were tacked on the ribbon- he tore them off without any of the ribbon to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he appear quite in his senses? A. Yes; he spoke very well - he did not appear half-witted nor drunk. I am sure I did not strike him before he struck me; nobody struck him till I was struck myself; I then struck him; I did not call him any names; he had no weapon about him.</p>

On Friday morning, the 20th of July, a little after six o'clock, I found my back kitchen window had been forced open, and a pane, composed of strong brown paper, between the passage and the shop, had been completely separated from the frame; a person could then get into the shop; on entering the shop I found the desk had been forced open by a screw-driver, which laid near it; I found on the counter two drawers, which had been taken out of the desk, turned upside down - and at eight o'clock, when the shopman came, I learned what he had left in the desk the evening before - no money was left in the desk. I do not sleep in the house, but my two servants, whose names are Lockyer and Adams, slept there; one is nineteen, and the other fifteen years old. I had left the house about three or four o'clock the afternoon before - I got there a little before six in the morning, and found them both up, as they should have been, as the workmen come at six o'clock- nobody had been into the shop; as the shop-door was secured.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. I left the shop at eight o'clock in the evening of the 19th of July; I locked the desk, in which I left a 10l. and 5l. note, 3l. in gold, and 18s. in silver. I deposited the key in the shop where I knew where to find it again. I left Lockyer and Adams in care of the house - I locked up the shop, and put the key of it into a room up stairs - the key of that room is left with the prosecutor's son - I put it into his room; he had the key of that room. I went next morning at eight o'clock, and was informed the shop had been robbed. I noticed a window, which before was covered with brown paper, had been forced open, and somebody appeared to have got in; I got the key of Mr. Jones' room, and found the shop key still there; I found the desk broken open, and two drawers, which I had locked in it the night before, were taken out, and the money taken out; also about 1s. worth of copper was taken out of the till, which had not been locked, and an old black coat of mine was gone - I could identify the 10l. note; I did not notice the back window as I passed it, but afterwards found it was drawn back. I found Lockyer and Adams still in the house.</p>

On the 20th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing the shop of Mr. Isaacs', clothes-salesman, of No. 29, Monmouth-street - I cannot exactly say the day of the month- it was on a Friday. I heard of this robbery on the Monday afterwards; Isaacs called me in; I saw the prisoner and Bodnum there: Isaacs asked if I had a handkerchief to sell - I said Yes, and produced one - I sold it to the prisoner and Bodnum, for 4s.; they presented a 10l. note in payment; I cannot swear which of them produced it - I told them they had not come honestly by it, and I would give charge of them; Mrs. Isaacs would not let me give charge of them in her house - she said I should take them to my own house, and give charge of them there; I took them to my house, and sent my shopman for an officer - in the mean time they both said it was their father's note, and they would bring their father down; I agreed for them to fetch him; the shopman came back, and said he did not see the street-keeper at the corner; I cannot say whether they heard that; when I agreed for them to go to their father, they asked me to give them a sovereign, which I refused at first; but they begged hard of me, and said they would bring their father down: I at last gave them a sovereign, with a card of my shop, and told them to call next morning with their father, and I would give him the rest of the change; I kept the note; they went away, and never came back again, nor did their father - I only gave them a handkerchief and a sovereign. I let them go because they persisted in its being their father's.</p>

I shall give charge of you." My wife, who was present, said, "Take them down to your own place, and give them in charge," for she herself was very poorly with the fright: he took them to his own shop.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old in February, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. I ran away from my father and mother about the latter end of June, and have supported myself by holding gentlemens' horses; I ran away from them three weeks before this happened. On a Friday, about the 21st of July, I went with the prisoner to Isaacs'; he gave me the 5l. note in the shop; he was with me on the Thursday evening, between five and six o'clock, and said he would have about 20l. in the morning - this was in Cumberland-street, opposite Hyde-park: we had been holding horses all day: I went down into Regent-street with him; he left me in Regent-street, a little way down on the right hand, about nine o'clock in the evening, and told me to stop there till he came back; I did not see him again till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when he was in Regent-street; I asked where he had been so long; he said he had been to Lambeth; he then pulled out a lot of halfpence and showed me, and then he pulled out a 10l. and a 5l. note, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 18s. in silver. We went out of Regent-street into Oxford-street; he told me next morning that he had got the money from somewhere down by Lambeth, in a court; he said he got into the back window, through a pane; that he left his shoes and stockings down in the kitchen, and went up stairs - that he had worked at the house before, and was turned away through some silver spoons: he said that when he went up stairs, he broke the lock of the desk open, and took this money out of the desk; that there was only one young man slept there, a little bigger than himself; we had been to a brick-field to sleep, and were down in the Bayswater-road all the morning, and in the afternoon he went to Isaacs', and bought a suit of clothes and a handkerchief; he bought a hat in Oxford-street: I went to Isaacs' with him a second time, and bought a suit of clothes for 30s. - I paid a 5l. note, which he gave me in the shop. Simmonds came in, and the prisoner wanted change for a 10l. note; we were taken up about nine o'clock the same night by the watchman - some gentleman gave charge of us; we had gone to the Bayswater-road again. My clothes are at my father's house now; they were on my back when I was taken up. My father works in stables; we had both ran away from our parents at this time.</p>

            . I am keeper of Paddington watch-house. The prisoner and Bodnum were brought to the watch-house, on suspicion, on Friday evening, the 20th of July, by one of our watchmen; there was no direct charge against them: I searched them, and found they had every thing on new from top to bottom - I found on Martin a new purse, with a sovereign, and 17s. 6d., a new comb and knife; Bodnum had a new purse, with 15s. 6d., two new combs, and a knife. I asked where they came from: they both said they came from Bristol; I asked how they came by the money, and what they came to London for; Martin said his mother had given him the money to come to town to buy clothes with. I detained them all night, and took them before the Magistrate next morning; they were remanded till Tuesday, and in the meantime I heard Mr. Jones had been robbed. I produce the 10l. note which Simmonds gave me - I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES re-examined. I had dismissed the prisoner, as he was accused of stealing some silver money from a cook-shop; a silver spoon was missing from my premises about a week before I discharged him, and he was charged with it.</p>

On the evening of Saturday, the 16th of June, I saw the premises locked up between six and seven o'clock - I left them safe; I returned on Monday morning, about half-past eight, and found the premises had been broken into, and sundry cloths had been stolen - they had made an entrance from Cateaton-street; there were no visible marks on the outside of the street door, but they had broken through a door in a passage, which we and another person have access; they had cut a pannel out of the door, and opened it; it was safe on Saturday night. Two desks were broken open, out of which the cash-box was taken. A segar-chest in the warehouse had been broken open, and a few bundles taken out; three gold watches were also taken. The cash-box, contained eight bills of exchange, amounting to above 1000l. I missed fifteen or twenty pieces of woollen cloth, worth about 400l., and twenty dozen pairs of gloves, worth 30l. - they had selected all the fine cloths, and left the coarse behind; they had opened a bottle of wine, drank part of it, and smoked some segars; the remains were left on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Do you know what part of the property has been found? A. No. The pannel of the door was cut out. I should conceive more than one person must be concerned.</p>

            . These are my property - I have looked at the cloth - there are about eleven yards of it, which is worth about 9l. The gloves are worth 7l. 10s.; I know them by the manufacturer's mark on them - the papers have been exchanged, but I have no doubt of the property; my cash-box contained about 1011l. in bills.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the mark on the gloves? A. They have the letters C. B. stamped within; I do not know the manufacturer's name, but they always put their initials on them; they are a French make - the gloves I lost were marked exactly in this way; some have an arrow stamped on them. I am certain they were made in France, by the way they are stitched; I have not the least doubt of their being mine; all French gloves are not stitched the same way; some are pricked seams, being made with the machine - these are done by hand. I swear positively they are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE re-examined. I found the property in the ground floor front room; it is not fitted up at all like a shop - it is a parlour; they were in drawers: the prisoner was in the room, and said he had bought them, but could not exactly recollect of whom; his wife was there, and Forrester and White, the officers; his two daughters came in afterwards and a man who lodged up stairs.</p>

            . I have a warehouse in Coleman-street, and a manufactory at Stroud, in Gloucestershire. I have sold a great many cloths to the prosecutor; I cannot identify these cloths by this light, but I saw them in Mr. Cope's possession, on the 29th of June, at the Mansion-house, and one piece I could particularly swear to, as being my manufacture, and part of what I sold Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot be certain it is what you sold him? A. I sold him thirteen pieces, all of which had been damaged in a very peculiar manner, which gave them a very singular appearance on the wrong side; it arose from an accident, in the application of a patent finish in hot water; I recognized them at the Mansion-house by that; other manufacturers apply the patent finish to black cloth; it gave it a very peculiar brown dark appearance on the wrong side; the cloth had been made from a peculiar sort of old fleeces, and had a hair list.</p>
               <p>MR. WALLER re-examined. I had no cloth in my warehouse on the 16th of June, but what I had bought of Mr. Frost.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that his infirmity rendered it impossible that he could have committed the robbery, and contending that the property being found in his possession so long after the robbery, ought to do away the suspicion of his guilt, as it must have changed hands several times - that he had purchased the goods of persons whom he did not know; he was prepared to prove that he was a general dealer, and in the habit of attending sales; also that he was at home at the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I live at No. 41, Nightingale-lane, and am a general dealer. I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years; he had been a general dealer, and frequently attends sales with me - he is in the habit of making purchases there, and I have documents to prove that he has bought goods of me; I have bills to produce of property which I have sold him, which is detained by the officers; it is not the property in question.

               <p>COURT. Q. What time on the 17th of June did you see him? A. After dinner - he dines about two o'clock; I was about half an hour with him; I do not know that any doctor attended him: he was sitting in a chair - he had been to a sale with me about a month before that, and bought some remnants of cloth and kerseymere; he has attended several sales with me - he attended one at Mr. Bailey's, in Wood-street - I cannot say when that was - I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he was at a sale with you within a month of the goods being found? A. He had been to Bailey's, and to the Auction-mart, with me within two months - I do not know whether he bought any thing.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for two years. I have been sitting in Court - I did not hear the witnesses ordered to go out. I boarded with the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130011"/>at the time he was taken; he was ill at home on the night of the 16th; he complained of being ill all the day before, and on the 16th he was worse; he appeared ill; I saw him on the 17th; he was worse then. I myself underwent a surgical operation on the 19th of April, and was not out of doors for six weeks afterwards; I was sitting at home, and saw him the whole evening on the 16th of June; I saw him go up to bed about ten o'clock, and saw him come down stairs about nine next morning - I saw him go to bed that night, and saw him the next morning; he was not out of doors till the 19th - he attends sales.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is he a very infirm man? A. Yes; I cannot say whether he rides to the sales or not. I sleep in the ground floor back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any customers come into the front room? A. There are customers come backwards and forwards - I have seen several customers come there for goods; the last time was in June - I cannot say the day; I could not see what was done in the front room when I was in the back, but I have seen persons come and inquire for the prisoner; they came in at the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, you had undergone a surgical operation, were you not in bed? A. No - it was only an operation on my hand; I was sitting at the front door. The prisoner slept in the second floor back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then where he was at night you cannot tell? A. He wished me good night, and went up stairs at ten o'clock; he could not come down without my hearing him; it might be four or five months ago that I saw customers come there; I did not see what they purchased, but they came out with a large brown paper parcel; I have seen them several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have seen that for the last four or five months? A. I cannot say that I have; I have seen him buy and sell goods about five months ago - that was floor-cloth and ribbons. I was at home when the officers came - I did not see them take any goods; I had not the curiosity to go down stairs; they awoke me when they came; I lay on the prisoner's bed in the day time; I never went to a sale with him, but he has shown me things which he has said he has bought - that was sixteen or seventeen weeks ago.</p>

            ; his duty was to enter it in his own book, and hand the cash to the clerk; here is his book - there is no entry whatever of that sum in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. I suppose that you reposed confidence in him? A. Yes. He had sold coals on his own account before he came to me, and I believe he brought me three customers; he was in the habit of taking orders. Vender's tickets were not made out in his name since he has been in my service; I allowed him 15l. a-year for the business he brought. I lent him 40l., which he gave me his note of hand for, three or four years ago; I arrested him for that sum about the 23d of March, immediately on my finding that he was doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not issue an Habeas against him, on the very day he was going before the Commissioners, to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act? A. My attorney had orders to prosecute him long before that - but I believe he was taken on this charge the day he was going before the Court - he entered in the book the figures of the money he received; my son kept the other side of the book - the money was to be paid every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not his custom to deduct his salary from the money he so received? A. No; he had to collect some small rents for me, and in one or two instances where he owed money to persons who owed me accounts - he here said "I owe so much to the baker, and you must take that, as having been received by me;" I did not allow him to stop money which he had received against his salary - he always paid the cash to my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not in the habit of stopping so much as being due to him? A. No; he has been paid out of the rent money - as that was about enough to pay him; if he had not received sufficient rent money to make up his salary I paid him the difference, but that was confined to money received for weekly rents.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was in custody, did you not go to him to make up his account? A. Yes; I had then only arrested him; I told him there was something wrong in his account. I did not require an account from him, but he sent to the wharf to say he would make up his account - we said we did not want it, for we had found it out ourselves - he, however, sent an account, which I produce - the sum in question is entered here; this account was furnished after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130012"/>we took him on the criminal charge - he was brought here three or four months ago; he would not be tried one Session, and the next I was out of town - he had notice before he was brought here, that we were going to prosecute him, and the witnesses' names were given to him - when I arrested him I had no idea of the extent this had gone to, till we went round to the customers; he was arrested on the 23d of March, and brought here - I did not like to have the trouble of taking the weekly rent, so I let that be till I paid his salary - I gave him 15l. a-year instead of his selling on his own account; he charged his expenses at the end of the half year, and I paid him - he entered in the book whatever he received, and gave my son the money; but if he drew bills he gave them to me, as they required my indorsement - the cash account was balanced every night - when I speak of an account between us, I mean the rent account; I gave him a house to live in, as part of his salary. I had frequently to give him 2l. or 4l. when we settled - I am sorry to say that he has seven children - he bore a good character and is a clever man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ought there to be entered in this book the sum of money which he received on one side, and your son enters on the other side what he has paid? A. Yes; he had two guineas a week, a house to live in, and coals; and he charged his public-house expenses - the account he has sent me, is in his own hand-writing; some of the sums he has entered have been received two or three years back - none of them have been paid to me; this amount of Harris is among them - here is upwards of 200l. on this paper. I have received none of it, nor is any of it entered in his book - he was to take his salary entirely from the money received for rent; if he received more rent than was due to him, he paid me the balance, and if at the end of half a year it was less, I paid him the difference. After I had discovered several sums which had been received, he sent this account; I suppose about 2000l. a year might pass through his hands - Harris was not one of the customers he brought me.</p>

            . I am a buckle chafe maker. I deal with Mr. Pocock for coals; and on the 1st of November I paid the prisoner, on his account, three sovereigns, half-a-guinea, and 4s.; he gave me this receipt for it - (read). I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any recollection in what coin you paid him? A. I know there were three sovereigns, half-a-guinea, and 4s., and I recollect his remarking that I had given him sixpence short - I said No; that was half-a-guinea, and he looked at it again.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I am not in partnership with him; I am cashier - it was the prisoner's duty to enter in this book what sums he received - I enter on the other side the cash he pays; he never accounted to me for 3l. 14s. 6d. received from Harris - I remember this account being sent to my father; we knew of the deficiencies before that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he to make up any expences he had incurred? A. He was allowed that every half year; he was supposed to pay the expenses out of the money received.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would the account be regularly balanced if he kept money back? A. No; his expenses might amount to 20l. or 30l. in a half-year - the account of deficiencies which he sent in amount to 200l. - we have discovered more since.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Beside this 200l. here is 42l. under the head of "liabilities?" A. That is my hand-writing - he calls those persons his friends, and he had sold them goods in his own name; that money is included in the 200l.; but then he says, we can get that from them again - it appears he has given them a receipt in his own name.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read a long address to the Court, stating that he had been under considerable pecuniary embarrassments; but although he was accused of embezzlement, he trusted it would appear it was nothing more than a matter of account; he had never intended to defraud his master of one farthing, never having misapplied a sum with a criminal intention, but only considered it as debt.</p>

            . I live in Wellington-place, Back-road, Shadwell, near the Jolly Sailors. I saw Mr. Peck get off his horse, and give it to a boy to hold; the prisoner came up, and said, "Let me hold it?" Mr. Peck at last gave it to him, and went in; I went in, and had a glass of ale; I heard an alarm, ran out, and saw nothing of the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see it rode away? - A. No; I saw the mob running in all directions.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of August, in Charles-street, near the Jolly Sailors; he said he lodged there; I had been looking after him several times, and have been some hundred miles to look for Dean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had been after him several times, was it not on this charge? A. Yes; I never saw him before. Mr. Peck said he was the man who held the horse, and he said "I did hold it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written.) I am innocent of the charge of stealing the horse. I was unfortunately the person who had it to hold while the prosecutor stopped at the public-house; and, to my great misfortune, I was brought up in the same neighbourhood with Dean, who rode off with it. He came up, and asked me to let him have a ride up and down the street, which I did, and walked by the side of him; I requested him to return back as the gentleman would be angry; he immediately rode off at full speed, and I have not seen the horse or Dean since. When the officer came to apprehend me, I said I was the person who held the horse, and gave them my name. I did not know he was going to ride away with it.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            , who is a scale-maker, and lives in Brill-place, Somers'-town. The prisoner and her husband lodged in my house; they had three daughters; two are married, and one worked out of the house. On Saturday, the 21st of July, about ten minutes past twelve o'clock, I remember the deceased coming home to his dinner; he appeared quite in good health; the prisoner came to me about half-past twelve o'clock, and brought a piece of pudding on a plate; she said Wittenback was very sick and bad, and she thought he was poisoned; she asked me if I thought the pudding looked as if there was anything in it. I went down stairs with something of my own, and when I came up again, I entreated her to go down to her husband; she said she could not, for she was as bad as he was: I said, "I thought you said you did not eat any of it yourself:" she said she had eaten it while I had been down stairs; she had eaten it all. I said, "What! eat it when you said your husband was poisoned?" she said I was a liar, for she never said she had poisoned him at all: nothing further passed. I asked her to take a tub down stairs with her; she said she could not then, whatever she did the next time: she then went down to vomit; she came up, and went down again with the tub; she said she had been down to vomit as she was so bad; I then saw the deceased coming up stairs; he appeared very bad, indeed; he could scarcely crawl up - she could hear what passed between him and me very plainly; she was in her room, sitting in a chair,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130014"/>near the door, which is close to the landing - I was close to the door, standing on the landing; he was coming up the stairs - it is a very small straight stair-case - I am sure she could hear what passed. I said, "Oh! Mr. Wittenback, what is the matter?" he said, "Oh! Mrs. Davis, I am very bad - I think I am poisoned;" and that he thought he was done for; that is all that passed then; I saw him vomiting; directly after that, Mrs. Sanders, the landlady, put him to bed; the prisoner was then sitting in a chair in the same room, vomiting; she said she was very bad, and that they were both poisoned; she laid down on the bed; I saw the deceased afterwards, trying to get out of his room, to go down stairs, but he could not: my husband fetched Mr. Jackson's assistant, and he administered an emetic to him - he still continued very sick: I left the room, and went to him again; just before four o'clock he called out dreadfully for help; he called me and Mrs. Sanders to rub his legs, as they were in such dreadful pain; when we got near the bed, we felt timid at rubbing them; he said, "Oh, dear, Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Sanders, are you both here?" we said Yes; he said, "Never mind my legs, for I am stone blind, I cannot see." His youngest daughter, Charlotte, was present, and went for Dr. Dillon. I proposed that Mr. Walford should be fetched; the prisoner said,"Don't fetch him, he is so dear;" I said I dare say her father would pay him when he got better, but he was not fetched: two gentlemen came from Mr. Dillon; he dozed while they were gone for; I was not present when they came. I was not in the room again till about seven o'clock, when my husband gave him some pills, which he took. The prisoner and her husband did not live exactly on very good terms, from what I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. It is understood that the deceased vomitted in the yard, do you know anything that took place afterwards in the yard? A. Mrs. Sanders' cat was afterwards very bad, and died; I did not see it partake of what had been vomitted, but I saw it in the yard: when the prisoner brought the pudding to me, she said it was a suet one - I asked where she bought the flour; she said of Mr. Smith. I heard her daughter Charlotte at home till about eleven o'clock, and she came home again after her father was bad - I saw nobody about the house except those I have named.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. She said she bought the flour at Smith's - did you know Smith? A. Yes; I know he sold flour: Mr. Jackson was first sent for about half-past one o'clock; the deceased came home to dinner about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - it was full half-past twelve when I saw the prisoner - it was a goodish bit of pudding she had in the plate - it appeared part of a suet pudding - it was about a quarter to one o'clock when I saw the deceased on the stairs; my husband was down stairs, in Mrs. Sanders' workshop, and could not hear what I said to the deceased - I am sure I have stated the very words that passed; nobody was in the house besides the deceased, the prisoner, my husband, myself, and Mrs. Sanders, who was behind, helping the deceased up stairs, when I had the conversation with him. I told her what had passed between me and the prisoner when the deceased was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not send for a medical man as soon as you heard the prisoner make the disclosure to you? A. I went down and spoke to my husband about his being bad; he went and asked him if he should fetch somebody - that was before I saw him on the stairs - the prisoner did not seem at all alarmed when she came to me with the pudding - I did not perceive any alarm at that time - it was about five minutes afterwards that she said she had eaten the rest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the husband vomiting in the yard? A. No; but I heard him, dreadfully.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you returned up stairs, did you see any pudding left in the plate? A. No; but I did not go into her room then; I was very much confused when I heard her say she thought her husband was poisoned.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up did not she appear to be labouring under the effects of poison? A. I did not perceive that she did, any further than what she said herself; she was spitting in a tub, and complaining of sickness - I saw a little froth come out of her mouth, that was all - there are only two rooms on a floor; the stair-case parts my room from theirs; she was sitting inside her room at the time the conversation passed on the stairs, with the pot in her lap; saying she was very sick - she appeared to be labouring under the effects of what she had eaten; we put her husband to bed directly - he could not stand - and she said she was unable to make the bed; they are poor people - it would be an object to them to have a cheap medical man.</p>

            . I am the last witness's husband, and lived in the same house with the deceased. I never heard him mention his name; but his fellow-workmen always called him Jem - I was at the window and saw him retching in the yard, as I looked through Mrs. Sanders's workshop window - my wife had been down to me previously; I went out to him in about three quarters of an hour - I said to him "You are very bad, and had better have a doctor;" he did not answer immediately, but said, in a few minutes,"I am; fetch me a doctor, if you please;" I went to Mr. Jackson's shop, which is about one hundred yards off - his young man came back with me; the deceased was then lying on the bed up stairs - I returned with the young man, who gave me an emetic, which I administered - it operated considerably, and after that I went to Brompton, on business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what come from his stomach in the yard? A. Yes; and I saw the cat eat of it, it turned sick almost immediately - this was before the emetic had been administered; I afterwards buried what had come from him, in the dust-heap - this was before I went to Brompton; I returned between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the deceased on the bed - the stomach-pump was being applied; he seemed much the same as when I first left him; he was very ill indeed; the gentleman gave me a box of pills, two of which I gave him about four hours after the pump had been applied - when I asked him to take them, he said he was just the same as if he had been in liquor, for his head rolled about - I had great difficulty in getting him to take the pills; he died, at twenty minutes past three o'clock in the morning - he did not work with me, but I have heard his fellow-workmen, as they passed, call him Jem whether that was his name, I cannot say.</p>

            . I keep the house in Brill-row, Somers'-town. The prisoner and her husband lived at our house for about five months - his name was Frederick. On the 21st of July, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130015"/>him come home to dinner he passed me at the door, and seemed very well indeed - he went up stairs. I saw him again at about twenty minutes before one, retching violently in the yard; I went to him, and asked what was the matter; he said he was very ill, through eating pudding for dinner; I asked if he felt ill before he came home - he said No; he never felt better in his life than he had that morning - I asked if he would have assistance - he said Yes; and Mr. Davis was sent for; the deceased went up stairs, I followed him up; he begged that his bed should be made - I asked the prisoner to make it; she said she could not, she was as had as him - I made the bed and helped him on it; I know they had pudding for dinner, because, as I was passing into the opposite room, I saw the prisoner with a saucepan in one hand; lifting the pudding into a plate - I saw it smoking. I was not in the room, but only peeping - their daughter had gone out about eleven o'clock that morning; she had been at home altering a spencer till then - the prisoner had come into my room between ten and eleven o'clock, to borrow a washing-tub, which I lent her; she was talking about where she had been at work in the week, and said her husband expected 10s. that night, but she wished he might get it, and she said the girl was at home altering a spencer, expecting to wear it to-morrow, "but" said she, "she little thinks what I have got in my head." I do not know what terms the deceased and the prisoner lived on - I never heard a word between them. I saw my cat go into the yard and eat some of the pudding which the deceased had vomited; it retched directly afterwards and crawled over the wall of the next garden - I saw it dead afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after the cat went over the wall did you see it? A. In the evening; Mr. Wright and another person went over and fetched it - it ate the pudding between one and two o'clock; the workmen used to call the deceased Jem - I only know that his name was Frederick, because the girl said so when the inquest was summoned,</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many rooms are there in your house? A. Four; I let one to the prisoner, and another to Davis; there is no kitchen for them, they only use their own room; the prisoner and her husband slept and lived in one room; Davis lives in the other room on the same floor.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at St. Pancras workhouse. I attended the deceased on Saturday evening, the 21st of July, about half-past seven o'clock; he had been vomiting considerably, and complained of great pain and a burning at the pit of his stomach; his symptoms accorded with what he stated; he complained of a twisting round the naval - I considered he had taken something of a poisonous nature, which acted on his stomach; the prisoner was also sick, and retching violently - I used the stomach-pump to them both; the stomach was emptied of its contents - I remained with the deceased till nine o'clock, and saw him again about eleven - I could not ascertain what the poisonous matter was; I opened the stomach after his death; it was inflamed, and the inner membrane softened - I should consider that was produced by some mineral poison; they are symptons of mineral poison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I presume you have been some years in the profession? A. Ten years. I observed accurately the state of both of them; it is possible, that if I had been there earlier, further relief might have been given - it is likely his life might have been saved; they both appeared to labour under similar symptoms - I should think, if I had not used the pump to her, she would have been a corpse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand the symptoms were described to you, and you opened his stomach? A. Yes - I used two tests to the contents of the stomach, but was unable to find any traces of arsenic or any other poison; an operative chemist has had the contents of the stomach, he is not here - I could not obtain that which was buried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing death to have been occasioned by arsenic administered so late as the pudding was, and death to have followed so soon, must not the traces of arsenic be visible? A. The stomach had been so completely emptied that there were no traces - I tried two tests on what I call the scraping of the stomach, which I extracted when I opened it; the cramp in the leg, and the loss of sight, are both symptoms of the parts being affected by mineral poison; it is possible, that the stomach may be so completely washed out, as to have no traces of poison, and that more so since the use of the pump, but generally some portion adheres to the coat of the stomach - I cannot swear that he did die of poison, or that he did not; but from all the symptoms, I believe that he did die of poison.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the man's stomach been disordered in a natural way, and a powerful emetic administered, would that have left the stomach as you describe? A. There are some emetics that would produce inflammation of the stomach, and had there been any existing inflammation at the time, it would certainly have increased it; but that would not have caused the cramp or the loss of sight. On some constitutions, three grains of tartar emetic would produce inflammation; the stomach of a hard working man, used to drink, is less liable to excitement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the specific action of mineral poison on the stomach? A. It produces inflammation of the stomach and intestines, depression of nervous energy, heat, pain throughout the whole alimentay canal, and general debility of the whole system; there will be a partial inflammation of the coats of the stomach; very frequently there will be only patches of inflammation here and there, and that was the case here; the emetic administered is not too powerful in a case of poison; four grains of tartar emetic would be a large dose, if there were no poison.</p>

            . I am out-door surgeon of St. Pancras parish. I was called in to the prisoner, between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 22d of July; the man at that time was almost in a dying state, constantly vomiting and purging; the pupils of his eyes were dilated, and his extremities quite cold - I continued with him till half-past two o'clock; it was my opinion that the symptoms were produced by mineral poison being taken into the stomach; every symptom was conformable to that idea; I was not present when his body was opened - I found it necessary to remove the prisoner to the infirmary at two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, as her symptoms were then very similar to what his had been; her extremities were cold, the pupils of her eyes dilated: she vomited and purged: her pulse was scarcely to be felt at her wrist - I had great apprehensions for the safety of her life; she did not say how she came so - I did not think it necessary to use the pump at that time - I told her my opinion of her state; she said she would rather die than recover - I asked her if she had taken any poison, or what, that I might the more easily get at the means of relief; she denied having taken any; she would certainly have died, if strong means had not been used to save her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the stomach-pump, in your opinion, a violent means to have recourse to? A. I do not think it a violent recourse in experienced hands; the emetic was a strong dose; but it is what is very often prescribed: it might produce inflammation in some cases, but in the majority of cases it would not - I have not had much experience in the stomach-pump; it might produce inflammation if used roughly, and in an injudicious way.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Supposing a person to have been vomiting for three quarters of an hour, to have the cramp and loss of sight, would the emetic administered be too strong a dose? A. Certainly not.</p>

            . I am one of the beadles of St. Pancras. After the inquest had been held, I took the prisoner to Newgate, in a chariot, on a warrant - Ley, another beadle, was with me - I had some conversation with her - I did not lead her to suppose that it would be better or worse for her, if she said any thing, or hold out either threat or promise to her in the least - I said to her, "You are aware of the situation in which you are placed" - she said, "Yes, I am" - I said, "Do you know where you are going," - she said "Yes, to Newgate" - I then said,"Don't you think you are a wicked woman for what you have done, and are you not sorry for it" - "Yes, I am," she said - I asked her what was the stuff which she bought; she said it was a white powder - I asked where she bought it; she said on the left hand side of Islington-road, between the Angel and Islington church, at a druggists or chemists - I then asked what it was put into; she said, a brown paper, - I asked her if it was asked what purpose it was for; she said for poisoning rats - I then asked, what quantity she thought there was, if it was a tea spoonful; she said "Yes, and much more" - the conversation ended here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a beadle? A. Five years. I have been a parish officer sixteen years; I did not tell her what she would say might be given in evidence against her; I put the questions, and she answered them - I gave her no warning; she appeared quite collected. I did not say that I knew all about it, or any thing of the sort; I have told you every word that I said, as near as I can recollect; Ley did not say that he knew all about it, or a word of the sort, nor did he warn her that it would be given in evidence against her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Ley join in the conversation? A. I believe he did speak one word or two, not more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever go to the Islington-road, to make inquiry? A. Ley and I went into two or three chemists' shops on the left-hand side of the road, but we could learn nothing. I should think the distance between the Angel and the church is half a mile or better.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Pancras. On the 24th of July I accompanied Hutchings to Newgate with the prisoner - I did not hold out either threat or promise to her; he asked how she could be the woman to commit herself in the way she had; she sighed, and said she was sorry for what she had done; he asked what it was that she had bought - she said it was white powder; he asked where she got it; she said at a druggist's or chemist's, between the Angel and Islington-church, and in the way we asked if she thought where she was going to - she said Yes, she was going to Newgate; that is all I remember: we have been to all the shops between the Angel and the church, and below the church. We inquired at about five shops, and could not learn any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the question, "how she could be the woman to commit herself in such a way?" A. Yes, something to that effect; I think I said, "It is a shocking thing you should commit yourself in the way you have;" that was after Hutchings asked how she could be the woman to commit herself in such a way; he asked if she was sorry for her situation. I have been an officer of St. Pancras some years; I did not tell her what she said would be given in evidence - I only asked how she could commit herself so; she was quite collected in her answers, but was in a weak state, being affected at her situation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not in a most depressed state of mind and body? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was she in such a state of mind as prevented her from understanding the questions, and answering them? A. She gave reasonable answers to my questions, and understood them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you with Hutchings all the time in the chariot? A. Yes, all the way from the workhouse to Newgate; I do not recollect any thing more that passed.</p>
               <p>MR. DILLON. Arsenic in powder is white; corrosive sublimate is also white.</p>

I do not know whether he and the watchman were at all acquainted; it did not last above five or six minutes altogether.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman, and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July, a little after two o'clock, at the corner of St. Mary's-street, against the post (it joins the workhouse;) I saw the prisoner walking up the road with the deceased and the woman; Doleman was before them - they walked within seventeen or eighteen yards of me, by the workhouse - I I heard nobody speak; I saw the prisoner throw the stone with his left hand; the watchman immediately fell; the prisoner turned round after throwing the stone, and ran away; I pursued him - a person stopped him before I got up to him, but I never lost sight of him. When I got up he asked if I could swear he was the man who threw the stone - I said I could; he said nothing further. I assisted in conveying him to the watch-house, and the deceased to the hospital. Doleman got up to him before me - it was getting towards light - the day was breaking. The prisoner seemed perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you much opportunity of seeing whether he was sober or not? A. Yes; I saw him in the watch-house; I did not notice him before - it might last four or five minutes altogether.</p>

            . I am a dealer in fruit, and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July, between two and three o'clock; I heard a cry of Stop him! Stop him! I went towards the road, to see if I could see any one running, and saw a man running from the workhouse, across the road, in a direction for the New-road - I instantly ran across the road, and secured him; he resisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130018"/>very much, and said, "Let me go - it was not me - it was not me;" that was all he said - it was the prisoner. I went afterwards with him to the the watch-house, and saw the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the last witness from him? A. I saw nobody near him till somebody came to my assistance; I just looked round me; I did not look to see if any one was near - my attention was to secure the prisoner - I delivered him to Doleman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see anybody beside the prisoner in the street? A. Not running. When I laid hold of him I saw nobody near him; Doleman came up in two minutes or a minute and a half; there was nothing to obstruct my view down the street; Baker's-row is not far from the workhouse - I could see very plainly from that distance; he was stopped at the corner of the New-road, opposite to Baker's-row, about fifty yards from the workhouse.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. - On the morning of the 24th of July, I was standing at the end of Great Garden-street, in Whitechapel-road, and heard a call of Stop thief! I ran up to where the deceased lay - I was then desired to follow the prisoner, which I did, to the corner of Cannon-street-road; when I got there he was custody - two or three men had hold of him; we brought him back by where the deceased lay, and a man sung out, "Look out for the stone;" as I came by, my foot kicked the stone - I picked it up within about two yards of where the deceased lay, and put it into my pocket; I delivered it to the officer afterwards - I looked at it at the watch-house - I saw no blood nor dirt upon it, but did not examine it close enough for that - it appeared to have been carried about for some time: it had no dust nor any thing on it, nor dirt or mud. The streets were quite dry. The prisoner did not appear the least in liquor. The deceased's name was

I am a patrol of Whitechapel, and was at the watch-house on the morning of the 24th of July, when the prisoner was brought in; Sykes delivered the stone at the watch-house; it has been in my possession ever since, and is in the same state now as it was then - there is a spot of blood on it; there was more on it, but being handled has taken a little of it off.

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. On Tuesday morning, the 24th of July, the deceased was brought there - he was completely insensible; his feet and legs were cold, and his pulse fluttering - he was evidently dying when he came in; he had one bruise on the forehead, and one above the left ear; there was a severe bruise on the forehead, and a considerable swelling - he lived about three hours; after his death I examined the head; there was a fracture of the skull, passing from about the left ear, across the base of the skull, to the right ear; there was from a pint to a pint and a half of extravasated blood on the brain - the blow above the ear was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a severe blow in front of the skull? A. Yes; as if it had come in contact with some hard substance - as if he had fallen with cousiderable violence - that was only a bruise, and would not affect his life - the skin was not broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you form a judgment how the blow above the left ear had been occasioned? A. By something striking the head; a large heavy stone, like that produced, would do it, I should think; his merely falling down would not produce such a fracture; I am satisfied his death could not arise from the fall, but from the violence applied to the head.</p>

            . We carry on business in the first floor of the Palladium Insurance-office in Cornhill; nobody sleeps in the house at night; on Saturday, the 4th of August, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I left the premises safe - there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130019"/>a quantity of woollen cloth, kerseymere, jeans, and other things, to the amount of 200l. or 300l. - I was the last person that left our part of the premises; I closed the shutter, and locked the warehouse door - and on coming down stairs locked the street door; I was the last person who left the house; I returned on the Monday following, at nine o'clock - I was the first person there; I found the lock of the street door merely on the latch, merely slammed too - it would not open without the key, but it was not locked as I had left it on Saturday night; on opening the door I found on the stairs two rollers, which had silk on them, and were in a drawer in the warehouse on Saturday night; I found the warehouse door wide open, without any marks of violence on it; the warehouse was entirely ransacked, and every thing of value gone; the papers which had covered the goods were strewed about, and nothing material was left; most of our goods had fag ends to them - I have a book in which I enter the numbers of the articles in the warehouse - it is in my own hand-writing. The value of the articles lost is about 200l. On Thursday, the 9th of August, I saw part of the goods at the Mansion-house, in possession of the officer - they are worth 30l. 7s.; two fag ends of cloth were produced at the Mansion-house, which had been attached to the goods in the warehouse on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the goods more than two women could carry? A. I cannot say; the cloth was not in whole pieces; the robbery seems to have been done with dexterity, and by somebody who knew the premises. I never saw the prisoners before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How did the door appear to have been opened? A. The lock had been picked; the goods, I should think, would require a hackney coach or two to take them away - and it would take some time to pack them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had you left the premises? A. From eight o'clock on Saturday night till Monday morning; one person could have taken the goods in that time.</p>

I went down and waited in the back parlour with her - no key came; I said, "I had better break in, or get in at the window, as the key does not come;" she said, "Well, I will go for the key;" and while she was gone the prisoner, Elizabeth, went up stairs - I had seen her before - I heard a noise, followed her up, and found her with a towel in her hand, and something wrapped in it - and some dirty linen in her hand besides; I said,"What have you there?" she replied, dirty linen; I said,"Why, let me look;" she rather refused, and I took the towel out of her hand, and in that towel, among some small pieces of cloth, I found the fag ends of a black and blue cloth, with the numbers on them - I produce them; I afterwards showed them to Mr. John Hobson - Mary Anne did not return, and I got in at the window. In that room I found some remnants of various lengths of cloths of different colours, some a yard and a half, some two and three yards long - and here is one length of fifteen yards - some was on the bed and some in a chair. Mary Anne returned, and I secured her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She returned with the key? A. I never saw the key, she had been gone about twenty minutes, when I got in at the window - I understand she is married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not some articles of female dress among the dirty linen which Elizabeth had? A. I never said there were articles among it which the parties might not like to exhibit; she had more slips of cloth, but only two were numbered; the towel was not tied up - I understand she is the cousin of the other prisoner's husband - I do not know whether she lived there.</p>

            . I am single, and live at No. 5, Stangate-street, Bishop's-walk. I know Mary Anne Dove; she has a husband: his name is Henry - I have known her for fourteen or sixteen years, and was present at her marriage; she always lived with her husband, to the best of my knowledge - I called on her in Paradise-street, about four months ago, when she was very ill; she was then living there with her husband; he was master of the house.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Ashmore, an attorney, and am subscribing witness to this agreement(producing it) it demises the house in question to Henry Dove; it was partly drawn by me - I know the husband lived in the house up to the time this transaction took place - I lodged in the house; on the 4th of August, the prisoner Elizabeth was at home with me, and on Sunday she went with me to Gravesend; we both returned to the house at eleven o'clock at night, and she remained at home all night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the house did she occupy? A. No. particular part; she slept in the middle room over the first floor - I slept in the next room to her, and am confident she was at home all night, for I could hear her speak and walk; and if she drew her breath, I could hear it; she was at home on Sunday night also; she was only visiting there.</p>

On the 8th of August I went with my father and Herdsfield to No. 9, Paradise-street; we searched the first floor middle room, which was open, and found a cupboard over the stair-case which was locked - I went down and asked Mary Anne Dove for the key; she said she had not got it, for she had lent the use of that cupboard to the person she had let the front room to - I fetched a poker out of the kitchen to break it open, and in putting the poker under the door, it ran into one of the bags, and the cochineal flowed out - there was about 300 lbs. of cochineal there - I produce samples of it - I asked her to inform me where the young man was, whom she had let the room to; she said she should answer no questions. On the 13th of August, in consequence of information, I, Herdsfield and

I have examined the samples of the cochineal found at Dove's by daylight; we prepare our cochineal by a particular process, and can say this is our property; it is in a finished state - that found at Chick's is part of the same parcel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You prepare yours by a particular process? A. We believe so - I do not know how others prepare it, but we always know our own when we see it in the market with other lots; we prepare all ours by the same mode - it differs principally in two respects - there is a better state of colour on it, a better face, and it is lighter in hand, as we call it - it has a different feel. I think I could tell one lot of our preparation from another, but not by candle light - by referring to my book I could see what quality was prepared at one time from another. I saw this cochineal in its first state, and followed it through all its different processes, and know it to have been prepared at a particular time, for a particular market, and from particular samples; the preparation is the same, but the qualities selected are different in the first instance.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where was this prepared for? A. For Chinn. I am certain that this was prepared only a few days previous to the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. VALENTINE. I know this cochineal to be what was prepared in July for China. I have seen it by daylight, and by candle-light. It was only prepared a few days previous to the robbery.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer, and know Chick - he is a shoemaker. On the evenings of the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th of July, I was at his house, and part of the day time. I went there to ask him to recommend me to work. I had come from Portsmouth, and had seen him before - I slept in his house all those nights, in the next room to him; nobody could come out of his room without going through the one I was in, nor without disturbing me - I generally got there about half-past nine or ten o'clock, and I, in a measure, spent an hour or two with him every evening; he generally got up at six o'clock in the morning - he never left the house on those nights, or I must have heard him - he had more work than common at this time, and I assisted him; I was there occasionally for three weeks after, or nearly four weeks, going to assist him; I was there on the Wednesday before he was taken; and towards the close of the evening I saw a man bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130021"/>a bag - it was Wednesday, to the best of my remembrance - it might be about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man say any thing? A. The only words I heard him mention was, "Let this remain here for a few minutes;" he might have said more, but I am rather hard of hearing - he might have said the number of minutes - the bag was left in the outer room. I went away about half-past seven o'clock - he had not come for it then - I never saw him before. I did not see the bag afterwards; it appeared to be made of strong brown linen, which I call Russia sheeting.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where do you live? A. In Bell-alley, Goswell-street. I had no residence when I slept at Chick's - I had just come to town; the rooms are very small, and only a thin partition between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there two beds? A. Why, it cannot be called a bed - it was a make-shift, to save me from a lodging - he must pass very lightly through my room not to awake me - I am very wakeful - a person might perhaps go through the room without his shoes. Chick wished the man to take the bag away - he did not open it, nor ask what it was, nor did I. Nobody could go out and come in again without my hearing them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. I thought you said your hearing was bad? A. Sometimes it is. I lodge in Bell-alley, on the first floor. I left Chick's house at eight o'clock on Sunday morning, and returned about half-past six or seven o'clock- I was absent all day; I think I can say I did not return later than seven; I keep no watch, and there is no clock, but I know the people were not out of church.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of what church? A. Out of the churches which I passed; I went up Windmill-street, and passed the Tabernacle; the people were in there - I suppose that is over about eight o'clock, but I cannot say when. I will swear I got to Chick's before eight, for after I got there I heard the people passing by, say it was eight; I was then indoors. The footpath is close to the door; I heard the parents call their children in, who were playing there, and say it was gone eight. I was talking to Chick and his wife at the time. I went to bed on Saturday about eleven o'clock - the bag was left at his house on a Wednesday, about five weeks ago - I think it was about the 8th of August - I am confident it was Wednesday; I was not there when the officers came - whether they look the same bag away I cannot say; it was left by a stout man in a jacket, but what his jacket was made of I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he wear a cocked hat, or a round one? A. Oh, it was not a cocked hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a good round hat, or a shabby one? A. That I cannot answer - he was at the door so short a time I could not observe; he put it in, and went away after saying what he did. I cannot say whether his hat was shabby or not - I do not think it was very shabby; I cannot say what his hat was, whether it was new or old; to the best of my remembrance he had a hat on, but of what sort it was I do not know - he had the bag on his shoulder - I think it was large, but what the size was I cannot say - I should think it would hold about two bushels; I do not know what cochineal is; he left it between five and six o'clock - he put it just within the door; the prisoner said,"You must not leave that here," or words to that effect; he did not throw it out of doors after him - I did not run after the man; we did not go to inform a constable; Worship-street is about half a mile off. I was there about two hours and a half that day - I went to see about some work which he had promised me, but there was none - I staid, as I had nothing to do; I made no inquiry whether such property had been lost. The man did not run away that I know of - he went away; we did not call him back. I told the prisoner's father of this on the day he was committed from the Mansion-house, as I was there; I was not inside the office. I cannot say that the prisoner ever examined the bag. When I left the house it was on the same spot as the man left it; I have not seen it since.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ on the 28th of August, as a shopman - and, in consequence of suspicion, I employed Clements, the officer. On the 30th of August the prisoner was sent to Grosvenor-square, with some goods; he left our house apparently for that purpose - after he returned I saw him in the shop - no conversation passed between us that day; I called him up into my room next day, and asked him where he had been the day previous - he said he had been to Grosvenor-square, to a lady, whom he named - I said, "Powell, of course you took the goods under your arm as usual - walked all the way there and all the way back;" he said he did. I then asked if he had not got a lodging in Carnaby-market (we had furnished him with a lodging in Greek-street) - he said he had not; Clements was present, and said, "Have you, or have you not, a lodging in Carnaby-market, Powell?" and I think he said at an eating-house - he said "Yes, I have;" Clements searched him, in my presence, and found on him three keys; I afterwards went to a house in Carnaby-market, with the prisoner and Clements, and, on going up stairs, Clements asked him which was the door - he pointed to the front room on the second floor; we went into that room, which one of the keys opened, and found two deal boxes - Clements opened them with one of the keys which the prisoner had given him, and in those boxes we found all the goods stated in the indictment, which are worth 120l. or 130l. together - I knew them to be ours directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing, did you make him any promise or threat? A. No; he said he had brought the goods there - I had given him no permission to take any goods to any lodging whatever; I have seen him write - Clements produced an inventory of these goods in his hand-writing - I think it was in one of the boxes, but I first saw it in Clements' possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were any of these the goods he was sent with to Grosvenor-square? A. No part of them - they were all our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is not the name of your parish St. Anue, Soho? A. No; I never heard of any other parish of St. Anne in Westminster - our house is in the liberty of Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the prisoner he could not he in a worse situation than he was, before he said any thing? A. No; nor any thing to that effect - I visited him after he was in custody, and questioned him. I know nothing about his being prevented from communicating with his solicitor - I know of no such order.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he said the goods were yours, and taken by him before you visited him in prison? A. Certainly.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. In consequence of directions I watched the prisoner on Wednesday, the 29th of August, and saw him come out of his masters' shop with some rolls of silk, or something in a bulk - he went to the coach-stand in Dean-street, got into a chariot, and drove to Grosvenor-square - I followed, and waited till he came out of the house - he was in there above half an hour; he returned in the same chariot to Dean-street, then got out and walked to his masters' shop. On the following morning I saw him at Mr. Sewell's, and found the keys on him; I went with Mr. Sewell to Caruaby-market, and found the property, which I produce. Mr. Sewell's account is correct - when I searched him at Mr. Sewell's I found the keys - I also found this inventory on him; it remained in my possession till we found the goods - I had not looked at it till we found the goods. I produce the paper and the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know he had been sent to Grosvenor-square on business? A. Yes; I watched him there and back.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. This paper is in his hand-writing, and is anexact inventory of the goods in the boxes; I believe every piece of goods has our mark on it; the most valuable article here is a piece, containing forty-five yards, of black Genoa satin, which I am certain of; it cost us 4s. 11d. a yard, and is worth above 6l.; here are also twenty-two yards of Genoa satin, worth 4l. 19s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you measured this black satin? A. No; it has been measured in my presence since it has been found, by one of our shopmen, who is not here; there are about forty-five yards - I will swear there are forty yards. I saw the young man count it - 4s. 11d. is the cost price; it is certainly worth more than 5l. - we took him with the highest character, as a confidential servant; we had a good opinion of him; he had been four months with us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

            . I am a laundress, and live at Hampstead with my husband. I have known the female prisoner from an infant, and her husband, since they have been married, which is eleven years or more. On the 14th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, they both came to me and continued about an hour - they both asked if I had been into the country - I said No, but I was going down on the Saturday following, if nothing happened - that I was going to St. Albans; they both said they should very much like to go down with me, for they had not been down in the country for nine years before (the woman was born at St. Albans). I asked Mr. Gunyon if he had had a death in his family - he said No; that a friend had sent him some money - I asked that question because I knew they were very poor before, and I thought it not in their power to go into the country - they left; he said they would come up again on the Wednesday, which they did, between two and three o'clock; they both sat down, and Mr. Gunyon pulled out this purse with money in it, and said there were forty sovereigns in it - his wife asked him to give it to her, which he refused - she then said he had better leave it in my care, and he gave the purse into my hand; his wife took it and opened it, she put in a 10l. note, and said that made 50l.; she gave me the purse; I locked it up in a drawer - they stopped till the evening. I saw no more of them till Saturday morning, when they came to me again and had breakfast; Mrs. Gunyon took five sovereigns from the purse; we put it back into the same place again, under lock and key - we left Hampstead that morning and went to St. Albans, remained there until Monday morning at eight o'clock, and returned to Hampstead - they staid with me till evening, and then went home; they did not take the money with them. I told them I was coming to town on Tuesday morning on business; they said they would meet me at the Blue Posts, public-house, Tottenham-court-road. I waited there an hour for them; they did not come, and I went to their lodging in Monmouth-street, and found only a strange woman and their eldest child there; they were in custody, I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything said about the money when they left you on Monday? A. Not a word; I was not to bring it to town, and did not - they had said they were going to take a little shop, and should like me to go with them; we were all at my mother's, at St. Albans, part of the time - the male prisoner is a waiter, or something at hotels. I did not know of the woman being employed at Crosby's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the prisoners a lodging of their own? A. Yes; they deposited the money with me of their own accord. I never heard any thing against either of them before.</p>

            . I am a Marlborough-street officer. On the 18th of August I first heard of this robbery: I made inquiry; and, in consequence of suspicion, I and Ballard took the prisoners into custody, at No. 68, Monmouth-street, on the Monday night, between ten and eleven, or rather later; we had been there at eight o'clock, but they were from home; we told them we took them on suspicion of stealing Bank notes from Miss Mason; they said we were welcome to search, for they knew nothing of them - we searched, and found no notes, but some new bed linen and wearing apparel; we asked how they became possessed of it - the woman said she had a 5l. note sent her from a Mrs. Pears, her sister, at Clapham, and had purchased them with that; we took them to the watch-house, and next day (21st) they were examined and remanded till the following Tuesday - we went to Mrs. Pears, at Clapham. I had information and went to Mrs. Sidwell, on the Tuesday afternoon, at Hampstead, with Ballard. Mrs. Sidwell gave Ballard thirty-five sovereigns and a 10l. note; on the following day we saw the male prisoner; and told him we had get 45l. from Mrs. Sidwell, and that he need not answer any questions unless he thought proper; that he might use his own discretion - I neither threatened or promised him anything; he then said he had received the money from his wife on the Monday morning - we then asked what he had done with the 50l. note; he said he had taken it to a Mrs. Aglen, in Wellclose-square, and sold it for forty sovereigns - we asked if the knew where any of the other notes were changed - he said he did not; after that we saw his wife, and told her not to answer any questions unless she thought proper; she then said she had taken the money - that she had changed a 10l. note in Monmouth-street. another 10l. note at Waterloo-house, and a 5l. note in Oxford-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130024"/>that all she had taken was 85l. and that she thought at the time that the 50l. note was a five.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell them that whatever answers they gave, you must give in evidence? A. No; their apartments appeared in a most distressing state.</p>

            . I am an officer, and assisted Goddard in taking the prisoners: we told them the woman was suspected of having stolen 100l. from Miss Mason, of George-street; she said she knew nothing about it; I said it was my duty to search; she said she was surprised Miss Mason should suspect her, and we were welcome to search - they were in bed at the time; I told them to remain in bed while we searched - we found a new bolster, new blankets, a mattress, and in the female prisoner's pocket were two sovereigns and some silver; their clothes appeared to be new; I asked how she came by the new things; she said she bought them with a 5l. note, which her sister, of Clapham, had given her - we took them to the watch-house. I went to Hampstead, and received thirty-five sovereigns and a 10l. note from Sidwell; we then went to the prisoners, and saw the man first - we held out neither threat nor promise to him. I told him we were come to ask him questions, and he was to do as he pleased about answering them; I thought it my duty to tell him first that I had thirty-five sovereigns, a 10l. note, a silk dress, and a lace cap and collar, from Sidwell; I did not say I must state what he said. I then said, "What have you done with the 50l. note?" he said, "I have sold it." - "For what?" said I; he said for forty sovereigns - I asked to whom; he said Mrs. Aglen, who lived at a butcher's shop in Wellclose-square, and he must leave his wife to tell where the rest was changed; he said, "You say I took the notes, but I did not;" I said, "I cannot say you took them - when did you first have them?" he said in the morning - I asked at what time he got to Miss Mason's house; he said between twelve and one o'clock - that he had been at Battersea, and got home late. I then went to his wife and said she must do as she pleased about answering my questions, that we had got the things from Sidwell, and her husband had said he had changed the 50l. note, and left it to her to say what she had done with the others, but she must do as she pleased: she then said she had changed a 10l. note at Waterloo-house, where she bought a silk dress and collar, a 10l. note in Monmouth-street, and a 5l. note in Oxford-street, where she bought the bolster, blankets, and mattress: I said, "What have you done with the others?" she said there was no more; I said there was 100l.; she said No, there was only 85l., and she thought the 50l. note was a 5l., and she gave it to her husband on the following morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were in custody when you examined them? A. Yes; I did it of my own accord.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you present when they were examined before Sir George Farrant? A. Yes: I saw their examinations taken, heard it read over to them, and saw them sign them; Sir George said, "What have you to say for yourselves? you need not say anything unless you like" they said it was true, and they were very sorry. Sir George asked if they objected to sign it if it was taken down; they said the case was bad enough, and they hoped he would have mercy on them - it was taken down, and I saw them both sign this paper, (looking at it) and here is Sir George Farrant's signature to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you given evidence of the confession they made to you before they signed this? A. I had. (Read.)</p>
               <p>Charles Gunyon says "he admits receiving the 50l. Bank note, and a 10l. Bank note, from his wife, last Monday fortnight, and sold the 50l. note to a woman in Wellclose-square, for forty sovereigns." J.C. GUNYON.</p>
               <p>Sophia Gunyon voluntarily says "Last Sunday fortnight she went up to Miss Mason's bed-room in the evening, and found on the floor a roll of papers, which she picked up, and then discovered that they were Bank notes; she put them into her pocket, and next day gave her husband the 50l. note.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the whole house your's? A. I pay 200l. a year for the house, with the exception of the shop, which was let before I came there - it is the house I live in; I have a separate door and separate passage. The people of the shop cannot come into my part of the house, nor into my passage; there is no communication whatever from the shop, or the room behind it, to my house. The prisoner came to me with an excellent character; I never doubted him in any way - he has a wife, and, I believe, four children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I always maintained a good character, and was never even before a Magistrate. Unfortunately I was a long time ill, and had no idea of the danger I was running into by doing this; I was much reduced by my long illness, having a wife and family. I had some very severe surgical operations, which reduced my health, and injured the spine of my back. Under these circumstances I beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the 21st of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along the Strand, and was accosted by a well-dressed woman, who stated that she was very thirsty, and requested I would give her a pint of porter; I agreed to give her half-a-pint, and to take half-a-pint myself; she introduced me into a public-house, which I understood to be the <placeName id="t18270913-17-crimeloc113">York Arms</placeName>

I sat down in the tap-room, to drink my half-pint of beer - she had her ginger-beer in the same room (the house I understand to be in <placeName id="t18270913-17-crimeloc114">Shire-lane, close to the Strand</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18270913-17-crimeloc114" type="placeName"

I was immediately afterwards followed into the house by Jones, Palmer, and several other women - they sat down in another box by themselves, several of them; I drank my beer, and Jones, with a woman who is not in custody, got up, and crossed the room to me- I suppose I had been about ten minutes in the house - they crossed the room, and seized me by the throat, as I at oh the bench; the other woman assisted in holding me, while I was robbed by Jones - Palmer was one of them; there were five or six of them; Jones and the other held me by the throat, the others by the arms and legs: Jones held my throat with her right hand, and thrust her left-hand into my waistcoat pocket - I extricated my left hand from one of the women, and for hold of the bottom of my pocket, to secure my property. Jones drew her hand out, and got eight sovefeign out of sixteen; eight still remained in my pocket, they trust me down on the settle, knocked my hat off, and ran away, leaving me there. I proceeded towards the door, to secure them, and was met by Riley - I stated to him that I had been robbed; he demanded the money for half-a-pint of beer, and the ginger-beer before I should go out - I told him I had been robbed, and to let me go and get an officer, and he should have his demand; he said, "D - n all about robbery - give me the money for the beer" - and after detaining me for a minute or a minute and a half, he let me go into the street, without paying him; I returned into the house, having no hat on - he met me in the tap-room, brought my hat to me, and again let me go without paying. I proceeded to find an officer - that is all I know of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Riley at the time these women were on you? A. I asked him where he was - he said he had been out to get change - I did not see him at the time; he was not in the way; he at first said he had been out to get change for his master, and then said it was for a person in the neighbourhood. He was certainly not in the room at the time of the robbery. I asked the landlord where he was at the time - he said he was asleep, and had left a child to mind the bar. There was nobody in the tap-room except those who attacked me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A carman and green-grocer. I keep a horse and cart. I had just received the money at Hopkinson's, the banker, in Regent-street. A gentleman in Regent's-park had paid me a cheque on them. I had never seen the welldressed woman before - I met her about the end of Shire-lane; I was never up the lane before - it comes into the Strand, on the other side of Temple-bar. I did not know it was a bad house, or a bad lane; I only went there to get the beer. She appeared a decent woman - I did not give it a thought whether she was an immodest woman. I believe there were five or six women in the room altogether - I will swear there was not a dozen; I could not halloo out, because I was nearly choked. Riley, the waiter, brought me the beer. I had never seen Jones before - I did not notice her being pregnant - I was as sober as I am now. I was too much confused to notice who was in the bar. When I ran out Riley would not let me out of the room - I did not go to the bar. I had never seen any of the women before, to my knowledge. The prisoners had three examinations. I told the same story to the Magistrate; Mr. Halls said I had contradicted myself, but on referring to his writing he found he had made a mistake - that was not about this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, at one examination, say Jones robbed you while another held your throat? A. I say so now, but she held my throat with one hand, while she robbed me with the other. Directly I got outside the house I looked about, and returned to the house for my hat: the party were all gone out - I had seen them go out, and the moment I was let out I followed. I do not know whether there is a watch-house near. I have been in the Strand a thousand times, but know no watch-house there. I have noticed the patrols about the Strand, but till this happened I did not know they were officers. The lane I was robbed in is west of Temple-bar - I have not been there since, except with the officer, to take Riley. They call it Little Shire-lane. He conducted me to the house the robbery took place in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PALMER. Q. Can you swear to my being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130026"/>one of them? A. Yes; I never doubted about you or Jones - it was about some others who were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you identify me till the officer said half a sovereign was found in my mouth? A. I was put into a room where the prisoners wait to be examined: there was above forty persons in the room. The officer desired me to go and see if I could identify any of them - I turned round, and said they were two of them. They had not told me half a sovereign had been found on her.</p>



               <p>COURT. Q. After this transaction, you speak of something else happening - had you, after the first occasion, seen Palmer till she was in custody? A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On Saturday, the 21st of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I had information of this robbery; I took Palmer about half-past eight, or near nine o'clock - I took Jones about eleven, at the King's Head public-house, Strand, and told her about the robbery at Temple-bar; she said, thank God she was not there, she had been out charing all day, that they had agreed to give her 3s. for her day's work, but she pleased them so well, they gave her 4s. - and as we went to the watch-house, she admitted that it was all false what she had said, and that she was there, and had done the robbery by way of a lark - I had not used any threat or promise to her - I took Riley on Monday morning, the 23d, at the York Arms public-house, Little Shire-lane - there is a court out of Picket-street, into the lane; it is on the west side of Temple-bar - Great Shire-lane is on this side the Bar; the York Arms is in the County - I had not seen the prosecutor till the Monday morning, when he came to the office, and went with me to the York Arms; he could not point out the house for some time; he did not know exactly where it was situated - I found half a sovereign tied in a handkerchief, which Palmer had round her neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Little Shire-lane in a straight line with Great Shire-lane? A. No, it turns to the left - I go up a court in the Strand directly into it; one side of Great Shire-lane is in Middlesex; the prosecutor had given information to two officers in the Strand at the time.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. When this man came in, an old gentleman was there, drinking half a pint of a beer - he called for three bottles of ginger beer, and a glass of porter - I went to the old gentleman, and said, "I wonder what you was going to do with the ginger beer;" the old gentlemen said, he had got three girls who had gone backward; when he had drank the beer I asked him for the money; the old gentleman said I need not be afraid; one of the young women came, and asked me to get change for a sovereign - I went out for it, and as I came back the old gentleman said, "That man has been robbed, you had better go after him, and give him his hat" - I went and met him, gave him his hat, and asked him for 101/2d.; he said "Show me the house, and I will give you any thing" - I showed him the house; he would not give me the money, and I would not let him go out again; he must have been intoxicated, or he would have known the house.</p>
               <p>Palmer put in a written defence, declaring her innocence, and that she had not been in the house at all that day.</p>

            . I was a patient in the Westminster Hospital; the deceased was brought in there on the 22d of July, about eleven o'clock - I slept in the next bed to him; he died on Friday morning, the 27th, about a quarter past ten o'clock - about an hour and a quarter before he died, he called me to his bed-side, and said, "Martin, I am dying;" I asked why he thought so; he said he was sure of it, from the difference of the appearance in his flesh, that it was mortifying - I then asked if he knew who the party was that gave him the ill-usage; he made no answer then, and I asked him who the man and woman were who came to see him on the 24th, because I would send to let them know he was dying; he said he wished I would, that he lived at a china-shop, next door to a green-grocer's shop, in Strutton-ground, Westminster, and his name was Ward - I asked if he would tell me what was the reason of Ward's giving him the ill usage; he had said he was violently kicked and beat about in his back and left side by Ward; that he was first knocked down and violently kicked; I asked the cause of it; he said he had taken two baskets from Ward's premises that morning, but he did not know they belonged to Ward, or he should not have taken them: but he thought they belonged to the green-grocer next door; he said Ward came to his premises to know what he had stolen them for, that Ward was in a great passion, but he begged his pardon: that Ward went away, but came a second time, and ill-used him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You asked if you should inform the person who came to see him on the 24th? A. Yes; that was Ward; he did not bring him tea and sugar - some was sent on Monday - I do not know who by; a tea-pot, bason and spoon also came - I cannot say they were from Ward; he did not tell me; he had denied taking the basket, the first time Ward went to him; I never saw Ward at the hospital but once; he stopped about five minutes; he seemed very civil and quiet - I thought he was a friend of his; a young woman came with him - I do not know her name.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at the Westminster Hospital. Mosland was brought there on Sunday, the 22d of July; I saw him directly he came - he was in a dangerous state; I found very severe blows had been inflicted on his side, and inflammation was coming on; he died on the Friday - I opened him on the Saturday, and found a great deal of bloody fluid in the cavity of the abdomen, and a rupture of the spleen on the left side, just above the kidney. In my judgment it was occasioned by a violent blow - it doubtless caused his death - a violent blow on the side with the fist might have done it; the treatment described by Barnett was sufficient, in my judgment, to account for the appearances which caused his death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that his brother's children's clothes had been stolen by some boys, whom the deceased was in the habit of fostering, and on losing his baskets he went there, hoping to hear of the clothes, when an altercation ensued, and the deceased said he knew where they were, but would not tell him, and, irritated by this, he struck him, but had he supposed him to be hurt, he would have procured him assistance - but when he left him he was standing up, and did not appear hurt; and that he had sent him what was in his power, to make him comfortable at the hospital, and on visiting him, the deceased said he could not blame him.</p>

I have known the prisoner five or six years; he sent me to take the deceased some tea, sugar, butter, a roll, and biscuits, but they would not admit the roll and biscuits at the gate; he said he was much better; and told me to tell the prisoner he should like to see him, for he freely forgave him - and he should have done the same himself. I accompanied the prisoner next day to see him - he appeared anxious about him, and went there again after he died.</p>

I took compassion on her, and asked her to go home with me to my lodgings - she did so; we went to bed together - I put my watch under the pillow, with the seals and chain; I cannot say whether she saw me put it there - I went to sleep, and awoke about six o'clock in the morning - she was then gone, and my watch also, with the chain, seals, and key - they were worth 7l. or 8l.; I had worn the chain four or five years - it was a gold chain, three gold seals, a gold key, and a silver watch, which cost 9l. 10s. by itself, about twelve months before; she had not told me she was going - I did not know where she lived then - I saw my watch on the Monday following. at Mr. Joyce's, pawnbroker, of Euston-street, Euston-square; I had advertised it, and sent hand-bills round to the pawnbrokers. I happened to go into Joyce's shop, and asked if he had such property - and he produced the watch and appendages, all complete, as I had lost it - I had not given it to her - I am certain of her person; I did not lock my bed-room door - Mr. Finch lives in the house; I only have the second floor front room, and I am single.</p>

On Friday, the 10th of August, some time in the morning, I saw her come home - I was then in bed. I saw her about eleven or twelve o'clock - she asked me to go and pledge a watch for her, and told me where to go. I do not know where it was - but it was in the neighbourhood; she told me to ask three sovereigns on it, but I made a mistake, and asked for two; she sent me back, and I got another on it - I gave her the three sovereigns, and the duplicate.

I gave her 2l. with a ticket for the watch, chain, and seals - she returned in less than a quarter of an hour, and asked for another pound, saying, she had made a mistake. I gave her another, as it was worth the money. On the Monday following, Byers brought a hand-bill - I told him I had got the watch - he claimed it; it answered the description on his bill. I went with him and the officer, that evening, to No. 26, Euston-crescent, and Byers pointed out the prisoner, among four or five other women there - Williams was not there; the prisoner denied it strongly. I said she had better tell the truth; the property is worth 5l. in the trade. I do not think it would fetch more - I think that the full value.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 22d of August I left their banking-house in Fenchurch-street, at four o'clock in the afternoon, and then had a pocket-book in my inside coat pocket, containing bills of exchange for 53l. 7s. 5d., 150l., 80l., 65l. 2s. 6d., 200l., 25l. 35l. 13s. 6d., 25l., also a 300l. and a 100l. promissory note - they were all in my pocket-book, and my coat was buttoned up from the time I put the book into my pocket, till I came to the end of Copthall-buildings, where I saw five or six men standing, as if in conference with each other, they were close to the posts at the end of Copthall-buildings, by the passage which leads into Bell-alley - I did not observe the features of any of them; as I was going between the posts, a hustling began among them, and they stopped me; I could not go forward nor backward, as I was surrounded by them (I knew nothing of the party at all) - I was hustled for some time by these men, and at last they got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130029"/>so violent, that I really became apprehensive for the consequences of it - I was quite frightened; when they had hustled me for a small space of time, with violence, then they all dispersed in a moment; they all ran off. I immediately looked down, and found my coat had been opened - I felt for my pocket-book, and that was gone, with the contents. I have not since seen it, or any of the property in it; I have no recollection of the features of any of the persons. I gave an alarm, and said I was robbed of my pocket-book; I saw the prisoner in custody within ten minutes - Brady, I think, had him - only one person was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you a son or relation named James? A. I have a son, James, about twenty-five years of age; this happened about a quarter-past four o'clock in the afternoon; the place is a considerable thoroughfare. I could not tell at what time of the transaction the pocket-book was taken. I suppose it was when the violent hustling began - it all happened in less than two minutes.</p>

            . I am a member of the Stock Exchange. I was passing from Copthall-court into Bell-alley, about a quarter-past four o'clock on this afternoon; there are some posts there - I saw Mr. Sharpe, and observed a very unnecessary confusion in passing; there were several men there, and the prisoner among them - it was not till the party separated that I could see Mr. Sharpe, he being a short man, and so surrounded by them; I could not at that instant distinguish him - about five or six persons were surrounding him, besides others who were passing at the time, and had nothing to do with it. I heard a person observe, "The conduct of those men is more like pick-pockets than anything else." I was waiting to get by at the time, and hearing that observation, I took more notice; Mr. Sharpe appeared very much agitated; the persons separated rather in haste; there was only one I could fix my attention on, and that was the prisoner. I can speak to him with the greatest confidence, he was not so far from me as I am from your Lordship; I asked Mr. Sharpe if he had lost any thing - he felt his pockets, and said "I have lost my pocket-book." I asked him if any thing of consequence was in it; he said between 200l. and 300l. I instantly left him, and ran back through the posts, and caught the prisoner by the arm; he was walking at a rapid pace, and two others of the gang were also walking rapidly. I said to the prisoner, "I observed you there under very suspicious circumstances, the old gentleman has lost his pocket-book, and you must not go till you give some account of yourself," he hesitated at the moment and appeared to doubt that I should suspect him. I said, I certainly would not lose sight of him, and resisttance was in vain; he then professed great readiness to accompany me. Mr. Clarke immediately came up, and said"I am sure that is one of the men;" the prisoner was very near, and I suppose must have heard it - I think he was nearer to the prisoner than I am to your Lordship. Mr. Clarke did not speak very loud - I begged of Mr. Clarke to run after the two other men, but none were secured; the prisoner walked down with me to the end of the court - I walked by his side, and while I was speaking to Mr. Clarke he had walked on rapidly some paces, I followed him again and overtook him, and soon after met Brady, the officer, and gave him in charge - he took him into a shop. I am quite confident he is one of the persons who surrounded Mr. Sharpe - when he was in the shop, he accounted for his being seen stooping down, by saying some of the party had lost a few shillings. I had not seen him stooping down - he said he had stooped down because himself, or one of the party, had dropped a few shillings; I will not say his exact words, but it was to that effect - that himself or some of the party had dropped a few shillings; whether it was himself, or one of the party, I will not undertake to say - I had seen no stooping down myself, not so as to swear to it - he was taken to the Mansion-house, and refused to give any account of it. I have not the slightest doubt of his being one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where you saw Mr. Sharpe did you come up with the prisoner, when he was walking? A. I should think about fifty yards, it might be seventy; I had asked Mr. Sharpe if he had lost anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your attention at that time drawn off to Mr. Sharpe? A. Certainly - I did not see any person do anything - I think I saw a person stooping, but will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed some persons who were walking quickly? A. Yes; their backs were towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw Mr. Sharpe, you had your eye on the party? A. Yes; the instant the observation was made about their conduct I spoke to Mr. Sharpe - I saw the prisoner before I spoke to Mr. Sharpe, it was long enough to distinguish him, it might be a quarter of a minute at the least - eight or nine persons might be collected, waiting to get through the posts like myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how easy it is to mistake a man's face? A. Yes; but it is not easy to mistake a yellow handkerchief, and boots, much larger than are usually worn, without tops to them, and a tall man like him - he had a yellow handkerchief, and boots of a peculiar character, which attracted my attention, as well as his features, and his back more particularly. I saw his back and face also; not both at the same instant, but during the time - the crowd was very close together; the prisoner was an outside one.</p>
               <p>Q. When a crowd is collected, can you see who has boots on? A. Yes; he being outside the crowd, but one of them; I noticed his being a very tall, powerful man; I was going to remoustrate with them at first, for pushing in that way against an old gentleman - and when I heard about pick-pockets, I noticed them more - I took hold of him, but when he consented to go quietly I let go of him; he walked on before me eight or ten yards, and I came up to him; he walked away at a very rapid pace - he did not run - the others ran away when they got to the corner; they were all strangers to me - whether they were acquainted together I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see them do anything? A. I saw them very active in surrounding the gentleman; I saw him among the crowd, very active in opposing resistance to any one who attempted to come through the posts, as I thought, but when they separated and the cry of Pickpockets! was given, then I found what they had been about - a considerable quantity of silver was found on him; I believe nearly 3l. but none of the property - Mr. Sharpe was agitated, and said he had lost 200l. or 300l.; but directly he got to the Mansion-house, he said 1200l.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the London Life<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130030"/>Assurance-office. I was passing in Copthall-buildings at the time in question, and noticed a number of persons standing round by the iron posts: I was informed Mr. Sharpe had been robbed of his pocket-book - I did not see him at first, but when I heard he had lost his pocket-book, I saw him - I saw three persons going in the direction which the prisoner went, and several persons going towards Bell-alley: I distinguished the prisoner's person quite plain - When I first saw him he was at a less distance than I am from your Lordship. I joined Mr. Edwards in the pursuit, and overtook the prisoner. I then went to see after two others, but did not succeed. I walked with Mr. Sharpe to the Mansion-house - the office was closed. I attended the examination next morning, and had no doubt of the prisoner's person then, nor have I now. I have no doubt of his being one of the men I saw at the posts at the time Mr. Sharpe was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand that your attention was first directed by hearing it said Mr. Sharpe was robbed? A. My attention was first directed by seeing a number of persons together. I directly put my watch into my pocket for safety; that was before I heard Mr. Sharpe had lost his pocket-book. I suppose seven or eight persons were collected - I was not in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a crowd? A. There were seven or eight persons round the posts. The passage is not more than four feet wide, I should think: they completly blocked up the passage - I could not see beyond them.</p>
               <p>Q. When they dispersed did not ten or twelve go away together? A. No - I saw no persons walking but myself and Mr. Edwards: he (Mr. Edwards) was close to the crowd; I was further from them.</p>

            . I am a constable of Broad-street Ward. I was going down Broad-street, and saw a crowd of people coming up: I asked a person what was the matter - they sent me down to Copthall-court, but I met Mr. Edwards in Broad-street: he said, "This man has hustled a gentleman, and he has been robbed:" he charged the prisoner with it. I secured him, and took him into a grocer's shop, and searched him, but found none of the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to observe that I was passing accidentally through the court at the time: several other persons seemed obstructing the passage; I passed, as several others did, and did not notice any thing that was going on - I passed through the crowd, through three or four persons - I got through, and was going along another street, out of the passage, when a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had not come through that court - I said Yes: he said a gentleman had lost his pocket-book there - I said I knew nothing about it; he said it was very suspicious; I said, "If you think it was me, you are at liberty to search me, or I will go any where with you." That is all I know of the transaction.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. I am not certain that the prisoner said he himself was stooping down.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, but stated they had known nothing of him for the last three or four months.</p>

I found in a box there, (of which she had the key.) my purse, with other things; the box was not locked; it contained nothing else but her apparel - I am confident of the purse, having made it myself - it was empty; she knew it to be mine as well as I did - she had frequent opportunities of seeing it; she was present, and directly it was found, she knelt down and begged forgiveness, and said she would never do the same again. I had simply said,"Oh! Emma, how could you do this?" the box was not hers; she had none, and used this of mine, which I had no objection to.</p>

We were very comfortable all day Saturday and Sunday; we breakfasted and dined together - I had no dispute with him at all - I think I laid down about half-past one, it might be a quarter of an hour later when he came and struck me - I looked up when I heard him stir - he had been very bad in his head a month before Christmas, and he went to Bethnal-green mad-house about a week after Christmas - he used to get out, and walk about, talking all manner of stuff, and he would get out of bed in the night; we were then taking care of Mr. Payne's house in Earl-street, for six months; he was sent to the mad-house from there - I got an order from the churchwardens to have him out of the mad-house, when he had been there a fortnight, as I thought he was not well used; he was not discharged as well (he came back to Mr. Payne's); he seemed unhappy when I went to see him, and said he could not eat anything that was in the house; he was very ill in his bowels after he came out; nothing but blood came from his bowels, and all like pieces of flesh; two doctors attended him; he had got well enough to go out before this happened - Mr. Bracker, the tailor, of Bell-alley, employed him; he only worked a little at a time; we worked at home - I used to fetch and carry it home - I had given him a sovereign on the Saturday, to go and buy something for dinner, and when he came in, I asked for the change - he said he could keep it as well as me - I did not care how long he kept it, so that he did not go drinking with it; he gave me 6s. of it in the afternoon, and 8s. on Sunday morning; he said he should do no good with it, and when he got a little liquor, he gave away a shilling among half-pence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know how old he is? A. I dare say he is full seventy-two or seventy-three; we always lived very happy together. I am sure I saw him come to me with the poker - he would not go out to drink sometimes for three or four months: he was a very bad temper when he got drunk: he has been flighty ever since I knew him, whenever he got beer - he had no money in his pocket when I gave him the sovereign - he said he had a few halfpence; he had not been drinking the night before, but I knew he had that morning. I had the care of Payne's house, and I always took the work home, and received the money for it every Saturday. He had earned the sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he been doing when he was sent to the mad-house? A. He got drinking a little gin, and that drove him raving mad; he got a mob round him, and they were afraid he would do some mischief; I applied to the churchwardens to take him to his own parish, and me to mine, about five weeks before this happened; as I was afraid of personal violence - our parishes are only a mile apart. The churchwarden promised to come, and the very Monday after this happened he came to take him away. I had not changed my mind about his going - I thought if he was not able to work if I was down there I could assist him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, during this five weeks, think it unsafe to leave him at large? A. I did go away from him once or twice, but he was so unhappy I was obliged to go back to him; I left him because when he was in that way, he was so hot in his temper, I did not know what might happen. I thought he was attached to me, and wanted to see me again; I had said nor done anything to provoke him - he had no accident with his head while I knew him, but I have heard that he had, from his brother, who is dead. He had a daughter living in Peter-street, Sun-street, and a brother in Rosemary-lane; he always treated me kindly - we were affectionate together. I did all I could to make him comfortable. I have only one child. I am quite blind.</p>

            . I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Bartholomew Hospital. This woman was brought there on Sunday, the 27th of May - I examined her about four o'clock that day - there were four wounds on her head, and a contused wound across the nose, and a contused wound on her left hand, which fractured two of her fingers - the contused wound across the nose had deprived her of sight; two of the wounds were on the back of the head, and two on the left temple - they had the character of incised wounds. I should have said those four wounds had been done by a cutting instrument she has lost her sight from a rupture of the coats of the eye: the crystal fluid has escaped. I do not see the least probability of her recovering her sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Should you have called them incised wounds without the word "character" if you had not heard how it was done? A. Yes; there was a slight confusion, but not sufficient to call them contused; they had more the appearance of incised wounds - it is possible they might be made with a poker and yet have the character of incised wounds - I should call them cuts.</p>

            . The prisoner and the prosecutrix lodged with us for a month or five weeks. On Sunday, the 27th of May, I saw the prisoner in the morning, about nine o'clock, and saw him go out of the street door, between two and three o'clock; he said, "I have done for her:" I understood him to say so - he was talking to himself, as he went out - he did not address himself to me. I, my little girl, and my son went up to her room, and found her sitting on the bed, with her face covered with blood, leaning against the wall, with her hands up, wiping down the blood; she was so covered with blood I could not see her face till she wiped it down: she said something to me; Rice, a lodger, came into the room. My son took up the poker, and looked at it, in consequence of what she said - there was a little blood and hair on it, and it was bent. I sent for a surgeon, who washed her head with sponge; I saw it bleeding very much, and a place on the side of the head, which looked like cuts, bled. I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken. I had observed nothing particular in his conduct while at our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him when he used these words? A. I was in my room, but the door was open. I saw him go along the passage, and thought he went rather quicker than usual; my room door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130033"/>opens into the passage; the surgeon who came was somebody from Mr. Robarts, of Sun-street; he cut a great deal of hair off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any noise or cry to lead you up stairs? A. My little girl called me, and as I was going up, I heard the woman cry; all the four wounds on her head were bleeding.</p>

I fetched the prisoner's dinner home on this day, and he told me to fetch the beer - when I brought it, Mrs. Jones gave me a halfpenny; I went down stairs, and after that I saw the prisoner in the passage, and heard him say, "I have done for her;" I went up stairs with my mother, as I heard Mrs. Jones crying.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to him when he said this? A. Nearly close to him; he must have seen me - any body might hear him.</p>

            . I was at my father's, and saw the prisoner going out at the front door, about half-past two; I think the words he said were, "She has got it now - I have done for her." I heard a faint cry a few seconds before that, and thought it was a neighbour beating a child; I ran up stairs, and saw Mrs. Jones sitting on the bed, with her head against the wall; the bed was on the ground - she was covered with blood; I could not discern her features; there appeared three or four cuts on the head - they were clotted with blood, and her hair matted together; I could not tell whether they were cuts. I took up the poker - it was bent, and had a little blood and hair on it; it is here - the edges are very sharp; I think the one produced is the same.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of May, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Lamb-alley, Long-alley, and saw the prisoner coming towards home; as soon as he saw me, he turned back again. I had heard of this, and went after him - I overtook him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said,"Old gentleman, I want you;" he said, "Is my poor wife dead?" I said I did not know, but I believe she was; he said he was most sure she must be, and said, "The Lord have mercy upon me, I am done for - and I hope the Lord will receive her soul; but she should not have aggravated me so - I did it in the heat of passion." I asked how he could be so cruel as to beat her so; he said he did not know, he had done it in his passion; I asked if he had done it all with the poker; he said, Yes; I asked if he had not a knife; he said he had done it all with a poker. I then took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said she should not have aggravated him so? A. Yes; and that he had asked her for some money, but she would not give him any, and that caused a few words between then.</p>

               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his defence, entered into a long and unconnected account of his having fetched some victuals on the Saturday, and his feeling strange in his head; that on Sunday, after dinner, the prosecutrix had presented a stick at him, by which he understood her to mean he was to go about his business - that she then gave him some rum, and said she had done with him, and on his asking the reason she said it was useless to talk to a madman, and that she laid down - He then proceeded "As I sat by the fire something came over - I could give no account of it; I could get no command of myself till I walked a mile and a half or two miles - I then thought I had done wrong, and was sorry for it, and have been sorry from that time to this;" that he got a bed in Wentworth-street, but could not sleep; and about three o'clock in the morning went to give himself up - and that at times he had no command of himself.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live in Earl-street. The prisoner and his wife took care of my house from the 1st of September to April, this year. I believe, at times, he was decidedly insane; shortly after he came to my house I went into the kitchen one morning - he asked how I did; I said I had a giddiness in my head; he said he had been affected many years in his head, and told me a story about his walking over different bridges; and said, "I was very ill a long time, but once, when I got to the centre of London-bridge I met the devil, I took him in my arms, and threw him over into the water;" I said, "If you killed the devil, how did you feel then?" he said, "I was quite well then, and came home to my work;" I considered him then not right in his head; I had him sent from my house to Warburton's, about the beginning of January, which was some time after this conversation; he used to talk irrational and incoherent, for a fortnight or three weeks before I had him moved; I had seen him decidedly deranger, and was afraid to keep him in the house - his wife tells me he expressed a wish to kill his brother - and I have heard him say very bad things about his brother; I was obliged to keep his brother down in my shop on the morning he was taken away; it is my full impression that at times he is insane.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him after he came from Warburton's? A. He returned in a fortnight or three weeks to my house, and stopped till April; he was extremely ill in bodily health, and had a doctor attending him daily; he talked rational when he came back, but I avoided his company then; I was always afraid of him, as he still talked strange things, which made me sure he was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you under the same impression as to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130034"/>the state of his mind, when he left you in April? A. Yes; I did not think him in his right mind; he was always very fond of this woman, and she of him; they seemed to live comfortably together; when he was taken from my house, he said, "Mr. Payne, I hope you will take care of my wife"- I then thought she was his wife.</p>

            . I am churchwarden of St. Andrew by the Wardrobe. I first saw the prisoner on the 3d of January. Mr. Payne applied to me to have him taken care of; I saw him, and, supposing him in an unsound state of mind, I got Mr. Houghton, a surgeon, to examine him; he gave me a certificate previous to sending him to Warburton's; the woman applied to me afterwards for an order to get him out, which I complied with; he came out very ill; Mr. Houghton and Mr. Burn attended him for about three months; about three weeks previous to this affair, the prosecutrix applied to me, saying he had gone into his old condition, and wished him returned to Bath. I went the same day, and saw him on his shopboard; he said, "Sir, you see in what state I am, and I wish to get to Bath." I considered him insane at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. HOUGHTON. I am a surgeon. I attended the prisoner on the 3d of January; I found him looking very wild, and talking incoberent; I questioned him; I considered him certainly of unsound mind, and certified that he was fit for confinement; that was the honest persuasion of my mind. I saw him on the 17th of January, on his return from Warburton's; the last time I saw him was on the 30th of January; I then thought his mind in some measure improved, but he was evidently still labouring under delusion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are these delusions the test of insanity? A. Certainly; I have heard the woman's account of his bowel complaint; its being attended with bleeding would be very beneficial to his state of mind; it would improve it; and on his getting stronger, the delusion would be more likely to return.</p>

Bank notes, eleven sovereigns, and some silver, at two different offices at Somerset-house - I paid away two 5l. notes that night, to a boatswain; I put the rest into my pocket in a housewife; after that I bought a purse, into which I put eight of the notes and some gold, leaving two notes and the rest of the gold, in the housewife. I slept that night at a lodging-house, kept by McCarthy, near the watch-house - I went to bed about ten o'clock; the prisoner slept in the same bed with me - I put my purse and housewife into my jacket pocket; I put it under my pillow; he came to bed immediately after me. I got up at eight o'clock - my purse and housewife were then in my pocket; I went down, leaving him in bed; we went out together that morning twice; we came in again, and about five o'clock went into the room, and he laid down on one bed and I on the other - when I awoke I asked him who had shut the door, as I left it open, he said he did - I said I could not open it - he got up and opened it; we were out and in, all day together, walking and having grog. I was not quite sober, but knew what I was doing; I went down stairs, and he came down in a few minutes - I felt that my purse and housewife were safe, but did not examine them. I went out between six and seven o'clock to buy something for

            , the landlord's daughter - she went with me; I bought some things at a shop, and on overhauling my housewife, the two 5l. notes were gone, also some gold and silver; the rest of the money was in my purse. I had changed no notes, and only spent a few shillings in liquor - the prisoner was not with me then; White and I came out of the shop and went into a public-house, staid there some time, and there was a good deal of disturbance. I took off my jacket and laid it on the bar; the housewife was in my jacket pocket, but there was no notes in it then. I told Mrs. White to mind it - she said she would; the prisoner was not there - I went out without my jacket; some girls picked me up - I carried them under my arms a little way down the street, and one of them snatched my purse from my pocket. I am sure I had two notes in the housewife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had you lodged at McCarthy's? A. Two days; before I received the money, I asked the prisoner to go with me to receive it, but he declined. Mrs. White went by her father's name, Miss McCarthy; she has altered it to White. I went to two public-houses on my way from Somerset-house - I was quite sober all Friday; I had been drinking in the house that evening with the prisoner and other lodgers - there was no quarrel. I did not count my money on Saturday; we only went to two public-houses - I was not drunk; I cannot tell at what house I lost it, but it was before I went to the shop. I passed a girl of the town in the street, but had no conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give the prisoner money that day, to go and dine with? A. No; I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You and the prisoner went out about eight o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; we came in together about two o'clock - we had been together all the time; we did not dine together that day. I went up to lay in the bed and went to sleep - he laid on the next bed to me; I do not know when he came up, but I found him there when I awoke - that was about five o'clock.</p>

            . I attend an eating-house, kept by my sister, in Lower East Smithfield. The prisoner came there with Welch, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; I think it was three weeks ago last Saturday - he called for dinner, which the waiter carried them, and after they had dined the prisoner pulled out a 5l. note, and gave me - I was not in the habit of changing notes, but I did at last, they paid me 1s. 6d.; - I gave him the change. I have the note here, it is No. 18,561, dated the 27th of July, 1827 - it has been in my sister's possession part of the time. I know it to be the same, by two spots of grease which I saw on it when I took it; I took it up stairs to my sister directly, and got it from her on the Monday morning, as the officer brought the prisoner to the house, and asked if he had changed a note there - he asked me the number - I said I could not tell, but I should know it again by two spots<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130035"/>of grease on it. I went up with my sister, picked the note out, and brought it down - I delivered it to my sister again, and got it from her to take to the office, and gave it to her when I returned - I got it from her again on Monday; I am certain it is the same, by the spot of grease on the back, nearly at each end.</p>

            . I am a seaman. I had just come on shore - I first saw the prisoner on Thursday, the 23d of August, at the head of the London-docks; I saw him again on Saturday at the dock-gate, he treated me with a dinner at Perren's, between three and four; he asked me to go and dine - I told him I should be better pleased if I was at home than if I had 15l. - he said he was worth nearly that himself; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out two 5l. notes and four sovereigns - I looked at them in his hand, he put them into his pocket again - he paid Perren one of the 5l. notes at the counter; I asked where he got the money; he said he had wrote home for it - I knew he came from the north-west of Ireland.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 27th of August, and told him the charge; he said Thompson gave him the 5l. note to get his dinner with - I learnt he had changed a note at Perren's, and in going along he told me he had had the note for two or three months, and took it for wages; I took him to Perren's, who produced the note; he said nothing about it - I took the number, which was 18,561.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Navy Pay-office. On the 24th of August I paid Thompson twelve 5l. Bank notes - I do not recollect the dates of them, so as to be able to swear to them; but I was in the office on the 15th of August, when some notes were brought from the Bank - I know the numbers of the notes I paid Thompson were fifty-nines and following numbers, but whether hundreds or thousands I cannot say - they were following numbers; I recollect it from the circumstance of having requested him not to take the whole of it - that is our general practice, as there is danger of their soon getting rid of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you your book with you? A. Yes; it is only a memorandum of the payment; the numbers of the notes are not entered. He was an unusual time in the room, which makes me recollect the circumstance.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 27th of August, I was passing Perren's shop, and saw the prisoner in Ames custody; I asked what it was about; Ames said, he had robbed a man of a 5l. note and changed it there - I asked the prisoner where he got the note, he said, Thompson had given it him to get some victuals with, and he had given him the change. I asked Thompson, who was present, if that was the case; he said, No, it was not, he had given him no note, nor received any change. Perren produced the note - I took the number of it - it was 18,561, dated the 27th of July, 1827 - here is the memorandum which I took at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say they were both drunk? A. No.</p>

I took him home; I asked him for some money to get a dinner, and he gave me the 5l. note; he was drunk after that, and laid on the bed - I went and laid on the next bed.</p>

I do not recollect any of the persons who were about - I was not hurt at all; I was sensible of my watch being taken from my fob; it was a silver watch; without a case; I saw it again next morning at Mary-le-bone Office - I am certain it is mine; I have had it above three years.</p>

On the 6th of September, between eleven and one o'clock in the morning, the witness Stephens brought this watch to pawn; I detained her; she produced the prisoner as the person of whom she received it - I shewed him the watch, and he said, it was his own, and he had sent her to pawn it for him; I sent for an officer and gave him in charge, haring received information of the robbery.</p>

On Sunday, the 15th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I and my wife went out; I have a room on the first floor, and a room over that, as a work-shop; the house is all let out to different lodgers; the landlord does not live in it; the prisoner lives in a room on the first floor also, and passes as a married woman; her husband lives with her. I locked my room-door when I went out, and put the key in my pocket, leaving nobody in the room; I have no family; we came home together about ten o'clock at night, and found the door open - I examined it, and could find no marks of violence on it; I am certain I locked it, for I tried it afterwards - when I got into the room, every thing in the drawers laid so smooth I thought nothing was gone - I went to bed, and next morning, about seven o'clock, my wife called me from the work-shop, and gave me some empty loose papers, which had contained the spoons and sugar-tongs - I then searched another drawer myself, which I had put two watches into two or three days before, and found them gone also - I searched the prisoner's room on the Tuesday night, in the presence of her husband; she was then in custody - I found four pieces of cloth, but nothing else - I had no officer with me; I tried the key of her room-door, and found it opened mine, and the key of my work-shop would also open it - I believe the drawer was left unlocked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does the landlord live in the house? A. No; I rent one half; another person another; the prisoner's husband had one half - I spoke to her husband when I came home; I do not know whether she was at home; I did not then know of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of her going to the Police-office, to complain? A. She threatened to do it for my taking her character away; she was taken on the Tuesday morning; I discovered the robbery on Monday morning; I searched her room after I had found the plate in pawn.</p>

I had Dr. Bell's System of Tuition, and a piece of India rubber, in my outside coat pocket; I felt a hand at my pocket as I stood at the fire - I said to my friend, "I am robbed;" the book and India rubber were gone; and, on turning round, I saw the prisoner behind me - several persons were near me; as I attempted to turn round I received a blow - I do not know who it was from - the prisoner was close by me - I did not see my property about him, and have not found it - it was not him who struck me, I am certain.</p>

Crawley was close to him, and stood at his elbow, while he was trying to take something - he must have seen him take them; they stood close together, leaning over the rail.

I immediately went to the bed-room door, and saw the prisoner down three stairs - she was a stranger; I laid hold of her, and took the tea-caddy from her. I had seen it safe ten minutes before - the watch, tea-spoons, and money, were in it - the sheets, pocket, and apron, were on her arm, under her shawl; the street door is generally open.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I saw it safe on Monday evening, the 16th of July, at six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130039"/>o'clock. I put the money in then, and locked the portmantean I am certain; my room door was not locked. I went out of the house about eight o'clock that evening, and returned about ten, but did not go to my portmanteau. Next day, about a quarter-past seven in the evening, I went to my portmanteau, and found it locked as I had left it - my clothes were not taken, but the money was gone - a false key must have been used. I missed the money and notes - the sovereigns were wrapped up in the notes. I had no acquaintance with the prisoner, and never told him the money was there. I did not know the numbers of the notes, nor had I any writing on them; since the prisoner has been taken I have seen three notes in the hands of the Bank clerk, which I have been told are the same; I had received them from Messrs. Jones, Lloyd and Co. I had an order on them for 22l. odd - Mr. Gallatly paid me the money. I am certain I had these notes from them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you certain you did not make any payment from the time you received the notes till you went to the Bank of England? A. I made payments, but did not pay away any of the notes I am certain. I had seven sovereigns and 8s. 1d.</p>

Lloyd put her hand into my right hand waistcoat pocket, where I had a sovereign and 4s. 6d. in silver - I immediately took hold of her hand; she drew her hand out, and my money was gone. The other one immediately ran up St. Mary-at-hill. I immediately gave Lloyd in charge of the watchman: no money was found on her. Williams came down to the watch-house in about five minutes, to inquire for Lloyd - I immediately gave her in charge also - no money was found on her. I felt Lloyd's hand in my pocket, and am certain at that time that the money was there then; I had not put it there above two hours - I had my hand in my pocket while they were in my company, and felt it just before she took it.</p>

I received charge of Lloyd, who was brought to the watch-house by a watchman, charged by Jennings with robbing him of a sovereign and 4s. 6d. - I searched, but found nothing on her - she denied it; they were both in the watch-house when I got there. Williams was charged with running away, and he suspected she had run away with the money - she was searched, but nothing was found on either of them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners handed in a joint written defence, stating that they saw the prosecutor speaking to two women in Thames-street; that he crossed over the way, and laid hold of Lloyd, whom he wanted to force up a passage, but she not consenting he said he threatened to give her in charge - that he was much in liquor, and said he had been robbed, and she should pay for it.</p>

I could not perceive that they had any bundle. I ran up to the parlour, and gave a scream. I missed the clock from the side-board in the parlour, and two spoons from the dumb-waiter; they were safe when I went to bed. One of the men appeared to me to have fustian clothes on.</p>

I was going out on the 16th of August, and saw the prisoner pass me - he was running, and I noticed him pull his jacket off; I stopped, and looked at him particularly; at that moment another came up, with a clock under his arm, covered with a white cloth or something. The prisoner pulled his jacket off, and threw it over the clock, so that nobody could see it. I followed them down New Peter-street - they went through a court, into Duck-lane. I returned, and met Mr. Greig's son running after them; I told him what I had seen. I saw the prisoner in custody three or four days afterwards, and was positive he was the one who covered his jacket ever the clock, not the one who carried it.</p>

            . I am a ship insurance agent. On Sunday, the 12th of August, about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, both the prisoners passed me in Beaumont-square, about thirty or forty yards from the prosecutor's house - Ferry was carrying a bundle, which he threw away - I had not spoken to them; they were both in company, but Ferry came along first, and Hall a few yards after him; they came in a direction from the prosecutor's house - I did not see them come out of the house - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and then the bundle was thrown away; they both ran away - I pursued down a very narrow lane - Ferry was first, and was stopped by another man, in my sight; Hall was running after him; I was close in pursuit: and as Hall ran, he threw away three different parcels over a wall - I did not stop to get them up, but, having a rule in my pocket, I immediately scratched a mark on the wall, to know the place, and still pursued; another person came by me, and stopped him - I immediately collared him, and the other man let Ferry go immediately - I took Hall back to the garden, where he threw the things over, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130041"/>were handed over to me - I am certain of both the prisoners - I searched Hall myself, as nobody was in the watch-house, and found on him a chissel, a brad-awl, a waistcoat, a glass, and phosphorus-box, a shirt in his hat, and a baby's cap, or something - I am sure Ferry is the man who threw away the large bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know Ferry before? A. No - I did not see him come out of the house; he did not run very fast at first - I have not seen the man here who took Ferry; he was retaken a long time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you made inquiry about Hall since this occurred? A. I have no doubt he has been led into it - I have reason to believe his parents are highly repectable, and he has been the dupe of some other person.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Saturday, the 7th of July, in consequence of information, I went to the French Horn public-house, in Barbican, with Lloyd, Ferguson, and Mr. Powell, the assistant solicitor of the Mint - one Vint was there also; we first got into Kelly's company at this public-house - I searched him there, and found he had nothing about him - I then gave him two good shillings, which I marked, in the presence of himself and the officer: Kelly then left us, and went in a direction for Chequer-alley, by our direction - Kirby went with him. I saw Kelly again in half an hour or more, at the same public-house; he gave me two had shillings, which I produce - he showed me one of the good shillings which I had given him - he informed me what he had done and seen; between four and five o'clock that day I sent him on another errand: he returned to us in about half an hour, and produced three bad shillings, and a piece of colouring stuff in a paper - it was in powder, not in a lump - I produce that and the bad shillings. In consequence of what he stated I went, with Lloyd, Kirby, and vint, to No. 2, Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street; we found the street door open, and went up to the first floor front room - the door was on the latch; I opened it and saw Lynch near the door, partly undressed; the other prisoner was near the window; she had her gown sleeves tucked up, and I think she had not all her clothes on - I think this was between five and six in the afternoon; I took Cavenagh into custody, and Kirby took Lynch - we handcuffed them together, and then searched the room - there was a bed in the room, and under the bolster I found this canvass bag, containing a good half-crown, and a good shilling which was marked, and was the one I had given Kelly; in a piece of brown paper, near the bag, were-seven bright counterfeit shillings: while I was searching the bed, I heard a scuffle between the prisoners and Kirby - I turned round, and received from Kirby this bag, containing the colouring powder, which I afterwards tried on a halfpenny - it gave it the appearance of silver; there was a cupboard in the room - I examined it, and found two bad shillings wrapped up in a piece of rag, in an old mug - they had been rubbed down, and recoloured, fit for circuiation - they appeared to have been rubbed down by sand paper, then recoloured, and blacked over. I found nothing on either of the prisoners; they were taken to the office and searched by Mrs. Lee, the jailor's wife, who gave me, in Cavenagh's presence, a shilling and two or three halfpence, which she stated she had taken from her person; the shitling was marked, and was one of those I had given to Kelly - I had then got back both the shillings which I had given him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you stated all that you saw these women do on your going into the room? A. Yes; one was more undressed then the other - I think they had been washing - I did not find them doing anything; I sent Kelly there by direction of Mr. Powell.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I was with Limbrick; I saw Kelly at the French Horn, public-house - Limbrick marked 2s. and gave him; I followed him from there to No. 2. Chequer-alley; he went up stairs, but there was nobody at home - he came down again - he and I went to another public-house. and in half an hour, I watched him up stairs at No. 2, agains; he remained there not five minutes, and came down again - this might be half-past twelve o'clock; he gave Limbrick two connterfeit shillings - he was then searched, and only one of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130042"/>good shillings found on him; he went again in the afternoon, but I did not follow him then - between five and six o'clock, I Limbrick, Lloyd, and Vint, went to the house, the door was open; we went to the first floor front room - the door was on the latch; we went in - I first saw Lynch; she came towards the door as we opened it - she was nearly naked, I believe she had her gown on - Cavenagh was standing close to the window, with her sleeves tucked up as if she had been washing - they were both taken into custody and handcuffed; I had hold of each of their hands; Lloyd left us, and went into another room - while Limbrick was searching the room I saw Cavenagh take something off the bed, it was a little parcel, tied up in a piece of bedtick - I took it from her; we had a scuffle, and Limbrick took it from me - I afterwards saw that it contained a grey powder; I found a paper of cream of tartar on the mantleshelf.</p>

            . I have known both the prisoners for three-quarters of a year - they have lived together during that time, at No. 2, Chequer-alley. On the 7th of July I saw Limbrick, and received from him two good marked shillings; I went with them to Chequer-alley - Kirby followed me into the alley; I went to the first floor room, and saw nobody the first time - I came back, and went into a public-house; remained there about five minutes, and saw both the prisoners go along - I immediately went out and saw them both go into the alley - I went up stairs, and found them both in the room; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock - Cavenagh asked me what I wanted, I told her I wanted two bad shillings; she said I should have them - she went to an old quilt that hung before the bed - Lynch was present; and Cavenagh asked her where they were - Lynch said, "They are there;" Cavenagh produced two bad shillings to me, and I gave her one of the good shillings which I had received from Limbrick - I asked her for a small bit of colouring stuff, she said she had none - but I should have plenty in the evening; Lynch said,"What is that?" Cavenagh said "A small bit of colouring stuff, the boy wants." Lynch said she had none, but I should have it in the evening - I asked at what time I should come in the evening; Cavenagh said "Come between four and five o'clock." I then went to the French Horn, public-house, in Barbican - saw Limbrick there, and delivered him the two bad shillings, in the same state as I got them. I told him what I had seen; I went again between four and five o'clock; found them at home - one was standing near the window, andthe other near the bed; there was a cupboard in the room - I asked Cavenagh for three bad shillings, meaning counterfeit shillings; I used the word bad - she said I should have them; she sat down; and drew a paper out of her bosom, containing about a dozen had shillings, in a bright state - Lynch was washing down the cupboard; Cavenagh sat down, and got some sand paper and was rubbing the bad shillings down; Lynch grambled at not being tall enough to wash down the cupboard. Cavenagh said "Come here, and get these ready for the boy, and I will wash it down;" Lynch came, and sat down, and rubbed down the three bad shillings with the sand paper, to make them not look so new, and fit for passing. Lynch put them on the bar of the stove, and after heating them by the fire, threw them into a basin of water, which Cavenagh gave her; she then took them out of the basin, brought a piece of bed-tick from under the bolster, with colouring stuff in it; she rubbed the bad money with the colouring stuff, and then threw them into another basin of water, took them out, and rubbed some cream of tarter on them; she lighted a candle and somaked them over it, and then rubbed a little tallow on them, to make them a little darker than they were; she folded them up in a piece of printed paper, and gave them to me - she gave me a small piece of colouring stuff. I gave Lynch the other marked shilling, which I had from Limbrick; I took the counterfeit shillings and the colouring stuff to the French Horn, gave them to Limbrick, and they went to apprehend the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these country-women of yours? A. I do not know that they come from the same county - I have known them three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known this process of colouring? A. The very first time was the commencement of that three quarters of a year - I get my living by labouring, any work that I can get.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to get acquainted with Limbrick? A. I had given information to Mr. Powell of the Mint; I never passed any bad coin in my life - this is the first time I ever asked the prisoners to sell me any; I have been promised nothing for doing this, but I hope to be paid for my time and trouble - I hope to be justified by the Court, to be paid for my time and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Is all your expectation the usual expenses which the Court allow; what do you mean by being justified? A. I hope to be paid for my time and trouble in seeing the King and Government justified, seeing that they are not robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been working for Mr. Powell? A. The three quarters of a year was the first commencement of it - I work for him but very seldom; I never had any jobs for him but this; I got some money from him to purchase of them. My sister introduced me to Mr. Powell; she was in the habit of going out with bad money; Mr. Powell never promised me any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be better paid if you convict these women? A. No; I do not know any thing at all about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you expect to be better paid provided you can convict them, than if they get acquitted? A. I dare say I will. I do not know whether either of them are married - I never had any quarrel with them; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Q. During any part of the three quarters of a year, have either of them accused you of stealing a duplicate off her mantle shelf, and getting a shawl out of pawn? A. No, never; nor a gown, nor any thing - I never heard either of them say a word about it - I do not know a woman named Taylor nor Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then no relation of yours named Kennedy lived in the room with these women? A. No; I swear that - I shall be satisfied with any expenses I get from Mr. Powell - I do not know how much to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it depends on the success of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130043"/>evidence, whether you get any thing? A. Yes, I do; but I expect I shall get something for my time and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you ever say to a woman named Taylor, that because Lynch charged you about the duplicate of the shawl, and said she would do for you, that you were determined to do for her? A. No; that I swear, nor any thing of the kind - I never heard a word of it; nor ever said a word of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Do you expect to be paid for your trouble, whether they are convicted or not? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an inspector of coin at the Mint;(looking at the paper of bright shillings) these are all counterfeit, and bright in the same state they first came from the die - there are seven of them; the sharpness which is now on them is removed by friction of glass or sand-paper it removes the silvering from the surface, and takes off the sharpness of the die - it is then necessary to re-silver them, which is done by a mixture of nitrate of silver and salt, being rubbed on in a moist state - here is some of that mixture among the articles produced [here the witness after moistening the powder produced, with pure water, rubbed it on a piece of copper, which he then rubbed with cream of tartar, and it produced the appearance of silver] after it is coloured in this manner, a portion of grease and blacking is generally put on it to give it a dull appearance as if it had been in circulation. I state this from a great number of years experience (looking at the two counterfeit shillings produced by Limbrick as received from Kelly) these are counterfeit, and appear to have undergone the process I have described. rubbing down, re-colouring, greasing, and blacking; they are in the state in which they are usually put into circulation - (looking at the three other counterfeit shillings produced by Limbrick) these are counterfeit, and in the same state - they have been rubbed down, re-coloured, greased, and blackened; the small quantity of powder produced by Kelly is of the same nature with that found in the room.</p>

               <p>CAVENAGH's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I can assure you most solemnly, that I know nothing of the crime. I was this day sent for by my daughter-in-law, as she was lame, to assist her in cleaning her room; a woman named Kennedy was there, and the witness Kelly came to see her, and paid a shilling for her rent, as she was about to leave my daughter-in-law's room, having notice to quite. Kelly also sent me for some gin, and gave me a shilling to get it with. I am a hard-working woman, and sell fruit; and having a quantity of copper in my pocket, I paid for the gin with that and kept the shilling - this shilling was found upon me when at the office. I saw Kelly (the witness) go to the mug on the dresser, where the two bad shillings were afterwards found - Mrs. Kennedy also laid in the bed where the other things were found. kelly had a quarrel with my daughter-in-law some time before, about a shawl, the ticket of which he stule off from her mantle-piece, and Mr. Fryett, a pawnbroker of Whitecross-street, described a man of his description as having redeemed the same; when threatened about it, he swore that he would do for my daughter-in-law (that is, he would do her some harm.) I hope my Lord, you will not receive his evidence against us on this account, as I firmly assure you of my innocence, and pray that our unfortunate case may meet your merciful consideration. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I most solemnly and earnestly, assuring you of my innocence, pray that my case may meet your serious consideration. I have always borne an honest character, and beg to state that the witness Kelly has had a sister tried twice before for this very crime, and a sister of his Joan Kelly, was tried here only during the last Sessions, as he well knows. Myself, I am sure, and my daughter also, are far from being able to attend to, or deal in such practices; there were no appearance seen on either of us to make out that we had been doing what the witness Kelly states; this plau has been laid by himself, or the woman whom he came to my daughter's house to see, and for whom he paid the rent with one shilling, and gave the other for gin, which I kept in my pocket, which I should not have done, as I could have thrown it away on going to the office, had I sold coin for the same.</p>
               <p>LYNCH'S Defence. I know nothing about it; the man brought the woman to lodge with us. I accused him of stealing the ticket of my shawl; all his family are passers of bad coin - he came into my room and treated me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever say to you, that as the prisoner Lynch said she would do for him, he would do for her? A. Yes; he said as she had accused him of taking her shawl I out of pawn, he would do for her; I met him in Holborn at the time - I asked what he could do with her; he said he knew that himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you go by any other name but Taylor? A. Brander was my name before I was married - I have been married about six months - I met Kelly in Holborn about three months ago; I had a basket of cherries at the time - I spoke to him first - I said, "Kelly, are you not ashamed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130044"/>to go to that poor lame woman, and take the ticket of her shawl, though you used to go to the woman that lived with her - you should not take her shawl." I said I heard her say she would have him up for it, and do for him, or send him to Newgate: his answer was, he would do for her before. I said, "Lynch is fully intending to settle you in Newgate for it:" he said he would have her there, and do for her before she could do for him; the prisoners were not in custody at that time - I went by the name of Taylor then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever yourself under a charge of passing bad money? A. No; there never was any charge of the kind made against me at Hatton-garden - I was there once for a row; I was never at any office for passing bad money.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Friday, the 7th of September, in consequence of information, I went to No. 12, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles' - it is a lodging-house - I found the street door open; Edwards, Lee, and Kirby were with me; we tried the first door on the right hand side, in the passage, found it fast, and burst it open; directly on entering the room, I saw the prisoner standing fronting the window; he threw something into a pail of soapsuds - I could not see what it was, but I took out of the pail some colouring powder in brown paper, which I produce - I tried it on copper, and it gave it the appearance of silver: we secured the prisoner, and I took from a cup two bed shillings, in water - they had been rubbed down, recoloured, and were fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner threw the powder into the tub did you get it out? A. I went to it immediately, but the water had made it into a sort of paste; I took the two shillings out of the cup, and put them up in paper, wet as they were, which has made some specks on them that were not there then; the cup stood on a dresser; I saw Mrs. Lowe standing very near the bed, and under the bed I found some more colouring, which is here; I searched a shelf over the door, and found a piece of glass paper, which had not been used - it is used to file down the edges of the coin; I found some sheets of whitey-brown paper on the shelf that is used to tie the shillings up in; I found nothing else that day - I think I saw a cup on the dresser: we seut them to the office with Bailey, who was in the room, but was afterwards discharged: I locked the door up with a padlock, which the landlord got, took the key with me, and returned to the room the following day with Edwards and Kirby; I saw Edwards move this cup, which is the one I had seen on the dresser the day before; he took the top of it off, and took from it four bright shillings - it was a child's Tunbridge ware cup.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it Thursday or Friday? A. Friday, the 7th of September.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and accompanied Limbrick and Kirby to the prisoner's room, on Friday, the 7th of September; the street door was open - the room door was fast: we forced it, and found the prisoner standing by the window, and two others in the room - I saw something drop from the prisoner's right hand, into a tub of dirty water. I saw Limbrick take from that tub a powder, which he tried on a halfpenny, and it gave it the colour of silver; there was a show-board in the room, and on that I found a quantity of sand paper, which appeared to have been used in rubbing down coin - there appeared a portion of coin on the paper. They were taken to the office. I went there again on the Saturday afternoon, between four and five o'clock, with Limbrick, Kirby, and Powell. I saw a Tunbridge-ware toy, which appeared to be part of the top of a cup, and under it I found four shillings, bright as they came from the die; they were wrapped up in paper; I did not observe where that stood the day before. The lower part of the window is wood instead of glass, which prevents persons seeing from the street, unless they are very tall.</p>

This cream of tartar is used in the process of colouring; the four shillings produced are counterfeit, and in the new state as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130045"/>came from the die - the two shillings produced appear to have been rubbed down and resilvered - they are now in a bad state, by being apparently left in acid.</p>

               <p>MR. FIELD. They are from the same die as the foar others; the rubbing down is to give the money more the appearance of having been in circulation - it takes off the sarface, as the coin now in circulation is worn.</p>

On the 15th of August the pirosoner came to the shop, with another person, who seemed to be a foreigner, (as the prisoner interpreted for him.) The prisoner asked to look at some gold seals, which I showed him - he then asked to look at a diamond ring - I showed him some; he then produced a letter from his pocket, and read from it an order, which he said was from South America, and would be for three dozens of gold seals, three dozens of gold fancy rings, one diamond ring, and six pairs of brilliant ear-rings; he said Mr. Mainwaring's name was given to him by a Mr. Askill, of America, and said, "I do not know whether I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Mainwaring or not;" I said, my name was Brown; he said it was of no consequence, as we might rely upon having the order, and named the following Monday morning, at nine o'clock, to see a better assortment than I had then before me - he appointed that time himself; I showed them the whole of our diamond stock, which they seemed paricularly to admire. They asked the price of various articles, and then went away; I immediately put the things they had looked at into the drawer and case from whence I had taken them, and as they did not keep their appointment on the following Monday morning, nor indeed ever came again, we had some suspicion; Mr. Mainwaring and my self took stock, and missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had shown them the pin and rings, and I am certain I had seen the other things two days before they came. I have seen the diamond pin at Marlborough-street - it is worth above 5l. The property altogether is worth 43l., at a very reduced calculation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MCDOWELL. Q. How many persons had been in your shop from the time you had seen the other things? A. Probably thirty or forty - I had no conversation with the other man; they talked in a foreign language, but I doubt his being a foreigner, for he looked at a very fine sapphire brooch, and I heard the word No, from one to the other - I will not swear it was No - it seemed to be a signification of No - I do not know whether the negative term in the French language sounds like No - I did not observe any conversation between them till after they had been into the warehouse - I looked at the things  - the prisoner produced the letter from his pocket; I swear he did not say he wanted the articles for the gentleman who was with him - that man did not look at more than one or two articles - I showed them some pearl suits; the prisoner immediately said, "I do not deal in that, but my friend deals largely in it" - I did not mention this circumstance at Marlborough-street, as they thought I had stated enough; that was my only reason for not stating it - I did not see to whom the letter was addressed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the peculiarity of the setting, and the tint of the colour - it is set with the stem angleways, which is unusual-there are two grains, and then one, which is unusual; it happened to be the very largest pin we had, and was on a piece of velvet, with about thirty others - I did not tell the Magistrate, that the person who came with him appeared an excellent judge of the articles, nor say any thing to that effect.</p>

             re-examined. I saw a Frenchman in company with the prisoner on one occasion; he had some things, and gave them to the prisoner to pawn with me, one at a time; the prisoner asked more on them than I could lend, and he returned them back to the Frenchman. I think this was two or three days subsequent to his pawning the pin; one of the articles was a diamond brooch, and I think there were some rings, but I am not positive; the prisoner was alone when he pawned the brooch in the name of"John Johnson, 17, Oxford-street" - it was a diamond sapphire brooch; he had brought me something to pawn about a week before, with the Frenchman, but I did not take it in.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did he come to your house with the brooch? A. About a month ago; he wanted more than I could advance on it - that was the first time that I remember; he came the last time on the 22d of August, and offered a gold watch for 5l. I offered him 3l. - before he would take it, he went and spoke to the Frenchman, who was at the door, then came back and pawned it with me in the name of "John James, 18, Castle-street." I do not remember their coming at any other time.</p>

             of it about a week afterwards, or it might be more. Soon after, the prosecutors kept a more diligent watch over their property, and in about four months had pedlocks put on all their cannisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 24th of July, do you remember some paper coming in? A. Yes; one ream of thin blue and one ream of thin white; we use it to pack tea and coffee for the retail trade only - it would last a long time, as we have very little retail business; it was placed on a back shelf, near the bottom of the counter - Sanderson had access to it. On the 24th I made this memorandum of the paper in hand - there were sixteen quires of blue, fifteen of white, and eight of brown, which we call bag-cap; on the 27th I looked again, there were fourteen of blue, twelve of white, and seven of bag-cap; we had not cut up any of that paper for bags or any thing, nor had we used any of it; what became of the rest I cannot say, but none of it had been used in the business whatever - it could not have been taken for the business without my knowledge, nor could any such quartity have been consumed in business in so few days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you enter the prosecutors' service? A. On the 27th of October, 1825. Sanderson made the communication to me within a month or six weeks; I told Mr. Green about a week afterwards - Sanderson remained in their service till July last; there are four servants in all, including myself; there is a female and a boy beside me and Sanderson - the female had no access to the shop. Mr. Henry Green was always in the business, and Mr. John, occasionally - it is Sanderson's duty to make the bags; I sleep in the house; the paper was kept on an open shelf - the shop is locked up at eight o'clock at night, and I kept the key; the servants have access to the paper in the day time, but I can tell what would be used; the boy or Sanderson could take it when they wanted it - I swear it had not been used in the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could such a quantity be used without your knowledge? A. It could not; it would take a long time to make it into bags, and we never use it for bags - I had a particular reason for taking down the quantity there. I travel sometimes - but was not out during this time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 24th of July, was there a stock of bags so as not to require more to be made? A. Yes; the bags are made of cartridge paper - not of this sort.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Clement's-lane, and am the eldest son of Mr. Green. I supply the paper for the business - in July last I sent them a ream of double crown blue, and one of double wove yellow, and some other papers; in consequence of what was said to me I advised Jordan what to do about the paper - I have since seen some paper produced; it is impossible to swear to paper - but, to the hest of my judgment, it corresponds in every particular, and I believe it to be part of the reams which I delivered them; it is of the same quality, size, fabric, and from the same maker - I compared it with what was left; there was no wrapper on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you supplied them with paper? A. About seven years; I have sold them a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130047"/>great quantity in that time. I called there about ten minutes after it was delivered - I saw it on the floor of their warehouse; I do not deal with several manufacturers - the same maker supplies other people, no doubt - I will not swear that the paper had ever been in my possession; the blue was charged 27s. a ream, and the white about 25s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do the prosecutors have as much paper as a retail dealer would take? A. Much less; I suppose two or three reams of each sort of this paper would be more than their supply for the year.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my son Henry. Sanderson had been about fifteen years in our employ, and was confidentialy employed, till I had reason to suspect him - I am seldom in town. In July last, in consequence of what came to my knowledge, I called him into the counting-house, about three o'clock in the afternoon - it was on a Tuesday, towards the end of the month. I desired Mr. Jordan to repeat, in his presence, what he had said to me; he said he had lost several quires of paper. I had made him no promise of forgiveness, or said any thing at all to him; Jordan said he had missed five quires of paper - that he had taken an account every morning of what there was for several days, and every day had missed some; the prisoner was silent, or said he knew nothing about it, I forget which; I then said there was a rogue in the house, and that he was the man. I observed that he shook a little; he said he knew nothing about it; I persisted that it was him; and at last he acknowledged that he had taken it, and if I would look over it, he would do so no more, and would pay me for what he had taken. I told him that would not be done - that it was not that alone, but I had to accuse him of a great many other things, as he must be aware of - he denied any thing else. I saw him again before I went out, and asked what he had done with the paper - he said he had sold it; and, after some hesitation, he said he sold it to a man in Lime-street, without naming him, and got 6d. a quire for it; after some further conversation, I sent for Wiltshire, the officer. I then said, "Will you tell this officer where you have sold the paper?" he named the man soon after; two officers left the place with him. I went out of town, and next morning I saw the paper at the Mansion-house - it appeared in every respect part of the paper missing. Jordan produced two quires of the paper, and it appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take an active part in the business? A. Not now, nor did I in 1825.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my father; soon after Jordan came into our employ he made a communication to me, respecting Sanderson; and after that I had frequently missed property in small quantities, which could hardly be missed at the time. I had a padlock put on the large tea cannisters; I afterwards missed other things; there was paper missing in July last; the circumstance was mentioned to me on the 27th; I ordered the paper to be counted daily - but I believe that was done before, when I was out of town - I was not present at the conversation with Sanderson, so as to give a particular account of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had something been said to you about a half-crown piece? Yes; I never heard my father say he should be forgiven if he made a communication. Jordan gave me information within a month of the time when he came. I missed property the next day, and almost daily afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was your reason for keeping Sanderson? A. I wished positively to discover who the thief was, and not to accuse any body improperly; the deprodations were always trifling; but the whole, together, was considerable.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of July, I went from Messrs. Greens' with Sanderson - he took me to the house of Bewick, No. 30, Lime-street; "Dealer in marine-stores" is written over the door; the stock chiefly consisted of old iron, rags, and such things - when we came to the door the prisoner Bewick was in the back part of the passage; Sanderson said,"That is the man I sold the paper to;" I went up to Bewick, and said, "Where is the paper you purchased of this man?" Bewick answered, I never bought any of him;' he then opened the door, and we went into the shop, which is a dark place backwards. I again said,"Now, where is the paper you bought of this person?" he said, "I never bought any of him." Sanderson said, "Yes, you bought some of me yesterday;" Bewick then took up some loose sheets of paper, which laid on the top of a quire of brown, and a quire of white which I produce; Sanderson then took hold of the two quires, and said, "This is the paper;" I then took Bewick and the paper into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two quiros concealed from view? A. No; it might he seen under the loose cloth. I have had it ever since - Mr. Green saw it at the Mansion-house, he compared, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From first to last he denied buying it of Sanderson? A. He did; his shop is on the ground floor - he opened an inner door to admit us - but when I first saw him in the passage he slammed that door too - there might be more paper in the place, but I did not search for more - this was all Sanderson pointed out - he did not say, in Bewick's presence, what he sold it him for.</p>

            . I believe the paper produced is the same as these samples, from the bulk - there is no water-mark, but from the texture, quality, and colour, I believe it to be the same; it is worth 1s. 3d. a quire - the brown also agrees in every respect, and is worth 10d. or 1s, a quire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many thousand quires you may have sold in a year, you cannot say? A. I supply nobody but my father with that sort of paper - the manufacturer may sell a large quantity.</p>

I have dealt with Bewick, and sold him paper of different sorts at different times, bag-cap and small-hand; I do not know that I ever sold him any like that produced; small hand is about half the size of this; I may probably have sold him paper like that produced, but not lately - not within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130048"/>the last three years; I should think this bag-cap is heavier than what I have sold him - it is impossible to identify bagcap - the maker could not do it, not to distinguish one sheet from another.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you sell him any paper at all? A. About three months ago; I sold him bag-cap, small-hand, and lumber-hand - it is perhaps, five years since I have sold him any of the sort produced; I believe I have sold it within seven years, but not within five; I sold him some paper about one month before I sold the bag-cap - I generally sold him a ream or a bundle at a time - I do not believe any of this paper to have been sold by me.</p>

I have sold him some bag-cap like this, but after it goes out of my hand I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you sell him any bagcap? A. I think about the middle of July - I have not brought my books here - I was not desired - I generally sell for ready money - I do not deliver invoices - I take it my self, and receive the money; I think I sold him three bundles, one of bag-cap, and two of this sort, which is double crown - I believe this is machine cut; I bought my paper of my cousin in July last - I bought about 25l. worth altogether, but not more of this sort than I sold to Bewick - this paper is similar to that; I will swear it is the same quality - it is as near the size as can be - I cannot swear to half an inch - it was about the 10th of July.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cripplegate-within - my heat extends within two doors of Honey-lane-market. On the 1st of August, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, as I was standing on my duty, I heard a call of Stop thief! from Russia-row. I had not seen either the prisoner or the prosecutor - I then saw the prisoner run from Russia-row to Honey-lane-market; I am positive he was running; he might be about twenty-five yards from me, when I first saw him - I saw he was coming towards me and concealed myself in a door-way; when he got within two yards of me I ran out and seized him; he made a blow at me; I lowered my head, avoided the blow, and secured him; while he was struggling with me, he put his hand into his waistcoat or breeches pocket, and threw something into the middle of the road; I heard it fall and saw it go from his hand; I drew him to the place immediately, and picked it up; it was a watch, without any appendages. I took him to the watch-house, which is in Aldermanbury, about one hundred yards off; the prosecutor came to the watch-house about ten minutes after; his face was very much cut, and bleeding very much; so much so, that he could not speak plain, for the blood which flowed from his mouth; I showed him the watch - he said it was his - I asked what he knew it by - he said I could not open it with my finger only; I tried and could not - he said "Now, if you will take the point of a knife and try, it will open;" and it did so - he gave the same account of the transaction as he has now, and produced the ribbon, seal, and key, which he said belonged to the watch - the prisoner said nothing.</p>

I bought it of Mr. Mills, Ludgatehill, eighteen months ago; and, in consequence of an accident, it will not open without a knife; the steel ring broke with my laying hold of it.</p>

I saw three or four men run down the street; the watchman tried to stop two, but they passed him; I run behind and he laid hold of me. I was then taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate you did not know whether there was any mark on it? A. I said I believed there were some black spots; and I believed the calf produced then was the same, but I did not notice it sufficient to swear to it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might it not have strayed? A. It might - there were five other calves in the field.</p>

            . I am a drover. On the 8th of July, at night, I was by the Elephant and Castle, going to Smithfield; I saw the prisoner with seven sheep, marked with a round O on the rump, and an H within it; I walked with him for a quarter of a mile - he asked me to let him mix the sheep with mine - he did not say why; he did not appear to know how to drive them; they were Southdown sheep; I parted with him at the end of Skinner-street, Somer's-town. I was informed he was in custody on the 11th; I went to Kentish-town watch-house, and saw him, but did not recollect his person then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you speak to him now? A. Why, I did not own him at the watch-house, because the officers had had me in custody, and so I would not answer them - I have been several times in custody, but only for rows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Repeat your last answer - did you say only for rows? A. No, Sir - I was once in trouble about a smock-frock; I do not know whether I was charged with stealing it. I was in gaol two months after being tried. I have not been in custody fifty times, nor twenty-five, nor half of that. I am not going to satisfy you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in gaol? A. About eight times - I will not swear to ten; I was only tried once - that was about the smock-frock. I described the man who had the sheep to Brown, as a country looking man, and said I could swear to him among five hundred - that he was a stout man, with a red face. I did not, to my knowledge, say I should get 20l. if I convicted this man; I will not swear about it; I do not want to convict the man; I said it was a much stouter man, but I have explained my reason for that. I never said I should not swear to him if Dr. Owen had not threatened to lock me up, or any such thing. My life has been threatened outside the gate. I have only been in custody once on a charge of theft.</p>

He said he wanted the uniform to go out to join Lord Cochrane, as he should have a letter of recommendation or introduction to Lord Cochrane, to get an appointment there from Lord Stanhope; he left my house, and returned about nine in the evening, or a little after, and I returned him the 15l. - I had taken the numbers of the notes he left with me - I kept the 5l. he had first left; he called several times between the day he ordered the goods, and when he called to settle - I did not see him on all those occasions; he called on the 24th or 25th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I had his account made out ready, in consequence of something I heard - I presented the bill to him when he called; he looked at it, and said he should require discount; and then said, "Can you give change for a cheque?" - I asked how much it was; he said 30l.; he did not say whose cheque it was - I said I could change it, and he gave me the cheque - this is it (producing it); he gave it into my hands, and I saw the signature; he did not say himself whose it was; this happened in the counting-house, when we were alone - I went up to my desk, and gave him the balance out of the cheque, and asked him to write his name on the back of the cheque, which he did; I deducted my bill, and lessened the discount; he then asked me to return him the deposit money, having included every thing in the bill, and I returned him a 5l. note, not the same which I had received from him - I took the number of it in his presence; it was raining, and he asked me to lend him an umbrella, which he would leave in the morning - I rather hesitated at lending it, as it belonged to a friend, but I did lend it, and he said he would leave it the next morning; the uniform was finished at that time, but he left without it - he did not ask for it; it was ready for him, but I expected he would call next morning; he did not call - I did not see him again, till I saw him in custody at the Mansion-house, on Saturday, the 1st of September - I have a foreman named Blanchard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How many persons have you serving in your shop? A. Two besides myself; they are both here; he called several times, and had conversations with me at times; the deposit of 5l. remained with me till I last saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods were ready for him, but he never asked for them? A. He took a jacket with him, two or three days after the order was given; it was all ready when I received the cheque; the uniform amounted to 20l. odd; he did not get that; nobody was with us when he paid me the cheque. I believe I recollect all that passed between us; it was on the 24th or 25th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. When the cheque was handed to you, did he not tell you it was one he himself had cashed? A. No, he did not; he merely produced the cheque; he had represented Colonel Stanhope as his friend frequently, all the way through.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130051"/>Q. That through his interest, he expected an appointment under Lord Cochrane? A. Yes; I am not certain whether I was at home all the next day; either I or one of my shopmen would be at home all day; he put the name of George Haig on the back of the cheque - I believe that to be his right name; it was the name he gave us when he first came, and which we wrote in the order-book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he the waistcoat and trousers away? A. He had them the next day, as he desired; the jacket he took away, was an undress uniform; the change I gave him was between 4l. and 5l., besides the deposit.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Baldwin; I saw the prisoner in the shop, for the first time, on the 14th of May, and measured him that day for his uniform suit. Mr. Baldwin had measured him for the waistcoat and trousers before I came in; he said it was to be a midshipman's uniform, in the Greek service; before I measured him he gave me an address in pencil on this paper,(read) - "Currie, 20, Regent-street, St. James" - he said he understood Currie had made uniforms for that service, and I should there get the regulations - I went, but got no information there - I got it throught a private friend - On the morning after Mr. Baldwin received the cheque - (I believe it was the 24th or 25th, or perhaps the 26th, I had seen the prisoner at my master's house the day before) - I took the cheque to Messrs. Coutts', and presented it, but received no cash for it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the evening before you presented the cheque, until the 1st of September, had you ever seen the prisoner? A. No; on the 1st of September, at near ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming up Walbrook, and on turning round into Bucklersbury, I met him; I accusted him, and told him he was a pretty sort of a fellow to have uniforms made, and to say he was going out under Lord Cochrane, and giving a cheque to my employer; he denied it; he said, "O! it was not me;" he then ran from Bucklersbury to the back of the Mansion-house, towards George-street - he walked two or three yards and then ran, as I have stated; no more conversation passed between us before he ran - I pursued him, and after running some time, I cried Stop thief! thinking he was gaining ground on me - I overtook him myself, seized him by the collar, brought him near the Mansion-house, and Turnpenny, the officer took him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on the day after the prisoner had been to your master's house? A. I presented the cheque as soon as I came to business - I returned from Coutts' between ten and eleven o'clock, and was at home the rest of the day - he never came to the shop while I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The reference to Currie's was merely to ascertain the uniform? A. Yes; they did not choose to give me information - when I called Stop thief! after him, he appeared as if he could not run at all - he did not directly stop, but slackened his pace, and I then got up to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by his appearing as if he could not run at all? A. He did not run as he had before - he went from one side to the other, and slackened his pace.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ, and was at home on the 24th or 25th of May, when the prisoner called at the shop. I was afterwards at the Mansion-house, when he was in custody - he was not told it would be better for him to confess, or worse for him if he did not - I, the foreman, Turnpenny, and the prisoner, were standing together - the prisoner spoke first; I am sure nothing was said to him in my presence; he said he was very sorry, that he intended to call and pay Mr. Baldwin - Turnpenny said it was a forgery; the prisoner said it was not, and he could bring witness forwards to prove that he did not write the cheque; and said he had been to France in pursuit of the person he took it off - that was all that passed between me and him. I do not recollect any thing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That was the answer he gave you on being charged by Turnpenny with forgery? A. Yes; he did not say whether he had been able to find the man.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. On the 1st of September the prisoner was given into my charge in George-street, close by the Mansion-house, by Blanchard, a little before ten o'clock in the morning; he was examined the same day - there was some conversation in the lobby before the examination - what he said was not taken down; I did not make him any threat or promise. I said it was a forgery; he said "No, I can prove to the contrary of that;" and, I think, he said he had been to France to look after the person he had it from. I had seen him before the Lord Mayor once before, about a drunken frolic - he was discharged immediately.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the agency-office of Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there any customers named Stanhope, whose hand-writing you do not know. A. Yes; there are. I have seen Colonel Leicester Stanhope write, but not Colonel Lincoln Stanhope.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you seen any writing with the name of Lincoln Stanhope to it? A. Yes, frequently - I have marked drafts of Lincoln Stanhope for payment, and they were paid - I have done that very frequently; the two Colonel Stanhopes are related; there is another Colonel Stanhope, a customer - his Christian name is Philip, and, I believe, John - his initials are P. J.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other customers named Colonel Stanhope, whose Christian name begins with L., except Lincoln and Leicester? A. I do not know any more.</p>

I might know; but if I saw a draft presented hearing another sig<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130052"/>nature, I should refer to the Army List to see if there was such a name. I do not know any customer of that name whose writing is like this.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of paying drafts of the other customer named Stanhope, beside those you have named? A. No; I belong to another department; I should see the signatures of those officers whose names are Stanhope, provided we were agents for them.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. There are other departments which you have nothing to do with? A. Yes; I can only speak of those officers who are in my department - there may be gentlemen named Stanhope, whom I have nothing to do with.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - From the peculiar circumstances under which I got possession of this cheque, I cannot bring witnesses to prove it. I gave cash for it. I was in the practice of attending a gambling-house in St. James', and there frequently saw a young man of respectability, whom I understood to be the nephew of Colonel Stanhope. And, as I was about joining the Greeks, I thought if I could get an introduction to the Colonel, it might be of service to me. he played one night, and lost all his money, and requested me to cash this cheque, which (being a considerable winner at the time,) I had no hesitation in doing. I was given to understand, on the following night, that it was not genuine. I lost what money belonged to me; and since that have not had an opportunity of calling on the prosecutor to take the cheque up. On person, in particular, saw me cash that cheque, but I am afraid he would not like to come and give evidence in a public Court, because it may be the cause of his losing his situation.</p>

I said,"You rascal, you shall have the law;" he said, "Let me go back, and I will give you every thing I have got, to let me go;" I said, "No; I will have an officer, and you shall be taken; I insist upon it." I went with him to the watch-house, and delivered him safe there; my master's boots were taken off his feet, at the watch-house - I took off his hat, and found a new shirt of master's in it; the officer searched him at the watch-house, and found the soap, cheese, and spurs on him - I said they were master's; he said, "You liar, the cheese is not yours;" I went home, and found our cheese was gone - and missed a piece of soap and a loaf; the property had all been in the bed room before.</p>

            . I lived in James-court, Featherstone-street. On Sunday evening, the 29th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was sitting in my room; the prisoner called me over to her apartment, and told me to look at

             how she was spending her money in drink; Davis was spending her money in her own room: Davis said she was doing nothing but spending her money, and treating the people underneath - she was treating them with rum; she was neither sober nor drunk. The prisoner said if she came up there drunk, she would break her neck down stairs, or chuck her out of window; the prisoner was not sober herself. Davis had lodged in the prisoner's room for four or five nights, but was treating the people below; they had not quarrelled at all that I know of. Soon after this I was sitting at my door, and saw Davis come out of the house; I persuaded her to go up stairs again - she went up, and as soon as she got to the top of the stairs, she fell down again; I ran across to pick her up;

             and another helped me up stairs with her into the prisoner's room, and we put her on the bed - I did not know that she was dead for some time afterwards - she never spoke. I did not see whether she got to the top of the stairs before she fell; when we got her up into the prisoner's room, the prisoner was there with a man who had been with her (the prisoner) all night and all day; there was but one bed in the room. I believe the deceased had been out all night; but before that they had slept in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you went up? A. She was walking about the room, saying she would chuck her down stairs again, and break her neck, not knowing then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130054"/>that she was dead. We took no more notice of the deceased for full an hour, but let her lay, thinking that her being in liquor made her not speak. I staid in the room about an hour, then went to the bed-side, and found she was dead - she was not cold. I directly sent for Mr. Smith - he came, and while he was looking at her, the prisoner tied up her clothes, and went away with the man; he had said she was dead before she began to tie up her clothes. After she had tied them up she took a pint pot, and said she would cut the deceased's head open - Evans and several more took it from her; she went away with the man - I have not seen him since - he had never been there before. Mrs. Evans lodged in the lower room, under the prisoner. I found the prisoner in a wine-vaults in Whitecross-street, about five o'clock the next morning, drinking rum - she was neither drunk nor sober. I asked what made her leave her room when she knew the woman was dead - she said, I could not say she had killed her; I said it looked very black of her to leave the room in the manner she did; I persuaded her to come home, and when she came, they asked how she came to murder the deceased; there was a watchman and several more in the room - she said she did not push her down, but dashed her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had she not a black eye, and a black spot on her right arm a week before this? A. She had a black place on her arm, but she was hearty and well; it was a bit of a bruise - I believe she had fallen out with a young man whom she lived with - neither of them were sober; whether she had got to the top of the stairs, or whether she fell, or was knocked down, I cannot tell; her head struck against the street door as she fell.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, James-court, Featherstone-street. I do not know where the deceased lived - I had seen her backwards and forwards in the prisoner's house, two or three times. On Sunday afternoon, about half-past five o'clock, I saw her come in, and go up stairs to the prisoner's room; she was very much intoxicated - I was in my own room, on the ground floor; she was no sooner up stairs, than I heard her fall down - I ran to her assistance, and called somebody to help her up. Turner, and one Bradham came and helped me up stairs with her: we laid her on the prisoner's bed, not knowing then that she was dead; the prisoner was in the room, and a man sat there, who was a stranger to me; they were drinking porter - I continued there all the time, and in about three hours, we found she was dead; we had not spoken to her, when we took her up stairs; being intoxicated, we laid her down, thinking she was gone to sleep, and took no more notice of her - I went to awake her, but receiving no answer, I felt her forehead, and found she was very cold. I called to the prisoner, and said, "This woman is dead;" they immediately came to the bed-side; the prisoner was very much in liquor indeed; she seemed much alarmed at the woman's death, as she had known her some time - I made an alarm: two medical men came; the prisoner stopped there some time; she then got a cap, gown and shawl, and went away - I think she took them more for security than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs with the deceased, did you hear the prisoner say any thing? A. I heard her say nothing at all; she was very much in liquor, about an hour after, and had been out, she took up the quart pot, and said she would strike the corpse; she attempted to strike it, but I knocked the pot out of her hand, and threw it under the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to strike, or only say she would? A. She did not attempt it; she was very much in liquor; she went away, and was brought back about half-past five in the morning, by Turner; she had only lived there about three weeks - I never heard her quarrel with the deceased.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was desired by the Coroner to inspect the body previous to the Inquest - my apprentice had been fetched on the night in question: I found the neck dislocated between the first and second vertebrae - I considered that sufficient to account for her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130055"/>death, and made no further examination - extreme violence would occasion that dislocation; falling down stairs was as much calculated to produce it as any thing - it might happen whether she fell or was thrown down; but the greater probability would be, that it would happen from being thrown down with violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing she had fallen backwards, from the top to bottom of the stairs, and struck her head against the door, would that occasion it? A. Not if she fell flat - it was represented to me, that she had fallen with her head doubled up with the body - if she fell against a surface hardly equivalent to the length of her body, I consider the consequence would be the same, whether she fell or was thrown backwards.</p>

               <p>T. WILD re-examined. Evans was intoxicated; all the witnesses were not drunk, but several were; Turner was drunk; Goff lived servant at our house - her name is Liberty, not Jane - she followed me to the room and I left her there - I did not see Buck or Steele there; my stay was short.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner in the shop on the 22d of August; he had been there about a minute when I came in; a person, having the appearance of a foreigner, was with him - they were looking at gold ear-rings, which my husband had taken out of the case to show them; the prisoner was the only one who spoke; a tray laid on the glass case, close to the prisoner, but not close to the foreigner; the tray had been drawn out, and laid on the glass case - I had put that tray to rights not half an hour before, and had seen a gold watch in it, set with turquoise on both sides - it cost my husband ten guineas - the selling price was fourteen guineas, which mark was on it; as soon as I came into the shop, the prisoner said, "Give me a piece of paper, and I will write my address," which he did; he then said,"You will be with me to-morrow morning between nine and ten o'clock, and I will promise you that one pair of the ear-rings I will keep:" they went out of the shop - the pair he thought he should keep was 10l. or ten guineas; he said he was going to make a present of them to a young lady; I suspected them, and within a minute of their leaving the shop, I missed the gold watch I before mentioned; the prisoner stood near the case - the other, I do not think, was within reach of the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. McDOWELL. Q. How long had the prisoner been in the shop before you entered? A. About a minute, because I was in the parlour with the door open when they came in. I heard what passed, and could see what was done in the shop. I always observe if a second person is in the shop, but being engaged in stringing coral, I could not immediately go into the shop - I was noticing them all the time, and could see who was nearest the counter. I could not see what he was doing with his hands certainly. I left off stringing the coral the moment they came in. I could see that the other man did not move from the place he stood in, and it is my firm belief, that he was not near enough to the case to touch the watch - the prisoner was close to the case - our shop is a large one - it has been a parlour, it is on the south side of the square, next door but one to the Bazaar; there is only one counter, which continues down the shop, and then turns the corner. I have a full view of the counter as I sit at work - the parlour is large. I sit at a table close to the door, in order to have a view of the shop. I rose from my seat immediately they came in, but it was a minute before I entered the shop. I had my suspicions when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner stood near the tray, of course you observed his movements very narrowly? A. I could not see his hands - I could see his face - he had been in the shop before, and raised my suspicions before. I could not see his hands move - he was too clever to let me do that. I endeavoured to get into the shop as soon as I could. I did not see him remove any thing from the tray. I discovered the loss immediately they left the shop, and mentioned it to my husband - he did not follow them - he did not suspect them before, or he might have caught them. I looked at the ear-rings first, then looked at the tray, and missed the watch, and told my husband; he immediately went to Baker-street, to see if such a person lived there; the prisoner had looked at the bracelets before I entered the shop; he never spoke to the foreigner - he entered the shop first, and the foreigner close at his heels - they were together; my attention was not directed to one more than the other - I had a full view of both of them; if half a dozen persons were in the shop they could not get out of my view - the foreigner might be a yard from the prisoner; he stood out in the shop, not at the counter; he only looked at one pair of ear-rings, but did not touch them - the prisoner showed them to him, and he merely nodded.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he stood close to the foreigner when he showed him the ear-rings? A. No - he did not; he held them up to him. I do not believe he spoke to the foreigner at all, if he did, it was something very quiet.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 92, St. Martin's-lane. On the 22d of August, (I think it was towards the evening) the prisoner came to our shop, and offered to pawn this gold watch - there was a Frenchman outside the door, on the steps, he wanted 5l. on it. I offered him 3l.; he said he was afraid that would not do, he would inquire; he went to the door, spoke to the person who was waiting, then came back and took the 3l.; he gave me the name of

            , No. 18, Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the value of the watch, in your opinion? A. I should think about 6l.; I should think that the extent at this present time; there has been no particular alteration in the value lately; it is a common French watch; it is set with turquoise, which is a common stone; 6l. is the outside value, I supposed the other man to be a foreigner.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY re-examined. I went to the house in Baker-street, and found no such person as Butler lived there. I paid ten guineas for the watch; they would not make the cases in this country for the money - there is a great deal of work in them - it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. How do you know it? A. As well as I should know you, if I saw you to-morrow. I have had it eight years, and then paid ten guineas for it; I think now it might be bought for eight guineas; the works are very good. I would give eight guineas for it now, if I wanted it to sell again; the prisoner stood close to the tray; the foreigner was as far off as I am from that lamp (about a yard and a half) - I do not think he was nearer; he did not move but once, I believe. I did not see the watch in either of their hands; I never said I had - there were seven on the tray, but I did not see them touch one; they did not ask to see watches. I did not hear any conversation between the prisoner and the foreigner; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Your Lordship must have remarked on the former trial, that I did not seek, in the least degree, to question the testimony of the witnesses; but, I declare to God, there is such wilful and corrupt perjury in this case, that it cannot pass without remark. I declare positively that Mr. Ely, before the Magistrate,(though not exactly under examination at the time) stated that he saw the watch in the hands of the foreigner; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130057"/>I was near the window, and the case was about the middle of the counter, and the foreigner, being in the middle of the shop, it was impossible for me to have touched the watch. I declare he stated this to the Magistrate, though it is not in his deposition. On my former trial these persons were in Court, and as they found the Jury acquitted me, supposing I was only the interpreter, they have judged it necessary to charge their statement. The lady particularly expressed her intention of prosecuting me, and hanging me. I understand, from good authority, that the gentleman himself said he would prosecute me, and showed the most decided intention of making me his victim. When I went into the shop I spoke French from beginning to end. The prosecutor says he showed me several pairs of ear-rings and bracelets, and the lady says I was not a minute in the shop before she saw me. I trust you will consider these circumstances, and make allowance for my accomplice (as it is supposed), being absent. I shall call Norman, the pawnbroker, who will state how I appeared when he accused me of having gone to several shops; that I appeared totally innocent from my manner, and went immediately before the Magistrate; it was my own proposition; he insisted on my going out of the shop myself, while he made inquiry. I was prepared to answer this charge, but being now unprepared by this wilful perjury on the part of this gentleman and his wife, I am deprived of the means of rebutting it immediately.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY re-examined. Q. Did you, before the Magistrate, say the watch was in the hands of the foreigner? A. I did not; I do not believe a word was said but what was taken down in writing; my deposition was not taken before the Magistrate, but by a clerk in an office; the prisoner was not present at my conversation; I did not at any time state the watch had been in the hands of the foreigner, and have no idea of its ever being in his hands. I have taken great pains to find the foreigner, thinking him the worst, he being old enough to be the prisoner's father. I should suppose him about forty-five years old, but he took my attention very little, as he took no part in the business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (reading.) At the latter end of June, on my return from France, I came by Dieppe to Brighton, on board the steam-packet. I entered into conversation with a Frenchman, who had all the appearance of a gentleman, with whom an intimacy was soon established; he told me he had already visited England, and had some acquaintances in London, but had no knowledge whatever of the English language. I immediately offered my services, and we came to London together; on our arrival we put up at the same hotel, from whence he requested me to accompany him to Giraudier's hotel, in the Haymarket, where he said he had lodged before; he then inquired for Mrs. Giraudier's brother, who had served him as an interpreter during his former stay in England, but was told that, from a situation he now occupied, he was prevented from acting in the same capacity; then, and not till then, did he propose to me to act as his interpreter, promising to remunerate me for my loss of time; I acceded to his request, and then he confided to me that he was by profession a jeweller - that his object in coming to England was to inform himself of the price of every article in that line; after which he intended to have a large quantity of French jewellery brought to England if the prices suited - thus we went about to different jewellers, where he always contrived to employ me in writing what he dictated, which prevented me from observing his proceedings: he now and then begged me to act as if for myself alleging as his reason, that a Frenchman asking the price of English jewellery, might excite suspicion, as every article was much cheaper in France than in England; and his being a foreigner would induce them to ask a larger price; this was so plausible, I did not hesitate to do as I was told. In the course of a fortnight he gave me a ring to pawn; and on expressing my astonishment at his being obliged to resort to those means, he replied, that not receiving remittances as he expected, he found himself short of money; in a word, he accounted for every thing in so natural and plausible a manner, that I am convinced any person in Court would have been deceived as I was. I shall now proceed to the cause of my apprehension. I went to Mr. Norman's with the Frenchman to pledge a diamond pin. Mr. Norman informed me he had received positive information that two persons, answering our description, had committed robberies to a large amount, and that he was obliged to ask me how I became possessed of the diamond pin. I translated what he said to my companion, who immediately took flight, while I remained astonished at his sudden departure. Mr. Norman begged me to give my name and address, which I immediately did - and said he would make inquiry if I returned in a quarter of an hour. I offered to remain while he made these inquiries; but he told me it was not necessary. I returned in a quarter of an hour, and he said, in consequence of information he had received, he felt it his duty to give me in charge of a constable; but on seeing my companion was absent, he told me to bring him with me. I went to three houses where he was in the habit of going; and not finding him there, I was going home, and, near my own door, I met Mr. Ely and another man, who called upon me to go before a Magistrate. I accompanied them without the least hesitation, and have not since seen the Frenchman.</p>
               <p>MR. ELY. I reached a pair or two of ear-rings out of the window, and most likely the watch was taken then, as my back was turned to him during that time.</p>

I first became acquainted with the prisoner when he arrived in England, two or three months ago; he was accompanied by a Frenchman, named Perren, who represented the prisoner as his interpreter; I had known Perren eight years ago, when he was in this country for eighteen months - he was a jeweller and dealer in diamonds, and lodged at my hotel; he did not speak a word of English, and my brother acted as his interpreter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he dealt in diamonds? A. My brother told me so, and I have seen jewellery in his possession; my brother acted as his interpreter immediatcy he arrived; he has only been in this country once since.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Norman, a pawnbroker, of Princes-street, Soho. I know the prisoner - I was present when he came to our shop, accompanied by a foreigner; the last time he came was when Perren brought a diamond brooch; I believe that is about three weeks ago, it was the day the prisoner was apprehended - he came to the shop, accompanied by Perren, before he was taken into custody - Mr. Norman communicated to him his suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to your shop in a quarter of an hour after those suspicions were communicated? A. Yes - he returned with me; Mr. Norman sent me to inquire if he lived in Pulteney-street; I went to his lodging, to inquire, while he remained at the shop - he heard me sent to his lodgings, and just as I was returning the prisoner came up to me; Mr. Norman had let him go out of the shop - he returned with me to our shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the charge against him at that time? A. Mr. Norman suspected him of having stolen a brooch. I heard no charge made about this watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a French watch, and if I had had any suspicion that would have driven it away - I was led to suppose it belonged to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Hodges to induce him to say anything? A. No; on taking him from the watch-house to the office, he said the hair found in his breast he had taken from his master's kitchen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you afraid your principles would be corrupted? A.

               <p>Q. Was it not to get into his employ that you gave him information? A. No - I could not rest without telling him - it was about 1lb. or 11/2lb. of long hair that Lumbley took.</p>

I saw Lumbley and Wheatley do it at the kitchen stairs - they took 1lb. or 11/2lb. I saw Todd and Hodges take some about a week before. Todd took about 1lb. and Hodges took 1lb. or 11/2lb. a week or two after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you now in the prosecutor's employ? A. I left once because I got more wages.

            . On the 4th of August, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I was in the parish of St. Giles, <placeName id="t18270913-54-crimeloc334">coming down towards Holborn</placeName>

I received a blow on the side of my head, which knocked me right into the kennel; a person had asked me the way to Holborn. I received the blow directly, and fell straight forward into the kennel; two more came up - (the prisoner was one of them) they pulled me on my side, tore my pocket out, and part of my shirt with it - they got 18s. 4d. out of my pocket, which was all the money I had. As I was rising up to run after them, the prisoner struck me in the eye, and knocked me against the brick wall - it cut my eye open - I was almost stunned. Jones the watchman was five or six yards off, and I told him to take charge of him directly - I never lost sight of him. I was covered with blood, and very severely used. Jones took charge of him in my presence without my losing sight of him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the man who struck you against the wall is the man the watchman laid hold of, and that he was never out of your sight till he was secured? A. He never was - there were two more engaged in it. I cannot swear he is the man who took my money, but he is the man who struck me when I was rising - He said "You have not got enough yet" - that was after my money was taken - he struck my head against the wall - I was stunned at first. I never lost sight of him all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What charge did you give to the watchman? A. I told him to take charge of him, for he had robbed me and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give charge of me and my wife for robbing you of your hat? A. I did not - I never saw your wife. I saw a woman run away with my hat while I was rising before he struck me - I did not charge her with any thing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning in question, I was crying two o'clock up George-street, and just at the corner of Ivy-street, the prisoner passed me - the prosecutor called out to me to take charge of him; the prosecutor was lying with his back against the wall, and his face covered all over with blood - he had a very large cut under his right eye; he was about five or six yards from the prisoner, when he desired me to take charge of him; he said, in his presence, there were three men, that two ran away, and the prisoner stopped by; and as he recovered himself, he knocked him down where I found him - that his hat fell off, and some woman came by and took it away - he said it was some woman, but that he did not know whether it was the prisoner's wife or not - the prisoner then called two men by their names - Kelly was one I know; they came up directly, and he said to them,"Have not I been drinking beer along with you;" they both said they had been drinking beer with him - I took him to the watch-house, and the two men followed me down - when I got there, Furzeman, (the officer), said the prosecutor ought to give them in charge as well - the prosecutor said, "I cannot swear to them, but I will swear to him," and they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not standing still when he sang out watch? A. You was standing when I came up; he did not say he gave charge of you for robbing him of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say get up, "For if he had robbed you, he would not stop here?" A. I said no such thing; I went before him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any blows given? A. No my Lord - I went up as he called watch as loud as he could; I was within three or four yards at the time, but just at the corner; there was nobody near him but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me touch him? A. No; I was coming down the street, and he cried out "Take charge of that man;" he was coming towards me in a direction from the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was the 25s. given to me? A. Either to him or to his wife, in his presence - I paid it on his account; I paid the money, as his wife said, he had said he would take her out of the house, if we would give her that money - he was not present then, but he came in the morning, took the money, and took his wife and family away; it was said, by either him or his wife, they would not be troublesome again; that was said in his hearing, if he did not say it himself; the wife and him were talking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a direct application made to you to advance that money, on an undertaking on his part, or by his wife, in his presence; that they would not be troublesome any more? A. That was the impression on my mind; the money was asked for in his presence, on a promise that they would leave the house; he had been moved to us regularly in February, 1825, and settled in our parish, with his family - he was present when his wife received the money.</p>

On the 8th of January I received the prisoner and his family to our parish, by a regular order of removal at that time - I paid him 8s., which I wrote on the order; I continued to relieve him at different times till August - our parish did not appeal against the orders. On the 14th of August I paid him 3l. 5s. to set him up in business as a box maker; I did not then know that his wife and family were in the poor-house at Cripplegate - he, himself, was admitted into our work-house on the 25th of July, with his family, and discharged on the 14th of August, when I paid him the 3l. 5s.</p>

I had seen the note safe on the 4th of August, a few minutes before the left; she had given me warning - I should have been glad to have kept her, she was such an excellent servant.

I searched and found two keys in her possession - I asked where she had taken lodgings, she said, "Up there;" pointing towards Westminster - I asked her to shew me the house; she took me to the British-hotel, in Cockspur-street; she said,"That was her place, and desired I would not open her box nor let Mrs. Neele do it; but to take particular care of her keys;" she said they could prove nothing against her - I went to Mr. Neele's, and tried one of the keys, which I found in her possession - it opens the drawer the note was in; I went with Mrs. Neele to search her box, in which I found the ribbon and comb, also some new linen-drapery, with a bill of it, bought in Greek-street, Soho; amounting to 2l. 2s. 3d. - the keys open any of the drawers.</p>

I said No; two came behind me, and caught me round the shoulders, and were going to take my rod and basket away; one of them pulled at it as hard as he could - they were all strangers.

            . I work with my father, at Mr. Adams' tile-kiln, Bagnigge-wells. I was with Singleton - seven or eight young men came up to him; they asked us, as we were going along, if we had any victuals; they were on the other side of the road - three or four came over at first, and then more followed; he said he had no victuals: two or three of them then said, "Let us go and see what the b-rs have got;" two or three got up, and crossed the road; one of them laid hold of Singleton's rod, and tried to get it from him, but he held it so tight they could not; they then began hitting him, and got his head twisted under one of their arms; one went behind him, and began hitting him in the forehead; he called for the watchman, and so did I; one of them, with a violent blow, knocked him down, and as he fell they took the hat off his head, I saw that done; as the watchman came along they all ran away. I swear that the prisoner is one of them; I cannot say whether he struck him, but he is the one who ran away with his hat - I cannot say who knocked him down, but one of them did. I saw the prisoner in custody about three weeks afterwards, and am sure he is the man who took the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dusk? A. It was rather darkish; there were ten or fifteen of them altogether; there might be more than fifteen - I swore to the prisoner directly I saw him; I cannot say whether he struck him; I could see him by the gas-light; they were all sitting by the side of the lamp; I could see them plainly.</p>

            . I live in Tysoe-street, Spa-fields, with my father, who is a cooper. I was going on this Sunday morning to fish, with Singleton; there were nine or twelve young men on the right hand side of Hare-street, opposite the second gas-lamp; one of them came out in the road, and asked if we had any victuals; Singleton said No, but he did not know how soon we might have some; he then asked if we had any tobacco - we said No: he said, "Let us go and see what they have got;" the prisoner then followed us, and caught hold of Singleton's basket and rod, and tried to pull it away; three or four more followed very quick, got his head under their arms, and hit him; we called Watch! and as the watchman was coming, one of them struck him, took his hat off, and ran away. I will not say who took off the hat, but the prisoner is the man who first spoke to him; I saw him three weeks afterwards, and swore to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe who run away with the hat? A. I cannot swear it was him who ran away with it; I should not know the man who ran away with it: the prisoner is the one who first spoke to us - I can swear it was not him who took the hat away; if any body has said so, he must be mistaken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, the 5th of August, I was on duty in the neighbourhood; there was a cry of Watch! I was coming towards Hare-street, and ran towards the cry; when I came up I saw Singleton and the two witnesses, who complained of being robbed - I did not examine whether Singleton had a blow in the forehead - he did not complain of it; he was without his hat - I looked for it, but could find it no where - he complained of being robbed of it. I have often seen the prisoner in the neighbourhood; he has been about that beat for two years; I cannot say whether he lived in the neighbourhood, but have often seen him about Hare-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you looking after him at all? A. No; I did not look for the persons. I had not met several young men about that night; the prosecutor said they had ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him about that night? A. No, I had not; it was rather darkish when I looked for the hat; my beat is in Hare-street, Fuller-street, and Church-row; I had been round my beat every hour.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, John-street, Newington. On Thursday night, the 16th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in the Kingsland-road, returning home from work. from my father's, in Clerkenwell; I was alone - and in Kingsland-road, Blackford overtook me - I am sure he is the man - I never saw him before; he walked with me till he came to a house on the left hand side of the road - he had inquired where I was going, and said he was going to Newington; when we came to the Carpenter's Arms public-house, on the left hand side, he said, he wished for something to drink; and from his appearance, I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130064"/>to be one of the Newington carriers, and paid 4d. for what he had to drink - I took nothing myself - we were not in there more than two or three minutes - he accompanied me along beyond Kingsland-crescent, and I heard footsteps behind me - I was suddenly seized by the arm by somebody, who came up behind, and laid hold of my left arm; Blackford directly seized hold of me by the right arm, and almost at the same instant I received a severe blow in my right jaw, by a third person, who came in front of me; I was knocked down - I immediately called Watch! - the watchman came to my assistance, and they all three ran off, taking from me my hat and handkercheif - my hat was knocked off after receiving the blow - and as I recovered myself, on getting up, I saw Blackford pick it up - I am sure of that - I cannot be mistaken in him; I saw him pick it up and ran off with it - the watchman pursued them with me, calling Stop thief! till they came to the turning, where we lost sight of them. Blackford and one of them escaped towards Haggerstone; the other ran towards the Rosemary Branch - the watchman said he knew the party" - I went with the watchman to the watch-house, and gave information - the watchman went in pursuit of them - I remained there about a quarter of an hour, and in about an hour and a half, I saw Blackford and Riley brought to the watch-house - I said, I was positive of Blackford, and am positive now that he is the man who seized my arm, and took my hat - I cannot be positive of the others - I lost my hat and handkerchief, which were not worth much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLACKFORD. Q. Did I drink the whole of the liquor? A. I did not say so; but I drank none; I paid 4d.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 16th of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Kingsland-road - I saw the prosecutor there, going by my box, which I was sitting in - Blackford had got hold of his left arm; Riley was close behind him - there were four of them together, including the prosecutor - there was one before; one had hold of him, and one behind him - after I saw them pass my box, I darkened my lantern, went on the other side of the way, and followed them to the extent of my heat - they had not passed many minutes before one of them had hold of each arm, and the other struck him and knocked him down; he fell on the ground - I could not say which struck him - I immediately ran across the road; two of them ran down Haggerstone-lane, and one turned across the fields, towards the Rosemary Branch - the prosecutor got up, and we followed them a little way, but it was no use to run after them, for I knew the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the third man? A. I have no recollection of having seen Read before - I went with the prosecutor to the watch-house, to give information there: and as we came along the road, told the rest of the watchmen of it. We went to a hay-loft in Crooked-billet-yard, Kingsland-road, and met them coming in there - that was only Blackford and Riley; when they got in and fastened the door, we went in and took them - I could find nothing on them belonging to any body - I saw Blackford pick the hat up as he ran away - they both ran away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How near were you to them at the time? A. I cannot say exactly how many yards - I was on the opposite side of the way - I never measured it; I was across the road; it might be eight or ten yards - I ran up instantly; I did not spring my rattle - I had not time, as it was buttoned in my coat; the watchman above sprang his rattle - I darkened my lantern while I followed them, and when the prosecutor fell, I opened it directly, to see which way they ran.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BLACKFORD. Q. Are you quite positive I picked the hat up? A. Yes, quite; I knew you before - you had a jacket on, a waistcoat with sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the other man who had his arm? A. Yes - it was Riley - he caught hold of his hand - he walked behind at first, and then one pinioned him on each side; as soon as Blackford saw us enter the hay-loft, he knew me, and said "You are a bl-y good fellow to come and take me" - that was when I said "Here are two of them here."</p>

            . I am headborough of Haggerstone. On this Thursday night, about twelve o'clock, I was coming up Brunswick-street, Haggerstone, and met Blackford and Read coming from Kingsland-road way towards Hackney - the clock had struck twelve a few minutes before. I had known Blackford before for some years - they were walking. Blackford had a hat in his hand, holding it before him; when he saw me he put it behind him, and when they had passed me he put it before him again. I went back to them, and asked what they had got there - neither of them spoke, but Read shoved me on one side when I went to catch hold of Blackford, and Blackford threw the hat at me, and they ran across the fields - one one way, and one another. I followed Blackford, but he got into a field, and as it was very dark, I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are headborough of Haggerstone? A. Yes - of Shoreditch-road. I know the crescent in Kingsland-road. I was coming from Hackney-road way just by the new church; when I met them I was in Brunswick-street; the gas work's clock struck twelve a minute or two before - I had not heard the church clock strike. I suppose I was about four minutes walk from Kingsland-crescent. I never saw Read before.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Kingsland-road. On this Thursday night, I was standing by my box, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and Blackford coming up. Blackford was catching hold of the prosecutor's right arm - they went by me very peaceably and quiet; the other two prisoners, Riley and Read, were a little way off behind them, about six yards behind them. I am sure of them both - they were walking in the same direction.</p>

On Thursday night, the 16th of August, I was at the watch-house when the watchman gave information of the robbery - the prosecutor was there, and just after one o'clock, I went to the hay-loft in Crooked Billet-yard, and there were four men lying in the hay in the loft, covered with hay - I found the three prisoners there - we took them all to the watch-house - three watchmen were with me. Read was there. I took Riley and Blackford to the watch-house first, then went back and took Read and the other - we had not strength sufficient to take them all to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130065"/>the watch-house at once; the fourth man was discharged, as he could not be sworn to.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Kingsland-road. On this Thursday night, I was at the Carpenter's Arms, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw all the three prisoners there. I saw them go in there in company - the prosecutor went in at the same time. I saw them come out again in less than two minutes. Blackford went on with the prosecutor towards Kingsland - he took hold of his arm, and walked with him - the other two walked behind them - they went up the road towards Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw him go into the public-house, and the three prisoners go in at the same time? A. Yes - I saw them go in together.</p>

               <p>Q. The prosecutor did not go in with Blackford only? A. There was very little difference - I had seen them all three together just before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that before he went into the public-house, the three walked along the road with him A. No; the two were three or four yards behind - they were not all talking together; they went into the public-house about the same time - they had some gin. I did not go inside, but I looked in to see what o'clock it was. I did not see them drink gin. I could see them taking their gin - the prosecutor stood by their side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see each of them drinking gin? - A. No; I saw one of them drinking; I cannot say which of them it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw them all four together in the house? A. Yes; I did not see a fifth man; I only saw the three prisoners and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You mean all four were in the public-house at the same time? A. Yes; they stood at the bar, very near each other; they seemed to be in company; I do not mean to say they were drinking together - I did not hear any conversation between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were only in the same place at the same time? A. Yes, in the passage before the counter; the prosecutor stood near them; he might have seen them if he had looked at them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they standing so near together that the prosecutor could not avoid seeing the other two? A. He could not help seeing them, I should think.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. Q. Who did you go into the public-house with? A. With Blackford; I have no knowledge of any one else - I was walking with him, and went in with him - I did not take particular notice of any one else; there might have been others there - I think Blackford spoke to some one in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed whether he was in company with any body before? A. No; he overtook me on the road - I did not notice any body following us in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could there have been footsteps within two or three yards behind you without your hearing them? A. There might be without my observing them - I went just to the bar of the public-house - it is in front of the door - there is a wide entrance - there is a counter before the bar; the space before the bar may be about four yards; I had not been drinking before I went in - I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . Here is the hat that was thrown at me - I never saw Read before - it was rather dark; there was a gas-light opposite, and I have heard there is a person very much like Read.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, positively, that Blackford and Read were together, coming from towards Kingsland-road - that Blackford had the hat, and Read shoved you aside, and so on? A. Yes; but I said I never saw Read before - I believe it to be Read; there was a gas-light opposite - it was a very dark night - I had only the opportunity of seeing him by the light opposite - they were then about ten minutes walk from the hay-loft - the field they crossed leads that way; I am certain of Blackford; the other man went down Haggerstone-lane - that leads in the same direction - it would lead to the hay-loft also.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had not seen Read before, do you believe he is the man or not? A. I believe he is - it was a person answering him in every description, and he had on just the same dress as he has now, exactly so, a red waistcoat, blue apron, and that jacket, and he had a glazed hat - I saw that distinctly, and when he was apprehended he had the glazed hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there is some other person like him? A. I have been told so since.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. This is my hat; I have had it some time in wear; the maker's name had fallen out about a week before - I named that to the Magistrate before I saw it.</p>
               <p>BLACKFORD's Defence. On the night of the robbery I had been drinking at the Eagle, in Kingsland-road; about half-past eleven o'clock, I was coming towards home: a person, who had been drinking with me, was rather intoxicated, and I led him home; this officer and a watchman came and said to me, "It is time you were at home:" I said, "I have been taking a man home." I am in the habit of going out to the markets about two or three o'clock in the morning, and thinking it was too late to go on further, I thought I would go and lay in the loft, as it would be time to get up soon; I went to the loft - the officer and watchman came to me; I was fast asleep; he said, "I want you:" I said, "For what?" he said, "You will know presently; by whose permission are you in this loft?" I said,"By the owner's." After I had been in the watch-house ten minutes, the prosecutor came in, and Jones had charge of him; the prosecutor said Jones was implicated in the robbery, and the officer would not allow the constable of the night to take charge of him, as he said he should want him to appear against the prisoners in the morning; the watchman said, "I will give charge of this man," and the prosecutor said, "Charge for charge:" he was so drunk, that he could hardly stand on his legs - they are now swearing false.</p>

            . It is false; the prosecutor came back from the watch-house to my beat, and asked why I did not come to his assistance: I told him I heard nothing of it, my beat was so far from the spot; he was rather sancy about it, and I took him to the watch-house for assaulting me on my duty; he did not charge me with being concerned; he was angry with me for not assisting him.</p>
               <p>A. W. MOORE re-examined. I was not drunk - it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130066"/>quite false; nothing was said about charge for charge; I did not charge Jones with being concerned in the robbery; after I had given information, I was told to go home, and attend at Worship-street; as I was going home, Jones asked me if any of the men were taken; I said No, but I had to attend before the Magistrate; I said I thought the watchmen on the road were very neglectful, as I cried Stop thief! very loud: he said they should have enough to do, if they attended to every cry of Stop thief! I said by their not coming forward it appeared as if they were implicated; he said, "Do you mean to say I was concerned?" I said, "No; I said no such thing;" another watchman came up; I told him of it, and I was taken in charge, because I said I thought the watchman might be implicated; they took me to the watch-house at the time the two prisoners were brought in; the watchman wished the person there to take me in charge, but he would not, as I gave him my card; I did not hear any rattle sprung at all.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 43, Drury-lane. In the beginning of July I bought of the prisoner, a gold snuff-box, which I have returned to Dr. Clendinning - I gave him 8l. 12s. for it; there was an advertizement afterwards, and I went to Bow-street about it - I also bought of him some sheets and shirts, for 6l. 19s., and some table-cloths; he was very genteely dressed, and represented himself as having come to London for pleasure, and having been rather too extravagant, was obliged to dispose of his property to go home to his friends in the country; he did not name what part - I produced the property at Bow-street, and detained a few articles, in order to produce, if the prisoner was taken; he came again, about a month after the first transaction, and offered to sell me a brooch - I secured him immediately - I have kept a shirt and gold pencil-case, which he sold me.</p>

            . I live at Hillingdon. On the 10th of September I was in company with the prisoner and Durden, about half-past eleven o'clock at night; we had been to a wedding; Clarke, Cherry, Watts and Beddis were there - Samuel Rutter had been married, and we had been merry-making at his house, which is down by Providence chapel, Uxbridge - I went there about ten o'clock, and found them there; there had not been much drinking; we were all coming home together, going to Hillingdon; we sat out from Uxbridge about half-past eleven o'clock; the prisoner and Durden came with us all the way: nothing happened till we came up to <placeName id="t18270913-63-crimeloc384">Hillingdon-end</placeName>

As soon as Durden recovered himself he got up; the prisoner struck at him with the knife, and cut him in the neck, across the back of his neck, and likewise cut his ear - Beddis came across from the opposite side of the way, and began to pitch into Joseph Durden with his fist - Durden then struck Beddis; they had a bit of a scuffle altogether, and the prisoner cut Joseph Durden in the thigh - Durden had only struck him once: that was after he knocked him down with a stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they got into a fight? A. Yes; Durden, the prisoner, and Beddis - all three had a bit of a fight together - that was before he cut his thigh with the knife. The prisoner was in a great passion, and swung the knife about very much; none of them had drank much while I was at the house; I had not kicked George - I only touched his head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On your oath, did you not hit the man's hat, and knock it down over his eyes? A. I did not; I thought it no arm to put my finger on his hat; I did not do it to vex him - his wife was not there during any part of the scuffle; I did not throw her down, nor did any one else; I saw her on the ground - she was drunk; that was directly we came out of the house - I was not there when she was picked up. I swear she was not present during the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Beddis, in the first instance, interfere to prevent you and your drunken companions ill-using the prisoner? A. No. I forget whether Beddis knocked him down; I do not think he did, but I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not some of the party catch hold of this old man by the neck handkerchief, and almost strangle him? A. They did not; Durden did not push him against the wall; the prisoner was going along quietly when I touched his hat; his wife was not ill-used by any body in my presence - it was a moonlight night.</p>

            . I had gone to this merry-making about eight o'clock - there was not much drinking: we left about half-past eleven o'clock, to go to Hillingdon; I was walking some distance before the witnesses; I heard a noise and squabble between them behind; I went back, and met George, with a knife in his hand - he threatened to cut me if I did not go out of the way; he then directly cut my brother Joseph - they both fell down together.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but did they close together first, or did your brother try to lay hold of him? A. No; after he cut my brother they both fell down - he cut him just down by the thigh; my brother was then standing; they both fell together; I saw nothing before that, nor afterwards. The prisoner's wife was not there; I had not spoken to him before he spoke to me - I got out of his way.</p>
               <p>Q. You turned round, and went up to him - did he miss you and strike your brother by chance? A. Yes - he struck at me, I got out of the way - he missed me and struck my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you going up to secure him, or what? A. No; I did not know what was the matter; I had seen nothing but good will between them before; we were all good friends at the wedding, and came away good friends; my brother had never quarrelled with him; he said he would cut the first person who came up to him, and I went up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear to be defending himself against the persons who were attacking him? A. Not that I saw; I did not hear him say, "Keep off from me;" I saw nobody ill-use his wife. I saw nobody strike Beddis, nor did I see Beddis interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not your brother got the prisoner throttled up by the neck, against the brick wall? A. No. Beddis was walking along the path; he might be a yard before him; I did not see the prisoner's wife on the ground; as we came out of Rutter's house the party broke up altogether - she was tipsy - I saw nobody so tipsy as she was; I did not notice her walk out of the house; if she was laying in the parlour she might have got up before I got to her; I was nearly the last person who came out; I saw her standing in the road when I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, was she not knocked down by some one, and very indecently used? A. I heard of nothing of the kind. Clarke took the prisoner's stick from him, and returned it to him; I cannot tell who had it when I saw him with the knife; we were not going the nearest way home, but we generally go round that way.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I went to Rutter's house about eight o'clock in the evening; there was some drinking: we broke up about half-past eleven o'clock- the prisoner and his wife were there; we had been very sociable, and all left together - the prisoner and I were coming home together; Larkin was behind us; I did not see him do any thing. George turned round with his stick in his hand, and struck Larkin; it was a common stick;

             was in the middle of the turnpike-road - he stepped up to the foot-path, and George hit him on the side of the head, and knocked him into the kennel; I instantly went, and took the stick from the prisoner's hand; he said,"D-n his eyes; I will let the g-ts out of the first man that comes near me;" he was in a great passion: I went and put my back against the wall, and did not see what happened afterwards.

            . I was at this wedding, and came away with the rest; Joseph Durden and I were walking along the road together - I saw the prisoner striking Larkin, who had put his hand on his head; Joseph Durden stepped over, and said, "What is the matter?" George made no more to do, but knocked him down in the gutter - as soon as Durden recovered he got up, and stood in his own defence - he went up to him, and George struck him again, with a stick; Beddis (who was going along on the other side of the way) came over, and began pitching in to Joseph Durden; Durden struck at the prisoner, but hit the wall - George then began upon him with the stick - Clarke took the stick from him; George then drew out his knife, and swore he would let Clarke's g-ts out, for taking his stick away; Joseph Durden, Beddis, and the prisoner were all down together; there was a scuffle between them. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130068"/>George cut Durden on the ear, and then on the back of his neck - and as I was dragging Durden away the point of the knife caught my finger; we were then going home - George was first, and met Samuel Durden coming down to meet us; George said to him, "Get out of the way, or I will let your g-ts out;" he turned round, and cut Joseph Durden in his hand - that cut was not intended for Samuel - he turned round to Joseph, who was behind him, and cut him; the prisoner was not in liquor - I did not tell the Magistrate so; I said he was rather in liquor, and that Beddis was in liquor; Joseph Durden went to strike at him before the knife was drawn - he did not put himself in a fighting attitude - he had one hand in his pocket, and the other by the side of him - that was when Larkin was struck; they were all in good humour at the house, and no quarrelling at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of a touch did Larkin give the prisoner's hat? A. He only put his hand on the crown - the prisoner had done nothing to provoke anybody; he was walking quietly with Clarke and talking - I did not see Joseph Durden knock Beddis down - they were all down together, all in a scramble. I do not know who threw Beddis down - the prisoner's wife was very tipsy; I did not see her till it was all over - I saw her on the ground when we came out of the house - I saw nobody push her down or ill-treat her - she said, Larkin did it; her person was very much exposed as she lay.</p>

            . I was at this wedding; as we came along I saw Larkin walking behind the prisoner, trying to trip his heels up - I went across and said they were a set of scoundrels, to try to interrupt the man, as he was quite peaceable, and interrupted no one; they said nothing to him, but tried to trip his heels up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on the ground? A. Yes; Larkin and Watts threw her down; her person was very indecently exposed by them; they threw her clothes up - the prisoner had not said a word to them. When I went to interfere for the prisoner, they began to cry out, "Oh!" I was knocked down twice and received a number of blows. Joseph Durden had got him pushed up against the wall before he cut him - he had him twice against the wall before he struck him with the stick - I saw nothing of the knife; they pushed him twice against the wall before he used the stick - and I suppose, he received ten or a dozen blows - my daughters fetched me away before the stick was taken from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there any body but yourself who saw them in his possession? A. Yes, the officer. I traced him down the road to Colchester, from Ilford - they had noticed him at some gates, and some they had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not want you to go with him to a house, where he said he was directed to drive them? A. No; he said nothing of the kind to me; he told me nothing about Dyer - I had no conversation with him, but what I have stated - he said something about Dyer before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you trace him to Ilford? A. I inquired at Chingford-gate, and from what I heard there, I went on.</p>

On the 31st of August, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was in Tottenham-marsh, and saw the prisoner driving the two cows out of the marsh - they were two pole cows - one red and one white, with a bald face - the other was a blue spotted one - I have known the prisoner these nineteen years - he has been a farmer, and lives at Tottenham - I am sure he is the person - he drove them along the bank of the river, towards Chingford - I did not know whose they were; I said,"How are you, Mr. Southgate;" he made no answer that I could hear; I saw the cows again on this day week, in the marsh - I went and picked them out myself, by order of the Magistrate, from among ten or twenty others, and drove them up to Mr. Mallett; they were the same as I had seen the prisoner drive away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was broad daylight? A. Yes; there was nobody else there. I did not suspect him - the river bank is a public path for foot passengers.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 16th of September, I left the house about a quarter before six o'clock, and left nobody there - the shop was shut - I locked the street-door myself - the whole house is mine - I am the landlord. I returned about twenty minutes after seven o'clock with my wife. I applied the key of the street-door, to unlock it, and found it made no impression on the lock. I instantly tried the handle of the latch, and pushed the door open - it was shut close too and latched, but not then locked. I did not examine the lock at that moment. I heard a noise in the house, apparently at the foot of the stairs, and immediately exclaimed "Good God, there are thieves in the house!" I called out Thieves! and at that instant two men rushed out past me. I made a blow at one of them with my umbrella, and got hold of him, but he got away - they both ran away. I pursued them both down Princes-street, calling Stop thieves! but returned immediately, got a light, and observed that the door leading to the parlour at the foot of the stairs, and which leads into the shop, had been burst open. I found the desk in the shop in confusion - I had left it shut but not locked. I missed a metal watch case out of the window, and a gold key. I have seen the watch-case since. I cannot speak to the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your private residence? A. My family reside in Rup ert-street; I have my meals there, but I sleep at the shop in Princes-street.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I went out with him on Sunday night, and came home with him. I saw him try the door - he opened it, and called Thieves! and almost instantly two men came rushing out of the house; the first who rushed out, attempted to strike Mr. Wood with a crow-bar, but I put up my hand, and held the bar tight; he tried to wrench it out of my hand, but I held it so fast he could not get it - he left it in my hand, and got away. Another came out, and I tried to catch hold of him. I knocked off his hat in trying to get hold of him - I picked it up, and in it was a large bag; the constable has got the hat and crow-bar. I cannot say whether the prisoner is either of those persons - he is like the second man - he is not the one who made the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How soon after this did you see the prisoner at the watch-house? A. It might be about an hour or an hour and a quarter, for I went home to recover myself from the fright. When he was shown to me, among others, I said "They have none of them their hats on, and I cannot say without;" all their hats were then put on, and I could not swear to the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Little Argyle-street, Between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday evening last, I was near the prosecutor's shop - I saw him and his wife go to the shop door. I was about ten yards from them - I heard a cry of Stop thieves! saw a scuffle at the door, and instantly saw the prisoner bolt from the door and run down Princes-street. I pursued him, came up to him very soon, and caught hold of him, but I could not hold him - he ran swifily; he continued to run down Princes-street. I followed him, calling Stop thief! till he came into Panton-street - he turned into Panton-street; a person there attempted to sieze him, but they both fell, and I instantly secured the prisoner. I had not lost sight of him for an instant from the time I saw him bolt from the door, till I took him - he had no hat on. I brought him back into Princes-street - a watchman came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at the watch-house that you would not swear to the prisoner's person? A. I did not; I said I would swear he was the person who escaped from the house. I was not three yards behind him when he turned into Panton-street; I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Three Fox-court, Long-lane, Smithfield, and am married. On Sunday last, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in Princes-street - I heard the cry of Stop thief! I immediately turned round, and got into the road, out of the way. I saw the prisoner as he passed me - he crossed the road as I stood in the middle of the road; he had no hat on; I saw him put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, puil something out, and drop it. I immediately ran and picked it up - it was the watch-case; as soon as I stooped to pick it up, Alcock, the watchman, came up and caught hold of me; I gave itto him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. No; I was certainly rather frightened; but I took particular notice of him, and can swear to him; I was not so much frightened when in the middle of the road as before, as I thought I was then out of the way of the mob; he passed me very quick, but I saw him coming all the way down the pavement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see what became of him after he dropped the case? A. I saw no more of him till he got to the watch-house, as I was picking up the case.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. James'. On Sunday last, between twenty and twenty-five minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Coventry-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I crossed over into Princes-street; and some way down Princes-street I saw a great crowd assembled; I got into the centre of it, and heard people say that woman had a watch; I went and demanded it from her, but she would not then give it me; I desired the people to bring her to the watch-house. I then turned from that woman to the prisoner, who was in Mr. Smith's custody; he gave him to me, and told me to take particular care of his hands, for he was dropping something; the prisoner could hear that; I then brought him along Coventry-street; on the way to the watch-house he dropped a key, which I picked up; I took him along Titchbourn-street, into the Horse Shoe public-house, searched him there, and found another key in his coat-pocket; also a candle, a silk handkerchief, two half-crowns, and 6d.; and as I was going along, there was as many as nineteen keys given me by different people, who kept picking them up; the woman gave me the watch-case in the public-house, where I searched the prisoner - I then brought him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge; he said the key I found in his pocket was the key of his own street door; the Magistrate told me to give it to an officer; here is the key I picked up in the street; I call it a skeleton key - I gave up the nineteen keys at the office - I cannot say they dropped from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the persons here who gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130070"/>you those keys? A. No; the one found in his pocket was a common one.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James, Westminster. I received charge of the prisoner on Sunday evening last, with a number of pick lock keys, which I produce - a crow-bar was given to me afterwards, also a hat and bag from Mr. Laing, whom Mrs. Wood took me to- I tried the crow-bar, and found it exactly corresponds with the marks on Mr. Wood's inner door; one of the keys opens his street door.</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOD. I delivered the hat, bag, and crow-bar to Mr. Laing - that is the hat and bag I can swear; the hat was put on him at the watch-house, but the lining was out all but one stitch.</p>

            . The hat fitted him, in my opinion - he pulled it over his face, and said it would not; but the lining was then torn out - part of the lock of the inner door was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. This watch-case is mine, and had been in my possession for the last two or three years. I left it hanging on a watch-house in the window on the Saturday evening - it is worth 2s.; it was not attached to a watch - the key was worth 8s.; that has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is more than a watch-case? A. It is a case, and there is a dial and glass in it, but there are no works.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in an ale-house in Leicester-fields. I had occasion to go to Chelsea; I came through Sidney's-alley; and, being rather late, ran violently down the street; another man ran in the same direction - I did not see whether he was without a hat - as I turned into Panton-street, I ran into the arms of a man, and we both went down; Mr. Smith came up in eight or ten minutes, and took me by the collar. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

I got to the Royal Exchange about three o'clock; he set me down there; I paid him, and discharged him; he had stopped and spoken to a man near Islington, in the middle of the street. I do not know what he said to him. I went to my lodgings about eight o'clock that night, and my trunk was gone - it contained a Spanish cloak; two coats, three jackets, about a dozen shirts, half a dozen pairs of trousers, some handkerchiefs, and other things - they were worth 15l. at least, beside my papers - I have found none of them since.</p>

I am certain he is the man; it was No. 117; I had never seen him before - he came between two and three o'clock; the prosecutor and prisoner lifted the trunk into the passage - I heard the prisoner say it was very heavy, and ask if it was doubloons; the prosecutor smiled, and said Yes; the prosecutor went away in the coach, and in about three-quarters of an hour, the prisoner came with the same coach, and demanded the trunk; he said the gentleman was very sorry, and it was wrong altogether; that it was to have gone to Leicester-fields; and said, the gentleman had given him half of a pound to satisfy me for the lodging; he offered me half-asovereign - my demand was 5s. I could not give him change, and he gave me 5s. in silver. I walked into my room and left my little boy there, while he took the trunk out - it was in the passage when he came; I did not see him take it away - I saw nobody with the prisoner, and cannot say whether any body was with him or not; the prosecutor came at eight o'clock to take possession of his lodging, but went away in five minutes.</p>

On the Friday following, the Magistrate asked him where he lodged; he said he could not tell the number, but it was nearly opposite a court in Archer-street. I found the house, No. 42, by his description - he said it was a front room, on the first floor. I went there with Colton - I found no part of the property; but there were sixteen common keys, and a dark lantern, which I brought away - I told him afterwards we had been there, and he admitted they were his lodgings.</p>

I was coming through the market at a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, on the 19th of August, and saw the prisoner and another taking onions out of Fluck's basket, at the next stand but one to mine; the prisoner went away with them - I followed him, and called the watchman; I collared him.</p>

I then went and searched the place where the prisoner was stopped, and found twenty-five pieces of silver coin English and foreign, and those other articles; this was an hourand a half or two hours after he was taken; he struggled very much when I took him, and said, "Don't meddle with me - it is only a bit of a lark." I went to take him, and he threw up his arms, and said, "D - n your eyes" - and then, I think, he threw the property into the ditch, where I afterwards found it. I gave it to the constable.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Regent's-park. On the 12th of August I saw the prisoner going up the hedge side, near the public-house: his waistcoat bulged out, and his hat was loose on his head. I went up to him, and he appeared to be picking thistles; I said,"What have you got?" he said Nothing; I said, "I will see what you have got;" he said, "D - n you, you shall not;" I then caught hold of him, and one of the pots fell from his hrt - he said if he could not get from me, he had something which would injure me - he then pulled out a large knife, and cut his handkerchief, which I had hold off, and cut me across the knuckles - he then got away. I caught him by the coat, which tore; a young man then came up, and he was secured - before I took him, he said he would fight till he died, for if he was taken he knew his doom - when he was taken he threw two pots over the hedge, and the knife after them.</p>

On the morning of the 1st of September I went down about six o'clock - the shop was not then open, but it should have been. I went to the yard door, and heard the sound of china in the shop. I looked, and saw Palmer take the china down, sound it, and put it on the floor - there were twelve cups and saucers, a tea-pot, two plates, and two basins; he then went and put some of it down near the door; he then came and took the rest - he opened the street door, and beckoned some one - Stevens came in with a basket, and they put the articles in it; they went into the other shop, but what they did there I do not know; they then went to the door, and Palmer said to Stevens, "Keep quite on this side of the way, and no one will say any thing to you." I then went out and took Stevens to the watch-house - he said Palmer had employed him - and he was to have 1s. to carry them to Hanway-yard. I took him to the watch-house - we then came back and took Palmer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Stevens you had never seen before? A. No, not to my knowledge. I hear he bears a very good character; I was at the yard door when I heard the conversation; about six yards from Palmer. I heard the words distinctly "Keep quite on this side the way; and no one will have any suspicion of you;" this was not said in a very low tone. I believe Stevens is a painter and glazier.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know he was engaged in building? A. Yes; I believe he has two little houses, and is getting up another - he first said he bought it of a man on the road, and then he said he bought it at Battle-bridge, of a man of the name of Jones, who lived at No. 33, Covent-garden. I believe Mr. Sellers went there, and said he could find no such person a stone-mason - he found a man of the name of Jones, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130075"/>keeps a cook's-shop - we have not advertised the stone - I have not been to the prisoner's house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might be the other one who said, "I have been having a bit of fun with the lady?" A. No; it was we have been having some fun with the lady; I did not see the reticule; the lady did say at first, that she thought the prisoner was one of the men, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did she say so? A. When I had hold of the man's collar, she was quite in a flurry, but when she recovered herself, she said he was with the thief.</p>

Being rather unwell I left home to take a walk - on my way home I went across this field, as the prosecutrix has stated - I stopped to look at the corn; a young man came up, and we were discoursing, I dare say for two or three minutes; this lady came by - as I was turning down a lane, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and I saw the young man who had been speaking to me rush by me - I put out my hand to stop him, but he got by - I told the witness who came up to stop him, but he let him go, being a man nearly his own size, and took me - the lady came up, and he asked if I was the person, she said No - he said, "Shall I let him go?" she said No - I believe he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130076"/>was with the other, but stop till my son comes up - the young gentleman then came up, and said he believed I was the person.</p>

On the 15th of July I was going home and met the prisoner (whom I knew before,) in Maidenhead-court; he asked me into a public-house, and said he would treat me - he took me into a house, and called for a pot of beer; he would not pay for it - he wanted me to pay, and I would not - the publican took it back again; the prisoner then said, "Have you got no money?" I said, "No, and I do not want the beer; you may pay for it;" he then put his fingers to the bottom of my waistcoat pocket, where my purse was, and took it out - I told him to give it me, that nobody might know it; he then held his fist at me, and pulled me into the passage - and while I was waiting for the watchman, he bit my fingers - the watchman came; he struck the watchman, and made away - the watchman followed and came up with him again, and struck him with his stick - he was then taken - he denied having the purse at first, but when the constable got up to take him, he produced it - the money was all right in it, and a bit of black thread was in it.</p>

            . I am an officer, and produce the papers which were delivered to me at Hatton-garden, by Turner, Gower, and the other witness.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. I know these papers - part of them are my writing, and part my clerks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was in the New prison, Mr. Taylor said, if he got his papers back he would be out of the way, and not prosecute me - he has discharged two clerks for dishonesty.</p>

               <p>MR. TAYLOR. There was a written paper sent me to sign, agreeing not to prosecute, but I declined signing it; I said I would make no compromise - I said, perhaps, if I got all my papers back, I would not. I have discharged two clerks for dishonesty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, On the 5th of July I left the office at dinner-time, and two officers came to search my apartment, saying, Mr. Taylor suspected I had taken some papers - I was taken to the office, and discharged next day; the Magistrate desired him to return me some papers which were taken from my lodging; but I left them for Mr. Taylor to look over - and left a note, saying he might look them over, and take what he thought proper. I left them there several days, then went and took the rest away, and sold it for waste-paper; I heard no more for some time, when he sent word that he was determined to prosecute me, unless I gave an account of what I had taken away; this was on the 7th or 8th of August. I had applied to him for 2l. 8s., which appears to have excited some vindictive feelings against me. On the 21st of August he sent me a note, stating that he wished to see me or my wife, and on the 23d I was again taken - the paper produced is precisely the same as was delivered to me at Hatton-garden - Mr. Taylor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130077"/>called on me in the New prison, and assured me he would be out of the way; his words were, "If you will give me up that green book, I will not prosecute; but if not, I will do all I can to transport you." He has discharged some clerks, and it is hard I am to bear the blame of all that is lost - I was allowed only 15s. a week, and had a difficulty to get that. I had some papers to copy at home.</p>
               <p>MR. TAYLOR. The papers desired by the Magistrate to be returned were not these - this is a subsequent transaction.</p>

In consequence of an anonymous letter I watched him, and about a quarter past nine o'clock, on the 15th of August, I saw the prisoner Jones come in, and when he went out, I followed him, and asked what he had been to the warehouse for; he said he had got a little hair; I asked how much; he seemed confused, and said about a pound or half a pound: I took him into the counting-house, and asked him what he paid for it; he seemed confused, and said Ryan could tell what he paid for it; I called Ryan, who said 18d.: I had the hair weighed, and it was 2lbs. 10ozs., the value of which is 7s. 6d. I told Ryan he must be a very bad man to deliver so much hair at such a price: he said it was a mistake altogether; I said I could not look it over, and got an officer - I had seen nothing take place between the prisoners in the shop; Ryan entreated forgiveness, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then Jones went into the house? A. Yes; Riley said it was his first offence, and that he had done wrong - I do not recollect his saying it was a mistake - he had lived seventeen years with us, and bore a very good character.</p>

I went down and asked Ryan how much he had received of Jones; he seemed confused, and said 18d.; after some time he gave it to me - he turned his back; I do not know whether he took it from his jacket pocket; I had seen Jones come in, but saw nothing pass between them - they went into the wareroom together.</p>

On the 24th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners together, within a yard of my house - I was a few yards off, talking to a person - I then missed Ward, and saw him come out of my shop - Edwards was sitting down on the step of my door - I am sure they were in company before; my shop door was open - my wife came out after Ward. and said to me, "Why don't you mind the shop, this man was in the parlour;" I then went in and missed the watch from the parlour, which was safe between nine and ten o'clock. I went in pursuit, and took Edwards about one hundred yards off, in two minutes; he had turned a corner; Ward was gone then; he was taken that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear your wife say any thing to Ward? A. Yes; she asked what he did there; he said, "He came for a halfpenny worth of milk;" he spoke to Edwards, and they went away - no other person had been in the shop after I saw it safe - Ward had no business in the parlour.</p>

I said, "If you have got it, give it him;" she then said she had not got it - he gave charge of her, and I took her to the watch-house, She then said she had given it to a woman named Smith, whom I went to take, but could not find.

Smith took from Easton a handkerchief which was warpped up clumsily - she put the handkerchief into my hand, and said it was for me to keep till the middle of the day, I looked at Easton, and said, "There are two of you - I want to know what is in this." I gave it back, and they opened it; there was a watch in it, which looked like this one. They came again, and left a snuff-box and duplicate with me.</p>

            . I am a constable. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 14th of August, Yowband was brought into the watch-house; she said she had not the watch, but would tell me where to find it - if I went to No. 5, Viuegar-yard, and searched closely, I should find it, as Kitty Smith had got it. I went and found Smith's husband in bed, but she was not there; next morning, I went to Hall's, in Vine-street, and found this duplicate and a snuff-box.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 31st of August, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was rather in liquor - I had about 50s. about me in gold and silver; there were seven or eight shillings; the rest was a sovereign and half-crowns; the prisoner is a coachman - I hired his coach at the top of the Haymarket, and went to King-street - I then got on the box; my money was in my right hand breeches pocket, which was next to him; the coach went on to Bennett-street, Westminster, but it stopped several times before that - I first missed my money when I got off the box - I am positive it was safe when I got on - I then gave him in charge - I had felt him fumbling about me, and told him it would not do - I missed between 40s. and 50s.; he was searched, and two or three sixpences found on him - Sherriff was there part of the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who was the friend you picked up? A. I had no one there; there was a lady there - I said nothing to her; the prisoner said he would take me to his house, to have a fowl dressed, which I had in my pocket - I had bought it in Oxford-street, about nine o'clock - I am not married - I will not swear I was sober - I drove the coach myself part of the way - I did not drive so long as a quarter of an hour; the lady got in near the Horse Guards, and got out in Bennett-street - I did not pay the prisoner - I will not swear that I did not say I had 5l. nor 1l. 12s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any opportunity of going to put the money away? A. He went into a public-house; he came in there afterwards for his fare - I went into the public-house to give charge of him - I called the watchman directly, but he did not come directly - I will not say whether the watchman was drunk - I live at No. 7, Earl-street; he drove me to Villiers-street, as I went to see a friend, a butcher - I was in the coach when we were opposite Northumberland-house. there was a friend, of the prisoner's in the coach - I was robbed on the box - I cannot swear whether I was in the coach with his friend.</p>

            . I was coming down Cockspur-street. The coachman accosted me; the butcher and the other man got out of the coach, and solicited me to get into it - I said I had no objection to a ride - I stepped in, and they all three got on the box together; they drove furiously on through several streets, and when I sat down, I saw the other man had got his hand in the prosecutor's pocket; he took out his money; he and the coachman shared the money between them, behind the prosecutor's back; when I got down I saw the traces of the coach were broken, in consequence of their furious driving.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? I work at the braid trade - I did not know the prosecutor before; it was folly in me to get into the coach: no one was inside with me. I heard the butcher say he had got a fowl in his pocket - I had been taking my work home - I did not hear him say he was robbed of 5l.; he said it was between 2l. and 3l. I live in Bennett-street - I was married fourteen years ago. I dare say I told them I lived in Bennett-street - I do not know whether I did not; the coachman took me imprudently round the waist, and then the other man asked me to go in, and I did; the coachman was tipsy. I do not think he knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who drove the coach? A. The butcher first, and then the other man; they drove furiously, and tried to upset the coach - I was in the coach when I saw the other man take the money; it was a charriot - I put out my head, and said, I saw what they had done - the man put out his fist, and said he would put my two eyes into one, and knock me out of the window.</p>

I did not hear him say it was 2l. 10s. - the first word he said was, he had been robbed of 2l. I was calling the hour, and then went up to the coachman, and said he was my prisoner; the prosecutor then said, "You scoundrel, you have robbed me of 5l.; take charge of him." I said I could not take him from his horses; the prosecutor then said he was robbed of 35s.; he was in liquor, but knew what he was doing.

My little boy told me the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, that a man had gone out with this stove - I looked out, and saw the prisoner with it. I gave no alarm, as I thought it might be quite right. I afterwards heard the door shut again - I looked up, and saw the prisoner with some covings on his shoulder - I then sent to the person who had the key, to know if any person had fetched the key away; Miss Heffer came, and said she could not open the door, there must be some one inside. I went to the door, and sent my boy for a constable; and while he was gone the prisoner came out with this other stove.</p>

I laid hold of the shawl, but he got away, and I could not hold him; my neighbours were in bed - my husband came home soon after: he went after the prisoner all night, but could not find him; we then offered a reward.

On the 8th of September the prisoners came to purchase some print - we showed them several - none suited - they bought none; and as soon as they left, I missed a piece of cotton. I ran out, but not seeing them, came in again, and my sister said something. I then missed another piece, and ran out again and passed a street, and in returning met them coming out of that street. I told them I missed two prints; they said they would go back if I made no alarm, and as I got to the door, I stopped to call a neighbour - they got a little before me into the shop. I went in and saw the green-print go from Hurley's hand on the counter - the other piece was then on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. They gave you a good deal of trouble, did not they? A. Yes; there were several prints on the counter. I did not miss the green pieces first - one of them had a basket, I think it was Hurley - they offered to be searched afterwards; neither of them had a green shawl on, that I observed.</p>

My sister called me into the shop; she ran out, and I missed the green print; she ran in again - I said the green print was also gone; she ran out, and brought them back, and I saw the green print in the basket, before it was thrown on the counter; and, soon after, I saw both pieces on the counter; Hurley then said,"Search me;" I said, "There is no occasion to search you, you have thrown enough out of your basket;" she said, "Will you swear a person's life away in that manner! Oh! what lies."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had one of them a green shawl on? A. Yes; I am sure the prints were not on the counter a few minutes before.</p>

            . My husband is a presser. I saw the prisoners in Margaret-street - Davis took something out of her pocket hole, and put into the basket; she then took something else more bulky, which appeared to be the green print, and put in - they carried the basket between them.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on the 23d of August, and took the prisoner - she gave up some duplicates of this property, and said she intended to redeem them on Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had she been with you? A. Between four and five months: she might be poorly, but never had any medical attendant - there was 2l. 13s. due when I spoke to her; she had given me notice to quit, and the expiration of the notice would have been in two days. I will swear that the first time I missed any thing from her apartments, was on the Tuesday night previous to the Friday on which the notice would have expired. I spoke to her of it on the Wednesday - I gave her into custody on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My remittances did not come in, and I pawned some sheets, which the prosecutor knew of- and the day I was committed here, she told me she was not a fool, she knew I had done it. Poverty alone induced me so far to forget myself.</p>

            . I keep a silversmith's shop. The prisoner came into my shop, two or three months ago - I cannot tell whether it was June or July - I was before the Magistrate, but do not know when - I have a very short memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to the Magistrate, at the examination, on the 24th of August: - "The prisoner came to my shop, and threw the spoon on my counter - I asked where he got it; he said his mother sent him with it?" A. Yes; it was broken. I do not know his mother - I weighed it; it was 13/4 oz. - I paid him 8s. 3d.; here is the spoon - I live in at No. 4, Upper East Smithfield, near the Mint - I deal in clothes as well as silver - I did not ask where his mother lived. I sell my silver to the refiners.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this spoon worn out? A. It is; because it is broken; it is not worn out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day did you buy it of me? A. I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's son; she informed me she had lost a spoon. I was accidentally passing Israel's shop, about a week after, and saw a spoon which appeared to me to be the same. I got an officer, who went and brought up Israel; the prisoner had been in my employ, and was discharged on the 6th. If this spoon is ours, it is much disfigured since I saw it last. I told the Magistrate the spoon produced there was mine - I cannot swear to it now. I knew the spoon I saw in the window was my mother's; if this is the same, it has been much worn, and knocked about since. I believe the one I saw to be ours, but the parts of this do not fit the bowl.</p>

On the 3d of August I was going my rounds, and at White's-bridge I saw the two prisoners coming across the country; one had a bundle under his arm, and the other this basket across his shoulder - I took a different direction, and met them in a lane, and asked what they had got - Francis said, "I have got nothing, not much;" I said,"What have you got?" he then said, "A turkey, I bought it of a man in a cart at Harrow, for 5s., for a gentleman in the Borough" - I asked what part of the Borough he lived in - he said, he did not know; I then asked where he was to take it to - he said, to the gentleman's brother in Westminster - I asked where there - he said he did not know; I asked if there was any direction on the turkey, and whether it was alive or dead; he said it was alive, and there was no direction; I then asked Smith what he had got; he said, "Some apples, to make a dumpling;" I asked where he was going to to make it; Francis replied, he was going to his house; I asked where that was - he said, in Westminster; I asked what street, and what number - he said he did not know; I then took them into custody, and have brought the turkey here.</p>

On the 10th of August I saw the prisoner - I have known him for the last twelve years; he came into the shop and took a piece of leather out of the basket, looked at it, and asked for some others. I had some suspicion, and took notice of what I put before him. He looked at them and asked for some others; and while I was getting them, he reached over, and slipped down two pieces by the side of the counter, and caught them with his knee. He then bought a pair of me for 71/2d., which he paid for, and went out; I pursued him, and met the constable in the street - we went to his lodgings. He had been home, and was gone out again; we wanted to search, but his wife would not let us, unless we had a warrant - we went to the office, and they told us to go back and break the door open. We went back and found these two pieces of leather in a pan of water, which they had not been in above four or five minutes. I can swear to them - we found the prisoner in Newport-market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. But he has bought a great number of pieces of leather of you, and whether these were not some of them you cannot tell? A. Yes; I can - I had bought this one pair that day, and they have particular veins on them; being in water so short a time will not alter them.</p>

I bought a pair of soles for 71/2d.; for which I paid - and if he had any suspicion he naturally would have given an alarm, it being in the middle of the day; I went straight home to my dwelling - I left the inner soles, and went towards the Strand - when I was going down Newport-market I met a man I knew, and while talking to him the prosecutor and the constable came up and charged me with the robbery. They took these two pairs of soles from my apartment, where there were several pairs, all with the prosecutor's mark - they had all been bought at his shop.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When you went there, did she say anything to you about it? A. She said all the property she had about her was a few halfpence - we took her in a back room; she threw out those few halfpence - we then searched, and found the box and duplicate: she at first said, before the Magistrate, that Mrs. Allen gave her the watch, and 1s. to pawn it; she afterwards said a young woman gave it to her - in coming home, she said she was a poor unfortunate creature and was sorry she had done the crime.</p>

I was in the parlour, behind my shop, on the 10th of August, and saw the prisoner come into the shop with long strides, and lay hold of the paper, which was at the farthest extremity of the shop - he had to reach over the counter to get it. I ran out, and he dropped it on the counter - he had moved it about a yard. I gave an alarm, and followed him. He was stopped in my sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not sitting in your parlour at the time? A. No, I was standing - I did not see you with a pipe in your hand; there is a curtain before my parlour window - but I was looking, because I had been robbed the night before.</p>

            . I heard the cry of Stop thief! and ran out - the prisoner went some distance, through three or four courts, and came round into the street again. I had an opportunity of seeing him plainly when he came out of the shop, and am quite certain he is the man - I have no doubt whatever - he said at the office that he went in to buy a sheet of paper - I saw no pipe upon him at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out to buy some tobacco. I saw no one in the shop; I took a bit of paper out of my pocket to light my pipe from the gas, and it was the shadow of my arm that he saw when he came out. I certainly did run, but it was to avoid the unpleasantness of being locked up.</p>

I received the money the day before, at Somerset-house. I had passed Friday night at home at my lodgings - I had had a drop, but I knew what I was about - I turned out on Saturday morning about seven o'clock. I went into another public-house, but did not go to sleep - I went home to go to sleep- I first saw her about six o'clock in the evening, at the Ship and Shears public-house. I had been home to lie down, and went out in the afternoon to buy some things, and kept myself sober - the prisoner and several others came in - I was in that house from six till near nine o'clock- I believe I drank with all the women; about a quarter of an hour before I went into the street, I had overhauled my money, and put the heaviest part of it in my bosom - the other change I put into my jacket; when the man came up to me he collared me, and asked what was the matter - I said I had been robbed, and he gave me a drive, which staggered me across the street.</p>

The house had been entered by the back premises, through a hole, which had been forced in the partition - these shoes, and this bed-gown are mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. The two houses were formerly one - there is a partition now between them. I went to the prisoner's father's house, on the 8th of August, with a search-warrant - in one corner of the shop next to the prosecutor's premises, I found a hole, and a bag hanging over it; I lifted up the bag, and found this blue nightgown, and this pair of shoes; and on the other side of the partition, I found this cap, which the prosecutrix identified. I was looking after the prisoner the whole of the day, but the prosecutrix met him, and took him to the watch-house. I saw him there, and asked him what he had done with the things - he said he had given them to his brother, and knew no more about them. His brother, I am sorry to say, is a very bad lad. He was taken up, but not committed.</p>

There was an agreement, which was signed by both parties, and the prisoner was to have the use of the fixtures - there were stoves fixed in the house at the time he entered, on the 28th of April. He said that he was in the iron way - he occupied the house, but never resided there; his lad and one of his men were there. On the 16th of July I went there, and missed a stove from the room, on the second floor - the prisoner was not there. This is the stove, which I have no doubt was in that room.</p>

On the Saturday before I was taken up, he sent me to a green-grocer's, to say that he had a stove for sale - the green-grocer was not then at home, but he came afterwards and had the stove, which came, I think, from the first floor in that house - I had helped the prisoner to take it down the night before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner on a charge of taking away fixtures, out of this house at Wapping, and selling them - he said he thought they were his own - he had taken the house, and had a right to the fixtures.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Defence. I took the house and warehouse, to carry on the ship-chandlery business; I undertook to put the house in repair; and this grate I was going to replace with a new one, which would have been three times its value. I had goods ordered, and I expected them in the day after I was taken, but I was obliged to countermand them to save my credit; I had not run away from the house - I was there two or three times a day.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Webber-street, Lambeth. I know the prisoner had taken a house, and there was an agreement between him and me, for me to put it in repair; this was about the 16th or 20th of June; I went there twice to see what repairs would be wanted: he said there were very old stoves on the premises, and I told him that I could recommend him to a person, who would let him have some modern stoves cheap; I had intended to have taken the old stoves myself, and made him an allowance: I have nineteen houses myself, and Lewis, who collects rents, was with me when this agreement was making; he made no secret at all about his taking the house, or of there being old stoves there.</p>

I went down and asked the mistress where she was; the woman told me to get out, and said she did not keep a bad house. I said I was sure she was there, but the woman would not let me see. I went and got an officer, and he found her at the next house.</p>

He then begged my pardon, and said I was not; he then returned with the officer, and said I was the woman.</p>

            . I lost the articles stated, on the 25th of July. I had been dining with some friends in the City, I had drank rather freely. I went on to Holborn, and got into a hackney-coach - the coachman took my case in hand, and drove me home; there was a stranger followed me into the coach. I do not exactly know what happened there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You recollect that you introduced yourself first to me to take a pinch of snuff, and told me to tell the coachman to take you to Covent-garden, and in going along, you took the pocket-book out of your pocket, to see if I could find a card of your residence? A. I recollect nothing about it - I might do so. The next morning the coachman called on me, and asked if I had lost any thing. I said I had, and he desired me to attend at Marlborough-street.</p>

            . I am a hackneyman. The prosecutor went by me on the evening in question - the prisoner had the umbrella in his hand when he called me from the rank to take the gentleman in: I then drove Mr. Roberts to his house - we had some difficulty in finding it, but we found it by the card which the prisoner has been speaking of. I was paid by a person in the house, and was going home - when I had got about twenty yards, the prisoner called to me, that he had left his umbrella in the coach. He came up, opened the door, and got in, and was shuffling the cushions about; I got off, and told him an umbrella was easily found, to take it, and go along, which he did, and I went on for about half a mile, when he came after me again, and wanted to get in again, as he said he was going my way; I said he should not get in, but he might get upon the box, which he did. When we had got some distance he wanted me to let him get in again, for some other things; I said there were no other things - he said Yes, there was a silk handkerchief, with some pastry in it; I said I saw none, and there were none in the coach. I kept him in conversation until I found a watchman, and then gave charge of him; he was taken to the watch-house, and there said the umbrella was his own, and he said so again at the office; I told him to open the door and take the umbrella out, but I did not authorise him to get into the coach, nor was any thing said about it.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by a watchman and a coachman, about one o'clock in the morning; he had this umbrella in his hand - I searched the coach, and found the snuff-box and pocket-book in one corner, under the seat. The watchman gave me the spectacles, and said they had been taken from off the seat.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Holborn, and when I came within four or five feet of Mr. Roberts I kicked against the umbrella; I took it up, and considered it as my own; there were four or five persons round Mr. Roberts, laughing at him; I said, "You had better call a coach;" the waterman said, "No one will take him unless some one goes with him;" I said it was a pity he should be out all night, and I would take him to his residence. Before that he had handed me his snuff-box. The waterman asked me for something, and I gave him a halfpenny; Mr. Roberts said he lived in St. Martin's-lane, Long-acre - we went there, but no such person was known. I said "Where do you live?" he said, No. 9, Wood-street, Cheapside - no such person was known there. He said, "It is all right - drive about all night;" he afterwards said, "Go to No. 8, Covent-garden-market;" the coachman said, "I will go there, and if that is not right I will put him into the watch-house;" in going along I asked him if he had got a card in his possession - he said Yes, pulled out a pocket-book, and it was No. 2, Newport-street; the coachman said he would go there: we found that was his residence, and there we left the gentleman. Now, do you suppose that if I knew there were such articles, that I should not have embraced the first opportunity of taking them? I certainly did call after the coach, and demanded the umbrella, which I considered as my own; I then went on a second time, and said to him, "If I had known you had been going my way, I might as well have rode as walked;" he said, "It is not too late now, get up." I then said, "I have left a silk handkerchief in the coach, which is of value to me - it cost my wife 3s. 6d.;" he replied, "I have a great notion you have been taking improper opportunities with that gentleman," and he gave charge of me."</p>

            . I am a watchman of Saint Luke's. On the 20th of August I went into Crown-court, between four and five o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner coming along the court, and another person with him. The prisoner had three saddles on his right shoulder - I caught hold of him, and he immediately threw them down - I called a porter to assist me, and we took him to the watch-house.</p>

I have undergone several operations, which has reduced me to great distress - I parted with every thing I had in the world. In coming up Swinton-place, I saw these pots on the rails; knowing them to be Mason's, I took them, intending to take them home; I had half-a-pint of beer in his passage, and then went to the corner; before I thought of delivering the pots. I was taken.</p>

            . I live at Hendon, and work for Mr. Thomas Jenkins. I went to work about half-past six o'clock, on the 25th of August, and on going through a little wicket-gate, into a bleaching-ground, I saw a wicket open, which goes into an orchard. I looked further, and saw the string was cut, which fastened the wicket. I directly went to the hen-house, found it was broken open, and nothing in it, but one guinea cock - I informed the servant - I went into the road, and met a man, whom I asked about the fowls; he asked me if I should know them again; I said, Yes, and one in particular. I have seen them since, and know them.</p>

On the morning of the 25th of August I heard some fowls go by my window; I got out of bed, looked out, and saw some men go past with fowls - I got up, with a neighbour, followed them, and took them; the prisoner was one - he said he was employed to carry them, and was to have three halfpence and his breakfast, when he got to London. I found six other fowls on another person - the prisoner had three in this bag - the other person ran away.(Fowls produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a builder. On the 7th of August my son came and told me that a man had taken a pot, and put it under his apron. I went out and saw the prisoner running in Augustus-street, Regent's-park - he jumped down the area of an unfinished house - I could not tell which, but I waited a short time - two men came up, and I beckoned to them to watch; I went into a house, where I saw him standing. I asked where the pot was; he said he knew nothing about it; I brought him out, and then he said if I would let him go, he would tell me where it was; we then went into the house, and one of the other men found the pot behind some bricks. I took him to Mr. Morrison.</p>

I went up stairs again, and in about a quarter of an hour I looked out of the window, and saw a person standing against the gas-light post. The prisoner came up to him with this roll of cloth under his arm - I went down and pursued them - the other got away - I took the prisoner into custody; when I first saw him he was about four doors from our house - it was then about five o'clock. The other person had something in his hand, but I could not see what - the prisoner said he found it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was present at the execution of this warrant - I found this tailladder; these articles were all on the cart, which were found on his premises.</p>
               <p>REV. MR. JONES re-examined. Q. Have you examined the wood? A. I believe it to be wood taken from my premises - I am convinced the shafts must have been my linen-posts, because they are perfectly similar in the nature of the wood, and because the two ends of the shafts are very dark, in having been in the ground and there me some of the rails in the ladder - they are the same kind of oak with some that have, and I am inclined to conceise it to be mine - I have not the least doubt in the world of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are a clergyman you state? A. Yes; I am chaplain of Whitehallchapel. This paint on the rails, exactly corresponds with the paint on the rails of my sheepfeld - and there are five in another which corresponds with the others I have lost,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130104"/>and the nail holes correspond with the nail holes in my fold - I did not miss these rails till the cart was found - I remained in this country till the end of April. These things usually belong to carts; my carpenter told me that this is a foreign oak; he is dead. I bought them of a timber-merchant at Edmonton - I was not inclined to press the case, because I did not consider it sufficiently strong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you under recognizance to appear? A. Yes. The prisoner was to take care of my horses, cows and sheep, when I went abroad. The posts were fixed in the earth; they were not in sockets, but in the earth.</p>

On the 4th of August I saw the prisoner take these five handkerchiefs off the ground - I cannot tell how they came there; I had hung them up in the morning on a book, about two yards within the shop; it was between two and three o'clock; he stood just outside and reached in - he had not been in the shop; I followed him, stopped him, and asked what he had got in his hat - he said nothing. I told him a person had seen him put some handkerchiefs into his hat, and desired him to come back - he said he would; he turned, and came back a few steps - he then gave me the handkerchiefs out of his hat, and wished me to leave him - I said"No, I will take you back;" he kept dodging me about, and then ran away. I pursued, called for assistance, and some gentleman stopped him, and took him to my master's, who gave him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prisoner had been there, but was gone - he returned in about a quarter of an hour, and was told what had taken place; he came to me, and said, "I beg your pardon - I know where your handkerchief is, and if you will go with me you shall have it;" we went to a stall in Huntingdon-street, just by - he asked Archer's wife for the handkerchief which he had left there; she said her husband was gone out, and had got it with him; he then said to me,"It is all right - you shall have your handkerchief;" I said,"When I get the handkerchief I shall say it is all right - but you must go back with me;" Constantine came, and took him, and as we were going to the office we met Archer, running with the handkerchief. My jacket had been off a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I do not know whether it was taken while my jacket was on or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Were not many persons about? A. Yes, and many coats and hats were off- it might have been put into the prisoner's hat. When I first missed it I offered half-a-gallon of beer to any one who would give it me, if they had done it for a joke. The prisoner told me he knew where the handkerchief was, but the officer had then been sent for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he know the officer had been sent for? A. Yes - I told him myself, when he returned, but at the time the officer was sent for he was not there. When Archer came, he said he had brought the handkerchief, which the prisoner had left with him, and told him he would call again presently; neither Archer nor his wife said he left it with them to find the owner - he said he did it for want - he had had no work for a long time.</p>

Gray gave me a watch there to take care of for him, as he was not going home that evening; he remained there drinking till after it was lost; the prisoner Connor came in and cut my gown down, but I did not feel it, till I felt the knife sticking at my breast - I put up my hand and then missed the watch - I caught hold of her directly, and saw her pass it to Robinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A servant; I had been drinking wine - I cannot say how much; I was sick there - I had been to Kensington, and had the wine - I drank nothing at this house; I was not sober. Gray called for three half-pints of gin, which the prisoners and other people drank, but I drank none - Gray is not here.</p>

I had seen him before - he had followed me two or three times; they ran away together, and James gave the bundle to Butler - they ran down Little Gower-place, and tried to throw it over the pales, but it fell down, and I took it up; I carried it on to Mr. Potts' - some persons were pursuing the prisoners.</p>

I do not know the street; I never mentioned the name of it, or the number of the house - I never said it was No. 20, White Lion-street, or that it was at Mrs. Clark's. I met her again on the Wednesday following, in the same place - I did not give charge of her; and, on the Friday after, she was brought to me by a shipmate - and was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not take her on Wednesday? A. I was afraid she would run from me.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 4th of August, the prosecutor came to me between five and six o'clock, and said he had been robbed; I went with him - he could not point out any house. On the Friday he sent for me, and said he had seen the woman, and his shipmates were going to bring her down; she was taken, and he swore positively to her - she was remanded twice, but he had given us information of quite another person altogether.</p>

I then saw Collins and William Murphy take it up, chop it into pieces, and put it into a barrow, which Collins wheeled down Parliament-street; William Murphy ran and joined him in Parliament-street (Dennis Murphy remained at work). I followed them to Schofield's, in Dean's-yard - I saw them take the lead out and carry it into the shop; I immediately went in, seized William Murphy, and told Schofield it was stolen goods; here is the lead, it is pieces of large pipes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. William Murphy and Collins took it away? A. Yes; but Dennis came to the very spot where they were taken, in about ten minutes - eight o'clock is the time they leave work; they were working at the office of the Board of Works, Scotland-Yard.</p>

On the 1st of September the prisoner came, and my boy showed him some things, and called me into the shop; another person came in, and then a third; two of them went into the counting-house, and tried on several pairs of trousers - I had my suspicions. I went and saw the prisoner putting a pair into his hat - the others then went away. I attended to the prisoner - he was there about half an hour; he tried on a pair of drab trousers, and said they would not fit him - he then put on his own. I understood he was going. I walked to the door before him, and accused him of it - he said he had nothing; he took off his hat, and there was nothing in it. I detained him; he unbuttoned his own trousers, and produced this pair from the seat of them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. The prisoner came to our house that evening, and sent me out three times for a young woman whom she knew. I did not go far the first time, but came back and said I did not see her. I went as far as the Star and Garter public-house the second time; and the third time, as I returned, I met the prisoner with a bundle in my mother's red handkerchief - this was a little after eight o'clock; she asked if I had seen the woman - I said Yes. I went home and missed the things, which were safe when I went out.</p>

            . On the 15th of July, I was in the back room of this house where I lodge; the prisoner came in and told a young man and I, who were writing a letter, to come into the front room, as we should be quiet - we did so, and in a few minutes we came into the front room. I saw her tying up a bundle - I knew nothing of her before; she brought the bundle, and put something on my box. I went up stairs, and as I came down, saw her going out - I followed and enquired for her.</p>

On the 10th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night I marked a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, which I put into the silver division of my till; no other silver was there - I had closed my shop, and finished business for the night; my niece marked some copper. I got up about half-past five o'clock, and at a quarter to six, I saw the prisoner in my shop, which was not then opened for business; no customer had been; my niece and I then went into the parlour, shut the door, and put up a thick curtain, so that we could not be seen; we turned it aside, and had a fullview of the till and desk; the prisoner came to the back door, when the servant had taken down seven shutters; as soon as he set his foot in, he called "Mrs. Oakley!" pretty loud- I made no reply; he instantly advanced into the shop, and went on stooping, with his head below the counter, to the till, and drew it out, then raised his head, and looked into it, put his hand in, and took something out - he then took something out of the copper drawer; he went to the desk and tried that, but it was locked; he returned in the same position, went to the back door, ran up the first pair of stairs, stood there a few seconds, and returned, went out, shut the door, and ran into the stable - I had seen the money safe in the till just before - I examined it again directly, and the half-crown was gone - I sent for an officer, and he was taken - I went to the watch-house, and saw him struggling with the constable; he declared he had not set his foot in the house that morning; the officer would search him, and found the marked half-crown, which I knew directly; he threw some copper on the table in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is your son in partnership with you? A. Yes; I keep the house; this was housekeeping money - it did not belong to the trade - I had taken it from the till before - I have a certain sum for housekeeping; my son lives in the house; if I do not lay it all out, I have the rest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you take the money out of the till to mark it? A. No, from my pocket - it was my own, for housekeeping.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 12th of July, I was with McWilliams and Tyrrell, in Church-row, Bethnal-green; it was just then getting light. I saw Hawkins riding on a gelding, at the corner of Busby-street, which leads out of Church-row - I suspected all was not right, and ran after him; he was only walking - I pursued him up Busby-street, and when I came up with him, I asked him whose horse that was; he hesitated a minute or two, and then said, he was a drover, and was coming from Romford, that about a quarter of a mile below Bow-bridge, a man in a fustian coat hired him to ride the horse to Church-street, Bethnal-green, and he was to have 1s. - but he was then riding away from Church-street - Tyrrell had got up by this time; he took Hawkins; I lead the horse to the corner of Brick-lane; McWilliams went to the farther end of Church-street, near Shoreditch, where Hawkins said the man was to wait for him - he returned in about ten minutes, and said there was no one waiting; that nobody was there but the watchman - we then took Hawkins to Bethnal-green watch-house. Tyrrell and I took the horse away, and at the corner of Hare-street, Brick-lane, we saw Hitchcock coming along - this was about six hundred yards from where we met Hawkins; we took him, and Tyrrell found a quantity of oats in his pocket; he was walking toward Church-street - we took him to the watch-house - we asked him where he had been - he said in the brick fields all night; we said nothing to him before we searched him. We asked Hawkins, in his presence, if he was the man who gave him the horse; he said No; we locked them up. I shewed the same horse to Mr. Kain, who claimed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was the shop open? A. About half-past seven o'clock.

               <p>Prisoner. I admit pawning it. I met an acquaintance named Jones, who owed me 7s., which I asked him for - he said he was short of money, and wanted to pawn the desk, which he had got, but felt tenacious of going to a pawnbroker - I pawned it for him and gave him the money; he paid me 5s., I allowed him 2s. for the duplicate.</p>

I went up stairs, and found the doors were open - I came out to look for Daniels, but could not find him. I returned, and found the prisoner and the other man in Daniels' room, packing the things up - I forced into the room, and took the prisoner; he struggled, and got from me - the other man ran out; Peckard caught the prisoner - I am sure he is the man - they were putting the property into bags.</p>

            . I am an oil and colourman, of Broad-street, Golden-square. Last Tuesday night, at a quarter to ten o'clock, Sullivan came to my shop, and asked if I would purchase some chrome yellow; I asked what quantity; he said he had 2lbs. handy, and could have more; I asked what he wanted; he said 1s. I asked to see it; he ran across the street to the other person, I think, who gave him something in a handkerchief - and when he returned, as he only asked a quarter of the usual price, I detained him, and sent for a watchman; he ran out- I followed him, brought him back, and gave him in charge; he said he was the manufacturer, and lived near Vauxhall-bridge - he afterwards said in Milbank-street, and next day said he took it from the prosecutor.</p>

            . I lost my shirt, trousers, handkerchief, and snuff-box, on the 30th of August - the prisoner has my handkerchief on his neck now - I came that day from the India-house to Mr. Cole's. I saw the prisoner there, and he said, "I will cook for you, if you will give me a mouthful of rice;" I gave him a half-crown to go and get some beer; he went away, and did not return with it - he afterwards came and took my clothes away. I was a little tipsy, and went after him, but he got away - this was on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell any body of it that night? A. No; I was not so drunk as not to know what was going on. I saw him take the articles; I know this tin-box to be mine; I saw him take it along with the other things.</p>
               <p>GEO. DEVEREL re-examined. Q. When did you take this box from the prisoner? A. On the 31st of August; Rose came the next morning with another person, on another charge. I found on him a bag, which belongs to the other prosecutor and this box in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The things I took I delivered to the officer. I did not steal them; Stevens gave me them to take care of.</p>

               <p>JURY to HENRY ROSE. Q. How do you know this box? A. It has been black, and the black is rubbed off - that is my handkerchief round his neck; it is quite plain, and has no border; it is three-cornered shape.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not take liberties with her? A.

            . I am a sawyer. and live in Wright's-buildings; the prosecutor is a tenant of mine - he has been badly off for the last five years. I never saw him with a watch in my life; he told me he had been robbed of one; I said it was odd, for I never knew him have one; he said,"Oh! Yes, I took it out of pawn yesterday morning from Philpot's, at Bermondsey." I know he often borrowed money to get victuals - I would not believe him on his oath.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Why? A. I believe him a very bad character - he has no lease of my house; I want to get rid of him- I never knew him swear false; he is given to drink; I think he was fresh when he spoke to me; he had come home in the night in question quite tipsy; I would not believe him if he was sober, for I believe he never had a watch.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MARTIN re-examined. I was once taken to Union-hall for an assault, and was acquitted; this man's wife once took me there, but they were glad to make it up. I was never there at any other time; she charged me with indecently exposing myself.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Wright's-buildings, Spa-road, Bermondsey, and live on my income. I have known Martin ten years; he was always in very indigent circumstances. I never saw him with a watch; I saw him on the 27th of August, in the morning, and told him I had read in the newspaper of his having been robbed of a watch- he said it was true, and that he had been hustled by three youths; I said I never saw him with one; he said, "I don't wish all the world to know what I do with my property;" he said he took it out of pawn at Thomas', which is now Philpot's; I said, "You must get a document from the pawnbroker to satisfy the Court that you had it;" he said there was no necessity for that; he afterwards said, "That is already done;" he said the person he was taking the geranium to, could prove that he saw it three-quarters of an hour before; I said, "Why, you was going there?" he said, "Yes, and while I was there, a person came in who had been robbed of 30s."

               <p>JAMES POWELL. On the 22d of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was in the street - I could not get into my own lodgings. I met Fearnley, and west with her to her lodgings, which are a second floor back room in <placeName id="t18270913-257-crimeloc1449">Collingwood-street</placeName>

I had not been in the room two minutes before I heard sovereigns jingle - she was sitting at my side. I had examined the contents of my purse previous to going there, and had spoken to nobody but herself. I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was gone. I accused her of robbing me, and insisted on her returning it to me; she then called out, and the other two prisoners attempted to get into the room - I did all I could to prevent their coming in till the watchman came, but they did come in, and shortly after, I saw Chandler standing with her back to Fearnley, and putting her hand behind her - I suppose she took my purse from her. Brown shortly afterwards went out of the room - the watchman came in soon after, as the landlady had called him; he searched, but could not find my money - Fearnley and Chandler were still in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Yes - I had met some people on business, and left them about twelve o'clock, I slept in Collingwood-street after this, at the same house - it is in the City-road - I could not get a bed any where else. I suppose I was robbed before the other two came into the room.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went to No. 3, Collingwood-street, and found the prosecutor, Fearnley, and Chandler, all in the second floor back room - he said he had been robbed of four sovereigns and about 20s. in silver - he accused Fearnley of taking it, and said Chandler came to the door and stood before Fearnley. I took Brown in her own room in the same house - she said she had got nothing - I found no purse - she denied having been into the room.</p>

I refused to go to bed till he gave me some money - I got up to come away; he pulled me about very much; Brown came to the door but did not enter - Chandler came in; he then left off pulling me about; I said"You good for nothing wretch, I will have the watchman here;" he then said, I had robbed him - the money that chinked was 3s. 6d.

I pursued directly, calling Stop thief! and somebody came behind me in Golden-lane, and struck me a severe blow over the ear, which hindered my observation - I had, before that, seen Bodell turn up Busket-alley, which leads into Whitecross-street. I described him to Harrison - he wore a blue coat, and, I believe, corderoy trousers; I went that night with Harrison to the Barley-mow, public-house, Blue Anchor-alley, and saw about a dozen people there, but he was not there. On Sunday evening the officer called, and shewed me some lace, cambric, and Irish linen; I went to the office on Monday, there were about thirty persons there; I pointed out Bodell at once as the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 8th of September, Lovegrove described the person and dress of Bodell to me; but I did not know where he lived. I went to the Barley-mow, he was not there - next evening Lock and I went to the Barley-mow again; we found Bodell there, and a man named Burke - we took them both, but Burke was discharged at the office; we put them into the watch-house, then went to Burke's lodging, and found Hammond there; I asked her where Burke was, she said she expected him every minute to tea, the tea-things were on the table. I saw a bag hanging by the fire-side, and in it found this piece of lace, and a piece of cambric; she said Burke had brought them in, in his hat, and gave them to her - Lock turned the bed down, and under the clothes found this Irish linen. I went to Worship-street; put Bodell into the room with twenty or thirty others, and Lovegrove immediately identified him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have a pair of shoes and a Guernsey-frock, which I took off the prisoner's person, about six days after the robbery - he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor agreed to let me have the things, and he was to be paid for them when I got to Gravesend. I merely went out for some tobacco, and seeing the ship moving, I went to assist, which was my duty- I went to join the ship, and found another man was engaged in my room.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of August, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was coming over Kingsland-road bridge, and saw the prisoner with another man coming out of the prosecutor's stable - the prisoners had each a sack; the third man opened a door to see if any body was coming - he did not see me; he said something to the prisoners - they came into the road, and went into a stable belonging to Brace. I followed, and saw them throw down the loads in the stable. I pushed the door open, went in, and there saw Brace, who had been holding the door, so that we should not come in - he keeps a horse and cart. I asked him what they had got - he said a bit of corn and chaff for the horse - we took them in charge; another patrol went after the third man, but he was gone. I went and took Batley's horse-keeper, but he was discharged - here are the two sacks which I found in Brace's stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when you saw them? A. By the wall, about thirty yards from the stable. I could see the door by the light of a fire from a coak burner. I saw them within two yards of the stable door; the third man was in the stable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was my own money, which I received from my master. Witness. No; he gave all his money to his sister the night before, and she came that morning, and said to him, "How can you say this is your money, when you know you gave it to me last night." I found 12s. and the brooch at the bottom of the leg of his trousers, which Williams claimed as his, and described the brooch before he saw it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your sight not defective, Sir? A. Yes; I missed it directly they were gone; nobody else had come against me - it was in my waistcoat pocket - it was safe a few minutes before - nobody came near me but them. I advertised it as lost, and offered 15l. reward for it.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live in Petticoat-lane. On the 11th of July, about seven o'clock I saw Lyons give a watch into the hands of Henry Levy; he looked at it, went into his house, and returned with some sovereigns, which he gave into the hands of Saunders - they then all three went into a public-house, at the corner of Arrow-alley, Petticoat-lane. I heard some silver ringing - I went to Taylor's house, but he was out; and at night I saw him and gave him information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known Taylor long? A. Yes; I knew he was at Aldgate watch-house - I was never locked up there; I have sometimes been out late, and Taylor let me in there; that is not once in a year - I do not go by the name of Tyo; they call my brother so. I work for my brother - I knew the prisoners by sight - I knew nothing of a reward till afterwards; I expect nothing - I do it for the good of my country - Levy lives at No. 1, Petticoat-square.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received a description of the prisoner, and took him twelve days after the robbery, on the Sunday fortnight. I told him it was for a piece of work in a public-house, and then said it was for robbing a man of his watch; he said he had not been in the house at all - I took him to the watch-house. I put him with a number of other prisoners, and took the prosecutor there - he clapped his hand on his shoulder, and said "This is the man;" and wanted to know where the property was - the prisoner said, "If I tell you, you will prosecute me all the same;" he then said, if I went to his father's, I should hear of the watch - I went there, but his father denied it; a man was charged with being with him, but there was nothing against him. The prosecutor told me of the robbery on the same night, but I could not find the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Berwick-street, and was called; the prisoner was coming out at the door. I seized him, and asked if he was the man; the landlord came up to me, and said "Come and clear the house." I let him go to clear the house - the watch had not been named at that time. I saw Mrs. Cormack, but she did not tell me of it till I had let the prisoner go. I then cleared the house.</p>

On the 1st of September, at half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw Ballard coming from my house (I was going towards the house) he stood, and looked up and down the street; then turned his head, and he spoke to somebody through the key-hole of my door - he looked up and down the street; then turned and spoke again - he did the same thing a third time; then Cain immediately came out, and they went away together - they turned into the next street, and I saw Cain give Ballard something but could not see what it was. I then turned into my house, found my street door open, and my shop door broken open. I went to my chest in the shop, where my property was kept; I found it wrenched open, and part of the lid off - I missed ten sovereigns, a silver watch, and 8l. in silver, from the chest. I had seen them all there on the 26th of August: I had the key of the chest - I saw the chest safe at five o'clock that morning, but did not open it. I directly went in pursuit, but did not overtake them. I took Ballard between one and two that day; I took Cain in Smithfield-market, on the 2d of September. I found my watch in pawn at King's, in Holborn; it was in the chest with the gold - I have found nothing else. I know nothing of Wilson. The officer fitted to the place an instrument belonging to Cain's father, and it corresponded with the marks; I fastened the street door when I went out that morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by McDOWELL. Q. What time did you return to your house after you lost sight of the prisoners? A. I returned to my house directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you go to bed the night before? A. Between ten and eleven - I locked the door, and believe I was the last person up.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and lodge at Dunn's. Between six and seven o'clock on this morning, I saw Ballard standing at the door; Cain came out - they joined together and walked together; they walked close, and Cain was showing something to him, but I could not see what it was; Dunn told me his box had been broken open. Before Cain came out, I saw Ballard peeping in at the door - I saw Cain go into a wine-vaults in Holborn, and saw Ballard counting some halfpence there, but I had no idea of their having this sort of property. I was looking to see if they had any wearing apparel - I afterwards saw Dunn and told him; we went to the wine vaults for them, but they were gone.</p>

            . I am the wife of Patrick Dunn. On this morning, at six o'clock, I was going to market, and saw Cain standing inside the passage, against the shop door, looking at it. I stepped back for about ten minutes, and then sent my little boy to see if he was gone - he was then outside; I stopped about ten minutes longer, and then went out - Cain was then gone; when I got to the top of the street, I turned and saw Cain go into the house - Ballard was standing opposite. When I returned home, I found this chopper, which has been part of a sword, laying by the side of my husband's chest; I had seen Cain frequently chopping wood with it - I shut the door when I went out: my husband had gone out at half-past five o'clock. Cain returned and went into the passage when he saw me gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CAIN. When our street-door is shut, we cannot get in without somebody coming down to open it. Witness. Yes; there is a lock which ties back in the daytime - I had left the door on the latch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say you never gave Dixon leave to take away any soot? A. No, not by any means; he had been in the habit of conveying some from one of my premises to another for three months - but I had given him orders not to take any on the 23d of July. Barry was not in the habit of buying soot of me; I never knew of his having any soot till the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Dixon never had any authority to let Barry have any? A. No, and he never received any of mine; Dixon had been employed by me to take it for me from Queen's-court to Coleman-street.</p>

            . I am a sweep, in the employ of Mr. Badger. I know the two prisoners - I have seen Barry at my master's cellar, and Dixon told me if I saw my master I was to say, "Master, do you want Jack?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much did you get? A. We had part of one sack between us; Dixon was in my master's service - I knew Barry before Dixon came; he used to come to another man who was there. I have been there three years - I first thought of telling my master of this on Sunday, when I came home from school. I do not know when they took it rightly - they had been at it about six weeks; I had no share of it till the last; Dixon told me he would beat me if I told; master did not say he knew all about it, and he would beat me if I did not tell him; I had a share of it.</p>

            . I am fellow-apprentice with the last witness. Barry never was in my master's employ - on Saturday, the 21st of July, I saw the prisoners in the cellar; Dixon filled a sack, and Barry took it away; then he came back with the sack empty; Dixon filled it again, and he took it away again - he came back in the afternoon about three o'clock, and then took another sack; he told me to cut the lumps down, and put the lightest of the soot in; Dixon gave me and Tuff 1s. between us - they promised us 1s. out of every three sacks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember Barry coming there before Dixon was there? A. Yes, and Tuff knew it too; my master never lost any soot before Dixon came, to my knowledge. I did not tell my master of it till the Sunday, when we came from school, because they said they would beat us - we had only 1s.; Savage came and told our master, and then he asked us if we knew any thing of the robbery.</p>

            . On the 30th of July I was in Cheapside, and saw the two prisoners coming down Wood-street into Cheapside - Donnovan went into two Manchester warehouses; they then went into Trump-street, and Donnovan went into the prosecutor's - Topper walked backwards and forwards, close by the door; Donnovan came out with something under his coat, and rejoined Topper. I took them both, and found the shoes on Donnovan.</p>

I refused, but at last consented - I went into a house and gave them some - I had none myself. I came out and saw no more of them till I got about fifty yards, when the prisoner rushed by me, and took out my purse with five sovereigns and a half in it from my pocket - the silver was loose in my pocket; she ran away. I pursued her up the market calling Stop thief! and caught hold of her gown at the top of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130137"/>market - she turned round, and said "There is your purse," giving it to me, but it was empty; the watchman came up and took her.

            . The house this lead was taken from was in possession of the St. Katherine Dock Company. Harragan came and told me he saw the lead taken- I tried the front door, and could not get in - it was bolted - I ran round to the back door, and saw the two prisoners about fifteen yards from the back door. I secured them both; Patterson said I was no officer, and should not hold him; if I let him he would walk quietly; I let go, and he ran away - I followed, and took him; I went on to the house, and found this piece of lead doubled up in the parlour. I compared it with the top of the dormer - it fitted exactly; Woodyer was there, but did nothing.</p>

I lost it in Whitechapel - I had it safe at seven o'clock. I was in company with Mr. Watson, a respectable man. I live in Mile-end-road - I had taken brandy and water - I fell in company with a woman in Whitechapel after I left Mr. Watson, about ten o'clock, and went to a house with her. I am sure I did not give her my watch - I gave her what I had in my waistcoat pocket, it was about five or six shillings. I will not swear that I gave her any thing - she told me that I did. I did not give her the watch, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Will you swear you did not give her your watch? A. Yes; I neither gave it, lent it, or sold it to any one - I gave information at Lambeth-street next morning.</p>

About seven o'clock; I do not know whether my watch was safe then; I cannot say that I had it when I went into the woman's company - I missed it that night, and am almost positive that I spoke about it that night - I named it to the woman, as she observed, that if she had known I had lost it, she would not have invited me in.</p>

I went with the other officers; I got first into the house, and saw the prisoner in a little back parlour; I asked her name - she said Solomons; I asked if she owned the house - she said Yes; I said we had a warrant to search - she made a great noise, and the officers came in; I sent her up stairs: I remained below some time, and fastened the doors. I then went up, and saw Edwards take the watch out of the hole - I asked if it was her bed-room - she said it was, and that she slept there; we took her and the property away.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRETT. I am clerk of the papers at Newgate. Isaac Solomons ceased to be in our custody on the 25th of May; there was no discharge lodged for him; he was taken to the Court of King's Bench, by a Habeas.</p>
               <p>Part of an affidavit made by the prisoner, and upon which she had moved the postponement of her trial, was here read, to prove that she described herself as "The wife of Isaac Solomons, late of Bell-lane, Spitalfields, but now of North America, as she believed"</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday night, the 14th of August, I found this parrot and cage hanging up in the prisoner's room, in Rose-lane, Spitalfields - I asked if they were hers; she said Yes, that she gave 14s. for it fourteen months ago of a man named Adams, in Rosemary-lane. I took her in charge.</p>

            . I am wife of Joseph Smites. I occasionally char for the prosecutor - I saw her buy this parrot about fourteen months ago in Rosemary-lane - it has hung publicly out of her window every day since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did all the neighbourhood see it? A. She bought it of Adams, he had two others at the time; she bought the cage also of him - he asked 1l., and took 14s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOODING. The parrot was advertised - Mrs. Ansell told me what it could repeat, and it did repeat it; and she described the defect in its wing before it was found. I am often in the prisoner's neighbourhood, and never saw it hanging out of her window; if I had seen one in that low neighbourhood I should have noticed it.</p>
               <p>Before the case was concluded, the parrot repeated, the words"Jacko pretty."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you have? A. A glass of ale; I was drunk. I cannot tell whether any women were there; I do not remember any thing about it.</p>

In a short time he fell asleep in the house; I immediately sent for a coach; when it came I awoke him, and did the best I could to get him into it, and then I missed his watch, which I had seen safe in the house ten minutes before. I took him back into the house directly, and an alarm was given - the prisoner was not in the house then, but the other females were; the watchman went out, and in a very few minutes brought the prisoner in with the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you quite sober? A. I do not mean to say that I was - I knew what I was about; I do not know where we had dined. We had left Westminster between seven and eight o'clock, and had not been wandering about - we were at a public-house, and had some ale after that; I do not know how much we drank - we might be in that house two hours; I swear we did not drink two quarts of ale; we had three glasses of gin and water at Westminster; the prosecutor was not very tipsy; he treated some people with drink in Smithfield; I do not think be drank himself there - I did not see all he did there; he might have given the watch to somebody - I did not see him take it out.</p>

Wilkinson and the prisoner were with him - one had hold of each arm; the prosecutor was stooping, and all in a minute I saw the prisoner start round the coach and run across the street - Wilkinson said,"Where is your watch, Dyson?" - Dyson said, "I do'nt know." Hawes said something, and I pursued the prisoner; we found a person dressed very much like her, and took her first by mistake - we went down to the bottom of West-street, and took the prisoner in a court there; I said, "What was it you took from the man at the Bull and Butcher?" she pulled out the watch and gave it to me - I am certain she is the girl whom I saw close to Dyson. I saw her every night; I took her within ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She had ten minutes to get away with it? A. Yes - Wilkinson was rather gone, but not so drunk as Dyson; he was unable to walk; I thought the other was the girl at first.</p>

I was then going home, and was stopped close to my house, by the prisoner and a female. I had been treating them at the public-house, and we came out together; they wanted me to go further, but I would not; they then came, and each took hold of my arm, and the female made a catch at my watch; the prisoner seized me at the back of my neck, and held me while the woman took my watch - I seized fast hold of each of them, and saw her give the watch to the prisoner, when her things began to tear - I let go of her then; he then gave the watch to her, and she ran away - I detained him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you told the whole story? A. Yes - when the woman was near, the prisoner tried to throw me down, but I kept hold of him; they came into the house, and asked me to treat them at the Blue Coat Boy, and then we went to the Hoop and Grapes public-house - I might drink a drop of gin and water, and some beer - I did not go into any other public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, at the Mansion-house, that another person was the man? A. I was asked if that was the man, and said Yes, thinking it was the prisoner - I remember the Lord Mayor telling me to come sober next time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I assure your Honour, that I am perfectly innocent, not withstanding the false allegations made to prove my guilt, of the charge, and which evidence, were I sufficiently competent, or enabled to employ counsel, I feel confident, would clearly be made to appear, in the course of the investigation, as completely false; and a case made up between the parties against me, who are of the most abandoned character, and whose manner of obtaining a livelihood, is by the most base means; as to the above-named person (Williams) I know her to keep a house of the most abandoned character, it being a common receptacle for prostitutes; and the witness, that she has caused to appear against me, I am totally unacquainted with; but I have no doubt, if questioned, that she would appear to be one connected with the prosecutrix in those, her abandoned pursuits, by which means I have, in the present instance, tallen an unfortunate victim. I, however, trust that by the following statement, you will see the case against me is altogether a false charge:- In the month of July, at about twelve o'clock at night, I had (on Saturday) been spending the evening with some of my workmates, at the sign of the Horse and Groom public-house, Cow-cross, and in leaving the company, and passing through Smithfield, on my way home, I met the prosecutrix, in company with a watchman, who I asked what he was going to do with her; he said he was going to take her to the watch-house, she being then in a state of intoxication - I told the watchman I would see her home, if he would allow me; and accordingly, knowing where she lived, from being in the habit of passing and repassing her house, I proceeded to take her home, where, after a deal of trouble, I arrived, and the woman belonging to the house came to the door, who, on telling her I had brought home on of her lodgers, denied that she (Williams) was a lodger of hers, and refused to admit her - with this I left her at the door, and went home.</p>

On the 16th of July, about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning, I stood about forty yards from the cart, and saw Smith take the flat off at the corner of King-street - I ran down West-street, and saw Butler standing near the work-house in the street; Smith went up and spoke to him, and gave it to him: Smith saw me, and came up towards me; we came up to Smithfield, and he gave the flat up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who is Butler? A. His father keeps a public-house in Smithfield; I do not know that the house is usually opened early; he had not got hold of Smith; he said, when I was taking them to the watch-house, that he had taken it from Smith, having stopped him with it - that was within a minute or two of the time. I ate nothing that was in the basket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the girl here? A. No; she said she found it in the street, and a young man dropped it; I was close to the gentleman, but there came such a rush I could not get to him.</p>

As near as I could be, next to the officers, not more than two yards from him; the prisoner was two or three minutes putting his hands into his pockets; the moment the prisoner was caught hold of, there was a mighty rush, and the gentleman was carried away with the stream.</p>

            . I am an officer of Smithfield. On Friday the 27th of July, I was on duty in Smithfield - it was horse market day; some man came to me, and asked if I would come to the Ram-yard, and take possession of a horse which they had found, belonging to somebody in the country. I went and found this gelding there, in possession of a man named Clinsey; and from what he said, I went to Dixon's Repository, and from what I heard there, I went there on the Monday at nine o'clock - I left, and went again at ten; I then found the prisoner in custody. I asked him where he got the horse; he said a man met him in the street leading the horse, and asked him to take it and sell it for him, and he would give him 5s. if he would sell it, and bring him the money. I asked the prisoner his name, he said it was Thomas Brown, and that the man who employed him was John Linton, of Church-street, Bethnal-green. I asked where the man was - he said he was waiting for him at a public-house close by - I asked him where the public-house was, and said I would go and take this Linton - he said it was in Beech-street or Barbican, on the right hand side of the way, but he did not know the name of the street, nor the sign of the house; he said he would go and show me; I asked if he could not give me a better description; he then said it was at the Star public-house, in the City-road, opposite the Lying-in Hospital - I asked what sort of a man it was; he said a tall thin man, with drab coat and top-boots - I secured him, and then went to the Star in the City-road; I had some porter, and inquired if they had seen such a person,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130145"/>but they had not. I afterwards showed the same horse to the prosecutor, who claimed it - as I took him down the yard, he said, "I have told you part, I may as well tell you all; my name is Heffield;" I said, "Is it not Thomas?" he said Yes.</p>

            . I am clerk at Dixon's repository, Barbican. On Wednesday, the 25th of July, about twelve o'clock at noon, the prisoner brought this horse to our repository - I entered it in the day book - I asked him what name; he said, "Linton, Church-street, Bethnal-green;" he booked it, "Quiet to ride, and quiet in harness, to be sold to the highest bidder" - it was sold to the highest bidder, at the Friday's sale for 1l. 10s. - it was small and very lean - it was delivered to the purchaser, who paid me for it; he is not here, but I understand he took it to Smithfield - it was knocked down to a Mr. Hedges, but afterwards transferred to Mr. Clansey, who paid me, and took it away.</p>

I then went on to the bottom of Long-lane, and he came to me again, and said, "Go over the way, and get two pipes." I left my bundle and went; and when I returned, the prisoner Edwards had run away with it - I asked Donoghue where the bundle was, and he said a boy had run away with it; I had seen Edwards following us before, but not close to us - Donoghue said, "Wait there, and I will run after him." I have not seen the bundle since - I am quite sure it was Donoghue who spoke to me; I did not take particular notice of Edwards, but I believe he is the person.</p>

            . I am a constable. The ass and apples being taken to the Green-yard, I gave orders that no one should have them but the owner; and Mrs. Page, to whom the Green-yard belongs, came, and brought Donoghue to me; he said that he had run after the other boy - in the evening, Mrs. Page sent to me again, and said she had got Edwards; he said that the other had induced him to take the bundle, and before he took it, he had taken a handkerchief out of it; he said he had sold it in Petticoat-lane - I went there, but could hear nothing of it.</p>
               <p>EDWARDS' Defence. The things were on another man's head; he asked me to take them, which I did. When I got home my parents would not let me in - I went and sold them.</p>

            . I was in the fair, opposite the show - I saw the prosecutrix with her reticule, and saw the prisoner make the snatch. I caught hold of him, and was thrown down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. You saw a hand? A. I saw the prisoner's hand, and saw him make the snatch. I was close by him.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST to MARY DONALD. Q. Do not you remember that you said he was not the man? A: I could not say so - I could not see his face, but my husband and those about said he was the man.</p>

            . I was at the fair on the night in question. I was passing, and saw this young man collared; I heard the woman repeatedly say that was not the man, four or five times.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that all you heard? A. Yes. I live at No. 4, Mapes-street, Hare-street-fields. I do not know where the prisoner lives; I have seen him before, but have never been in his company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A weaver; I was pretty near the prisoner; I do not know how many people were there; I did not hear the complaint of the robbery; I believe she had been robbed - I did not hear that she had lost her reticule, nor that she had been robbed; I had seen the prisoner before - I saw him taken up; I do not know what became of his companions; I heard the woman say he was not the man; I was subpoenaed here - I do not know who by; I had no conversation with him after he was taken up - I cannot tell who subpoenaed me - the subpoena was brought to my house; I suppose the solicitor subpoenaed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you heard that woman say, in Bartholomew fair, that that young man was not the man? A. Yes, Sir, I can.</p>
               <p>MARY DONALD re-examined. Q. Did you ever say that was not the man? A. No. I could not; I saw the prisoner by the side of me; but I could not say he was the man who did it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNS re-examined. I was present all the time, and heard all that was said; if she had said he was not the man, I must have heard it; I never saw this witness there to my knowledge; if this declaration had been made I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You say you were standing by him? A. Yes; I followed the lady and the prisoner down to the Compter; I had hold of the prisoner, and the lady was next to my left arm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see from the first to the last of it? A. Yes; I went with the lady till she got to a place of safety, and if this passed I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAKER re-examined. Q. Do you swear that the lady said the prisoner was not the man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at the time? A. Yes; I do not know how I came to be subpoenaed - I received my subpoena on Sunday - I have got it with me; I was not sent for to attend the examination before the Magistrate; I have never spoken to the prisoner, not to my knowledge; I have seen him at different times; I never knew him in jeopardy before - I have never been in trouble myself; how I came to be subpoenaed was, I happened to tell a young woman who happened to be in company with him, and by that means they told the solicitor; I had seen that young woman in company with him before, five or six different times- I have spoken to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep company with him? A. I do not know, I am sure, Sir; not to my knowledge, I do not know that she keeps company with him - I have seen them together five or six different times, seven or eight weeks ago.</p>

I took up the prisoner on the 14th of September - Mr. Abitbol was with me - I told him I took him for receiving the money for the cheque; he said he had received two sovereigns, and 20s. in silver, but had not any of it then; he said he was ashamed to come back, for a man had stopped him, whom he owed some money to, and he had paid it to him.

            . I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on the 10th of August, at the Bull public-house, in St. John-street. I found this seal, this screwdriver, and a fork on him - he was drunk and fell down. I took him up, and took him to the watch-house; when he was sober I told him what I wanted him for; he said he knew nothing about the things. I went to Mr. Donkin's, to see if the screw-driver would match with any marks on the premises, and the top drawer of the secretaire seems to have been opened with it - it has been made out of the blade of an oyster knife: when he was locked up there was a girl there who calls him her husband; the prisoner called to her, "Tell Tom to get out of the way."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That could never open a drawer. Witness. Yes, it could, and it fitted exactly; the veneering is broken.</p>
               <p>MRS. DONKIN re-examined. The inner doors were found open in the morning; there were marks on the outside of the small palour door, into which the bar window looks; that door leads into the yard - I saw the marks on the door before the officer came; there is only a small lock on that door - and when they got in, they had to force the other door to get into the bar. I found a blue pocket handkerchief on the sofa in the bar, and I had seen that or one very like it, in the prisoner's hand, in the tap room, in the evening; here it is. I found it when I came down with only my gown on, when my husband alarmed me. I know this seal by the letter W. on it - it has no other mark; my husband gave it to me, and I said it would do reversed for my name, "Mary." I believe it to be mine - the property lost is worth about 35l.</p>

            . There was no appearance of violence on the street door, but there was the mark of a person having got over the wall into a small yard - the parlour door opens into that yard, and on that door was a mark just the width of this oyster-knife - the marks still remain; on the secretaire drawer part of the veneer under the drawer is broken off - there is a small piece of the veneer in the middle, which is not broken off, which makes me think it was done with this, as it is a forked screw-driver.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came to London, not having any thing to do, I became a sort of clerk to the prosecutor, for which I was to have board and lodging - I. of course, looked out for something better. I frequently went and collected money, and retained it in my possession a few days. After receiving this money, I heard of some private business, and went to Richmond, intending to return and account for his money, and on the way there, wanting money, I used part of it. I was captured there the same night, and on my return, the prosecutor refused to wait at my house while I could have the money made up.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITBOURN. He did not ask me to wait at his house for the money to be made up.</p>

On the 12th of September, I was returning from Fulwood's-rents, and was getting towards a state of intoxication - a friend accompanied me as far as the House of Correction. I remember after that being in company with one or two females - I will not swear there were two. I remember afterwards being told I was robbed. I remember being in a house where there was a piece of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you not quite in a helpless state of drunkenness? A. I was going that way. I know my money was safe about half-past ten o'clock. I do not remember being at an oyster-shop or seizing any persons there.</p>

On the night in question, within ten minutes of eleven o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, and heard two females talking with a man. I knocked at my window, and said, "I don't approve of such language, and if you don't go away. I'll give charge of you." I soon after heard the watchman, I went to the door, and saw two females, and a gentleman in light trousers. Johnson who sat on his left hand took a watch out of his fob, and gave it to the one on his right - she then took something dark, which looked like a purse or pocket-book, and gave that to her; she then took something, which looked like a ribbon or chain and gave her. Johnson lives within three doors of me, I knew her well - the other had a light dress on; she went to Mrs. Hart's oyster-shop - Johnson followed, and left the gentleman within thirty yards of me. Mrs. Green called to me and said, "You saw that done, why don't you tell the gentleman where to go." I called the watchman, and pointed the house out. Mrs. Green fetched the gentleman and told him, that was where the women were gone - the watchman had got to the door by that time. I am certain the women who went into the shop are those who had been with him; but I will not swear to Bull's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. Yes - my husband is a bricklayer. I have lived there nine months; the street is infested with loose women - I frequently drive them away.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Charlotte-street, and keep an oyster shop. On the night in question, about eleven o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop; I was in the back room at supper; I went to them - they wanted a piece of fish; they gave me a penny-piece and a halfpenny for it, and one penny-piece fell on the floor; I took the candle to look for it, and the prosecutor ran in and seized me by the throat; I called Watch! the watchman came in, and said, "You are mistaken, these are the parties you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130151"/>want;" and caught hold of the prisoners; they said what did he want with them, he might search them; the shop door was closed; the watchman was looking about, and a voice through the door said, "Look into the fire-place:" the watchman looked, and found a pocket-book there; I found a silk handkerchief; they searched every where, but found nothing more; the next day but one I found this Irish penny-piece on the floor; no women had been into the shop except the prisoners - the handkerchief and pocket-book could not have been there before they came; my sister was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you kept the shop? A. Not three weeks; I let my first floor to a female, who says her husband is in Scotland - she was in bed at the time; I shut up immediately the prisoners were taken away; I was taken to the watch-house, and detained till morning, and taken to Hatton-garden, on account of the pocket-book and handkerchief being found in my house; I said they might search me; I was liberated - I do not know whether I was bailed - I do not know the meaning of it; they had not been a minute in the shop when the prosecutor came in; the handkerchief was near a basket - I pawned my ring after I left the office - I did not give any of the money to the prisoners.</p>

On Sunday morning, between four and five o'clock, I saw him unlock the door of their vaults; he went down and came out with a pail of beer, and left it in the yard. I said nothing to him - he then opened the gate, and let in two watchmen, who went up to where the pail was; I went out, but could find no watchman - I found a patrol and took him in, and gave charge of all three - the prisoner said he was sorry for what he had done, and he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Have not the men an allowance of beer? A. Yes; half a gallon a day or night - I give it out before I go away; another person had given him his that night; he has been there ten years, as a labourer - there is both porter and stout there; I cannot swear this was beer - when I came back, the pail was gone.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are stout and porter called beer? A. Yes; there was about a gallon and a half in the pail; I did not know he had the cellar key - he did not say it was his portion.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Danford's. I left my younger brother in the shop on the morning of the 14th of September, between half-past eight and nine o'clock; I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and missed a bundle of barber's weaving silk from the shelf - I sent round to different trades-people about it; my brother is not here. In consequence of information I went to Mr. Hudson's, in Porter-street, between one and two o'clock, about one hundred and fifty yards from our house, and saw the silk on his counter. I afterwards went to the prisoner's house, with Laing; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130154"/>not at home - we went again, and saw him; I asked if he had sent Laing to sell the silk; he said he had - I asked if he was in the silk line - he said not particularly, but that he had received this silk from his brother, at Sheerness, about a week before; he keeps a kind of curiosity shop, in St. Martin's-court. Here is the silk - it was made for us, of a size which is scarcely ever used - it was only made in July; we had a small quantity made about six years ago; here is some brown among it, of the same sort, which we bought in the City some years ago - there are two or three different sorts, made by different makers; the parcel lost consisted of all these different sorts - I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old is your brother? A. Thirteen years - I cannot say that he did not sell it. I did not say what I wanted the first time I went to his house - I think the silk was produced to him. The Magistrate admitted him to bail, and when the officer told him to come he came; I did not hear him say that his father had bought it in his absence, and he had mentioned his brother to keep his father out of trouble; he and his friends have been to beg me to keep out of the way.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser - the prisoner came to me last Friday morning, to my house in St. Ann's-court, and asked if I wanted any weaving silk, I said, No - he asked if I could tell him where he would sell it - I said, the hair merchants were the most likely people; he said he knew none of them, and if I would endeavour to dispose of it, he should feel obliged. I took it to Mr. Hudson's, and the witness came in and asked me the price: I said 22s. - he asked if I could not take less; I said, No, that it was not mine; he said he should like his father to see it, and then claimed it; I took him to Russell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him? A. Yes; he is a neighbour - he brought it openly, and did not desire me to keep it secret; he hears an honest character, and has lived there four years.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of this day week I saw Argent driving a sow through Church-street, Hackney; the other prisoner was on the path-way. I did not hear them conversing, but I gave information to the patrol - he went forward, and stopped it, and I took Argent into custody, and the sow. I asked him where he brought it from - he said he brought it from Leyton, and was going to take it to market. I went on to the Horse and Groom public-house, and turned it into the yard. I asked him then if he had any more - he said he had four others coming up the road. I asked whose they were - he said his father's; I know his father perfectly well - I went to Leyton. I saw his mother, and ascertained it was not theirs - I then went and told Walter, and gave information of it instantly.</p>
