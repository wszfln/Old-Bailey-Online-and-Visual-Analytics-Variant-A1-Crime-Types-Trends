The prisoner was my shopman four or five months before 4th Jan.; his duty was to serve customers—if an article was sold to a customer where we had an account, the prisoner's duty was to call out the weight, and if the person was going to pay, to call out the weight and the price it was sold for, and the party purchasing would pay for it at the counter—the prisoner had decided instructions not to receive money, he had directions to send the customer to the counting-house—I believe it never happened during the hours of business that there was nobody in the counting-house—on the evening of 3rd Jan., I made a communication to the inspector at the Bow-lane station, and handed him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my own money—there were two half-crowns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was at my business on 4th Jan., and saw persons in my counting-house attending to my business—my wife, my son-in-law, and a lad named Davis, serve in the counting-house, which overlooks both shops—I know that my son-in-law and Davis were there on that afternoon, between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was upstairs at the time—a communication was made to me; I went to the station-house and saw some sausages, they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old; I used to work for Mr. Dawson. On this Thursday I went up stairs, with Marshall, into the warehouse; it was about 10 minutes after 8 o'clock—I then went into the pressroom by myself, and there saw the prisoner; he was just on the top of the stairs—he asked me who was down stairs, Mr. Matthews or Mr. Marshall—I told him, Mr. Marshall—he told me to tell him to come up; and while I called him by one pair of stairs, the prisoner was gone by the other pair of stairs—the composing room and the press room open one into the other—the staircase he went down is at the other end of the press room; it was the stairs I had come up—he ran down those stairs while I was hallooing down the other stairs to Marshall—the stairs would take him to the front door—I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Dawson. I left the premises the night before at a few minutes to 8 o'clock; I did not lock them up; I left the workmen on the premises; there were about a dozen workmen there then—they generally leave at 8 o'clock, but I went away a few minutes before 8 that night—I went next morning about 10 minutes past 8 o'clock; I took the keys from the housekeeper's servant, and proceeded to unlock the door of Mr. Dawson's part of the building—Walsh called me, and I went up—as soon as I got up stairs I heard the warehouse door shut—I instantly ran down again to see who was there; I did not see any one—I saw Margaret Sullivan as I was going down the stairs leading into the court—when I left the premises the night before, the gas burners and the brass rules were safe in their usual places—in the morning I observed the window of the press room up stairs was open; the brass rules were not there; they were left in the composing room; they adjoin, one opens into the other—a man could have got through the open window—there was a ladder in the next court, where some men were employed plastering; it reached to the top of the house—any one could get up there—none of the things have been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Bennett-street, Black friars-road. On Tuesday, 25th Jan., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was near Temple-bar, coming towards Bridge-street, with Mr. Graham, a friend, who keeps the Old Bell Tavern—the two prisoners accosted me near Temple-bar, and requested me to treat them to something to drink—I went with them to a public-house; my friend did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in with me—I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold in my right hand waistcoat pocket, and some silver in my right hand trowsers pocket, a silver watch in my left hand waistcoat pocket, a gold chain, and a ring—we had something to drink in the public-house; after which, I was going home, and called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to go to the Black friars-road; the prisoners said they lived that way, and asked me to let them ride with me; they got in with my</p>

               <p>consent—I thought we were going over Black friars-bridge, bat, instead of that, we drove about the Strand, and went to two or three public-houses, and had something to drink—I am not certain whether I got out at the public-houses or not; I had some drink brought to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was sober when I got to the first public-house—after driving about, I became quite unconscious in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, after I had had the last drink—we arrived ultimately in the Black friars-road—(I was not excessively drunk; it was from something else, which I expect they put in)—the last thing I recollect before I got out was, expressing a wish to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man; Healey said it was all settled for, I need not trouble about it; that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man was paid—I was so bad that I did not think anything of that—I got out just below Stamford-street, and left them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I walked home in six or seven minutes, and then missed my money; I had only 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and my watch and chain left—(I think I paid for the first drink, and the second, and the last the prisoners paid for)—I gave information to the police next day; I did not trouble about it that night, because I felt so ill—I cannot say whether I was drunk when I left the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I have been drunk in my life; but from what I had bad to drink, I do not think it possible I could be drunk—I had porter, and I might have had some cold brandy and water—the prisoners were taken next morning; I am sure they are the women I have been speaking of.</p>

I was with van No. 123, which went from Camden-town to Keeling and Hunt's with ninety bags of nuts—I arrived there about half past 5 o'clock; that was before Jones came—I delivered my cargo; there were different men to carry them up the steps—on presenting my way-bill to Keeling; and Hunt for signature, I got a receipt for eighty-nine bags only—I had counted ninety bags as they went from the wagon—about half past 6 o'clock the same evening my fellow Wagoner arrived with wagon No. 174—I waited about to see, if I could, how I had lost the bag—I saw part of his load delivered, and saw the prisoner there smoking a cigar alongside the wagon—I watched him, and saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> away his cigar under the wagon; he turned his beck to the wagon tail, and Jones delivered a bag of nuts to him on his back—he turned towards the stairs with it, but instead of going up into the warehouse he went through, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> right across Monument-yard into Fish-street-hill, and then into Thames-street—I followed close behind him, and as soon as he got into Thames-street he hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Bob!</hi>" twice, but no. <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> appeared; he said, "I am wrong," and I collared him directly and held him—he flung me down on my back, but I never let loose of him till I gave him in charge—he had the nuts on his back, and after I collared him he dropped, them on the pavement and burst the bag—he begged of me not to tear his clothes—I had not noticed the prisoner while I was unloading my van.</p>

I know the prisoner as being also a clerk there for many-years—it was his duty to receive bankers' parcels at the Post-office; they are received between the hours of 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock every day except Monday—it was the prisoner's duty to take the parcels and to check them, to see that the amounts were correct—he was to receive the money, and to weigh them to see that the weight marked on them by the bankers was correct—he would then mark the amount of postage on them in red ink—I see the red ink marks on these envelopes that have been produced; they indicate the amount of postage—I believe them to be in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no red ink mark of the weight, only the amount of postage—the prisoner has a book in which to enter the parcels; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—here is an entry on 4th Jan. in the prisoner's handwriting—it is, "No. of the parcel, 29; addressed to Thomas Griffin, Wolverhampton: weight, 1 oz., postage, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is a number, "29," on the parcel; that is put there by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On 11th Jan. do you find an entry of a parcel addressed to Mr. Rae, of Liverpool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the number of the parcel is twelve—I find that same number on the envelope that is here, in the prisoner's writing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310037"/>
               <p>—I also find a tax of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the envelope, for postage; the weight is fifteen ounces—the entry in the book is, "No. 12, G. Rae, Liverpool; 9 ozs., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" that is all in the prisoner's writing—here is an envelope addressed to Mr. Provis, of Salisbury, on the same day—the number on it is "13," the weight nineteen ounces, and the charge for postage 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in the prisoner's writing; the entry in the book is, "No. 13, S. Provis, Sailsbury; weight 7 oz., postage 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—here is also an envelope addressed to Messrs. Bailey on the same day, number sixteen, weight twenty-three ounces, charge 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the prisoner's writing; it is entered in his book as, "No, 16, Bailey and Co., Abergavenny; weight 11 oz., postage 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that is all in the prisoner's writing—he would have to account to Mr. Mellish for the, postage he received according to the entries in this book—the alleged receipts on the 4th are cast up in the. book each day—the total which he charges himself with having received for parcels on the 4th 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 11th 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a president, whose duty it is to overlook this account, to check it and cast it up, and compare it with the parcels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To cast it up; the president casts it up as it is presented each day—I have not seen him check it with the parcels before they are sent off—I do not know whether that is his duty or not—there is, more pressure in the receipt of these parcels at some periods of the day than others,; the bankers' clerks, come more together at one portion of the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">IS</hi> this a part of the Post-office quite separate from the ordinary business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a room by itself—the prisoner has no other duty to perform daring this time than to receive these parcels—the Post office enclose these parcels in other covers, and address them to the postmasters of, the towns to which they go—the prisoner had a clerk to assist him on Tuesdays; that is our most busy day—there is nothing on the covers in which the Post-office enclose them indicating the weight or the amount of the postage,.—Mr. Partridge was the president on duty on the 4th, and Mr. Bourne on the 11th.</p>

On 29th Dec, between 4 and 5 o'clock, in the afternoon, three men and a woman came there—the prisoners were two of them—the male prisoner called for a quartern of gin, and a glass of noyean—the female prisoner took a white pocket handkerchief and wiped his coat down, as it was raining—she separated from the men; went and sat down at the bottom of the room, and called for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth more gin—one of the men left the male prisoner, and went to the woman—there were then two at the top, and two at the bottom of the counter—the male prisoner then went down to where the woman was, and asked me what the best whisky was a quart—I told him, and he said he would take a pint—I served him with it, and he said, "Put a pint of the best gin in a bottle"—I did so, and altogether it amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which he took out of a small pocket book—I looked</p>

On Wednesday, 29th Dec, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, my barman brought me a note into the bar, purporting to be a Bank of England note—I examined it, came to the bar, and saw the prisoner Wilson there (I am not a native of England)—I asked him where he got the note from—he said he brought it from his hotel, he had changed it for <hi rend="italic">a ten</hi>, and had spent all the money, and only had this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—I asked him where he came from, and he told me New York—I asked him about the hotel—he could not tell what hotel it was, or where it was—he said he was out for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>, and spent all the money, and that was all he had left—I asked him where he lived—he said anywhere, wherever he could—I said it was a bad note—he said, "If it is a bad note, I had it out of change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note," and said to my barman," Let me look at the note?"—I said, "When you tell me your name, and where you got it from, then I might let you look"—I told the young man, in his hearing, to fetch a policeman—Wilson said, "I will see you d—d first," or some such expression, "I will go and fetch one," and turned to go out—he went out at the middle door—I went as fast as I could out of the other door, took hold of him just as he came on to the pavement, and pointed him out to a policeman, and poked him into the passage—up to this time I had not seen the female prisoner—the policeman, Wilson, and myself then went into the coffee room—we searched Wilson, but only found a purse and a knife—the female prisoner then came into the coffee room, sat down, and asked for a cup of coffee—we do not allow females in the coffee room—I ordered her out of the house, and she left—I gave Wilson into custody with the note.</p>

On Wednesday night, 29th Dec., about 6 o'clock, I saw Sylvester, with Wilson in his custody, going in the direction of Poplar station—I followed about live or six yards behind, and saw the female prisoner go up and catch hold of Wilson's arm—she whispered something to him, which I could not hear, and I told her I could not allow her to do that—she followed a short distance behind with me—it</p>

I have no notes about me; I was out all day drinking yesterday"—she asked if she might be allowed to see the man she was charged with; I told her she would, after she was searched—I did not search her—there was nothing found on her relating to this charge—I took her into the waiting room, where the male prisoner was with a constable; she said she had never seen him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at No. 9, Byde's-place, Shoreditch. I have three rooms there upstairs; one of them is my kitchen—on a Saturday night, somewhere about 11th Dec, I was at home between 11 and 12 o'clock—there is a shop door and a front door—the external door was fastened on its spring, but was not locked; it could not be opened without a pick-lock key being used—it is a common street door lock; a drawback we generally term it—I heard a noise at the door, and in two or three minutes, as I was sitting by the fire, I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room; I said, "Who are you?" he said, "You know me well enough;" I said, "I don't recollect ever seeing you before in my life; what do you want?"—he said, "Your money"—I believe I said, "I have got none"—I did not like his appearance, and got up from my chair, intending to call the police, or to make a noise of some sort, and he seized me by my wrist—I had a knife in my hand—we had a little struggle, and he got the knife out of my hand—we still struggled together through a passage, but still not a word was spoken by either of us—I intended to shut him in, but he was too quick for me, and seized me by my handkerchief—I broke a pane of glass in the window, and called out police!" as well as I could speak—I never left go of him till he was taken by the police—in the course of the struggle we got into my kitchen; while we were there I called out "Police!" and he put his hand over my mouth, to stop me from making a noise; I wanted to get to another part of the room, to make my neighbours hear, and he laid his hand on my mouth again—after that I got to the window again, broke two more panes of glass, and called out again—a policeman came into the room, with two more persons, and took the prisoner—in the course of the struggle he <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me by the ear, and I felt something on the left side of my neck, but I could not say anything, as I was <hi rend="italic">game</hi>, and pretty well <hi rend="italic">mashed</hi>—it was a sensation of pain; and before the police came I felt more pain—it bled; you can come and feel it, if you like—I went from the station to the London Hospital.</p>

On Saturday night, 11th Dec, I was on duty in Bydes-place, Shoreditch, and between 11 and 12 o'clock heard a noise of a window breaking, and heard cries of "Murder!" from the prisoner's kitchen, which looks into the street—I and a person named Smith went to the front door, and found it fastened—we went round to the shop door, burst it open, and went up a ladder into the prosecutor's room, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor lying on the floor struggling—the prisoner was undermost—there was blood on the floor, and a great deal on the prosecutor's head—I did not notice his neck—there was blood on the prisoner's hands—I assisted the prosecutor to get up, and Smith took the prisoner up—the prisoner said, "Where is my hat?" he had lost it in the struggle—the prosecutor was quite sober—I took the prisoner down to the front door—it was bolted, and the chain was up—I took the prisoner to the station, the prosecutor going with me and preferring a charge, and I afterwards accompanied him to the London Hospital—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the floor of the room, bent as it is now.</p>

DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time were you in the Angel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 12 o'clock; about the closing time—there were two females there behind the bar, and the landlord was standing there, and there were two strange men besides the prisoner—I did not observe any more—I would not undertake to swear there were no more—there were no other females but those behind the bar—I was coming from a friend's, where I had a glass of grog—I cannot say how many glasses I bad had with my friend—I had not had half a dozen—I had not had above three or four in the course of the evening—when I came out of the public house, I proceeded a few yards—there was a light in the public house—I believe there was a light outside in the alley—I will not swear whether there was a gas lamp or not—I will not swear whether there is any light, I did not take particular notice—the place was not so very dark but that I could see a person close to me—it was moonlight or starlight; that was the only light—I would not swear what bonnet the girl had on when she was in the public house—I will not swear what kind of dress she had on—I took no notice of her dress—I will not swear whether she had a shawl on, or a cloak, or a mantle.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector</hi>). On Friday, 24th Dec, I went to No. 32, Clerkenwell-green, about 11 o'clock in the forenoon, accompanied by three officers—I went to the third floor front room—the room door was locked; Nevill broke it open, and he and I rushed in—the other two officers followed immediately—when I got in, Thomas Munns rose up from a table, at which he had been sitting—he seized Nevill by the coat, and resisted most violently—the other two prisoners and two or three children were in the room—at that time, I saw the two female prisoners, who were also sitting at the table, throw the things in all directions over the floor—there was a mould, a pair of scissors, and several other things that I saw that I did not pick up—they did not relate to this case, such as a basin and saucers—at that time Evans seized Eliza Munns, and Maskell seized Esther Munns—in the struggle, I saw Eliza Munns drop this sixpence, with plaster of Paris sticking to it, which was wet—it is a good one, and I believe she left her grasp of the officer's arm, where the mark is still perceptible—at that time, Nevill overpowered Thomas Munns, and threw him on a bed in the room, and I proceeded to search behind a little glass case which stood on the mantelshelf broken, where I found this half of a mould, which has on it the head half of a sixpence; and on the hearth, near the fireplace, I found the other half of the mould, which both put together form the mould for a sixpence—while I was so engaged, Thomas Munns called me by name; he said, "Mr. Brannan, I will not resist any more; you have got all you want, you have got me to <hi rend="italic">rights</hi>; don't hurt my wife, my children know nothing about it; if you will come here, you will find a few sixpences in this drawer"—the drawer in question was in an old chest of drawers, near the bed where he laid—I proceeded to it, and in it I found nine counterfeit sixpences, which I produce—they are in an unfinished state—I returned to the table, and on the table I found three more counterfeit sixpences, two shillings, and three files, with white metal in their teeth; and on the hearth, near the fireplace, this ladle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a small portion of metal in it, hot, but not in a state of fusion—in a cupboard in the room I found some bluestone and silver sandon a temporary shelf, close to the mantelshelf, I found a galvanic battery charged with acid, which I produce—when I went into the room, I saw Mrs. Munns dip her hand into a basin of water, and in that hand I found this portion of plaster of Paris, in a soft state.</p>

On Saturday evening, 30th Jan., I left home about 10 o'clock, and returned about half past 11 o'clock—as I was going up stairs I saw the prisoner come out of my room with a candle in her hand, and go into her own room, which is on the same floor—I had locked my room door when I went out, but about ten minutes afterwards I gave the key my little boy to come home and go to bed—I went into my room, looked about, and found the prisoner's apron at the further end of the room—I gave it to her, and asked her if it was hers—she said, "Yes"—I asked her whether she was in my room—she said she was not—I swear I saw her come out—I afterwards searched my room, and missed my husband's coat and waistcoat, a square of flannel, and several other articles, which were safe when I went out—I then went and got a policeman, and went with him into the prisoner's room—I found my little girl's frock under the prisoner's bedstead, and after the prisoner was locked up we found my husband's coat and waistcoat, the flannel, and several other articles in a pillow case—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my husband's—when I spoke to the prisoner, she denied having been in my room, and said she had seen a person on the stairs; which the landlady, in the prisoner's presence, said was false—when I came home I found the children in bed and asleep—my eldest child is thirteen years old.</p>

On Saturday night, 7th Aug. last, I locked up the station at twenty minutes to 11 o'clock; the windows were then safe—I left the clock and money all safe—next morning, about twenty minutes to 8 o'clock, I sent my son to the station—he returned and gave me some information, in consequence of which I went immediately and found that the office window had been broken open—I went in, and missed the time-piece—my ticket desk, till, and writing desk had been broken open, and I missed 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and copper, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper from a bowl, all the property of the Company—I know the prisoner; he is a carpenter—about that time he was in the habit of riding by the train about twice a week from Ashford to Staines—he worked at Mr. Richardson's, a builder, at Staines.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch and clock manufacturer, at Princessquare; we supply clocks to the South Western Railway Company, and go down the line every week and repair the clocks.

I lived in the same house with the prisoner and deceased, in the room immediately under theirs—I have known them living in that room about six months—the prisoner is a jobbing butcher by trade; he used to carry meat about the streets—they lived together on very bad terms—I very often heard screams, and cries of "Murder!" from the deceased—I remember the day on which she was found dead—between 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock, that morning, I was in my own room in bed, and heard violent screams from the deceased, in their room—she was</p>

The prisoner and deceased lived at our house for five or six months prior to the deceased's death—they occupied an attic—I remember 8th Dec, the day on which the woman was found dead in her room—in the early part of that day I heard great cries of "Murder!" in that room—they proceeded from the prisoner's wife—her name was Sarah Parrott—there was no one but her and her husband in the room at the time—I know he was there, because I saw him come down the stairs—I should say the cries continued about half an hoar, by what I could hear down stairs—I was in the down stair room—after the cries had gone on for some time I heard the prisoner come down, that was about 8 o'clock—I did not see him—the lodger in the one pair was abusing him for ill-using his wife—I did not hear him make any answer—I do not know what time he returned, I did not see him come in, but I saw him go out again about 10 o'clock, or it might be a little before 10 o'clock—he then had a hamper basket with him—before he went out at 10 o'clock, I had heard screams of "Murder!" a second time—I should say they continued about half an hour again—I did not see or hear anything of the deceased after he went out—the screams did not continue after he went out, I never heard a sound of her at all after that—no person went up to the prisoner's room after he went out.</p>

Mr. Parrott, she is dead, she is stiff and cold, you must have done this this morning before you went out"—he said, "Why, God bless you, woman, she spoke to me two minutes ago"—I said, "I am sure it is false, for I am sure she has been dead for hours"—he said that he had said to her, "Sally get up and let's have some tea"—and that she said, "I do not know where I am"—he said he had only been in about two minutes, and had just set light to the fire—I should say from the appearance of the fire, that it had been lighted a long while—the coals were bright, and quite at the bottom of the stove—I said to him," This is the end of your fighting and quarrelling this morning, Mr. Parrott"—he said, "Why, woman, you are going mad"—the deceased was lying not quite upon her back, but very nearly; the right leg was quite straight—J remained in the room until the doctor came—the prisoner went for the doctor—he was told several times by different lodgers that came up into the room, to go for a doctor; but I should say it was about ten minutes before be went off—when I spoke to him about his wife's being dead, he made no other observation except that she had spoken to him about two minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, and also practise as a surgeon—I reside at No. 3, Mount-place, near the London Hospital. The prisoner came to my house on 8th Dec., about 6 o'clock—he Said, "Mr. Leech, the surgeon, has sent me to you, wishing you to come; my wife is very bad, she is dying, in fact, I believe she is dead"—I drove there directly—I got there about a few minutes past 6 o'clock—I found Mr. Leech in the room—I found the body of the deceased partly lying on a piece of mattress which came to about her hips, and her legs were on the floor—the body was almost naked: there was a small piece of rug, or something like hearthrug, or drugget over it, that was all the covering</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310064"/>
               <p>she had; and it was a very small piece—she was lying with her head bent on the left tide, and her body slightly bent to the left side; her left leg was drawn up—the chest was bent towards the left side—her arms were lying by her side, I am not very distinct about their position it is only to the best of my belief—I stated at the time that in my judgment she had been dead about four or five hours; that was only conjecture; that is still my opinion; the body was cold except over the region of the heart—that was where the covering was—there was warmth there, amounting to the natural warmth—the body was rigid—the prisoner was there whilst I was examining the position of the body—I asked him, "Has this woman had any blows?"—he said, "No, she has not"—I made an examination of the body externally at that time—there was not one mark of external violence about it—there was no suffusion of the conjunctiva; the eyes did not protrude, they were slightly open; there was no red rim or mark round the eyes; nor any lividity of the lips—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Saturday following, the 11th—(I gave notice to the beadle at once, and the Coroner authorised me to open the body;) it was emaciated to an extraordinary degree; there were no scratches, or any marks of violence upon any part of the body externally—the stomach was small and contracted; the intestines were pale, empty, and attenuated, thinner than usual; all the fat which is generally, even in cases of disease, around the intestines, had been absorbed—the longs were out of their natural order; the left lung was compressed; it was congested and engorged with blood; it was full of black venous blood, unarterialised blood, and there were small congested patches in it as well—when I say congested, I mean red patches—the right lung was also engorged, and blacker than natural—on the front part of the liver, there was a bruised dark patch, about the size of the palm of the hand; over this patch, the peritoneal covering, which is a thin caul that covers the liver, was disattached from the liver—it was red, and there was some appearance of congestion about that portion—on removing the scalp, on the left side of the head there was a patch of coagulated blood, between the cellular tissue and the bone—it was blood coagulated in the vessels, forming a dark patch—I directed Mr. Leech's attention to that—and on examining the hair corresponding with that place, we found several of the hairs pulled out; the roots of the hairs were apparent; the hairs were not broken off, but pulled out by the roots; the hair was there, and the roots also—that was to some little extent immediately over the place where the coagulated blood was, and other parts near it—I looked at the external skin to see if there was any bruise, and also directed Mr. Leech's attention to that—there was no bruise—I then examined the interior of the head, the brain—the vessels were slightly engorged, although in a great number of bodies which I have opened at the hospitals, I have not seen the vessels so engorged in the majority of cases, yet I have seen cases of natural death where the vessels were as much engorged—the brain itself was healthy in its structure, and natural throughout—I examined the heart particularly—the right cavity contained dark blood, the left cavity was empty—I rather incline to think that the structure of the heart was more flaccid than usual, more weak and attenuated; whether that was from the absence of fat or not I cannot say—there was no structural disease in any part of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From all these appearances, what in your opinion was the cause of the woman's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion must be only taken as an opinion, and goes for no more than what you yourself would deduce from the facts, it only amounts to a probability, taking all the circumstances together, each of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310065"/>
               <p>which circumstances may depend upon some other cause, totally different from what I say—I merely give my opinion from rational ideas and notions; I am anxious that you should not attach to my judgment more value than it deserves—I am of opinion that from the emaciated state of the body, the woman was in an extremely weak condition; from the roots of the hair being pulled out, and the coagulated blood underneath that part, I am of opinion that she had received some violence by pulling her hair, and from the nature of that coagulated patch, and the appearances around it, I am of opinion that that took place during life—the congestion and compression of the lungs, and the compression of the chest, lead me to conjecture that her head had been pulled forward on her chest, and that from her weakened state, that caused her death, by stopping her breathing; if her head came in contact with the rug or mattress, in her weak and powerless state, life would become extinct—there is a disease called <hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphyxia</hi>, which I have seen persons die of—that is a disease attacking persons from causes from within, without any external agent being perceptible to us—it is possible that she might from the state of her heart have had a tendency to <hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphyxia</hi> and the pulling her head forward, in the manner I have described, might have caused an attack of this <hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphyxia</hi>, and have caused her death; it would be different in her case—in the case of a strong person, youwould necessarily infer from the congested and compressed state of the lungs, that suffocation had taken place; that would have been my opinion, but looking at the weakened state of this woman, her spire and all her muscles being attenuated, that which in a strong person would require continued pressure to cause that strangulation, and those appearances, would in her case be effected in a very short time, by a single pull, perhaps—it is possible that a slight interruption of the breathing by pulling her forward, and her face coming in contact with the cloth or the bed, from the weakened state of her system, and the heart being flaccid, would have caused death in her, when it would not in a stronger person with out more continued pressure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated two facts as to which probably the Jury may require some explanation; you say there was no redness round the pupil of the eye, and no lividity of the lips, what inference do you draw from that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the majority of cases, it is the opinion of the profession, that suffocation is generally accompanied by lividity of the lips, suffusion of the conjunctiva, and general protrusion of the eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does the attenuated state of this woman's body, and the feeble condition of her system, in your opinion, bear upon the absence of those symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That if pulled forward by her hair, and her head coming in contact with anything, that would be sufficient, in the state of her heart, to produce this strangulation, which it would not, in my opinion, in a stronger person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say, that you think a woman in her weak condition might be suffocated without causing lividity of the lips, or the ordi nary affection of the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the whole circumstances that you have described, in your judgment could the death of this woman have occurred from purely natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it did occur from natural causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the appearances of the body, do you think she could have died a natural death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think she could; the appearances were not consistent with a natural death, but it is possible—if I am confined to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances, I say it is possible she could have died a natural death.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310066"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Without any external violence at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it is possible that those appearances I have described could have occurred without external violence—the appearances I saw could not have occurred from natural causes; finding those appearances I do not think she died a natural death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think the period which elapsed between the death of the deceased and the time of your making the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, was about seventy-two hours, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the 8th to the 11th, it was sixty-nine hours after—the morbid appearances which would be exhibited upon a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination made immediately after death, sometimes differ from those presented after an interval of sixty-nine hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had been called in to make this <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, without having heard anything whatever touching the antecedents of the case, would you, from that examination, have come to the conclusion that the woman had died a violent death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know, it is difficult to answer that question, because it is mere conjecture—it is possible that I or any man might examine a body, and not having our attention particularly directed to any special circumstances, we might pass them over—I think the condition of the lungs would not have escaped any medical man accustomed to open bodies—<hi rend="italic">asphxyia</hi> was the proximate cause of death, that is, engorgement and congestion with compression; it is possible that congestion of the lungs might be produced either by internal or external causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the congestion that you observed in this woman, or do you mean that congestion of the lungs might take place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The congestion as it was here; it is possible to have occurred without external violence, I mean from internal causes, from natural cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the <hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphxyia</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not think that it could have been produced by any internal disease, the result of which was pressure on the trachea, I cannot reconcile the possibility of pressure on the trachea—it is possible, but I cannot reconcile the probability in my own mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any symptom from which you could judge it possible to have arisen from that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing that I observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what portion of the body did you commence your incision for the purpose of opening the thorax? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the anterior superior portion of the chest, the upper and fourth portion—I examined the organs of respiration and deglutition, which are comprised in the larynx and pharynx—after making the external incision to remove the integuments, I raised the walls of the chest, and then from that I proceeded to examine the bronchia, the internal portion of the cells of the lungs; from that to the larynx, and then the musical box in the throat—I took out both the larynx and pharynx attached to the end of the lungs; I took it out attached to the end part of the trachea, I could not take it out attached to the <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi>—I took it out downwards—I removed the trachea with the bronchial tubes, and passed my finger down to see that there was no foreign body in the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—I made an examination of the larynx and pharynx, and I looked at the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> particularly—I found no remnants of food in the mouth—I found the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> lying on the <hi rend="italic">rima glottidis</hi>, in its natural position—I examined the gall bladders; there was more bile in them than usual, but not any disease—I have met with cases of spasmodic action of the trachea—if death ensued from spasmodic action of the trachea, I should not be able, on a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, to detect that any spasm had existed—the appearance of the lungs would be precisely analogous to the symptoms I have been describing.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310067"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In point of fact, if this woman had died in consequence of a sudden spasm of that description, the appearances would have been precisely the same as those which you discovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible; but I do not apprehend that they would—I want to explain—in my opinion, if it had been from closure of the <hi rend="italic">rima glottidis</hi> or any obstruction of that sort, and no pressure had been used, the left lung and the right lung would probably have been in the same condition; it is an opening common to both lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then your theory of that pressure on the chest I apprehend is this, that the head was pressed down on the chest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The head was found so pressed down, and the chest might have been compressed, either from the body being pulled over, or from some pressure on the left side of the chest—the muscles of the neck and common integuments would not hare exhibited any marks of discolouration if, during life, the head had been forcibly drawn over on the chest—I saw a case where a man was pressed between a railway carriage and a wall on the Eastern Counties Railway, and there were no external marks, although the pressure was violent, and injured some of the internal organs, and this would be the case particularly with a thin woman, whose body was very much attenuated—the man I speak of did not die—I give that as a strong case—it is usual, if such violence has been exercised, to find some indications, such as ecchymosis or extravasation, on dissecting the common integuments and muscles of the neck—I dissected the common integuments and muscles of the neck of this woman on both sides—I laid back the flaps of the skin on both sides; not at the back, I examined the skin externally at the back—the muscles of the posterior and lateral portions of the neck arise, and are inserted from the base of the cranium to the clavicle and superior spinus processes—the <hi rend="italic">trapezius</hi> is the strongest muscle in the neck—I examined those muscles externally, but a muscle presents no appearance unless it is ruptured—it is not at all probable that those muscles would have been ruptured if this violence had been exercised; I cannot even imagine it possible that the <hi rend="italic">trapezius</hi>, or any muscle at the back of the neck, would have been ruptured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are such morbid appearances as were presented upon <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination here, frequently manifested in cases of death from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such appearances have been manifested, at least some of them—you do Dot allude to the pulling out of the roots of the hair, of course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am confining myself entirely to the internal appearances; I am afraid this unfortunate hair has created a prejudice in your mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps it has; it is impossible to divest one's self of it to a certain extent—the appearance of the lungs was strongly analogous to that which is occasionally presented in cases of natural death, but rarely so, not frequently; it would be an exception—I do not pledge myself as to the actual cause of the death of this woman—the appearance of the lungs in cases of death from starvation, is not generally very similar to the appearances presented in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend has asked you whether an interval of sixty or seventy hours might change the appearances upon which the examination proceeds; would that be the case here, with an attenuated person like this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it would not—I understood his question to be, "Do bodies generally change?" not with reference to this special case—in this particular case I do not think it did, because decomposition had not set in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked something about spasmodic action of the trachea; was there anything at all that indicated an attack of spasm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310068"/>
               <p>disease that leaves no <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances—there was nothing to lead me to the opinion that there had been any attack of spasm in the trachea—<hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphyxia</hi> is a disease where a person will suddenly faint off, and for some want of power in the action of the heart the blood becomes coagulated or thickened—it is possible that having first met the left lung, and impeded respiration, the right lung may become gorged afterwards, from the exudation of hydrogen or some other cause, leaving the left lung compressed—I did not observe externally any appearance of pressure on the left lung—I observed that the chest was bent on the left side, and the bones of the sternum depressed on that side, as if flattened—I pointed it out to Mr. Leech, and he also pointed it out to me—I am of opinion that that depression was from some external cause—if a person in a struggle knelt on that part, that would account for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to <hi rend="italic">idiopathic asphyxia</hi>, would your opinion of that disease arise in a case where you found the chest depressed, the lungs gorged, and the head leaning over in the way you have described this woman's head to have been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You speak of some coagulated blood under the place where the hair had been apparently pulled out; had that anything to do with causing the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I think an attenuated body of this description would get cold sooner than a more robust one—the time in which a body loses heat differs exceedingly—it depends so much upon the surrounding temperature, that it is impossible to say; I have seen rigidity and coldness of the body arise in two hours; I have seen bodies remain warm eight or nine days, and I have seen rigidity without coldness come on almost immediately after death—it is uncertain—it may depend upon internal causes, the circulation, the vital warmth of the body itself, the state of heat retained in the flesh and fat, and it may depend upon the external temperature—a body exposed to a draught will cool sooner than one not so exposed—there was nothing either in the nature of this body or in the place where it was, to make me suppose that warmth would last longer than usual—indeed, I should think a very attenuated body, in a garret without a fire, in the month of Dec, and with no clothes on, would get cold sooner than in an ordinary case. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the depression of the bone had taken place from any very recent violence, such as kneeling upon it, would it have been likely to leave any mark, the body being naked, or nearly so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be likely, in the generality of cases, I should say, but many cases to the contrary have occurred in my own experience, and it is laid down as a rule by medical men that great violence may be applied externally without leaving any mark at all; and on the other hand the least violence to some bodies will leave a very great mark—the thinness of the body would have something to do with it—cases have occurred of great pressure, such as pieces of rock falling upon a body and causing death, and upon examination there has not been a single sign of a mark externally, while the lung itself has been engorged and compressed—that would be more probable where a large surface was pressing upon it—the knee of a man would not be so likely to leave a mark as a blow, nor would a pressure—the general mark is from the vessels being ruptured from a blow; in that case it is an ecchymose mark—the least blow will cause a mark sometimes, when very great or violent pressure will not do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and was residing in Colchestef about three years ago. About two years ago I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi>, Mr. Robert Turpin's vessel—we left Colchester for Amsterdam, and then went from Amsterdam to the Mediterranean—I do not remember about what time it was that we left Zante, but some time after we left Zante we got near a place called Faro on the coast of Spain—one morning, about half past 8 o'clock, I was standing at the helm, and saw the captain take an sugar out of the locker, with which he bored some holes through the ship's side, under his bed <hi rend="italic">bunk</hi>—I should think that would be below water mark—it went through the skin and the lining—I said nothing to the captain of it at the time; I remained at the helm till 10 o'clock—the watch was called at 12 o'clock, and I then made a statement to the rest of the crew—in the ordinary course of business the watch would be again called at 4 o'clock—the well was sounded at the 4 o'clock watch, and there was five feet of water in it—the pumps were then set going; we worked them from 4 o'clock till 12 o'clock at night—the captain then said it was of no use pumping any longer—we had pumped all that time, but the water still gained on us (I cannot tell whether it was spring, summer, autumn, or winter)—at daylight in the morning the captain said we were to get the boats out—there was a boat there called the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi>, which was alongside in the water; I got into it, and so did the captain—he had an adze in his hand, which I saw him go and get out of the cabin five or ten minutes before; he cut the starboard port out with it—we then went round the ship's stern and cut the larboard port out—those ports might be about a foot long—they are for the purpose of taking in ballast—the lowest part of the port was at that time about ten inches from the level of the water—supposing the vessel to be sunk down to the level of where the ports were cut out, the water would run in like a sluice and sink her—at the time the ports were cut open, I observed a schooner about thirteen or fourteen miles off, and there were some smacks from the shore about the length of this room from us; they were coming off to us—we were twelve or thirteen miles from the shore at that time—with the leakage the vessel was making when the ports were cut out, she could have reached the shore at the rate she was making—the crew consisted of Joseph Turpin the mate, who was a relation of the owner, Benjamin Munson, Philip Erle, Robert Howard, William Cooper, myself, and the captain—about nine or ten months back I saw the captain at Sunderland—he came and asked me, "What ship?"—I did not tell him—he said he hoped I should not say anything about cutting the ports of the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi> out, or else he should get transported for life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time this happened, how many knots were you making? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None at all, only just knocking about—I was standing at the helm, and my duty was to keep a look out and to steer—I saw these holes bored by the captain through a skylight; the skylight hatch was off, and I could see down into the cabin and all over the cabin—the skylight was behind me, but I happened to turn my head at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310070"/>
               <p>time, and that gave me the opportunity of seeing it—I did not take my eyes off until it was done—I did not think it necessary to look ahead; while the captain was sinking the vessel it was not much use steering—we were in tolerably deep water—I do not know whether the vessel has ever been got up—I cannot swim much—we should all have got drowned if it had not been for the boats, yet I said nothing to anybody from half past 8 till 10 o'clock—I do not think it a pleasant thing to be drowned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But when a man is knocking a hole in a ship whichyouare in, and you are not able to swim, is it not worth while to speak? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She would be a long while sinking if he had not cut the ports out—I did not interfere, because I was afraid; I did speak of it when the watch was called—I did not leave the tiller up to 10 o'clock—during that time the captain was boring the holes in the vessel—I spoke when the watch was called; I cannot give you a reason for my not speaking at half past 8 o'clock—the other men were off the deck—I spoke about it at 12 o'clock—all the damage was not done then—the holes were bored then—it was a copper bottomed vessel—it went through her side—he might go through the copper too; he must—he made three holes—I was able to count, and can swear to three that went through the ship's side, through the woodwork and through the copper, I standing all the while and saying nothing to anybody until 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went away from the tiller at 10 o'clock, and you must have seen that the water was coming in; would it not have been worth while to mention it at 10 o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not see the water coming in, it ran between the outside skin and the lining—I did not hear it, but I was sure it was running in—I spoke about it to all hands on deck—<hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Munson succeeded me at the tiller; I might have mentioned it to him, but I do not recollect it if I did; I will not swear to it—there was only him and me on deck—I cannot swear whether I mentioned it to him—the watch on deck at the time were me and <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Munson, the boy, whose name is William Cooper, and the mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, if you saw the captain do this, did not you call somebody's attention to it at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I spoke about it at 12 o'clock, and I might have spoken of it at 10 o'clock, for what I know of; it is a long time back—it was 4 o'clock when the pumps were called, not 12 o'clock—if I told the men at 12 o'clock, none of them said anything to the captain—though I told the ship's crew at 12 o'clock, we did not say anything to the captain, or work the pumps—the auger might be half an inch broad, a foot and a half long, and about half an inch at the point; it was bigger than a man's finger—he bored with it—he went down on his knees, and went working away at it as if this was the handle; he bored it so (<hi rend="italic">imitating the action</hi>)—when he had got well through one hole he made another, I looking all the while, and not saying a word to anybody—he might be better than a quarter of an hour at this work—I had been in the cabin before; there was a table in it, and there were two or three cupboards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a cupboard in which the captain kept Hollands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was in the locker—I got into the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> first, and the captain followed—it was not an axe that the captain had, but an adze such as carpenters use, made of iron and steel—it was square, with a handle about two feet long, and an iron blade at the end, such as you cut with; he used it with two hands, chopping—I had seen it before, but never used it—I did not chop the port holes of bore a hole; the captain did it—I am quite sure it was not myself—I have nothing to do with it; I only got into the boat—I mean to swear, on my solemn oath before God, that I had nothing to do with taking out the ports</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310071"/>
               <p>—the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> is a small boat—the captain was in it, nobody else—he stood up in it, and chopped the starboard port out with both hands—the boat did not keep steady; I had to hold on by a rope from the ship while he chopped—that was for the purpose of having the port chopped out—I was obliged to do as I was ordered, and I held the boat on and the ports were chopped out—I held the boat for that purpose, and then did the same thing to the larboard—it was not long coming out—he used the adze with both hands, the crew looking on—I cannot tell you what time of year it was—I made no complaint till very lately, but it has been mentioned plenty of times—I first embarked on board the vessel at Wavenhoe—I was an apprentice to Mr. Turpin, the owner—I recollect the vessel being at Hamburg; that was before this affair—I cannot tell how long before—I cannot tell whether it was a year before; it might be three years before, but I cannot say—I cannot say whether it was one.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long, before the vessel was lost, were you at Hamburg? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had only been one voyage; I was an apprentice while we were lying at Hamburg—Mr. Wilson was the captain then, not the same man; I do not know whether it was his brother—I do not remember doing anything to the captain's cabin then; I am sure about that—the prisoner was mate at that time—I do not recollect charging the mate with breaking into the captain's cabin, and stealing some Holland—he never knocked me down—he struck me at Hamburg, because he said I had been and broke into the cabin; I said I had not been in—I did not say he had been into the cabin—he did not knock me down, he hit me; he did not make me bleed, or give me a black eye—he hit me somewhere in the head—I did not their say I would be revenged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be cautious; did you say you would go on shore and be revenged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not say I would have him taken into custody, on my solemn oath—I did not say I would pay him out—I might be angry when he struck me; if I said anything I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you cannot remember whether you did or not, will you swear you did not say you would be revenged on Wilson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I did, it is a long bit back, and I do not remember it—I cannot tell how long it was before the vessel sank, that Wilson struck me—he afterwards became my captain, and Isailed with him—I recollect, while in the same employment, being on board the <hi rend="italic">Ocean Queen</hi>—I brought some women on board that vessel—(it was after this ship was lost)—she was lying at home at the time I brought the girls on board—I did not get drunk—I was not charged with getting drunk—I brought my brother on board too—I left the ship without permission; I walked away, taking my indentures and ticket; I got them through the mate giving me the keys of the cabin; I did not tell him what I wanted them for; he had no business to give them to me—I got them that I might get my register ticket and indentures—the crew did not say their berths had been robbed; there was only one robbed of a coat, and there was a London man taken for that—he was not one of my companions—I was accused of it, but there was one who knew better than that—I do not know that there were a great quantity of things taken, and returned on the following day by my brother; he brought back nothing at all to my knowledge—nothing was brought back—I never joined the <hi rend="italic">Ocean Queen</hi> again—I did not run away; I was about home—I went away—that is twelve months ago; I have not</p>

               <p>been in England ever since that; I have a good deal, and in the neighbourhood of Colchester—I did not apply to Mr. Turpin to engage me again, or to anybody to be engaged on board Mr. Turpin's vessel at any time, never since—the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi> was not heavily laden; it was currants—there was ten inches from the water to the ports, and the ports were about a foot each way—the captain cut away the ports standing in the <hi rend="italic">dingy.</hi>

                  </hi>. I was an ordinary seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi>; it was my first voyage to sea. Cudmore was an apprentice on board—he is four years older than me—I recollect taking in a cargo of currants at Zante; we sailed homewards, and came out of the Gut of Gibraltar—I remember coming to Faro—when we were at some distance from Faro the vessel was in a leaky state—I cannot say whether the pumps were sounded; I was in bed—I remember the vessel going down; the pumps had been worked the night before that—(the prisoner used to do the carpenter's work on board)—we pumped from 4 o'clock in the afternoon till between 12 and 2 o'clock in the morning, but the water gained on us—I had no orders given to find out where the leak was, but I went without orders—the pumps were going because she bad the water in her—we knew the water was in her, otherwise we could not have got any out—I went all forwards wherever I had anything to do with the vessel; I might not go aft without the permission of the captain—we pumped till between 12 and 2 o'clock; we left off by orders from the captain—I stowed the flying gib myself; that sail was no good to the vessel at all, even if it was set; the vessel was going before the wind, what little wind there was, and that would do her no good at all; the wind was aft at that time—the boats were got out about six o'clock in the morning—there was a boat called the <hi rend="italic">dingy</hi> there—I cannot say who was in her, if any one—I saw no one in her until we left the ship, and then Cudmore was in her; he might have been in her before, but I did not see him—there was a larboard and a starboard port—I saw the captain cut the larboard port out that morning with an adze, and when we left the vessel I saw that the starboard port was out; I did not see who did that—the captain was on deck when he cut the larboard port out; I saw him on deck when he cut it out—the vessel was not afloat more than five minutes after we left her—I saw the water running in on both sides into the ports.</p>

Between five and six months after last Christmas twelvemonth, I was at Sunderland and saw Cudmore there, and saw the prisoner in the street; we spoke together, and the prisoner came across the street and said to Cudmore, "What ship?"—Cudmore made no answer—the prisoner said, "What have you been saying about the ship?"—Cudmore said, "Nothing"—the prisoner said, "You must have been saying something about her, as I have had a letter from Mr. Turpin, and if you say anything more about her, I shall get transported"—Cudmore said, "There will not be anything more said about it"—the prisoner said, "No; I doubt not that it is not settled yet;" and asked Cudmore if he would go and have anything to drink—he said no, he had not got time—the prisoner asked Cudmore to meet him at the Royal Oak public house that night—I did not hear what Cudmore said to that, but I know he did not go—it was not mentioned whether the ship was a bark, a brig, or a schooner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you known Cudmore long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years; he is no friend of mine—I do not associate with him; I speak with him when I see him—I have sailed with him to Spain from Sunderland; we were together ten or eleven months—he has talked to me about the <hi rend="italic">Essex Lass</hi>, but he has not mentioned the conversation I have just repeated; and I was with him, after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what necessity was there for him to tell you if you had heard it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not tell me, I heard it—we sailed together after that three months, and we had five months together before, not ten months—he never mentioned anything about transporting the captain when we were sailing together after this occurred; he only told me that the captain asked him to go to the Royal Oak that night—I do not know what made him tell me that when I had heard it; I do not know whether he knew that I heard it—I do not know</p>

               <p>how the conversation got up; we were going after some paint to paint the ship with—I do not know how he came to tell me about the captain asking him to go to the public house; it was not in answer to anything I said: I do not know how he came to say it; we were not talking about the captain; you must ask him—he said the captain asked him to go to the Royal Oak, to spend an hour or two—I cannot recollect whether I answered, "Why, Cudmore, of course I know that, I heard him;" it is very near a twelvemonth ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Randall, Freemantle, and Co., we carry on business as brewers in Hampstead-road. On 14th Oct. I saw the prisoner Gerhardt, he gave the name of John Henry Garrett, by word of mouth—it was in our counting-house I saw him—I think I had seen him before, about the beginning of the month—On 14th Oct. he said he had taken a house in Bath-place, New-road—he was fitting it up as a beer shop, and he wished to deal with us—he said he was a painter by trade, and he had recently come from Devonshire—he said he had laid out about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his house, and he stated that he had a lease of the house for twenty, one years, and he had paid a premium—we asked if he wanted credit—he said he did, and we asked for a reference—he said he had not been long in town, and he scarcely knew any one in London, but he could refer us to one, a respectable man, Mr. William Smith, of No. 8, College-place, Camden-town—he said Mr. Smith was a tailor, and he had known him for many years—I went and looked at the house in Bath-place, to see where it was situated, and I went to No. 8, College-place, Camden-town—I went in the course of the next day or two—at the house in College-place, Camden-town, I saw the prisoner Smithers—I mentioned that Garrett had referred to him, and asked him what he knew about him—I mentioned Garrett as a beer shop keeper, and that he had referred to him for his general character and respectability—on my so explaining to him, Smith said he had known Garrett for some time, and knew him to be an exceedingly honest and industrious man—he said he knew he had some little money, but not much, but he knew he was a very honest man—I think Smith did not say anything about the premises—he said that Garrett had come from the country—I believe I mentioned Devonshire myself—on that occasion Smith was dressed much as he is now—he had not any mark of his trade at that time—the next time I saw him was at his own house, about the 21st Oct.—that was after the first goods had been delivered—it was before any money had been advanced—the goods were delivered on the 14th, 22nd, and 23rd of Oct; this is the account of the goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had first seen Smith before any goods were sent—I had seen him before the first lot had been delivered, and a second time before the two last lots were delivered, and before the money was advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you have sent the goods if you had not heard from Smith the character he had given of Gerhardt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I would not have given credit unless I had had that character—I would not have given Gerhardt credit if I had known his name was Gerhardt—certainly not, because that name was well known to me, as having appeared frequently before me in the <hi rend="italic">Trade Protection Circular</hi>, in the Swindler's List—on the second interview with Smith he had a tape measure round his neck, over his shoulders—the first lot of goods that was sent to Gerhardt was four barrels of ale, one barrel of stout, and four barrels of porter—that was on 14th Oct—on 21st or 22nd</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310077"/>
               <p>Oct. we supplied half a barrel of ale and some bottled beer, and some on the 23rd—the amount of the whole supplied was about 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received a delivery ticket each time—this is one signed, "J. H. Garrett," on 14th Oct.—this other ticket is for the half-barrel, signed by the same party; and there is one other signed, but not by the prisoner—I have seen Gerhardt write on two occasions, and I believe these signatures to be his handwriting—our drayman is in Court, who saw him sign them—about 18th Oct. I saw Gerhardt again—he came to our counting-house, and said he had been pressed for payment by the party who was fitting up the house, and he could not open till the house was completed, and he had been disappointed of some money from the country—he wanted to borrow 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he offered, as security for it, to sign a bill of sale, or a deposit of his lease, or agreement for his house—we said that on advances of that kind we were usually satisfied with a joint note—he said he did not know who to go to, and I believe I suggested that perhaps Mr. Smith would be joined with him—(I bad seen Mr. Smith previously)—Gerhardt said he did not know whether be would, but he would ask him—he went away, and be came back to the brewery, I think on the 20th, and said Mr. Smith would be a security for him—on his saying that, I went and saw Mr. Smith on the 21st, at his own house, in College-place—I told him for what purpose I came; I said Garrett wanted an advance, and he had mentioned that he was willing to become security for him, and I asked if that was the case—he said he was not in the habit of doing such things, he did not like to put his hand to a bill, and he should not like his wife to know anything about it—I said we should make the advance entirely on the good character that he had given him; and if Garrett did not pay it, we should look to him—he said he hoped we should keep Garrett up to the mark, and get payment as soon as possible, to release him from his responsibility—upon that I drew a promissory note, and I saw Smith sign it—this is the note, signed by Smith, and signed afterwards by Garrett; and on Garrett's signing it, I gave him a check, which he indorsed, and we cashed it in our own counting-house—(<hi rend="italic">the promissory note being read, was dated October</hi> 21,1852,<hi rend="italic">for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable on demand, and signed William Smith and J, H. Garrett; the check was for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and indorsed, "J, H, Garrett</hi>")—this indorsement on it would merely show that he had received it—we have not received any payment, either for the goods or the note—we have received no payment at all—the goods were to be paid for a fortnight after he commenced business, as drawn; that is, such portion as he had sold was to be paid for—he would pay at the end of the fortnight for all that was drawn—it not having been paid, I wrote to Smith, and he called on us—that was about 14th Nov., about a month after the first supply of goods—I saw him when he called—he said he was sorry they had not been paid for, but he would go and see Garrett, and induce him to come round and make some arrangement—I said we should expect to have the amount paid, and the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. also—he said if the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid within a fortnight, he would pay it himself—I did not see him at the end of the fortnight—he did not call, and I wrote again to the same address; and that letter was returned by the post—I did not see either Garrett or Smith afterwards, till they were taken into custody—at the Police-office Smith gave the name of John Smith,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you said Garrett spoke by word of mouth, and did not write his name at the first interview? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not write his name—I went to the house where he represented he was carrying on a beer shop—it was in Bath-place, New-road, the corner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310078"/>
               <p>of Tottenham-court-road, I found such a house as Garrett represented—it was apparently fitting up for a person who was going to carry on the beer business—it was being fitted up—a new front had been put in—I did not go inside—I did not see any other alteration outside—when Garrett first came to me he said he wanted some beer, he was going to start a new shop—I asked if he required credit, and he said, "Yes"—really I cannot say whether I was the first that mentioned about credit—I advanced the money for the purpose, as I understood, of paying the man who was fitting up the place—he applied for that purpose—brewers frequently advance money to publicans—I believe they do that to insure the custom of the men—I believe they do not do it to get the men a little in their debt—I do not frequently advance money—I object to it—I believe the large brewers do it—I advanced this money for a specific object—I had never known this man before—I would not have advanced the money to any other person, on a man's merely asking it—I would not have advanced this man 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the person who might have been pressing him, if he had not been a publican—it was in hopes of keeping the custom of the house—that was the motive that induced me to part with the money—I myself suggested Smith's name to be on the note—when I suggested it, Gerhardt did not readily and at once adopt it—certainly not—he said he must go and see Smith—I believe he came back to me on the subject of the note in the course of the next day, possibly the same day—he said he was a painter by trade—at that time he was a beer shop keeper—but he said he was a painter by trade, and he should be able to paint our sign boards—I believe he did not paint the front of his own house—I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that when you went to Smith he said that as far as he knew, Garrett had some money—not much—not a great deal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and he had known him many years as an industrious hard working honest man—Gerhardt told me he came from Devonshire—no part of the money has been paid, either for the note or the goods—Gerhardt gave me permission to dispose of the lease of the house—that was as soon as the first payment became due at the end of the first fortnight, or within a few days afterwards—we instructed the broker to find a customer for the house if possible—when he said he could not meet the first instalment, he said we might take the lease and dispose of it, and we did all in our power to dispose of the lease—we brought an action for this money against Gerhardt, and the action was stopped as soon as we knew what his character was—we took proceedings after we stopped the action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You first gave instructions for an action, and when you ascertained what character he was you stopped the action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did—I certainly would not have advanced the money on this promissory note if I had not believed Gerhardt to be deserving of the character given him by Smith—I would not have supplied him with any portion of the goods if I had not believed him deserving of that character—it was after he had received all the goods that he instructed us to dispose of the house, about the beginning of November—we did not receive a farthing of money on the lease, or any agreement for a lease—we never had possession of the lease or agreement—after Gerhardt had made this representation to us, he never placed the lease or agreement in our hands—I did not call at the beershop myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Robert Lewis Gawtrey. We carry on business at No. 3, Loundes-terrace, Knights bridge—the prisoner was in our employ three weeks; on 25th Jan., in consequence of information, I went to a place where our parcels are put for delivery, and found a parcel directed in the prisoner's writing, "Mrs. Williams, 1, Farm-place, Walbam-green;" it was represented in a private character that 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., had been paid—this is the wrapper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it would have been delivered in the usual course if I bad not noticed it—I opened it, and found it contained fifteen yards of flannel, worth 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I then went to the books in the prisoner's charge, in which the money is checked, and found no entry either of the money or goods—if he had sold the goods, there ought to have been an entry of it in his book, and the cash paid at the desk—I sent for an officer; the prisoner was called up stairs, and questioned as to what flannel he had cut off, to send to Mrs. Williams—he said, "Fourteen yards"—he was asked the price, and said he could not recollect; he had sold it the night before, to a lady, and received the money in the shop—we have no flannel of which fourteen yards would have been 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was asked to point out in his book the cash he had received in payment for the parcel—he pointed out the sum of 105. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the day before (<hi rend="italic">producing the book</hi>) and stated that the lady had also had a pair of silk gloves, which she paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and took away with her—I then ordered the remainder of the piece of flannel from which this had been cut, to be brought up, and he was asked if that was the flannel he had cut from; he said, "I believe it is"—he was then asked how the price came to be 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., when the real price was 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said be could not understand our private letters, which told the prices—I then referred to the parcel book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find a parcel had been sent on 15th Jan., directed to Mrs. Williams, Walham-green, sold by the prisoner, and the price against it was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(that is not the same transaction)—I told the prisoner there was no entry in the cash book of that, and he pointed out two sums of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 15th Jan., which he said was the money be received for the parcel—I told him I should give him into custody; he said he hoped we should pardon him, or forgive him, as it would be the death of his mother, or words to that effect; he was then taken in charge—it is the duty of the shopmen to make entries of all sums they receive above 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they have each two books, which are changed at five o'clock every afternoon, and this book would not have been in the prisoner's possession at the time he says he made this entry—I went to the address on the parcel, and found a Mrs. Humphries, who answers to the name of Williams as well—she is housekeeper to Mr. Williams.</p>

About two months ago when the prisoner was not in Mr. Coleman's service, I lent him some money—I also told him when he saw a piece of flannel to suit me, to buy it for me, as he understood it, I was not in a hurry for it; it was to be about twelve or fifteen yards, and I was not particular in the price; and if it came to more, I would pay him for it—I never was in Mr. Coleman's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, at No. 89, Watling-street, in the parish of St. John the Evangelist. On 7th Jan. I left my warehouse soon after 5 o'clock, leaving L'Estrange, my clerk and warehouseman, there—I got to the warehouse next morning at about 10 or 20 minutes past 9 o'clock, and found sergeant Shephard there—I received a communication from him in consequence of which I immediately looked to my warehouse, and found the stock and drawers in great confusion—my stock consists principally of silk goods—I missed about 200 pieces of silk, amounting to 2,000 handkerchiefs, partly printed, and of the value of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—L'Estrange had been taken away in custody before I arrived; I had not given him into custody, neither would I have done so if I had been present—he is still in my employ—two or three days previous to the robbery, the prisoner Taylor came into my warehouse, and said be wanted a few dozens of silk handkerchiefs—that not being a trade expression, caused me to look at him particularly—I told him I was not the right man to apply to, my transactions were large—he said he was going to Australia, and wished to take out a few dozens with him—supposing he was a countryman, and really disposed to speculate, I said I would endeavour to find him a lot—I made a lot up of twenty pieces of India corahs, and said, "You shall have those for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the lowest"—he said, "Very well; I will come again, and let you know in half an hour"—he never came back; that was the last I saw of him till he was taken into custody—these twenty pieces of corahs remained on the same spot, and were among those stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, and live at No. 4, Greyhound-court, Strand. The prisoner was in my service from March till the 13th Sept, when I discharged him—after that time he was employed by me merely as a friend—he came in occasionally to see how I was getting on—at various times he assisted me, and I gave him a small remuneration for his services, as circumstances would admit—I sent him occasionally to the Blind School at St. John's Wood with work, and I trusted him with the check book—the check was filled at the time with the amount for the work</p>

               <p>he carried in, and the schoolmaster there signed the account of the work delivered—I have been accustomed to work for Mr. Watts, of Crown-court, Temple Bar, and he paid me every week—that work consisted of sundry office work; nothing connected with the Blind School—I worked for Mr. Watts since 1843—the work for the Blind School was binding books; nothing else—it was my custom to send the work, when complete, to the school, and the schoolmaster signed the check which had been written by me for the amount of the work which I delivered—when the prisoner had got the check he brought it to me—when he came out I said, "Have you got Mr. Wood's signature?"—he opened the book, and showed me that it was signed—I saw the signature, and he put it in his pocket, and it was delivered to Mr. Watts—I saw no more of it—on the 2nd Oct. I sent home by the prisoner fourteen copies of the Epistles to the Corinthians—the charge for binding them was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say whether, when the prisoner returned from the Blind School on that occasion, he showed me the check, for I never had any suspicion of him, and did not take any notice—after he came from the Blind School I told him to take the check to Mr. Watts or Mr. Stevenson, and bring me the amount—I think he brought me back the full amount—this is the bill, the receipt, and the check, No. 28, which I gave the prisoner on that occasion—the bill was for fourteen copies Corinthians, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 5 per cent discount, for Mr. Watts—it is now 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and for twenty-five copies—the prisoner paid me the sum of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. only—sometimes I gave the prisoner a shilling for going to the Blind School, sometimes half-a-crown, according as my pocket would allow.</p>

I said I did not know whether he would or not, I had orders to apprehend him—he then said to me, "What a <hi rend="italic">blasted</hi> fool I was to take the papers, but Mr. Smith told me that if I returned his papers he would not prosecute me"—I said, "But you have not done that, you have not been nigh the chambers since"—he then asked me whether I was going to take him to the police station, and whether I had any objection to go to Mr. Smith's chambers first; I said I had none, and I took him to Mr. Smith's, and then to the Guildhall police station, and afterwards to Newgate—I got this office seal with "The Brighton and Dover Railway" on it, from the prisoner's person.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ—about half the papers produced belong to me, the others belong to Mr. Bainbrigge, but were in the same suite of chambers—it is impossible to over estimate the value of them; they belong to my clients, and I am liable at any moment to be called on for them—I had some conversation with the prisoner, in which I made him a promise—I was anxious to get back all the papers, and I was not aware of the extent of the robbery.</p>

Feb., about 5 minutes before 9 o'clock, I am not certain as to the exact time, I was going to bed, and heard a strange foot on the landing outside my room door—I took no notice at the time, but shortly after went down stairs with Mrs. Shakel, and found the prisoner in the passage—he was in the act of taking a key out of the lock of the street door—Mrs. Shakel asked what he wanted there—he said he wanted Mr. Williams, and he lived</p>

               <p>on the third floor—Mrs. Shakel said Mr. Williams did not live there; how dare he enter with a key; why not ring or knock—no such person lives there—I stopped with the prisoner, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck me; I cried out for assistance, and Mr. Shakel came, and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house, and am an engraver; George Stevens, my father-in-law, is the master of the house; it is in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. I was going up stairs, at 5 minutes to 9 o'clock, and met the prisoner on the stairs—he looked hard at me, and passed me—I am certain it was 5 minutes to 9 o'clock—I went up stairs, and then heard the parlour and street door opened—I went down, and went out into the street to look for the prisoner, but could not see him—it must have been him at the street door; there was no one else who could have been—I then searched the house, and when I got to the top I was called down by Champion, and found the prisoner on the step of the door, and Mr. Champion said, "Is this the man?"—I said it was, and brought him inside the passage—I asked the prisoner for the key of the door—he said. "I have not got one"—he afterwards showed me one, which I tried, and it opened the door—he afterwards tried to get it away from me again—I called a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Custom-house, and live at Greenwich. The female prisoner was in my service for nine weeks; she left yesterday fortnight; she came to me after leaving Mr. Gull; she left my service of her own accord—during the time she was there, I saw the male prisoner twice, but I know he was several times in the house; he was allowed to come—I have spoken to him; on Monday, 17th Jan., in consequence of information I received, I went with the constable White, to No. 4, Newton-place, Greenwich—I went up into a room that was stated to be the prisoner's, and there saw some books of mine; one of them had my same stamped on the cover—there was a box in the room, which she said was her husband's, and he had the key—shortly after, her husband came in he produced to the policeman several keys, three I think; the policeman tried each of them, but neither of them was the right; she then produced the right one, and on opening the box there was a jelly pot of mine found, which I knew, and it is the only thing I knew to be mine—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by its having a fish at the bottom—there may be other jelly pots with fish on them, but that was the subject of a family joke some months before, and that stamped it on my mind; I could not swear to it—the policeman found a coat on the bed post, in the pocket of which he found a white pocket handkerchief of my wife's, marked with my name in full, "Edgar, 6"—his wife said, in his presence, that the coat was his; at all events he owned to it afterwards; he said he had not worn the coat for three months—several nights afterwards a silk handkerchief of mine was found in my presence, in the pocket of a coat which was hanging behind the door of the sitting room below; the landlady said the coat was the prisoner's—he was then in custody—that handkerchief has not my name on it, but I had bought two; one I missed, and here is the other; it is exactly the same pattern; I believe it to be mine—some socks were afterwards found by the policeman, I do not know when.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house in Sept., 1851—on Sunday, 7th Sept., 1851, my wife went out about 6 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there when my wife went away—he owed me some money for board and lodging—I had spoken to him on the subject of that on the Saturday evening previous, and likewise on the Sunday—I told him I could not afford to keep him any longer unless I saw his mother—I said he might lodge there, but not board—he said he thought I was a very bad man, and before he would sleep in my house he would sleep under a haystack, and for two pins he would smash my brains out—he went home in the evening to his mother's, but before he went away he went up stairs in my house twice during the evening—when he came down the last time he was carrying a small bundle under his arm, and he went away—when he got to the step of the door he said, "Here is my <hi rend="italic">kit</hi>, you may search me if you like"—I said, "George, I do not want to do so;" and he said, "You shall be a loser by me."</p>

"That is a bad one;" there was something in the manner of the prisoner that induced me to say so—I put the half crown in the trier—the prisoner came to the trier, and I took it from him—both our hands were on it, and it was bad—Mr. Brooks took it out in his hand, and gave it to the policeman.</p>
