                  </hi> My husband's name is George Fisher; he lives at No. 149, Leadenhall-street, and is a hair-dresser. On Thursday, the 24th of Dec., I was sitting in a room adjoining the shop, and heard a noise at the shop-door—I went there—a gentleman came in to ask some question, he opened the door, and he shut it as he came into the shop—I noticed the prisoner come from behind the counter, stooping down—I called to my sister, who was going through the shop, not to allow her to go out of the shop—I noticed the prisoner's features—I had seen her in the shop about half an hour previously—she was begging then—she went out, and I shut the door after her—no customer came in during that half-hour—there is no difficulty in opening the door from the outside, only turning the latch—I examined the till behind the counter—it was open, and I missed a box in which gold and silver money was kept—I said the box was gone with gold in it—the prisoner immediately stooped forward, and threw the box down on the ground, with one of the half-sovereigns and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in it—she had previously thrown down two half-sovereigns—I heard her drop them—I got a candle, and found the box where she had placed it, on the ground, with one half-sovereign and a small silver 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece in it—the two half sovereigns were on the ground close by the side of it—it had contained that money—the house is in the parish of St. Peter, Cornhill—the prisoner must have opened the door to get in—my husband had opened the door when he went out, and I heard him close it—she must have turned the handle, as nobody had come in—I lost nothing else.</p>

On the 16th of Dec., about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Petticoat-lane, which is on the boundary between the City and the County—I was in the City, and saw the prisoner there with a bundle on his back—I followed him—he looked back, saw me following him, and crossed the road—I pursued him—he dropped the bundle as soon as I got close to him, and ran away—I ran after him, and took him in Bell-lane—a scuffle took place, and we fell, I on the top of the prisoner—while on the ground, some woman said, "Shame! the man will kill the policeman; take his part"—I saw the prisoner take a knife out of his pocket after he got up—he had done nothing before that—I saw him put his hand into his pocket, after a person came to assist me on pretence—he got the prisoner on his legs—then he let go of him and walked away—it was then I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and I felt him <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> at my body immediately after that—I defended myself with my arm—I was standing at the time, and endeavoured to protect myself by my arm, and I received eight wounds on my arm—I am quite sure they were inflicted by the prisoner—they could not have been inflicted by anybody else—I cried out at the time, "He is stabbing me"—we had a struggle after he stabbed me —I threw him down again—he fell on his belly, and I on his back—I held his collar, with my legs round him, and M'Michen came up and secured him—I got no further stabbing while on the ground—we were standing up at the time—I thought if I had nor thrown him down, I should not have taken him at all, or got away from him—I went to Mr. Mear's, the surgeon's, and had my arm dressed, and since then to Mr. Child—I have not been able to go on duty since—my arm is still disabled.</p>

                  </hi> I am a follow of the Royal College of Surgeons; I am also surgeon to the City police force. On the evening of the 16th of Dec., at eleven o'clock, Pettet called on me—from what he stated I examined his left arm, and found it had been previously dressed by a surgeon—on re-moving the dressing I discovered he had received eight punctured wounds in The fore-arm, one about an inch below and on a line with the inner part of the elbow, which I considered important as regards its depth—a second was situated about the middle of the inner side of the fore-arm, which I considered still more important, form the injury sustained by the nerve which supplies the inner part of the arm—there was another wound over the anterior surface of the wrist, another on the ball of the thumb, which I considered important from their locality, being situated over the principal arteries of the hand—they all appeared to have been done by some small-pointed sharp instrument, such as a penknife—he has been under my care till the present time—the wounds have healed, but he still suffers form loss of sensation in the inner part of the</p>

                  </hi> I am a painter, and live in Buckingham-street, Pim<lb/>lico. On the 20th of Dec., at two o'clock in the morning, I was coming along the Bayswater-road—I made a false step and fell down—I had drank but very little—I was quite sober and collected—I had changed my um<lb/>brella just before in Stanhope-place, and stepping down a higher pave<lb/>ment than I thought it was, I fell—I saw no person near me till the prisoner came up—she took hold of my right hand, put her left hand into my trowser's pocket, and took six half-crowns out—I could not catch her with my right hand, as I had my umbrella, but I caught her with my left hand—another female took hold of her, and pulled her and me across to the park rails—i called "Police!" and when the other female heard the policeman coming she ran away—I still held the prisoner, and the policeman came and took her—the prisoner threw down two half-crowns, and two more were found the next day—I am sure the prisoner put her left hand in my right-hand trowser's pocket, and took the money out—I had not sufficient strength to hold her with my right hand, having the umbrella, but I held her with my left.</p>

He never works at home—he usually comes home about dusk, between six and seven o'clock, except on Saturday nights, when he is later—we were both acquainted with the prisoner—he was in the habit of coming to see us—on Saturday evening, the 14th of Nov., he came to the cottage, between five and six o'clock—it was dusk—my husband was not at home—our cottage is lonely—he tapped at the window—I said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is me"—I knew his voice well, and opened the door, and said to him, "Are you alone?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is anything the matter?" seeing him alone, (as he never came to our house, except the night before, without a person I thought was his wife)—he said, "No"—he came in, and said, "I came to ask if you had such a thing as a bit of paint to give me?"—I said, "I have not such a thing in the house"—he put his back to the door—I did not ask him in, as I wondered at seeing him alone, but he stepped in on the mat, asked me for the paint, put his back against the street door, and pushed it to, and it fastened—he kept rubbing his hands—he said he had been putting a bit of wood up at home, and wanted to colour it—he walked into my sitting-room, which is the next room, and said, "I have been over to Newington again, "(he had said on Thursday that he had been to Newington,) to pay the interest on some pledges, as he had not money enough on Friday, and was obliged to again—I said, "Why did you not say so when here yes<lb/>terday? I would have given you enough to save you the journey that night"—he said, "I was too tried"—"I said, "Will you like to sit down and take a pipe?" as my husband and he often smoked together—he said, "Thank you", and I gave him a pipe and tobacco—after he had smoked a short time, I was putting some meat into the pot on the fire, which I had just brought in for my husband's supper, having my things on—he said, "You will not have your husband's supper ready"—I shall, it is not more than six o'clock; I do not expect him till between eight and nine"—he said, "You have got your things on, I am keeping you"—I said, It does not matter for a quarter of an hour or so, while you rest"—I was then putting the meat into the pot on the fire—it was necessary to turn round to do so, which I did—he stood close to me; and when I rose up my head after doing so, he was standing close to me; with his hands in his trowsers pocket, and a pipe in his mouth—my eye caught his, and he gave me a dreadful look, which I could not understand—I became quite flurried, and turned back about two steps to<lb/>wards the window—I heard his step behind me, and received a most tremendous blow on the top of my head—I was half round the table at that time—he fol<lb/>lowed me round the table—I had a light burning on the table—the first thing I observed after he followed me was a tremendous blow on my head, and the light went out at the same moment—the blow was from some substance—I should not think it was a fist—he never spoke—I screamed, "Murder!" and made</p>

On the 14th of November I was at home—it was very dark—at six o'clock, while I was sitting in my cottage, I heard a sort of stifled shriek, which after<lb/>wards broke out into a women's scream—I did not hear anything but scream<lb/>ing—I was too far to hear words—I went out directly in the direction in which I heard the screams—I ran against the prosecutrix, pushed her down,</p>

               <p>but caught hold of her and prevented her going to the ground—we were run<lb/>ning in opposite directions—I found her bleeding, and said, "Who is it?"—she did not seem sensible enough to answer, but kept calling out "Murder"—she was covered with blood, her neck, bosom, and every thing—at the time I ran against her I heard footsteps running from the immediate spot, going towards the end of the alley—this is the bonnet she had on—it was in this state. With blood on it, then—I took her into her own cottage, and on the door-post of the cottage I observed blood spirted, and also on the brick reveal, which was lime-whited and showed the blood—on going into the cottage, blood fell from her person—she was quite exhausted—her spirits kept her body up—in a few minutes she got round a bit—the prisoner was brought to the cottage by the police the same evening—I was down stairs, and Haines and his wife were up stairs—I heard a few words pass, such as "Why did you do it?"—the first words I heard the prisoner say were, "Well, I did it; you shall know what for"—I then heard him say, "I did it for revenge and satisfaction"—Mrs. Haines is a peaceable woman, and respectable in her station.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live at Holloway. I was called on the 14th of Nov. to see Mrs. Haines at the cottage at the back of Paradise-terrace—I found her very much exhausted, and several wounds on her head, which had bled considerably, but were not bleeding much then—there were five incised wounds, which were also bruised—one of an angular shape, which corresponded with the front hole through her bonnet—another angular one, about two inches more backwards; which corresponded with no hole in her bonnet—a third, about two inches and a half from the centre, and two on the right side—there were two contusions on the back of the head, one about the size of a walnut, the other not quit so large—they were serious injuries—I consider a chisel the most likely instruments to have done it—I attended her about weeks—the cuts appeared to have been inflicted with considerable violence, as although the bonnet was on, the scull was laid bare in three places—the hair was also cut through—I had reason to fear on the 16th that her life might be danger—there was a trifling wound on her ankle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>much at one end—on examining the bonnet I find both the holes are narrow, and the straw requires something cutting to divide it—I am satisfied it was a sharp instrument, and something narrow—it is a clean cut—the con<lb/>tusion might have been made at the time the wound was inflicted, or by subsequent blows—the candlestick might inflict the wounds without the bonnet, but not with the bonnet on—there was no blood on the candlestick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> All I have to say is, I certainly did go to the cottage, and assault the woman; but as to ever saying it was out of revenge, I never did; we had words about a certain person calling at the house, and she said she would give me in charge of the parish officers for deserting my wife; I was irritated, and snatched the candlestick off the table, and to make her let go, gave her several chops on her back, but she still held me till we got out of the house; she them let me go, and I walked away; that is the long and short of the story.</p>

                  </hi> I am a linen-draper, and live at Nos. 210, 211, and 212, Whitechapel-road—my brother is my partner. The prisoner was in our service as a porter—he came some time in August, and he was discharged on the 7th of Nov.—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody, but he had been on our premises—on the evening of the 27th of Nov. I was the last person up—I bolted and locked all the doors before I went to bed—on the following morning I came down stairs at half-past seven o'clock—I found the street-door opened, and stuck to, with a piece of shoemaker's wax only—the box of the lock was taken off the street-door, and the box-lock as well as the patent padlock, broken off the inner shop-door—there were a good many things broken, which a screw-driver would have done—from the appearance of the outer door, the person had broken out—a person who was well ac<lb/>quainted with the premises could very easily have got on the premises and concealed himself—when I went into the shop I found that the till of the cashier's desk had been broken open—that was where the cash was always kept, which was known quite well to the prisoner—the slide that the till slides on was broken down with violence, so that the till was taken down—the slide appeared to have been taken out with a screw-driver and a chisel, and a hammer had been used—there were two marks of a hammer—about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in small change was taken from the cashier's till—I found a square of glass had been broken from the counting-house door—there is a desk in the counting-house—the bottom of the desk was cut out, and the cash-box taken from the desk—the cash-box contained from ninety to ninety-five sove<lb/>reigns, and from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in I O U's, which I O U's were found in the cellar afterwards—I went into the cellar, and found a pepper-box, which had been used as a dark-lantern—this is it—I found this screw-driver, which I know, it belonged to our firm—I have known the prisoner to use it several times—he used it only two or three days before he left—I know it was miss<lb/>ing after he left, and it was sought for all over the premises, and not found—I did not seek for it myself, I gave orders for it to be sought for—the porters sought for it—it appeared that an instrument had been used to break the window of the counting-house, and the marks correspond with the point of this screw-driver—I and the policeman tried it—I have seen this penknife in the prisoner's possession before he left the firm—I have not the least doubt about this being the knife I have seen in his possession—on one occasion he lent it to me—I had it in my possession, using it for a few minutes—I have looked at the blade of it, I know it perfectly—no other places were broken open but the desk in the counting-house, and the cashier's desk—other places might have been broken, but not which contained money—those are the only places which a person acquainted with the premises would have broken to find money—the person happened to hit on the only two places where money was.</p>

                  </hi> I am landlord of the Red Lion public-house, in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was my potman for about eleven months—in consequence of something that was said to me, and what I ob<lb/>served, I sent the prisoner up stairs on the morning of the 29th of Dec.—I followed him up—I went into a room and concealed myself under a bed—I had found a bottle concealed under the sofa about five minutes previously—it contained half a bottle of rum, the same as I had in my stock—the prisoner came into the room and placed a bottle-back under the sofa, and went down stairs—when he left the room I got out and book up the bottle—it was the same I had seen before, but it was then empty—I went down stairs to the long room, and showed the prisoner the bottle—I said, "I have found you out at last"—he said, "I know I have done wrong; I have only had two half-bottles since the time you accused me of taking the brandy; here is the key of the cellar"—he went down and showed me how he opened the cellar, and said he had had the key ever since he had had the brandy, which is sixs months ago.</p>

About ten o'clock last Sunday evening, on my return from my rounds I met Mansell on the road to the station with the prisoner—this pistol was afterwards brought to me—I examined it—it was loaded with a full charge of powder—the which I drew out—I found a piece of paper in the pan and some powder—the pan was up and the cock down—it was produced at the station, and the pri<lb/>soner said that was the pistol he had dropped—I examined it about three quarters of an hour after it was found—I did not see it found—if three was no stray powder about the pan, I suppose the paper in the pan would have prevented it going off—the flint might have gone through the paper.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Walter, of No. 42, south<lb/>ampton-buildings, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn; I reside in the house, which is mine, but Mr. Walter has an office there. The prisoner was in my service as a sort of clerk and servant to me—I paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he writes very indifferently—I know his writing—I have seen him write for the last nine years—on the 22nd of Dec. I had occasion to go to a table<lb/>drawer in my room on the first floor front, and missed 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I kept there—it was a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns—36, 050 was the number of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—this produced is it—(looking at it)—here is written on the back "James Webb, 17, Geo.—, —berwell"—part of the writing is struck out—I have no doubt it is the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You missed the money at one o'clock in the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the drawer was locked, but it had been unlocked by a key—I had the key in pocket—I found it locked—everything appeared to be very straight, but the money was gone—the drawer contained bills of exchange and other things—I had seen the money safe I think on the Friday or Saturday previous—this was on Tuesday—I put a lease into the drawer on Saturday, but will not swear I saw it then—several persons had access to the room, which was my office—perhaps twenty people as well as me passed through in the way of business between Friday and Tuesday—Mr. Walter frequently comes there—there is only one other clerk; his name is Healey—he lives in the house—there are three other persons in the house—they all have access to my room when I am in there—I have the whole house—I let two floors—the other are my offices—the prisoner has been in my service nine years—during that time he has transacted business as a clerk—I had trusted him with money repeatedly, and always found him honest—I took him out of kindness, being the son of an old friend—on the 22nd of Dec. I believe there was a summons in the cause of "Brown v. Applegate"—I was unwell, and did not get up till one o'clock that day—I dare say I instructed the prisoner the night before to attend to the summons for me—I am informed he did so—I am not quite certain whether I gave him the order—I have received 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. re<lb/>respecting the cause—I saw him about half-past twelve or just before one o'clock on the 22nd of Dec.—I was getting up at the time—Mr. Walter had business at the Court of Bankruptcy that day—I did not see the prisoner and Mr. Walter into a cab to go to the Bankruptcy court, but I complained of the Prisoner being late, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take a cab to go to the Bankruptcy Court—he ran up stairs, as I understand, to my room, got the papers, and went down to go off—I did not see him get into the cab—the bankruptcy case was Brown and another—he returned from the Bankruptcy court and came up stairs by himself—I saw Mr. Walter in the course of the afternoon—I am satisfied that the prisoner went to the Bankruptcy Court and attended on Mr. Walter—I think he returned to my chambers about half-past one—when he came back I immediately said to him, "I have been robbed, you have been my confidential servant nine years, I depend upon you"—the charge was,</p>

               <p>made against some other person, and I ordered that person to leave my house immediately—the prisoner said, "It is Mr. Morley, you may depend, had done it," and I would believe the prisoner on his oath at any time—he was taken in charge on suspicion on the evening of the 31st of Dec.—he remained with me as clerk till he was taken—I have known his handwriting nine years—I had a clerk named Shaw in my office for about two years while the prisoner was there, and a very indifferent bad man he was—he was about fifty years of age—I know the writing on the back of the note as the prisoner's.</p>

"—I expected he would have called on me in the morning before he attended the summons—I suppose the summons was returnable at ten or eleven o'clock—he went out with Mr. Walter to the Bankruptcy Court, and I believe he came back with him—the money might Have gone on the Friday, Saturday, or Monday previous—I was going to Add 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.., to it, and missed the rest.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Drew came up to the gate, and Mr. Shipp said, "Where did you get these shoes?" Mr. Drew said, "I gave them to him;" Mr. Shipp said to him, "Can you swear to them?"

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am innocent; I went on board, Mr. Drew gave me the job to take his things out, and gave me a lot of old clothes; I said, "Are these shoes of any use?" he said, "No, take them away;" when I got to the gate, Mr. Shipp said, "What are these shoes?" Mr. Drew said, "I gave them to him; let him go out."</p>

                  </hi>, I am the prisoner's mother—I remember her being con<lb/>fined on 24th Jan. last year—she had twins, a male and female—on 31st Jun. I was in the room—her husband was there—she was in bed, and the children with her—she suckled them then, but did not so so many hours after—this was on Saturday—I had observed what I considered insanity on the Thursday before—she wished me to see to her children, and thought she was dying, and was talking very much on religious subjects, and seemed very restive indeed—I found she did not know what she was talking about—she talked so strangely we did not know what to make of her—on this Saturday, while she was in bed, I asked her husband to take particular care of her, as she was very violent—to the child and with me—there was no reason whatever for that violence—I told her husband to take care of her, and watch her while I went to the fire-place—he turned round, and said to me, "Mother, she has</p>

               <p>thrown here down on the child," and when he went to remove her, I saw her make a catch at the child, and bite it on the cheek—her husband took the child away from her—I observed that the child's cheek was bit—I believe there were two marks on the cheek—her husband had to pull her head back to get the child from her—I took the child to Mr. Mason, the doctor, and went back to my daughter—she then appeared in a more raving state—her husband had tied her down with the sheet, on account of the violence she dis<lb/>played—she talked about religion, and told us to take care of her children—first she said she would have them, and then she said she would not have them—I considered she was raving mad—she was in a raving state—I was at the baptism of the child—its name was James King—it lived three weeks and two days.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Newington. On 31st Jan., about ten o'clock in the evening, last witness brought a male child to my house—the face all round the mouth and left cheek was covered with blood—on removing the blood, I discovered several punctured wounds, a slit of the left angle of the mouth, one puncture through the upper lip, another near the line of the nostril, and another near the eye—there was a complete circle round the left cheek, which was very tumefied—there were marks of teeth; inflammation and suppuration followed—I attended the child about three weeks, and then it died—I went out of humanity to see the prisoner—I found her raving mad with puerperal mania—I saw her the same night after seeing the child—she was not capable of hold<lb/>ing conversation—in my judgement, she was decidedly insane, and perfectly unconscious of what she was saying or doing.</p>

               <p>Brixton-hill—Fiddy, the deceased, was the driver—the prisoner was drive of another omnibus—they both started form the City at the same time, a quarter past four, on the 14th of Dec.—we reached Acre-lane, Brixton, about five o'clock—I had to let out a passenger, and then to go up the Effra-road, to the George Canning public-house, thence up Water-lane, into the Brixton-road—while we were at Acre-lane, the prisoner came up with his omnibus, and passed us there—after I let the passenger out, I gave the word, "All right!"—then we drove on, and went to pass the other buss, on the right-hand side—it was fifty yards before us, I should think, and going in the same direction, up the Effra-road—we were going at a good pace, quite fast—I did not notice at what pace the prisoner was going—we got close to his omnibus, which was then in the middle of the road—there was room for us to pass him on the off-side—our driver attempted to do so—the prisoner pulled right across us—he drove us on to the lamp-post—the omni<lb/>bus was in a position to have gone by without touching the lamp-post, if he had not pulled right across us—I saw the deceased thrown off immediately on knocking against the lamp-post, and lying on the ground—he was under the horses—he scrambled out as well as he could—his head and back ap<lb/>peared to be hurt—he was put into another omnibus, and taken home.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk at Dowgate-wharf. On the 14th of Dec. I was on an omnibus going to Brixton—I was on the top of the om<lb/>nibus, in front, with the deceased, who was the driver—when we got to the Effra-road I saw another of the omnibus before us—it stopped to let out a passenger at Acre-lane—the driver of the omnibus I was on attempted to get past the other omnibus—both omnibuses were going fast—the one that I was on struck the lamp-post—I should say that happened on account of the other one crossing—if the other one had not crossed there would have been room for us without going against the lamp-post—in driving down from town they had been going very fast—they appeared to be going against each other, racing.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tea-broker, living at Thornton Heath. On the 14th of last month I was on the prisoner's omnibus, sitting beside him, on his left—I remember getting to the Effra-road—I had noticed another omnibus—the two omnibuses had been running together in opposition, first one took the lead, and then the other—when we got to the Effra-road, and to the lamp<lb/>post, the prisoner's omnibus was in advance—we left the other omnibus about sixty or seventy yards behind, but it made up that distance in a very shore time—I saw him endeavour to pass us—on that prisoner slewed his om<lb/>nibus across the road—he did it gradually, he did not it at once, not di<lb/>rectly viciously—when we got opposite the lamp-post, he had alewed a const<lb/>derable distance across the road—there was not room for another omnibus to pass—that was in consequence of the prisoner's driving across the road—I saw the man thrown off—the prisoner drove on—he did not stop to see what was the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi> When your omnibus came abreast of the lamp<lb/>post, in what position was the omnibus of the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been very near on the path, if not quite—I generally travel by Ball's omnibus—when we were abreast of the lamp-post the other omnibus was very nearly abreast of us, but I could not see the horses' heads without looking back—it was then that the driver of our omnibus was slewing it across</p>

               <p>the road—there was not room for the other them to get past on the other side—he must stopped to have done so, he must have backed his horses and turned right round—when Ford slewed his horses round, they and the horses of the deceased almost touched, and at that moment the collision took place.</p>

                  </hi> I reside in the Dulwich-road, Brixton, and am a hop-merchant. On Monday the 14th of dec., in the afternoon, I was in the omnibus driven by the prisoner—part of the way I was on the step, and part of the way inside—I was inside at the time the accident happened, and saw all of it—the deceased was attempting to pass—I am not aware of what the prisoner did to prevent him—I do not think he did anything.</p>

Q.</hi> On which side of the omnibus were you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi> On the off-side, near the centre, looking through the middle window—at the precise moment the accident happened I was watching Ball's omnibus—it was galloping up after us—I am sure one of the horses was galloping—our driver did nothing that I was conscious of—he did not slew round in the least—I was watching the thing very closely—I stood on the steps part of the way down, and two or three times I thought the pole of Ball's omnibus would come completely on the back of ours—I was compelled to hold on one side—it passed us several times on the road, and the driver appeared to be in a very excited state—we left him at the church, which is only a short distance from where the accident took place—the driver of our omnibus kept in one line, I think, without the slightest deviation; but he was too near the off-side of the road—there was a part of the road recently laid with gravel—there was gravel on both sides fresh laid—the wheels of our omnibus on one side were free from gravel, and on the other side on the edge of it—the right wheel was keeping as close to it as he could without being on it—the right wheel was on the gravel—the gravel was not in the middle of the road—the road there is twenty-five feet wide, and it extended about six or seven feet on each side—our driver was touching on the off-side gravel—that was the wrong side—I could not see the driver—I could only tell by the motion of the omnibus, which I was watching very closely, in consequence of an expectation that there would be an accident arising from the driving of Ball's omnibus—I have frequently ridden by Ford's omnibus before—I always thought him a steady careful, well-conducted person.</p>

                  </hi> I came home about five or six o'clock on the 15th Sept.—about twelve or one o'clock I saw the assault—perman, by the ad<lb/>vice of these two woman, struck Ellis on the head with a deadly weapon of some sort—I never heard such a blow in my life—he struck him on the head two or three blows—the woman where abusing him very much—they called Pearman out, as Stephens stood in a fighting positjon befor Ellis, and when Pearman got out, he ran over and struck Ellis the blows, and one of the women said to Pearman, "Go it, Harry"—I saw him strike very repeatedly, and Ellis felt against the door-post—I called out, "you murderous crew, you have done it at last—you have concocted this—this is the most cold<lb/>blooded murder I ever saw"—I called "Police"—the policeman came and took hold of Ellis—I said, "Take the four person"—he said, "No, I have got charge enough here"—there was a pool of blood under Ellis as large as a tea-saucer, and his head was broken and his arm—I wished the policeman to take charge of the four person, and Mrs. Pickard said, "if anybody at<lb/>tempts to come into my house, policeman or not policeman, I will split his b—y head open"—I head the cramp so bad that I went in-door—the policeman took Ellis to the hospital, and I traced the blood about 300 yards the next morning—Ellis, through being disabled, is now in the poor-house—I have been a deputy corn-meter above thirty years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Ellis walked home the next day, and went before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe they went before the Magistrate there or four thimes—I did not see the beginning of this—I had been in bed—I heard what took place five or six hours befor I came home to tea, the first thing when I got out of bed at night I heard Mrs. Pickard and her sister call Ellis a b—y old rogue and a b—y old b—r—I cannot say where Mrs. Eills was—I did not see her—I did not hear Ellis threaten to beat his wife—I heard him say, "Let my wife come home; I will not ill use her"—I don't know that he ever beat his wife in his life—I live about twenty yards from him—he lives at No. 8, and I live at No. 7, on the opposite side—I have had no quarrel with Mrs. Pickard.</p>
