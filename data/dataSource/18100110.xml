               <p>Q. On the evening of the 23d of December last did the prisoner come to your cottage - A. Yes; about half past five in the evening; it was dark; he knocked at the door and called me by name, and on my opening the door he asked me if I sold potatoes; I told him I had none; he afterwards asked for a drink of water, which I gave him; my wife was broiling some sprats for the children's supper, he said you have got sprats. Boswell; my wife said, would you like to have any, and I joined in the invitation; after some solicitation he came in, and on further solicitation he sat down, while my wife was dressing the sprats; he are about a couple of sprats; he then enquired what was o'clock, I told him I thought it was near six o'clock; he then stood up and made a bow; I thank you for my sprats; he then said I thank you mistress for my sprats, and made another bow; I said they are not worth the thanks; he then stepped up to a young child of mine about two years old, he said, I will give the child a halfpenny; the child, said I, do not need any money, nor does he know the use of it, do not give him any; he turned round to the child to give him a halfpenny, as I thought; his back was towards me; he turned round again and presented a pistol at my face, it was about nine inches from my face; he said your money or your life; what do you mean, said I? - your money or your life, he again repeated; - damn you, said I, where do you think a man like me gets money; I took the chair by the back that Walker had sat on and dashed it full length at him; the pistol flashed.</p>
               <p>COURT. You dashed the chair at him to hit him I suppose - A. Yes; I struck him, and he pointed the pistol at me with his two hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had hit him with the chair was it that the pistol flashed - A. Almost instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the flashing of the pistol was owing to your striking him, or was it any act of him - A. I imagine it was his purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. That you believe, do you - A. Yes; and not with my striking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the chair strike him - A. In his face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was the chair above the pistol - A. Just at the point of the pistol; I hit his face just above it; he seized the chair with his right hand, and immediately flashed another pistol with his left.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he so flashed the pistol with his left hand was it presented to you - A. It was presented at my right eye. I think he dashed or threw the chair at me in the same manner as I did at him; he then struck me with his stick at the back of my head, and made the blood flow; he struck me another blow on the temple and another on the eye; I then collared him with the left hand, I struck him some blows in the face with my right hand, and his stick dropped; I called several times for a stick, my wife and children were in the room; my eldest boy put his stick into my hand, he then strove to wrest the stick from me; the scuffle increased, and he strove to overpower me; he kicked me, and bit my thumb; he got on the bed, I dragged him down, and he fell on my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your wife at last overpower him - A. Yes; I overpowered him; my wife tied his hands behind his back, and I ordered him to be tied to the legs of the bedstead; I put a chair across his breast and some cords round his body and legs and kept him in that all night. Mine is an alone house, about a quarter of a mile from any other house. In the morning I sent my son for assistance; he was conveyed to a justice, and he was taken from there to the office in Hatton Garden, and the pistols were taken to the same office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they, when taken to the office, in the same condition which they were when you took them away from the prisoner - A. They were; I gave them to Mr. Hale in my house, and he took them to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you delivered them to Mr. Hale had you put any shots in them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you gave them to Mr. Hale did you and he examine them to see whether they were loaded - A. I look at them and observed the muzzles full, within about three quarters of an inch of both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he flashed the second pistol, was there any thing but his purpose to occasion that - A. There was nothing. It was then presented to my face.</p>
               <p>COURT. There was nothing could make it go off but his purpose - A. Yes; I am sure it was intended by him, and the first also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever offer to fire a pistol at you - A. Yes, you did, two pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I tell you that I had a partner on the road with a horse - A. You did.</p>

             - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 23d of December last did the prisoner come to your house - A. He did; he asked my husband if any potatoes were to be sold there; he said no; he then asked for a drink of water, which my husband gave him, and said he was sorry he had nothing better to offer him. I was getting my children's supper ready, he said you have some sprats, mistress; I said yes; I asked him if he wished to have any, and that he was very welcome to have them; he said he was very fond of sprats, he had not had any this year; I asked him to sit down, he did; he seemed loth to sit down.</p>
               <p>Q. He required pressing - A. Yes. He sat down at the lower end of the table, I set some sprats before him, he ate a few of them; he said, you need not dress any more, he had more than he should eat; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100004"/>said he would give my child an halfpenny; he stood up; instead of giving the child an halfpenny he drawed out a pistol and turned round upon his heel and presented it at arms length at my husband's face, and said your money or your life; my husband said what do you mean; he said, I mean your money or your life; my husband took the chair that he sat upon and pushed it at him, straight foremost, and said, where should I get money, and instantly the pistol flashed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge at the time it flashed whether it was presented to your husband, or in any other direction - A. It was presented to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the going off of the pistol was occasioned by the shock of the chair, or was it done by the prisoner - A. I believe it was done before the chair reached him; I saw the pistol go off before the chair reached him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the direction of the prisoner's arm before the chair was presented - A. It was presented strait forward at him; I do believe that his arm went straight to his face before the chair was put.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. So that there was no difference in the direction of the arm when the chair was put - A. No difference; it was straight at his face. The prisoner let the pistol drop and seized the chair with his right hand and then flashed another pistol in my husband's face with his left hand; I had the baby at my breast, when I saw him present the pistol I stood up and gave the baby into the hands of another child, to hold; my husband closed in upon him; he struck my husband with the stick on the back of his head; that is the stick that my husband has produced in court. I ran over to my husband that he should not get him down; I thought I would hang on the fellows arm; he saw me coming; he kicked me at the bottom of my back.</p>
               <p>Q. At last he was conquered and secured - A. Yes; I received a blow in my face, on the side of my head, and on my shoulders; I was bruised all over.</p>
               <p>Q. At last he was confined and kept there till the morning - A. Yes; 'till Mr. Hale come.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I offer to pull out any pistol and fire at your husband - A. You did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I tell you that there was a man at the gate with the horse - A. You did.</p>

            . I am a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live near Boswell - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 24th of December were you sent for by his little boy - A. Yes; I went to his house and there I saw the prisoner, his legs were tied together, and his thighs, and a chain round on his body, and several cords. I searched him, I found upon him some gunpowder. The pistols I found in the house, the pistol cases were found out of doors in a bundle; there were two coats and waistcoats. As soon as I brought him out of the house, as he was coming out of the gate, he said let me have my clothes; in that bundle of clothes I saw my man take the cases out; these are the cases, they are woollen cases; and these are the pistols, and here is a pistol screw; they were delivered to me by Mr. Boswell; I examined the pistols at the time they were nearly full; I took them to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see the charges taken out - A. I did; they were both loaded with powder and snot. The pan of that pistol is broken, it could not go off; through the fall or the blow afterwards some injury must have been done to it; it must have flashed first before the fall; the injury seems to have been done by the fall. Here is some gunpowder in this pistol case, and in the great coat pocket there is some loose shot. I conveyed him to the office and he was committed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. When these pistols were produced by Mr. Hale at Hatton Garden office, did you, by the direction of the magistrate, unload them - A. I did. I have the charges here separate.</p>
               <p>Q.How many shots were there in each - A. I did not count them; I suppose there is pretty near an hundred, and about the same in the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. About a common charge was it not - A. Yes, about a common charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never offered to fire any pistols at him. I went to this man's house, I was informed that he wanted to buy pistols; I went there on purpose to ask him; I knocked at the door, they opened it; I went in, they asked me to have a bit of supper; I got one of these pistols out of my pocket to shew him, meaning to ask him to buy it; he took one of the chairs up; I never offered to fire at all, nor held my arms out; this man put the chair and struck at me; I dropped the pistol out of my hands; I took hold of the chair, I said, what do you want by this; he said, d - n you, I will kill you; I struck at him with the chair. I stood in my own defence: his wife ran and locked the door; they swore they would kill me among them, so therefore I hit them again with the stick; he got a fork and swore he would run it through me; then he knocked me down and overpowered me; I only stood in my own defence all the while.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. Hale. When you took hold of the prisoner in the morning did he mention any thing of his being in danger himself - A. No; he said nothing of that; I asked him his name, he told me he did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you nothing of this that he has said now - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury to prosecutor. Which pocket did he take the pistol from - A. I could not tell; he turned his back towards me to give the child a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where he took the second pistol from - A. No; I did not see it till he presented it and flashed it at me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you candles lighted in your shop at the time - A. Yes. There were three of us in the shop at the time; it was not a minute before the chain was taken; I was shewing the gold chain to the young woman at the next door, and I had only walked across the shop when the chain was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you hear, and what happened then, after you put it back again into the shop window. - A. I walked to the shop window, I heard nothing to alarm me; I observed the cotton rumpled, and the chain was gone, and the board on which the broaches lay, was turned over; I looked, and the chain and two broaches were gone; they were of the best gold; they lay close to the chain; and they were close to the glass of the window. The corner of the pane of glass, was cut as if by a diamond, and the piece of glass was taken away, and the hole in the glass was large enough to admit a lady's hand. On the next morning I went to the refiner's, I saw part of the chain.</p>

I missed the handkerchief about six o'clock, after the prisoner was taken between five and six. I was sitting in the parlour with a lady and gentleman, I heard the glass of the shop window break, I and the lady and gentleman went into the shop, I found a pane of glass with the corner broke out. The gentleman went out, and said he would watch. In about a minute the prisoner and another passed by the window; he looked earnestly at the window, and returned back again; he then pushed the remainder of the broken pane of glass in. It was not so dark but I could distinguish him; he put his hand into the window, he was dragging the ribbon out with his hand. I went out and collared him, he resisted, pulled me out in the road, and got from me. I pursued him, and cried out</p>
               <p>"stop thief;" he threw me down in the middle of the road; he was taken and brought back.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100006"/>Q. Was it day-light enough for you to distinguish the prisoner - A. Quite day-light enough for me to distinguish him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES GREVILLE. On the 8th of December I dined with Mrs. Cawthorn: Miss Emery was with me. We heard a noise like breaking of glass; we discovered a square of glass that appeared to be cut designedly, of sufficient length to admit a person's hand. I went out to watch, and stationed myself about twenty yards from the house. I noticed the prisoner pass several times, fixing his eye on the window; the last time I saw him pass he put his arm in the window. I could not see what he had in his hand. Mrs. Cawthorn came out and seized the prisoner by the collar, upon which the prisoner threw her violently down in the road. I pursued the prisoner, and took him in a court in Grub-street, Immediately I pursued the prisoner I was surrounded by four or five others, who tried to extricate him; they cut my coat with a knife in two or three places. I secured him, and brought him back to Mrs. Cawthorn.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutrix.) Was the ribbon and handkerchief ever found - A. Upon my taking hold of him he let the ribbon go, there were about two yards of it hanging out of the window. I never saw the handkerchief again; the value of the handkerchief was seven shillings.</p>

            , and requested that he would cause that note to be laid out at my shop at about a quarter past eleven o'clock that night. About eleven o'clock I took all the notes out of the till, and went up stairs, as is generally my custom. About twelve o'clock, after the shop was shut up, I went down to examine the till; that note was not to be found in the till that I had given to Mr. Bollard. The next morning I said to my young men, that I entertained a suspicion that I was robbed: I had caused a one pound note to be laid out on the evening before, which was not in the till. They all denied any knowledge of it. I told them the note was marked, I had sent it after eleven o'clock, and it would be found on some of them. I sent for an officer. On his proceeding to search, the prisoner stepped forward and said, unfortunately he was the person who had taken the note; and he produced it at the same time. He said, he had took it to make up a payment of a bill of about forty shillings that he owed his washerwoman. He begged hard for forgiveness.</p>

I gave the note to my daughter, and told her to go over to Mr. Sparrows: on the next morning, when I went to Mr. Sparrows, the prisoner produced the note; I took it of him, and saw it was the same which Mr. Sparrow brought to me.</p>

On Tuesday the 12th of December, a lighter came to the wharf, marked M, with one hundred and ninety-nine firkins of butter; It came under my direction as wharfinger, when the porters landed them, I took charge of them; I counted them twice, and found them to be exactly agreeable to the lighter bill, one hundred and ninety-nine. I put my watchman to take care of them, and when they were put in the warehouse, I counted them again, and found there was a deficiency of two, the parcel was two hundred, one was left on board the ship. I missed No. 41 and 94: on the next day, the witness came and asked me if I had lost it.</p>

            . I am beadle of the Portuguese Synagogue. In going through Cutler's-street, Woolpack-alley, on the 12th of December about two o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners, Allen had the load on his shoulder. I heard Ditch say to Allen. go on. I had suspicion that the property did not belong to them; I catched hold of Allen and Ditch, and insisted upon knowing what they had got; Allen replied, dirty butter. I took them to the Compter, by information, I found that Mr. Aylwin was the owner. It was concealed in this bag: Allen said, if I would let him go, he would give me the property.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Allen's Defence. I was coming along Houndsditch, a man asked me to take that bag into Winfield-street, he would give me a shilling; and going along Petticoat-square, this man took hold of me; asked me what I had got; I said a firkin of butter, I put it down, he said, he must take me to the Compter: I said, I am willing to go with you; that is all that passed between us; I never said, I would give him the firkin of butter.</p>
               <p>Ditch's Defence. I know nothing of it; I was going to buy an old pair of shoes for myself; he took hold of me, and said, I must go to the Compter.</p>

On the 7th of December, between six and seven in the evening, I was up stairs at tea, my boy came up stairs to me, for change of half a guinea, he said, he was to take it over to Mr. Jackson, the shoemaker, with a pot of beer; I gave him two new dollars; in the space of two or three minutes, I was called down stairs, my boy said, a man had taken the two dollars from him, he said, he would leave the half guinea at the bar. The prisoner returned into the house again; after he had got the change, and drank some gin along with a woman and a soldier, he was going out, I asked the boy whom he gave the change to, the boy said, that man; I told him he must not go, I should send for a constable, he said, he had no money in his pocket; while the constable was gone for, he took a dollar out of his pocket, he said, is this yours; I said, I believe it is, he said, take it. No, I said, this will not do, I must have another. The constable came, and searched the woman. and found a dollar upon her. The woman had said, she had no such thing upon her. On the woman was found a great quantity of loose halfpence, besides the dollar.</p>

I live with Mr. Shaw; the first time the prisoner came in, he had a man, and a woman along with him: they went in the parlour; he went out, and came in the passage, as far as the last pane of glass of the bar; he called for a pot of beer, to go over to Mr. Jacksons, and change for half a guinea, I asked him if it was Mr. Jackson's the boot-maker, he said, yes, I told the boy to go up stairs to his master, and get ten shillings, the boy came down with two dollars, gave them to me, they were two new dollars, I gave him the two new dollars again, and two old halfpence, and told him to take it over to Mr. Jackson, and he was to bring back half a guinea. In the mean time the boy was gone out, the prisoner came in, and went into the parlour. When the boy came in, he said, that he had given the man the change, and the man was to come in to give me the half guinea, and he gave me no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him. - A. I did, he came out of the parlour, and said, that his wife paid for the gin, he said, that he had ordered no beer at all, nor any change. Then the boy came in, I asked him, he said, that was the man, I told him to stop, I rang the bell for my master, he came down, I told him, that I had sent over a pot of beer, and change for half a guinea to Mr. Jackson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when he ordered the beer, - A. Yes; I was in the bar at the time; I am sure that is the man that ordered the beer to be sent to Mr. Jacksons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him order any change. - A. Yes; I am perfectly sure it is the man, he ordered the beer and change in the passage, at the glass window.</p>
               <p>JAMES ARTHUR. I was down in the cellar doing my work,

             called me up stairs, and told me to get two dollars; I got them, I gave the two dollars to Sarah, she gave them again to me, with a penny with it, and a pot of beer, she told me to go to Mr. Jackson's; the prisoner stopped me crossing the road, he asked me if that was going to Mr. Jackson's; I said, yes, he asked me for the change; I took out the two dollars, and the penny, he took them, he said, he would give the half-guinea at the bar. I took the beer to Mr. Jackson's, they told me, they never ordered any beer, they never drank any. I am sure the prisoner is the same man that stopped me in the road, about two minutes after that, I saw him in the house, he was coming out of the passage door, I said, he was the same man that met me going across the road; he put the two dollars, and the two halfpence into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in the dark, was it not. - A. It was between six and seven o'clock, the candles were lit up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it light enough to see the man. - A. Yes; he had a light waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>- I was a ward officer at that time; I searched the prisoner, and found nothing on him. I understood they had taken a dollar from him. I requested the woman in company with him, to turn out her pockets, she took out a number of halfpence and a dollar. I produce the two dollars, one was given me by Mr. Shaw, and the other I took from the woman.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had no mark on the dollar; they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100008"/>the appearance of new dollars. I cannot swear to them, having no mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I belong to the Tower-Hamlet militia. I had been to Deptford. on my return, I went into the Bull's-head, Leadenhall-street, with my wife and the corporal, on my going out, I was stopped by the landlord, who told me, that there had been a pot of beer ordered to the shoemaker's over the way, and I was the man that ordered it, they sent for a constable, and searched me, my chief witness, the corporal, who was with me, has got a furlough. I questioned the boy when I was going out of the house, he said, I give it to some man, I believe you are the man.</p>
               <p>Arthur. The prisoner asked me if he was the man; I said he was the man that took the money away from me; he asked me if I was sure of it; I said, yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>

On the 21st of December, about four o'clock, the two prisoners were coming out together to get their beer; I saw them; I staid away from the Exchange, in consequence of suspicion, to watch them; they went out of the laboratory, I stopped them in Mr. Maud's premises, and told them I had something to say to them; they followed me; when I got them up stairs, I sent for Cartwright the officer. Mr. Maud was present; he told them he suspected they had robbed the premises; they hung their heads and said nothing. Cartright came; they were searched; he found a piece of saltpetre in each of their hats. Connor said, he was sorry he had done it; and Stephens expressed sorrow; I do not particularly remember what he said.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshal-man of the city. - A. Yes; I was sent for; I went up into the room, the two prisoners were present; I took Stephens's hat out of his hand; I felt his hat very heavy. I said, Mr. Maud, there is something in it; I searched further and took out this salt-petre; and in Connor's hat, which he had put on the table, was this piece of salt-petre; I weighed them, one piece is five pound weight; and the other is five pound and a half. Connor and Stephens begged for mercy; Mr. Maud said, he had lost so much, he could think nothing at all of it. I handcuffed them and took them to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Biggar. What quantity is there of this. - A. About five pound weight in each, worth about ten shillings. Stephens's sole employ was in cutting the salt-petre out of the crystals.</p>
               <p>Connor's Defence. I lived eighteen years with Mr. Maud, and during them eighteen years, he gave me a very good character; I have been away from him, and only lived with him two years this last time. I superintended the laboratory for Mr. Biggar, for twelve years; and I have had the care of some thousand pounds; I behaved as an honest man all the time. I asked my mate to give me a piece of salt-petre, it was to give to a friend. Mr. Biggar knows me, he can give me a good character.</p>
               <p>Stephens said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Conner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Taylor. On the 23d of December, about twelve o'clock, I was in Sun-street about two doors from my master's shop; I saw the prisoner go out of the shop, with the glass. There was not a soul in the shop: I made enquiry of my mistress, whether she had sold the glass; she said, she had not: I ran after the man, and came up to him in Sun-street. I asked him, where he was going with that glass, he told me, that he was going in the fields with it; I desired him to bring the glass back to where he took it from, he said he would not; I said, he should, and collared him with one hand, and took hold of the glass with the other, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming towards his master's house, a man met me that I know perfectly well, but I cannot find him out since, he asked me to take the glass to Mr. Wilkes's house, Moorfield's, and when I received it out of his hands, I had not gone two doors before that gentleman came to me; and as to my being in the shop that day, I was not.</p>

He did not return again that day; I never saw him, until I apprehended him myself on the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time was the horse hired for. - A. For a few hours; to go to Hampstead, he said. I believe he was going to see his brother-in-law, and he wanted the horse for a ride.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you apprehended him. - A. I and another man, a hackney coachman. When I apprehended him, he said, how do you do, I am glad to see you; I said, how do you do, walk over the bridge and we will have something to drink; he said, I would as soon drink with you as any man. We walked over the bridge, I had hold of one arm, and the hackney coachman the other, and when we got over the bridge, he refused going any further; he said, what business had we to lead him that way. The coachman said, I am an officer, I will take you for horse stealing; I said, do not make words here; the prisoner said, show your authority. He could not show any authority; a mob gathered round, I had hold of him; I said, it is of no use your refusing going with me, for go you shall; I insist upon knowing where my horse is.

               <p>Q. What became of the horse after you had brought him back - A. I sent him off a journey about three or four hours afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took hold of him, he went very quietly with you till you pinched his arm holding him fast, then he wanted to see your authority - A. No man behaved more like a gentleman than he did: he is a gentleman all over him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BORADIL. I live at a livery-stable, Grosvenor-place, near Hyde-park-corner. The prisoner came to me on the 13th of November, about twelve o'clock; he asked me to take care of his horse; he brought him to bait at our stables; he went out of the yard, and returned in five minutes, and said, he wished the horse to be cleaned, as he had got two or three gentlemen coming from Tattersall's to look at the horse; he wished me to make haste. I asked him, if he was going to sell the horse? he said, he was. I asked him, where he brought the horse from? he said, Bourn, in Lincolnshire. He said, he rode him all the way up from Bourn, in Lincolnshire; he had no further use for the horse, and he wished to sell him. I asked him, what the horse was used to do, whether it would draw; he said, it had been generally used in the country to carry double. I asked him, if he warranted the horse sound? he said, no, he did not; he did not want to have further trouble with him. I had the horse turned up and down the yard, to see if he was sound. I bought the horse for fourteen guineas. I asked him for his address; he gave me his address,

I sent the horse to Mr. Westall's stables, in the Curtain-road, to be sent down in the country. I delivered the horse up as soon as they claimed the horse. I gave an order to get him from there.</p>

On the 4th of December last, my son had occasion to go in the City on business; he came home and told me, that he had seen a pair of shoes of mine in Mr. Atterbury's window; he is a pawnbroker, in Crown-street, Finsbury-square. I went there and saw eight pair of my shoes. On the 6th, I found two pair at Mr. Wright's, a pawnbroker, in White Cross-street, and two pair at Mr. Williams's, pawnbroker, Barbican. On Tuesday the 4th, I went to the house of the female prisoner, she was at home; there were two young women at home, and I think another of her sons was at home; her husband was not at home. The officer searched her, he took four duplicates out of her pocket, one of which was for a pair of shoes. He afterwards searched the room, and found a quantity of leather, some whole skins and some in pieces. Her other son, who was a shoemaker, was at work in his father's house; he separated his from mine. I found there twelve pair of shoes. The female prisoner said, she was very sorry for what had happened. She fell on her knees and said, what happened I am the cause of this; she asked, if I would forgive her; I told her I did not wish to hurt the hair of her head, but I wished to have my property back again. I told her my daughter had lost a pair of scissars; she gave me the silver part of a pair of scissars. The boy prisoner was at my shop when the officer took the female prisoner; he came to my house. I said to the boy Walter, put on your hat and go with that gentleman: he went with the officer. I never found any thing upon the boy. I had the most unbounded confidence in him, nor do I know of any thing done by him.</p>

            . I am an officer. After I had been to the house of the woman prisoner, and had taken her in custody, I went to Mr. Wood's house; the lad was there, and he gave charge of him to me. In going to the office, I told him his mother was in custody; he asked me for what; I told him, for stealing some shoes: and I shewed him a pair of silver bows belonging to a pair of scissars. I asked him, if he knew any thing about them; he said, he found them in his master's yard. He was very much alarmed when he found his mother was in custody.</p>

On the 2nd of December, I think it was, I went out to spend the evening with a friend; it was on a Friday. I stopped till two or three o'clock on Saturday morning. I had drank rather freely. I was coming home from Dyot-street to Duke-street, St. James's. I had been in Berry-street. I was not at home, I dare say, before five or six o'clock in the morning. I do not recollect any thing that happened. My landlady came up and called me at two o'clock, and enquired if I had lost any thing, because I was tipsey when I came home. I searched and missed my watch. About a fortnight afterwards I was told it was advertized from Bow-street, and that it was at Mr. Wigley's shop. I went to Bow-street, and swore to my watch.</p>
               <p>MR. WIGLEY. I live in Chandois-street. On the 11th of December, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to pledge this watch. I was not in the shop at the time, but my young man came to me. I went into the shop, and asked, what he wanted on the watch; he told me, he wanted three pounds. I asked him, if he knew what the watch was; yes, he said, he knew it was a gold watch. I asked him if he knew any thing further, because it was a repeater; he only said, he knew it was a gold watch, a gentleman had given it him to pledge to pay his rent. I told him, that was something extraordinary. I desired my lad to go for an officer. He asked me whether I meaned to give it him; I said, certainly. I did not; he immediately made off as fast as he could; the officer came; he was pursued and stopped, and taken to Bow-street. At the office he said, he found it on his beat; he is a watchman. On the last examination, the prisoner delivered up the seal to the prosecutor. There was no seal to the watch when he offered to pledge it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going my round at half past three on Saturday morning, I found this watch by the corner of Duke-street; it was laying on the pavement. I kept it in my possession for nine days, to see if I could find an owner for the watch. I carried it always with me on my beat: I heard no enquiries. I happened to go into this pawnbroker's to get the particulars of the watch for the purpose of getting it advertized the next day. I asked the pawnbroker's man to tell me, whether it was gold or not; he said, yes. I said, could I pawn it; he said, yes. I said, for three guineas; he said, yes. The master came in the shop and asked me many questions, and then told me to go away, he would keep the watch. I went out to get an officer. They took me. I was in Clerkenwell four days; and when I went up to the office, there was no owner to this watch: they let me go. I told them where I lived; and when they sent for me, I went to the office.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

             lodge with you, in December last - A. Yes, four days; it was towards the latter end of December. When he went away he left a bag in the room; when he came again, on the 27th, it was missing. I had seen the bag in the room on the 25th. The prisoner and 
               <persName id="t18100110-20-person196">Walker</persName>
             both lodged in one room. The prisoner went away on the morning of the 27th, between seven and eight o'clock, before the family was up. He owed two shillings for a week's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he given you any notice of going away - A. No, I was out on the Wednesday. On the Thursday morning I was informed the bag was gone. I went into the room, and saw the bag was gone. I suspected the prisoner, and went in pursuit of him. I apprehended him about five o'clock, at the Yorkshire Grey, White Lion-street. I found him there; he called me out into the street; he asked me, what I wanted of him; I told him to go in and have a pint of beer, I wanted to have some talk with him concerning the things that were taken out of the room; he said, he should go where he pleased for me, and he went down Queen-street. I followed him, and seeing a public-house open, the Black Horse, I forced him in there by main strength, and sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. At the Black Horse, there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100012"/>a man there that said, the bag was opened in his shop; his name is Newman. I went to Newman's house afterwards, and saw certain things which are now in court.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN. I am an hair-dresser, No. 17, White Lion-street. On the 27th of December, about the middle of the day, the prisoner called at my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with him before - A. Yes, he used my shop the whole of the Summer. He had a bag, which he told me he had just purchased; he said, that the man that he bought it of told him, there were four pair of stockings in it, and he wished to see the contents of it; he then untied the bag, and throwed the contents on the floor; he said, he thought he had not given too much for it. He found four pair of stockings there.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw, of course, what there were in the bag - A. I cannot recollect all the things that were in the bag: there was a black waistcoat, nearly new; two flannel waistcoats, which he observed would suit him, as he always wore sleeves to his waistcoats when he was at work; there was a pair of new braces. He said he was going to Northampton, he would not be troubled with all these things; he put the black waistcoat on, and selected what part he would take with him, and put them in the bag again; and these things he left for me. He called the next morning and said, the chocolate coat which he had on, was at the top of the bag when he brought them. On the evening of the 27th, I happened to be at the Yorkshire Grey public-house, White Lion-street, I there mentioned the circumstance to a neighbour, of the prisoner bringing a bag and emptying it in my shop, and that I conceived he did not come honestly by it, or had bought it of somebody that came dishonestly by it. My neighbour was in the same house that Mr. Sparrow put the prisoner in; he informed Mr. Sparrow of the circumstance. My neighbour and Mr. Sparrow came to me, and desired me to go to Bow-street; I immediately produced the articles and went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up, and went out in the morning, at day-light; I took nothing with me but the clothes that I had on my back; I owed no rent till the Thursday. I was going along the road, about ten o'clock in the day, I lit with a man with a bundle in his hand; he said, he came from Bristol; he asked me to buy it; he said, he wanted some money; I asked him to let me look at them; there was a coat and some stockings, I saw but three waistcoats; I gave him seventeen shillings for them, I thought it was the value of them. I went to this man's house, and let him look at them; I afterwards happened to go into a public-house, where I lost the things; I never made a farthing of them. I left with that gentleman, a tea caddie, three waistcoats, and a pair of old shoes, and what things else I do not know, I told him he was welcome to them.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner. - I knew her about nineteen years back, but I did not know her when she accosted me on the Tuesday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that Tuesday evening that she accosted you. - A. About five weeks ago, I cannot tell the day of the month; it was by the coffee house in Covent Garden; she had something in her lap, what it was I did not know at the time. She asked me if I could recommend her to a lodging; I told her I did not know any. I took her home to where I lodged; when she went home with me, she asked my landlady if she could lend her two shillings, she told her, no; I went and pledged a handkerchief for her that evening for eightpence; I left it at a public-house for her; I got no money, she wanted something to drink. In the morning I pledged the lace for a pound at Mr. Flemmings, in Fetter-lane, and there were three gowns, a petticoat, a shift, and handkerchiefs; she went with me when I pledged them at Mr. Flemmings; I got one pound fourteen shillings upon them. There were two pair of stockings, and two handkerchiefs, I pledged for seven shillings at the same place; and one pair of stockings, and three handkerchiefs, for five shillings, at Turner's, in Brydges-street. I offered her the duplicates with the money; she desired me to put them in my pocket, as she had no pockets to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. These are all the things that you pledged. - A. Yes. She requested me on the Saturday evening, that I would give her the duplicates; she came to where I lodge. I put them on the table, she said she was going to sell them to a woman in Covent Garden; she asked me if I knew a person that would buy them; I told her of Mrs. Beaumont; we went together to Mrs. Beaumont and sold them for thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>MRS. BEAUMONT. Q. Do you know the prisoner at all. - A. I never saw her in my life. I know the last witness,

               <p>Q. Be so good to mention what things there are there. - A. There are three pair of silk stockings, one cotton gown, a muslin gown, two shifts, eight handkerchiefs, a black lace cloak, and a shawl. The black lace cloak cost me eighteen pounds at first, I have had it two years; I cannot say what it is worth now; my shifts cost me sixteen shillings each. The black lace cloak was in my apartment, the handkerchiefs and shawl were in the wash, I know they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated when I took these things. Mrs. Priestly persuaded me to leave my home, and live with her upon the town, and she would take a lodging for her and me: she has got a girl now in the hospital that lived with her. That woman that took me to her place, she took a shawl and brought in some gin and victuals; she pledged all the things herself, and when the money was gone she turned me out. I was in the watch-house two nights. She went to this woman and sold the tickets; she said, if the tickets were found I should be prosecuted.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of your companions at that time. - A. I left them in the house; when I got outside of the house, they laid hold of me, and said, they would lodge me in the watchhouse; I forceably got out of their arms, and stood there about a minute about two yards from the door, to see what they were going to do with me; Britain came up and gave me a blow, knocked me down.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor even when you was knocked down, you did not go into the house to alarm the company of what had happened. - A. No; I went to the Police-office, and got assistance; I went back to the public-house, and found them there; the prisoners were searched, and there was three shillings found between the two.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you remember being asked, how you could make a charge of their stealing a dollar and three shillings, when you had not a shilling in your pocket. - A. Yes; Mr. Adkins knows I had a shilling in my pocket when I went to the office,</p>

               <p>Q. If any body would say that you asked for a shilling to pay for your liquor at that house, that is not true. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was paid to you in the house. - A. A dollar and two shillings, and I had two shillings and five-pence halfpenny before I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. So then, these two men followed you out of the house after they had put the lights out, knocked you down and robbed you, and went into the house again; you have heard of persons having forty pounds reward for a highway robbery. - A. I have heard of officers having forty pounds reward to apprehend thieves; I never heard of persons having forty pounds, that I swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that the person from whom you had the dollar and two shillings, his name was Wood. - A. No.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came down stairs, he was a lodger of mine, he had lodged with me about two months. He asked me for half a pint of beer. My small clothes were lying on the tap-room table; they were those that I had taken off, my apron was lying over them. I delivered the half pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the only person in the room at that present time - A. He was. I had another lodger come down stairs; he brought the half pint of beer back from the prisoner, and desired me to make a pint of it; I made it a pint. They then called for a quartern of gin. I left my breeches on the table in the room during this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and fetch the gin - A. I was in the bar, and they came for the liquor; the bar is on the other side of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them came for it - A. Not the prisoner. The prisoner remained in the tap-room during this time the man came for the gin. After they had drank this, they got up and went out together. My wife went into the tap-room, and found my things laying on the tap-room table, she brought them in the bar to me, and said, how simple I must be to leave my small clothes there; I said, there were no men there but our own lodgers, and a man that worked for Mr. Cotterell. She took my money out of my watch pocket, I immediately missed the check which the Bank of England notes were rolled in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Bank notes had you - A. There were nineteen pounds altogether, with the money and the check. The check was for five pounds ten shillings, drawn by Mr. Hobbs on Manwaring. At that present time I did not miss any Bank of England notes. I was rather flurried. Afterwards I missed a one pound Bank note. My wife said, our lodgess must have taken them, and desired me to run after them. I did run after them, and took them in King's-road. I stopped them, and told them they had been playing the rogue with my pockets, and desired, if they had to return me my money; they denied having any money of mine. The prisoner asked me how much I had lost; I told him, I supposed he knew better than I did: I could not exactly tell. I said, you must go back, and I will have you all three searched. They did come back; and coming down Liquor-pond-street, as I walked after the prisoner, I perceived him breaking paper and dropping it. I catched up a piece of it, and seized his hand, where there was the remains of the check. I then seized him and brought him to my house, and I sent for Mr. Hancock, the officer, to take charge of him. The other men were searched, but nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this check and the one pound note in your pocket before - A. On that morning; before I had undressed myself I had looked at them, and folded them up in this check; that was, when I was first up in the morning. The officer has the two pieces of the check.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. How long had you worn the breeches that morning - A. From six o'clock, I dare say; it was when I first got up.</p>
               <p>Q. You counted your money when you got up - A. I did. There was nobody about the house till these men got up. It could not have gone out of my pocket without it was taken out. I put them in my fob; they were tight breeches.</p>
               <p>Court. What parish is your house in - A. Saint Andrew's.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANCOCK. I was sent for on the morning of the robbery. I went to the house of Mr. Conner; he told me had been robbed; he pointed out three men; I searched the other men, then I searched this man. This note was given to me by Mr. Conner. I took the prisoner off to the New Prison. I asked for the one pound note; he had put it in the other notes, he told me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner delivered to me a one pound note; he said, that was all the money he had got. I put it into my pocket and mixed it with the others. I could not pick it out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a note of one pound - A. Yes, they were all one pound notes but the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your asking him to deliver up the one pound note, he gave you a one pound note - A. He did.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOBBS, Senior. Q. Did you at any time draw a check upon Manwaring and Co. - A. I did, on Saturday last.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning I was in Mr. Conner's house, between seven and eight o'clock I called for a pint of beer. I sat down by the fire, on the stool. The prisoner was on the right hand of the tap-room fire; he removed to the left. On the table there was something with a white cloth or apron over it. When she prisoner removed from the right to the left of the fire I heard something move; I looked of one side.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there on the table - A. I thought it was rolls, it was under a white cloth; what it was I did not know. The prisoner's hand was underneath; I saw it move; I drank part of my beer. I looked over my left shoulder, his hand was very busy for the space of two minutes and upwards. I drank my beer, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where Mr. Conner was at the time - A. He drawed my beer, brought it to me, put it on the stove, and went into the bar again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The note and check I picked up under the tap-room table in the morning after that gentleman was gone out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . Q. Were you sent by Mr. Murray to the East-India Company's warehouse, for this chest 7m100. - A. I was in the yard in Fenchurch-street, when Mr. Murray was there; I went to the box to look for the request paper, it was gone: I went to the Permit office, and found the permit gone.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. Q. What are you. - A. I am a labourer, in the employ of the East-India Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do, by sight. On Thursday the 5th of August, I saw him come in the yard, and go to the exsise-box, he took out a handful of request papers and he selected one of them, the chest was kept in the yard; he went to look for a chest of that number, to match the request note. I went up to him, and said, what do you want, if you want any thing, why do not you speak. My place was to see that every one had his own; I took the paper out of his hand, and looked about to see for the chest; I pointed out, and said, that is the chest that you want.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the paper that you took of his hand - A. It is the paper, the number was 7m100. I returned him the paper after I found the chest for him to go to the Permit office, to get a permit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose porter he was. - A. No; he went to the Permit office, he brought the permit into the yard, he was going to take the chest up; I said, my friend, I have not done with you yet: I took the permit out of his hand, and said, whose porter are you, I understood Mr. Roton's; I entered it in my book Roton, I asked him again, did you say you are Roton's porter, no; he said, Noton. I run my pen through Roton, and interlined it Noton.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have no doubt as to his person. - A. None in the least, that entary was done in his presence; he then took away the chest.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100017"/>Mr. Alley. You are sure the prisoner was the man that came to you. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring you a paper blue or black. - A. The request note was printed in red ink, and wrote in black.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the person who carries it to you, if the note is not a forgery, is the person who has a right to take the tea. - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no pretence to say this note is a forgery. - A. Not in the least, when he produced that note, I had no right to ask any questions, if you had brought it, I should have delivered it to you, for Noton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Leighton. Is that request note filled up with the hand writing of Mr. Murray. - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner there. - A. Yes; he came in the yard, I was at the gate, near Fenchurch-street, by the box; he came up to me going out of the gate, he had a chest of tea, he stooped, and presented me the permit to look; I looked at the chest upon his knot, I thought it was 7m160; the first O had a small stroke came down, which I thought was a 6, I made him pitch it on a post; I looked at the chest again, and was not satisfied, I called Collins, he said, it was the right number; he said, the stroke was not intentionally cut with the hammer, for a mark, it passed for 7m100, I called Mr. White, the Excise officer; he was sufficiently satisfied to let it pass. I think the prisoner said, if it was not the right chest, he would take it back.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Arabin.</p>
               <p>EVERARD DENTON. I keep a public house, next door to Messrs. Nash; my cellar is separated from the next door by a partition. On the 19th of December between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoner came, and said, he wanted two parcels, I told him, I did not know any thing of any parcels, he said, he gave them to my man John; John came in, I asked him if he had received any parcel, he said, no, I called three more, they all denied receiving any parcel; he then said, if you will let me have a candle, I can tell you where they are in the cellar. Daniel, the boy that is here, lit a candle, and went down in the cellar along with the prisoner; the prisoner returned, and they brought up two parcels with them from off the butthead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open these two parcels. - A. No; I said, go to Mr. Nash, the officer went with him. I had been in the cellar, about six or seven o'clock in the morning; and after that I had been in the cellar fining the beer down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any hole cut in the partition of that cellar. - A. None at all, I went down into the cellar again, when Mr. Nash came, I found a hole cut in the partition that was not there in the morning.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your master's house on the 29th. - A. I heard him talking with my young mistress, about some parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he entrusted you with any parcels. - A. No; I am certain of that, I went into the cellar with him, he shewed me where the parcels were; they were upon the head of a butt, close to a hole in the partition, the hole was large enough to admit these parcels to pass through it. I could get through the hole myself. He brought the parcels up himself; I saw them opened when Mr. Nash came, they contained glass, I went down in the cellar again, when Mr. Nash came I perceived a hole cut in the partition that was not there in the morning.</p>

On the 6th of December between six and seven in the evening, I lost the boots; the prisoner Johnson came into the shop, he asked for a pair of leather boot laces, I said to my young man cut him a pair; I was busily employed, and while he was turning his head to get the leather to cut out the boot laces, he turned himself round to me and said have you moved the boots, I said I had not; he said, they were here just this minute, and when I turned my head they were gone; Mr. Walker came in, I said you have not been playing any tricks with these boots have you; I saw the boy Johnson with a ring on his finger, I said who are you; he appeared small but he is above twenty years of age, I said who are you; you litle rascal you are a thief, I said where do you live; he said, in Sun-street, his father was a shoemaker and kept a room; I said that will not do, if your father was a shoemaker you would not come here to buy boot laces, you would know better how to get them. Johnson came in before Clarke, I asked him about the boots; he said, he knew nothing about them, I said Joe you go for an officer; I made the prisoners sit down in the shop. All in a minute the shop door bursted open, in came a great fellow; he said, Johnson come out, I said what do you do here you rascal; I took him by the collar put him out in the street, Johnson came after me I put him back: the prisoner Clark seized me by the collar and another by the left and pulled me right out on the pavement, as soon as I got out at the next door I saw a man standing, I said, Sir, will you be so good to assist me, these are three thieves; he hit me on the temple and Johnson hit me with his hands both sides of my head; I still held the man, the man said d - n your eyes let me go, I said I will never let you go while I have strength; they then said serve the b - r out. They all hit me as hard as they could, one hit me under the ribs, I struck the man on the head, and whether they struck me at the same time I cannot say; however three of us went down in the mud, I jumped up in a moment, I saw Clark go up Camomile-street, the two others ran another away, I said I will run after you if you go to the devil; I overtook Clark against the Coachmakers Arms in Camomile-street. Johnson was taken up on another indictment, I am sure he is the same man he was in the shop some time, he said his name was Johnson. We never found the boots, we made three more to match them.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Archer, I was present at the time that Johnson came in the shop; he said, he wanted a pair of boot laces, and while I was going to get a piece of leather to cut these boot laces, I turned myself round and missed three boots and four pair of pattens. I directly said to master, have you taken these boots away; he denied it, my master suspected the boy of the theft; he told me to fetch an officer, I did; and when I came back, Johnson was gone, and

               <p>MR. BARR. I am a cheesemonger in Bishopgate-street. Mr. Archer gave Clark into my custody, I searched him and took three handkerchiefs from him.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I went into Mr. Archers shop for a pair of boot laces, the young man was going to cut the boot laces he said, master have you taken away the boots from here; he said, no, he said they were here when this lad came in, I said I was sure they were not, they sent for an officer; somebody pulled Mr. Archer out of the shop, Mr. Archer pulled hold of me, I went to the door, there was a great skirmish I walked away.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. I was on the opposite side of the way when this affray happened, and directly I crossed over, I was struck in the neck, I ran away to avoid being struck and Mr. Archer pursued me.</p>

            , she keeps an oil shop, and lives at 74, St. John's-street. On Saturday, the 2nd of December, the prisoner at the bar came to Mrs. Clarke's shop to buy something, I cannot exactly state what articles she asked for, she bought something, I cannot speak to the amount precisely.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she offer to pay for it. - A. She offered a one pound bank of England note, apparently I asked her what name I was to place on it; she replied, she did not know from whom she received it, she had taken it from a new married couple, living some where in the neighbourhood, she did not know their names. She went out of the shop taking the note with her; and returned in perhaps six or seven minutes, gave me the address, which I put on the back of the note, Gerain, New-court, 2d of December, 1809, she gave me that address. I am sure it is my own handwriting, and I am sure the prisoner is the person that offered it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When next did you see the prisoner after having passed the note on the Saturday - A. I think on the Thursday following she came to Mrs. Clarke's shop to take the note that she had paid me on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask for it - A. Yes, Mrs. Clark was in the shop, I was present, I heard her say that she had come for the note and had brought eighteen shillings; I think she gave Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100110-32-person316">Clarke</persName>
             the money that she brought and she hoped Mrs. Clarke would not mind trusting her for the remainder to make up the one pound note, Mrs. Clarke took it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you serve her the things when she first came - A. I did; I do not recollect what it was, it was two or three shillings worth of something.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Q. Did she get back the note - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether since the first time that she came and rendered the note that any enquiries had been made after her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q, Do you know whether she called and paid Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100110-32-person317">Clarke</persName>
             the remainder - A. Yes; she called the same morning and paid the remainder, I saw her give some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100020"/>money; I believe it was two shillings to make up one pound.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENDERSON DOWE. Q. You are book-keeper to Mrs. Clarke, she keeps an oil shop in St. John-street. A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any intelligence that you received from the bank, did you go for the purpose of finding the prisoner. - A. I did; I went on Wednesday the 6th of December, I went to New-court; I afterwards saw the prisoner in the street in the evening; I heard that she was an old woman; she was turning into the place where she lived; I asked her, if her name was Gerain, she told me, yes. I asked her, if she recollected changing a one pound note at Mrs. Clarke's on the Saturday, she replied, she did; I asked her, if she knew who she took the note of; she said, yes; she took it of a gentleman. I asked her, to give me his name; she said, she could not; she said, she would make enquiry, and call the next morning at Mrs. Clarke's; she said, that she knew the gentleman that she took it off, but she, did not know his name; I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that she has never given you the gentleman's name. - A. No; she never has, nor any body else to my knowledge.</p>

Yes; I found the prisoner in the house when I came there, both of them were present; I questioned her, respecting a one pound note, that she passed at Mrs. Clarke's shop; she told me, that she found it near the Horns, public-house as she was crossing St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you confine the enquiry to Mrs. Clarke's note at that time only. - A. To Mrs. Clarke's note only; I asked her what time of the day she found it; she said, it was after dark; I then asked her, if there were any other note with it, she said, no there was not; I asked her, if any person was present and saw her pick it up; she said, there was not, she found it wrapped up in a bit of paper. Foy the officer searched her, he found six or seven seven shilling pieces; I asked her again, where it was she found Mrs. Clarke's note; she then said, she found several; I asked her, how many, she said, she believed there might be five or six; I asked if she had any of them by her; she said, she paid them all away; I asked her to whom she had paid them; she said, to different shops; I asked her then, if she had paid one at Mr. Osborne's shop; she said, she had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at that time about her husband. - A. As to the first note, her husband knowed nothing at all of. I asked him likewise, do you know any thing of these notes: he said, no; I do not, I asked the husband if he knew any thing about Mrs. Clarke's note; he said, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go to Osborne's note. - A. She said, she did pay a note at Osborne's, that was the note that she had found. Then her husband said, my wife is very wrong; she is telling you stories, I gave them to her.</p>

               <p>Court. Speaking both of Clarke's and Osborne's. - A. Clarke's and Osborne's both, I asked him then, where he got them, they were both present; he told me, he found them on his beat, he is a watchman.</p>

            . Q. You are a police officer, belonging to Marlborough-street. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany the last witness to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did; I searched her; I found on her person seven seven shilling pieces, upwards of a pound in silver, in shillings and sixpences; about three and twenty or four and twenty shillings, and nearly two shillings of copper money. She said, she had found the note near the public house, called, the Horns, at St. John-street; she found it at night, there was no other note with it, she said, at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. There was none other with it. - A. There was none other with it. After we had found the change, and Mr. Glover questioned her more, she then said, she found several, there were five or six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. After the conversation had ended between Mr. Glover and her, which has been stated, did you apprehend her. - A I did, and the husband also, and took them to the office in Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took them away, did you secure the room. - A. I did; I locked the door, and took the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was this room situated. - A. There are but three rooms to the house, this was the upper one, the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after the examination had taken place, did you return to the lodgings. - A. I did; leaving the prisoners at Marlborough-street. I searched the lodgings, I saw my brother find some more change, it was in my presence, he found fifteen or sixten dollars put under a pan on the floor covered over with some cloths; in another part of the room under some bricks, we found upwards of a pound in copper money, they were covered over with more things: they were all halfpence, I believe they seemed to have been packed up in five shilling papers, some of them were packed up. I searched up the chimney, after having searched all the other part of the room, there I saw hanging upon a nail up the chimney, a small black parcel, tied up with some twine, on taking it down and opening it, it contained eleven one pound notes, and four two pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these notes in your hand, and see whether these are notes that you found, and which were wrapped up. - A. These are all the notes I found, and these are the papers that they were tied up in.</p>
               <p>Court. When you returned with your brother, did you find the door in the same state which you left it. - A. I did; there appeared no alteration in the room whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100021"/>Mr. Knapp to Mr. Glover. You have told us before that you are an inspector of the bank - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Of course perfectly acquainted with their paper - I am now putting into your hand the one tendered to Mrs. Clarke - Look at that note and see whether it is a genuine bank note, or whether it is forged - A. It is a forged bank note; the whole of it is forged; it is not the paper used by the bank, and the signature is not the signature of persons in the bank; it has not the water mark used at the bank. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q. That one pound note, the one uttered to Mrs. Osborne, is that a genuine one or forgery - A. It is a forgery; it is not the paper of the bank, nor from a plate used in the bank; they appear to be from the same plate, and filled up with the same hand-writing, the same date and the same signature.</p>
               <p>Q. I now put into your hand the eleven one's and the four two's which were found in the chimney, are they all a forgery - A. They are throughout a forgery, they appear to be from the same impression and from one plate, all the one's, and filled up by the same hand, the same kind of figures throughout; the two's are from another plate, and they appear to be filled by the same hands as the one's. They are all a forgery throughout.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in December last, and on what day, go to the lodgings of the prisoner - A. On the 16th of December last, to No. 2, New-court, Peter's-lane, Cow Cross. I searched the lodgings, there I found eleven one pound notes, and four two's, I wrote my name on them; I found them up the chimney, they were wrapped up in a piece of paper, and outside of that a piece of black oilskin; these are the same wrappers; and there I found a quantity of good money of different descriptions, dollars, shillings, sixpences, and halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation did you find them - A. I found fifteen or sixteen dollars under a pan with some old clothes over them; and the halfpence underneath pieces of bricks and broken pans.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the situation of the prisoner at the bar in life - A. He stated himself to be a watchman in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe before you searched these lodgings and found the notes, you had apprehended the prisoner - A.I had; when I apprehended him I locked the door and took the key with me; on my return I opened the door with the same key; the room was apparently in the same situation in which I had left it.</p>
               <p>COURT. This was the room in which the prisoner lodged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the room - A. In the morning I found him and his wife in bed; I found them together when I apprehended them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you found these articles there was nobody but you and the persons that you took with you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What passed when you came there - this was before they were apprehended, on the 16th of December. You found the prisoner and his wife there - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make it known to them for what purpose you had come there - A.I mentioned it to her in the presence of the prisoner; I asked her respecting the note that she paid to Mrs. Clarke; I asked her where she got that note, she told me she found it near the Horns public house, crossing St. John-street; I asked her what time of the day it was when she found it; the husband and wife were both together there the whole time; she told me it was after dark; I asked her if she had any person with her at the time she found it; she said there was not, I asked her how she found it, she said it was wrapped up in a bit of paper; I then asked her if there was any other note with it; she said no, there was not; I then asked the prisoner if he knew of his wife finding the note; he said he knew nothing at all about it; after this Foy was proceeding to search her, he found a number of seven shilling pieces, I did not count them, there appeared to be six or seven upon her; I then questioned her again respecting this note; she then said that she found several notes in the same parcel; I asked her how many, she said, about six. I then asked her if she had any of them by her, she said she paid them all away. I asked her if she paid a note to Mr. Osborne, she said she had. The prisoner then said, my wife is telling you stories, I found them, and I gave the notes to her; he said he found them on his beat. He had before described himself to be a watchman. That is all the conversation I had; they were then taken in custody to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards return with Foy the officer - A. I did, about four hours afterwards, to the same house; I saw the officer lock the door before he went away; when we returned we went up to the same room; I saw the officer unlock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the notes were found in the way which Foy has described - A. I was; I was close to him. I received the notes from the officer, Foy, after he had marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two's, are these part of the notes which were found as he has described in the chimney - A. These are two of the notes, and they are a forgery throughout; they are not the impression from bank plates; they are not the paper used by the bank, nor are they the signatures of persons at the bank, nor the water mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the others and tell me whether they form a part of those found in the chimney; there are two two's, are they from the same plate with the first I handed to you - A. The two's appear to be from the same plate, and filled up by the same hand, and the same figures. The eleven ones appear to be from the same plate, and filled up with the same hand; they are all of them forged. (The note read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say whether he or his wife had passed some of the notes he so found - A. Yes; he said his wife had passed some of the notes he so found, and he had received the change.</p>

Before I went to Scotland I gave this lad twenty-one pounds which I held in my hand a twelve-month or more, he earned it; he gave it me for safety. When I came back I was informed that he was robbed; I was down at Greenwich when the prisoner was taken on Monday last; I saw him in the cage, I knew him immediately; I asked the prisoner for O'Brian's handkerchief, he said he had given him the handkerchief; I accused the prisoner of taking O'Brian's handkerchief and money; Tom was standing behind me looking over my shoulder; he said, George, did I give you the money too? - no, said he, I do not know any thing about the money. After that the constable came and took him from the watchhouse; on the way home I asked him where the handkerchief was now; he said the handkerchief was worn out. He would not own to the money or notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that paid him his wages - A. Yes; if I had been at home I should have paid him his wages, but Tom did it in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. How much wages were due to him - A. I believe six or seven shillings, I cannot be positive. When the prisoner disappeared I was in Scotland.</p>

Yes; there were seven shillings and two pence due to him; he worked all the week; he dealt at the chandler's shop, his bill was sent into the accompting house to be paid; the remainder of his money was seven shillings and two pence.</p>

            . I am a butcher, I live with Mr. Finch in the Minories. On the 9th of January, between one and two in the afternoon, I went into the Grotto, public house, Southampton-buildings, Holborn, I saw the prisoner come in with two men, they had some printed cotton rolled up, they called for a pint of porter; they sat opposite of me and my brother in the same box;

             had a pipe or tobacco, she went to the fire several times to light her pipe, and two men strove to hide the linen with their coats; the two men sat close together, and in the mean time the prisoner went to the fire one of the men put a piece of print under his coat and said he would go. He went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100025"/>Q. Then there were more pieces than one, were there - A. Yes; I do not know how many pieces there were. They each had a piece of print under their coats, and the woman had a piece of print. Mr. Osbourne called me out, he said, he thought they had been thieving, he would call on Mr. Marshall to enquire; in the mean time he was gone, the other man went away. Mr. Osbourne returned, and in about five minutes Mr. Marshall came. I went to fetch Rogers, the constable, and when I came back she tried to make away with the linen; she dropped it between her legs, and shoved it under the bench with her feet.</p>
               <p>MR. OSBOURNE. On Tuesday last I went into the Grotto; the prisoner and two men came in together, they sat down on the bench, and called for something to drink. I saw this piece of print hanging down between the prisoner and one of the men; the two men appeared to be adjusting something up under their coats; they saw me look at them very hard, one of them got up and went out. I beckoned Ross out, told him my suspicion, if he would stop there I would go to Mr. Marshall's to see if he had lost any thing. When I returned, the other man went out, the prisoner was sitting in the same corner, and this piece of print was hanging down under her; she got up, it dropped, and she kicked it under the settle; she was going away, I stopped her; by some means she got out of the door and went up Southampton-buildings. I went after her and brought her back; she had left the printed cotton behind her, I picked it up under the bench; then Mr. Marshall owned it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into this house I had nobody with me. I had no cotton. I called for a glass of gin and a pipe of tobacco. I went out, they brought me back again. I told them I brought nothing in with me. I am a poor woman that works very hard; my husband has been on board a man of war fifteen years.</p>

             helped me to remove to Mr. Iredale's house. Soon after we got into bed she told me, she was going to try something, and she laid the poker and tongs and things across under the bed; this she continued for several nights. She cut out rings, and different things, out of white cloth, which she placed in the fire-place, then she filled a tea-cup with sand and put a sprig of Southernwood in the middle, and cut figures out of paper and placed them round them. She placed the cup on the shelf, it remained all night; she made a cake, and gave me some to eat; she made some broth, put some powder in it, which she gave me to eat, and afterwards told me what she put in it. About the 9th of August, in the evening, as she and I were sitting at the table, a knife was thrown at me from the other part of the room. It was not thrown by her, she was sitting at the table with me. She then told me, the spirit of the man she now is married to threw it, because what I had done I had not done quick enough. I believe it was the same night, being in the dark, she stood by the window, she talked as if she was talking to a person, but I could not see any thing. She cut bread; and cheese, and butter, and different things that were on the table; she held it as if to give to some person, which she said, was the person of the man; and she told me, to look up against the wall, which I did, and I saw the figure of a lamb, about the size of a large cat. After we were in bed, she told me to look at the other part of the room; I looked, and I saw faintly the figure of a man with something white over his shoulders; he was sitting on a chair. She told me, he wanted something out of my box; I asked her, what? She said, <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100026"/>clothes out, and when he came to what he wanted he would claim the same, I took a great many things out of my box being very much frightened; and in the morning I found them all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this box from whence you took them - A. By the side of the bed; I got out of bed to get them out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the side of the room where the spirit was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mrs. Salter - A. She remained in the room and did not go out to my knowledge; Mrs. Salter made a great noise about the same time as if somebody was strangling her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that while you were taking the things out - A. It was both before and after a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you lost this night, let us have the particulars - A. A sprigged muslin gown, and a cotton gown, petticoat, stays, a spencer, I gave her four shillings for them back again; I missed four habit shirts and five caps.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever since seen any of these articles after that night - A. She told me that some of them went down to a Castle in Devonshire; I saw her with some of them on a few days or a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue to lodge with you - A. She continued for eleven weeks; she told me that these apparitions told her that she must wear my clothes or else I should be tortured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to this - A. No; she told me if I said any thing about it I was to be turned into a different shape and be tortured that kept me quiet, I dreaded the consequences; she so deluded me that I believed it was in her power to do every thing she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these all the circumstances that you know of the woman prisoner that was transacted that night. - A. Yes.</p>

             - A. He used to come to my apartments pretending to see me, they were always together, I did not wish him to come but she always asked him, he was there that evening he worked for Mr. Iredale, he was always coming to and fro.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in possession of the things that you lost that night - A. He said that he helped to take my goods away on the 2d of October, he said nothing about my clothes, I do not know any thing that he did at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you saw her wear - A. Handkerchiefs, caps, and stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You seem to have been affected a good deal by a spirit that night - A. I never heard of any such things before, I was very much alarmed.</p>

               <p>Q. He paid his addresses to you, did not he - A. He pretended so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards he married this woman - A. I understand so.</p>

               <p>Q. And part of the things the woman wore and continued with you eleven weeks afterwards; wearing them when she thought fit - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took these people before a magistrate - A. As soon as I found them out about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Court. What was it that induced you to suspect this fraud at first, you went on with her eleven weeks. - A. I did; under the terror of this apparation, when she went away from me she said, she was going down to where my clothes were to be tortured all her life, because she made use of this magic. I was told by several friends that they had seen her in the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you learn that there was no reality in all this magic - A. I found that she was living in a shop; and was not gone to where she told me, I heard where she lived, I applied to Mr. Bly the officer to take her up.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had drank a pint of wine and no more. We went into a house and had a pint of porter together, from the public house called the prisoners bars, we walked to the door of my house then I parted with him. After I had been in the house a few minutes I missed my pocket book, it was in my left hand inner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100027"/>pocket of my coat. On the next day my pocket book was brought to me by a woman, I was not at home; she said, she would deliver it to nobody but me, the next day the husband brought the pocket book to me, I went to Hatton-garden, and had a warrant for the prisoner; on Friday morning, I saw him at a public-house in Somer's-town, he then said, he did not know me nor my family.</p>

            . A few days previous to the 29th of December, I looked out seventy skins for an order, these skins being of a bad colour, I directed them to be brimstoned, to make them of equal colour, pale. On the 29th in the afternoon, I saw them all smooth on a horse. A few hours afterwards, they appeared very much tumbled, and one was thrown into the yard and dirtied; I caused them to be brought in the warehouse, and counted, there was two gone. Our foreman went to Worship-street, and brought Armstrong and Vickrey. They searched, and found this skin in the prisoner's breeches, and the other skin was found in the workshop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that the person charged at the bar by you was the person appointed to point out Hollincrest to the bailiff. - A. No; upon my oath, I never heard it, if it had been so, he had no business to take my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hollincrest leave the magistrates the same time as you did. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go off home, in a boat or by land. - A. He came which way he pleased.</p>
               <p>Court Give an answer. - A. He went in a boat, to avoid the bailiff.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me this moment, when I desired the short hand writer to take down your answer to my question, that you never heard of it. - A. I knew it last August.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man against whom the writ was. A. Hollincrest, my lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the man at the bar, say at the time you charged him coming to rob you; I came to point out Hollingcrest, and not to rob you of a pair of shoes. - A. I declare he never mentioned a word of a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am talking about a writ; which part of the shop was Hollincrest concealed and Thompson. - A. Almost the further part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And about three hours, the men had been lurking about your door. - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Court. They gave you plenty of notice to be three hours about your shop. - A. Twenty pound would not excuse what I lost last year.</p>
               <p>Court. You know that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not Hollincrest tell you, that he came to your house to be protected from the bailiff. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lodged with you. - A. He came in December some time.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a writ out against him ever since the month of August, and it is not till December, the honest creditor is able to find him out. Who took the shoes from the prisoner. - A. He dropped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that you were sorry he did not carry the shoes away. - A. I did; because if he had taken the shoes away, I thought it would be the worser for him; I have been so much robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. When men harp upon that, I always suspect them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In the month of December, the prisoner ordered a pair of shoes of you. - A. He came to me on the Wednesday, as I was robbed on the Saturday; he said, will you make me a pair of shoes; I said, I would, he said, what will be the price; I said, half a guinea; I was to get them done by Saturday night; as he passed on the Friday night, he said, will you be sure to make my shoes again to-morrow night.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you knew him perfectly well. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not you know the reason of his going backwards and forwards before your shop, was for the purpose of ascertaining whether that man was in your house. - A. I declare to God, I did not.</p>

On the 7th of December, between the hours of nine and ten, I and Mr. Durham were a few peces from the gate, I met the prisoner with an empty bushel measure, and a pass, he presented the pass when he came to the gate; I asked him whether he had any thing in the bushel measure; he said, no; I told him I must see; I laid hold of the measure, and underneath his smock frock, I saw this cake of copper, that was in the London Dock, Mr. Durham took the bushel measure; I took the copper from him, and took it to my box; the prisoner ran away, he was pursued and brought back. I produce the copper.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD MACDONALD. Q. Do you know of any copper being within the London Docks. - A. There is plenty, some of the same marks, and some of the same quality: it lies on the west side of the dock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the jury, I have never been before a court of justice before The copper taken from me, I had no intention of stealing the same being given to me by a person in the dock, alledging, he wanted it for a sample, unconscious that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100030"/>I was doing wrong; I acceeded to his wish when I came to the gate, although I had a pass I was stopped with the property, I informed them I was not carrying it for myself, I was carrying it for another person coming out of the Dock before me, who on my apprehension absconded. I was advised to run away, I therefore beg my crime may be considered to arise from ignorance.</p>
               <p>Q. to Durham. Did the prisoner say to you that he was employed to carry this out - A. He did not to me, he did before the Justice.</p>

She went and returned to me, and said, the young man and she could not agree for the price of the article she was looking at. She went back in the shop again, and the other women were going away. I looked over the handkerchiefs, and missed a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. The other women were dealing with you for the handkerchiefs - A. Yes; I charged them with having them. The prisoner was in the further part of the shop; she came towards them, and let the handkerchiefs drop from her person: I saw it drop on the floor; the other women were not nigh by a yard or two. I picked up the piece of handkerchiefs. I asked her how she came to take the handkerchiefs; she said, she did not. I told her, I saw her drop them. I said, I would take her to Marlborough-street; she said, she hoped I would not, she would give me the price of the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not see her take them - A. She took some of the handkerchiefs up to look at, that is all I saw.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop to buy some calimanco, he had only two pieces to shew me, at fifteen-pence a yard. I told him, I could only afford to pay a shilling a yard. The gentleman told me to stop, he had plenty. I stopped a minute, he took the pieces of silk handkerchiefs off the counter; he said, he had lost a piece of silk handkerchiefs between the three. I stood still: whether the handkerchiefs fell from the women, I do not know; the gentlemen said, they fell from me.</p>

On the 22nd of December, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in my shop, she was looking at some purple ribbon; and suspecting, from her appearance, that she was a shop-lifter, I asked her, what she wanted; she replied, some ribbon to match the pattern he shewed me; I answered, that it was impossible to match that colour by candle light. She selected a piece, and had a yard and a half cut off, which she paid for, and went out of the shop. I instantly went out of doors, and got sight of her. At Rupert-street I pushed her into Mr. Pitts shop an hosier's, I said, to her in Mr. Pitts shop, you have robbed me, and sent for a constable; and before the constable came, half a piece of ribbon dropped from underneath her, I said, to her, what is that, she said, I do not know sir; it does not belong to me, I took it up, it had my private mark on it; she said, she had kicked it along the street, I observed it was impossible, it was a very dirty night, and the ribbon was clean.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in July lose a lamp - A. I am not certain of the time, I believe it was in July, 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your lamp - A. In the passage within the house; the porter told me it was stolen, I looked and saw it was gone. About a fortnight afterwards, I was coming through Old Round Court in the Strand, I saw my lamp on a table in a broker's shop; I went into the shop, told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18100110-51-person466">Bradley</persName>
             the broker, it was my lamp; he described the man he bought it of, he said, he gave two shillings for it. I gave him the two shillings for it, and took the lamp home, and I never heard any more of it till yesterday was a week. The broker came to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADLEY. To the best of my recollection, it is about eighteen or twenty months since the prisoner came to my shop with this lamp; I bought it of him for two shillings and sixpence, it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Harrison, he desired me to point out the man; I told him I would, if the man ever came again. Accordingly, last Friday but one, the prisoner brought two sugar glasses, I got information from him where he was to be heard off, I let Mr. Harrison know, I have no doubt about the identity of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the House of Correction at the time this lamp was taken away.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AMES. I am principal assistant to Mr. Ayres, at the House of Correction, Cold-bath Fields. The prisoner was sentenced from this court in June, 1808, for six months, he continued till the 31st. of December. I believe the books of Mr. Newman will prove that he was in custody on the 31st. of May.</p>

Skinn affected great surprise and sorrow upon the occasion; Vickrey observed that he supposed that he would have no objection to a search, we searched, and could find nothing, except two pieces of paper, in which copper had been tied up by its appearance, however, these were things that we could not swear to. My partner and I agreed that if Skinn would come up to the magistrate at twelve o'clock the next day, we would not take him up that night. The officer asked him how he spent his time on the Sunday night, he said, he was with some friends, playing at dominoes at the Ivey house, till three o'clock in the morning; Vickrey then said, he should make a point of going there, and enquiring if any such person had been; nothing else passed at that time. I had not been home above ten minutes, before a person came that lodged in Skin's house, told me, they were packing up their things, and going off. Immediately I ran, and in my way I got a watchman, and when I got to Skinn's house, I found Skinn was gone; I saw a bundle tied up in the shop; I then enquired if his wife was there, I saw his wife, I gave her in charge of the watchman. I saw a little girl that had been calling out to Skinn's wife, he took hold of her.</p>

I asked Skinn, what was his reason for running away, and not coming down to Worship-street according to his promise, he observed, that as his wife had been taken, he was unhappy, and protested his innocence: upon which we took him before the magistrate in Worship-street, he was then examined.</p>

I then stopped him short, and told him, that any thing he then should say would be afterwards produced against him on his trial.

Gilbert and Mobsbey's, to examine the premises, to see if any body was about, which took them half an hour; that they went back and joined the other three, in the City-road; they all returned into Chiswell-street, and walked about, backwards and forwards, in the neighbourhood till the watch had gone twelve, and then Gould forced open the trap-door of Mr. Gilbert's cellar; they then staid till the watch went one, the informant Skinn and Gould went into Mr. Gilbert's cellar, struck a light and lighted the dark lanthorn; he went to the partition between the two cellars and broke into Mrs. Stafford's cellar, forced open a door at the head of the stairs which opened into Mrs. Stafford's passage, and then drew back the bolts of the street-door, took the alarm bell down, and laid it on the stairs, in order to escape if any alarm was given; they took down the partition of the passage, Gould went into the shop and into the accompting-house, and broke open the furthermost desk on the left hand side; the other two desks being open, they searched the desks but found nothing, except a little wooden box, which contained two small bits of coin, two small keys, a silver quizzing glass, a silver tobacco stopper, an old watch chain, a tassel or bullion of an epaulet, which Gould put into his left hand jacket pocket; the informant and Gould then broke open a cupboard, and took out five pound ten shillings in copper money, wrapped up in brown paper; a tin box with fifteen or sixteen one pound bank notes, a seven shilling piece, and some silver, a bankers check, and a pawnbrokers ticket. After they got these things, which was about two o'clock in the morning, they went out at the street door, the door stuck a little; they

             the bottom bolt which was not quite drawn out. Jones, who was on the outside, pushed the door open, the two others were waiting for them on the other side of the way, at the corner of Grub-street. Jones took them to a house in a narrow street, which runs into Petticoat-lane; they went into the house and divided the money between them; they had each of them four guineas, and ten shillings in copper, which was left; Jones gave to the women all the papers in the pocket-book, and in the box which kept the money, were burnt in the informants presence.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100033"/>Brown took the wooden box, and wrenched it to pieces, one of the women took the pieces into her lap. They then all went into Whitechapel, where Jones took the tin box, which contained the money, and laid it down in the kennel.</p>
               <p>The informant further saith, that he and Jones went to the City of Chester, public-house in Bunhill-row, a man came in named Jack, and to him the informant sold the two pieces of foreign coin, the watch chain, the tobacco stopper, the quizzing-glass, and two small keys, for three and sixpence; the man borrowed the three and sixpence of the landlady to pay this informant.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer belonging to Worship-street. - A. I am: on the first of this month, I received information that Mr. Gilbert's warehouse had been broken open; I went there about half after two o'clock on the same day. I saw Mr. Mobsbey, one of the partners, he led me to a place where he supposed the entry was made, but I soon discovered it was not made that way; I then went down in the cellar of their house, I discovered, that part of the partition to another cellar had been taken down, by which they could get through there, I went through that place, and found a flight of stairs which led up to the passage of the same house, only it is separated by the passage; at the top of these stairs, I discovered a pannel had been taken out, which parts the cellar stairs from Mr. Gilbert's shop, that was likewise big enough for me to go through, the door on the top of these stairs likewise had been forced open, it had been fastened with a large brass button, that button had been forced out of its place, and fell on the ground, the hole in the partition went into Mr. Mobsbey's shop. I went back the same way I came up, not being satisfied how the entery was made; I went into Mr. Mobsbey's cellar; I saw that there was a way down into the cellar from the street; I examined it, I found by putting a small instrument in, they might raise the cellar flap; I had no doubt the entery was made that way, there were no fastening to it; and from the nature of going from one cellar to another, I was satisfied that it was somebody that was, or had been about the premises. I went into the accompting-house, I discovered a desk had been broken open by an iron crow; the marks were there, I then went to the cupboard, where I was informed the money box was kept, I could see that was opened by an instrument, the same as the other, but not with so much force. I then left the place, desiring Mr. Mobsbey to make enquiry where Skinn could be found. I went on the Wednesday evening to Skinn's lodging, Mr. Gilbert makes a mistake in saying Tuesday, I went there on the Wednesday evening, I think between seven and eight o'clock, we waited a considerable time in the street before he came home; we watched him into his house, and went up stairs soon after him, we went into Skinn's room on the second floor, he and his wife were both in the room, I told him that Mr. Gilbert's house had been robbed, and there was some reason to think he knew something about it. I have heard Mr. Gilbert's account; it is quite correct as to that part; I left the prisoner, with his own promise to come to the magistrate on the next day, and told him I should make some enquiries where he was on the night the robbery was committed; I then with the other people, left the prisoner's room, it was half after eleven o'clock at night. On the next morning, I went to the Ivey-house in Goswell-street: I returned to the office, I found Skinn's wife in custody; this was on Thursday, Skinn was not then in custody. I waited at the office expecting that Skinn would come, he did not come; I learned where a relation of his lived, I went there, and at last I got to Type-street, at seven o'clock in the evening; I went into the house I received information he was there, but I did not see him. There were two old women there, there was a room at the back of this place, I went into that room, and there I saw the prisoner standing; I asked him why he did not come down to the magistrate according to his promise, he said, that he knew he told us an untruth; that he was out all that night with some girls and did not wish his wife to know it; I then brought him to the magistrate; it was after the prisoner Skinn made the confession that Brown was apprehended, Armstrong apprehended him. I apprehended Jones on the Saturday night following, in New Gravel-lane, Ratcliffe Highway, when he was brought to the office, he begged of me to get him an interview with the magistrate.</p>

It was very dark I cannot tell what hour it was, I was awoke out of my sleep by my deceased mother, my mother was very bad, she was sitting up in bed, we had a rushlight burning, she was awake, I was awoke by her, she informed me that somebody was tapping at the window, I had no clothes on; I went down stairs, Jones spoke to me, I knew him before, but none of the others, I let him in, and as soon as I saw the others I ran up stairs and got into bed before any of them got into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a table in the room - A. Yes; I put the rushlight on the table just before I got into bed.</p>
               <p>Q, When they came into the room what did they do - A. They all stood round the table, I could not see much it was only a rushlight, they enclosed the table; I heard the sound of money on the table, I heard one of them say, what shall we do with it, another said, throw it down the privy; and another swore a great oath that it should not be left in that quarter. Some of them were pulling some halfpence out of their pockets, one of the papers broke and part of the halfpence flew about the room, they left the remainder of the halfpence that were broke on the table, and one of the papers they put into the bed. In the morning I counted them, there wanted a few halfpence of ten shillings worth of halfpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you left them in order when you went to bed - A. Yes; and I had left her in possession of these articles when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Then all these things to the amount of twenty seven pounds fourpence halfpenny were gone - A. Yes; the prisoner never returned again. As soon as I missed her I went to the Thames police.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that you saw the prisoner - A, Not till the 20th of December. I did not find her myself, the person that recommended her to me gave information; I did not see her till she was in custody.</p>

No; I have only a frock of one of my children that was made out of the same piece, it was not a bonnet when she took it away; I cannot swear to the bonnet, I firmly believe it to be mine but cannot swear to it having no mark on it; nothing but the bonnet is here.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police. I went to Mr. Hains premises immediately after he had given information, to see if there had been any violence used, there was no appearance of violence whatever on the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the shop must have been plundered by some person in the inside - A. It appeared so to me. On the 20th of December, from information, I found the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, she had just taken lodgings, I asked her if her name was not Maria Fuller, she told me her name was Maria but said nothing as to the surname; I asked her if she knew Mr. Hains, I described his residence and business, she denied all knowledge of him and Anchor and Hope-alley. I was confident by the description that see was Mr. Hains's servant, I took her in custody, I told her for robbing Mr. Hains, I searched her but found nothing relevant to this case but a bonnet, she had a bundle of wet linen but nothing to apply to this charge except the bonnet; I took her before the magistrate. In the office without any promise or threat, she told me that she had given the trinkets away, she had been to Exeter and from there she came to Titchfield in Hampshire where she had disposed of the other articles in question to whom she did not say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have no friend in the world. I am blamed innocently in what my master is laying me in blame of; and in regard of the ear rings you could not find a gold ear ring in his shop if you were to search it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. It is with extreme concern I now appear before you, it is the first time in my life; I have only to offer in extenuation of my conduct, I have been confined three months with sickness, during which time I was obliged to make away with all my tools. I beg my offence may be considered to arise from necessity, and not from depravity, and should I be considered an object to experience the lenity of the court, the most grateful sensations of heart will be ever acknowledged, by your most penitent servant.</p>

At about eleven o'clock at night I went up into my workshop, I then missed a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the watch there before - A At a quarter past eight I had the watch in my hand, I placed it on a small scale board at the back of my lathe, where I work; my suspicion fell on the prisoner; I went to put my great coat on, which I had left in the passage, to go to where he told me he lodged. No. 15, Little Britain, my great coat was gone; I went to where he told me he lodged, there was no such person lived there. On Sunday morning I found him in Angel-court in Grub-street, I sent for an officer and he was apprehended. When the prisoner was apprehended, he then said a man of the name of Worthy had the watch, he gave it him; and the great coat was pawned in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the watch since - A. No; I have found the case, but not the watch. The case and the coat were pawned at Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK PRIDDEN. I live with Mr. Barker in Houndsditch. On the 6th of January last the prisoner pledged this coat with me for seven shillings; and he left a watch key with me to put a pin in the joint. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

             I am an officer On Monday last I went with the prosecutor to Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch, I received this watch case; the pawnbroker put his mark on it before he gave it me; I asked the pawnbroker about the coat; he said the person that pledged the coat, left a case to have a pin put in.</p>

            , a paper stainer in Chiswell-street, his manufactory is in Coleman-street, Bunhill-row. On Saturday the 23rd of December I received two one pound notes of my master, I was to pay myself and another of the servants; I went home to my mother directly in Shoreditch, my father keeps a shoe shop; I asked my mother to give me change, she said she could give me change for one; I wrote my master's name on both the notes; I gave the other note to my sister to get changed, and as she was going out for that purpose she was met by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner - A. I believe the prisoner to be the man; the shop was dark, I do not speak with certainty; she met this man just by the doorway; the prisoner said he wanted to buy a pair of shoes; my sister turned back to serve, the prisoner followed her behind the counter; he was in the shop for near ten minutes, he then went out; my sister said she had lost the note and she thought the prisoner had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner buy any thing - A. I believe not. I ran out of the shop, I could not see him; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the one pound note ever been found since - I saw it in Mrs. North's hands in Holywell-lane, about an hour and a half afterwards. Before the prisoner went out of the shop a little girl came in, she informed me where he lived, I went there and waited at a small distance till he came home; I saw the prisoner come to that door, I went in the house about a minute after him; my sister was in the house, she and I taxed him with taking the note; he said he did not know what we were talking about; I told him I saw him in my father's shop, but did not go behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that true - A. No; I saw him behind the counter; I told him he had taken the note from the window behind the counter, he denied it; I sent for Mr. Armstrong the officer and gave charge of him, he was taken to the watchhouse; Mr. Armstrong and I went with a pair of shoes that the prisoner had bought somewhere, he would not tell where; we found he had bought the shoes of Mrs. North in Holywell-lane; on our taking the shoes Mrs. North produced the one pound note; I knew it again, it had my master's name in my own hand writing; Mr. Armstrong has kept the note ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive from your brother on the 23d of December a one pound bank note - A. Yes; I was going to get it changed; the prisoner met me at the door way, he said he wanted a pair of shoes; I turned back; I had the one pound note in my hand, and as I was going round the counter I laid the note in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the window behind the counter - A. Yes; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100039"/>prisoner followed me directly and passed the window where the note was put down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner buy any shoes - A. No; he was about ten minutes behind the counter looking at the shoes to see if any would suit him; as he was turning to go I cast my eyes in the window, I said that man has taken the note. The prisoner was only at the door, he must have heard me, I halloaed it out, my mother and all heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop - A. No. Just as the prisoner was going out a little girl was coming in; she met him, she told him where he lived; my brother and I went to where the prisoner lived in Crossby's-buildings, Curtain-road; I went into the house to wait for his coming home, my brother and brother in law were waiting out of doors a little way off; when the prisoner came in my brother followed him and taxed him about the note, he replied, nonsense, don't talk to me about any such thing; he denied having possession of the note; my brother sent for Mr. Armstrong, he was taken in custody. I saw the note at the watchhouse; Mr. Armstrong brought it and I knew it again.</p>

The prisoner has been in my service sixteen years; I have been in the habit of losing my articles for some time; I may say some hundreds, and I knew of these things going; I placed a servant below to watch him, as he had the range of all my premises; I marked several potatoes, parsnips, and onions, I kept them below in an hamper; the servant that watched him gave me information; I then called the prisoner into the accompting house, I desired him to take out what he had got in his pockets, and put it on the desk; he said he had got nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him - A. No; he took out a parsnip marked R, and two onions marked R, that is the mark I had put on them; he then took out eleven pieces of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they fire wood - A. Yes; he said he had bought the onions and the parsnips in Clare-market; I told him he had brought them from below.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this all that was found upon him - A. I did not search him, he took them out himself; he came at seven o'clock, his business was to light the fires below. This was all that was found on him. I saw the wood, the onions and parsnip all safe at eleven o'clock the night before; the pieces of wood are worth about a penny. The other articles were taken at some other time.</p>

We then went up and searched her box, there was a pair of nut crackers, a silver salt spoon, a snuff box two mould candles, and the key of my drawer, in which I keep my copper money, and a pocket handkerchief of mine. We enquired generally through the house about the key of the copper drawer, and she must have heard of it. She said the candles she put in the chest, having found them in the cupboard in her room, for fear if her mistress saw them might think she had done something improper with them. We found more than five shillings worth of halfpence in her box; the key was in her box. She was then taken in custody.</p>

The candles I acknowledge putting them in my box, but I did not know how they came in the cupboard, but seeing them there I put them in my box, for fear my mistress should think it was my doings. The key that my master alludes to, of the copper drawer, is in a room that is never left alone; if master or mistress goes out of it they always turn the key of the door, which my master will say as well as myself.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH ROTHERY. I am son to the last witness. On Friday the 29th of December the prisoner came in for an ounce of tea, as I was taking down the cannister I saw him take the paper of starch from off the window and run out, I ran after him and halloaed out, stop thief; he was stopped; I picked up the starch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. Somebody threw him down. When I came up to him I found him down and the starch fell on the ground; I took up the starch and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON LOT. I am a baker. On Friday the 29th of December I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran to the door, I saw a porter trip the prisoner up, he fell with the paper of starch under him; young Rothery picked the paper of starch up; I secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I never had the paper of starch. I was running along, I heard somebody call out, I turned round to see and somebody knocked me down directly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she a servant in the house - A. No; she said the room was her own. I met her in a public house, I went home with her and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in bed before you lost the things - A. After I had been in bed a few minutes she got out of bed and made her escape out of the room, my money was in my tobacco box, she took that with her; it was about twenty-five shillings more or less. I heard money rattle in the box as she went out of the door; I missed the breeches that I had pulled off, two old handkerchiefs, and my gaiters; there were three dollars among the money. A few minutes after she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100043"/>was gone this man came up and asked me what business I had there, the room was his, he swore I should not be there; he pulled me out of bed; I begged of him to let me stay, for I was robbed; with a deal of persuasion he let me stop. The next morning before day light he wanted me to get up, for there I should be no longer; he pulled me out of bed, opened the window, and swore I should go out one way or the other; he pulled me out of the room and hurled my clothes after me; I put my clothes on and went into the street; I went to the police office, they told me to come down at night; I did, and they had taken the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things - A. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the woman before, had you - A. No; not till I saw her in the public house; I took notice of the woman; I am sure it is her, and I am sure as to the man.</p>
