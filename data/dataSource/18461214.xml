I know a man named Rose, and had a transaction, with him re<lb/>specting a horse, about a week before the present transaction—on the 6th of Oct. he called on me, and said he knew of a horse for a sale in the hands of a publican in Oxford-street; that the gentleman was in em<lb/>barrassed circumstances, in a lock-up house; that it was to be sold, as Mr. Brown had advanced 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and was to receive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the interest of the money—he said the horse was worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accompanied him in a chaise of his, to Brown's, the Three Tons. public-house, Oxford-street—he called at the door, and went round—Mr. Brown met. us at his back door, and ordered his man to bring out a horse, which was pro<lb/>duced, and trotted up and down the mews—Rose said it was as fine an animal as he had seen for many a day; and, provided he had the moneym he would pur<lb/>chase it himelf—I think Brown heard that—we were all together—I did not agree to buy it then—Rose took me home—he called repeatedly afterwards, and said, "Delays, are dangerous"—that was the second time we met—I said I could not think of buying a horse of a gentleman in difficulties, as I should not be safe; I should like to see the gentleman—Brown sad his servant was there very frequently; he would see if he was there now, but he was not—I told Brown I could not think of buying it until he made it his own—on the 19th of Oct. Rose called again, and said Mr. Brown had a letter from the gentleman; he had made the horse his own, and they had come to an under<lb/>standing to that effect—in consequence of that, I accompanied Rose to Brown's, and saw him, had some conversation with him, and he handed me over this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Portugal-street. Oct. 9, 1846. Sir,—In answer to yours last evening, the proposition you make respecting the business be<lb/>tween</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184612140006"/>
               <p>us, the money you advanced on my horse, which is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with expenses going on. I gave 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him in May last; but under circumstances I now stand in, if you will make it up now 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am sure he will fetch 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When sold, as he is one of the best horses that can be drove, as I have drove him twelve miles within the hour often, which you can recommend him to any<lb/>body. If you like to comply with this proposition, you shall take the horse for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with an understanding by allowing me half what he fetches above 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the expenses deducted. Your obedient servant, G. A. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. To Mr. John Brown, 429, Oxford-street."—On reading that I agreed to purchase the horse—I had agreed to buy two pairs of wheels—Brown put in the wheels and horse at forty-five guineas—the horse was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left a deposit of two sovereigns—Brown wrote this receipt for that on the back of the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I paid the remainder on the 21st—the horse was taken to my yard by Mr. Brown's pot-boy—they would not allow anybody else to take it there—I came home about an hour after, and it stood in the stall with other horses—next day I took him out to have a little exereise, and found him a rank roarer, and very much broken-winded—I went to Brown's in the afternoon, and found him and Rose there—I told Brown the fault of the horse, being such a bad roarer—he said, "I will come down and at you to-morrow"—we stopped there some time—Brown came down next day and when the horse was rode up and down, he said, "I never heard such a roarer in my life"—he said he would call next day, and arrange matters with me, and not to do anything until he called; but he never called at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an egg salesman, and live in Woodbridge-street, Clerkenwell.

I followed three persons to Charterhouse-square—while there I saw a wagon belonging to Chaplin and Home, driven by the prisoner—I had seen him before—I saw only one wagon there, and a green cart with a very poor bay horse—there were three persons in the cart—I saw the prisoner stoop, and remove a bale from the wagon—he put it over the tail-board into the cart, and the three persons drove off with the cart—one drove, the other two sat down—they drove down Charterhouse-lane into St. John-street—this was about five o'clock, as near as I can guess—it was dusk—the lamps were lighted—there was a lamp about two yards further on from head of the horse that was in the wagon—I spoke to a policeman—I asked him for a constable of the name of Storey—he raid he could not tell me where he was, he believed he was at the Sessions—I found Storey on the Thursday, and told him.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Shirtliff, a chemist in Chiswell-street—on the 24th of Nov. the prisoner came to our shop, I think about five or half-past five o'clock—he delivered two hampers and gave a book to be signed—it was signed in my presence by Mr. Shirtliff, and, to the best of my recollection it was handed to the prisoner—I noticed he left it on the counter, and I said, "Hoy" at the top of my voice—he was then four or five yards from me—Mr. Shirtliff had called him previously, but not in a loud voice—I shouted out once—no man with the sense of hearing could have failed to hear me—I had heard him talking to Mr. Shirtliff—he appeared to hear very well then—he took no notice of my shouting—the boy afterwards returned for the book.</p>

On Monday night, the 7th of Dec, the prisoner came to me—I am quite certain it was him—I did not know him before—he said he was going to Liverpool, and asked me to let him leave a few things there—I said I had no objection—he bad a jacket on over his other things—he pulled the things produced off in the shop, and left them with me—I delivered them to the officer.</p>

I was in Sandy's-row, Petticoat-lane—I knew the prisoner—he kept a shop there—I passed by his shop about the middle of the day, and went in to see if he had anything to sell that would suit me—I saw him, and think I asked him the question—he said, "I think I have got' some things that will suit you"—he showed me a lot of plated goods—they were new goods, and were in the manufacturer's papers—there were some of the manufacturer's marks on the papers—there were sixteen pairs of plated candlesticks, two of them were odd; two pairs of plated liquor-frames, four plated cruet-stands, one soy-frame, a basket, four pairs of bottle-stands, one egg-frame, five snuffers-trays and snuffers, four nut-crackers, three metal tea-pots, two plated tea-pots, two or three dozen spoons, and six toast-racks, all new; at least they had never been used—after some time, I gave him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and some goods, making together 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within a few shillings—the articles produced are them—next day I disposed of some of them to Mr. Bull, of Newington, and others to Mr. Herbert, of Brompton, and some to Mr. Grant, of Knightsbridge—a dozen of the spoons I sold to some stranger—a pair of snuffers and tray I sent to Yarmouth, but have got them back—I sold a pair of candlesticks—Mr. Adkins has got them back—I was in the habit of dealing in plated goods—the things I gave 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for were worth 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more than I gave for them—I am not generally in the habit of purchasing in Petticoat-lane—until I was a bankrupt I never bought things except of the manufacturers—after that I took to purchasing of respectable people wherever</p>

Q.</hi> Were these things in the front shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, most of them were in the papers—they have since been taken off—they were exposed in the public shop—people who saw them would know they were plated goods—the door opens immediately out of the shop into the street—it has not an ordinary glazed front—it is open like a butcher's shop—I could see the goods, with other goods, in the shop before I went in.</p>

I have known the prisoner by sight above two years, but have known nothing more of him—he came to my house last Sunday morning, between one and two o'clock, early in the morning—last Saturday was my youngest brother's birth-day—we were up—we had a few friends keeping the birth-day—the prisoner came and sat down in the back parlour—I asked what he wanted—he said, "Some beer"—I said it was public place to have beer or anything of that kind, and said, "You had better go out, my friend"—he called me several names—he went outside the door, and a young man named Hogan followed out after him—he was one of the party I had told to put him out—I shut the side door—the prisoner knocked the panel of the door through with a shovel while I was in the act of it, and after the panel came through he struck me with the shovel through the panel—I saw him strike me—the hole in the panel was about four inches wide or more—I saw him through the panel—he struck me with the shovel over the left temple—he made another attempt—Hogan took me into say shop—my head bled very much—the prisoner's brother and three or four more came in with him—I heard his brother say, "Here is the shovel, <hi rend="italic">Denny</hi>, and give it to her,"using a very bad expression—I was taken to the West<lb/>minster Hospital—my head was dressed—I have been in very great pain—I can scarcely speak at times for the pain.</p>

On the 27th of Nov. the prisoner came to the shop—he asked to be shown some coloured silk handkerchief for the neck—I looked out some—I cut one off, and he paid for it—he spoke to me as a German—he spoke very little English—I put those handkerchiefs away, and he asked to be shown some black ones—I opened a paper con<lb/>taining a number of black ones, but as they were not what I thought would suit, I laid them on one side, and opened another paper—he went away, and soon after he was gone I missed two pieces of black handkerchiefs, one piece contained seven handkerchiefs, and the other five—they have not been found since—no one else had been in the shop after I saw them safe—I opened them before the prisoner—there was one lady came to the door, but not near the counters—no one could have taken them but the prisoner.</p>

I recollect the evening of Wednesday, the 25th of Nov.—I was in Hyde-park, between the Magazine barracks where the guard is kept and Grosvenor-gate—about six o'clock I heard a violent scream, which I paid very little attention to at first and walked on—I then heard screams of "Mur<lb/>der!" five or six different times—I hastened to the spot as quick as I possibly could, and found the prisoner and the prosecutrix standing against a tree fifteen or sixteen yards from the path, where there are young trees protected by rails—they stood about a yard apart—the prisoner had an organ on his back or by his side—I saw the strap—the organ might be on the ground—when I got up the prosecutrix said she was very glad to see me, for the man had been wanting to rob and murder her, and taking liberties with her—she ap<lb/>peared in a state of agitation and alarm, and he was exposing himself, his trowsers unbuttoned, and his shirt hanging out between his thighs—a police<lb/>man came up just after, and he was given in charge—the prisoner and the prosecutrix were quite separate, a yard apart.</p>

On Thursday night, the 3rd of Dec, I lodged at Mr. Hickman's, the King's Head, High-row, Knightsbridge—i went to bed about eleven o'clock—there had been a concert in the house, which was not over then—I got up about twenty minutes before five o'clock—when I came down I had a candle in my hand—I found the bar-door was broken open—I saw a dark lantern on a little shelf just inside the bar-door, and just outside the bar-door, in the passage, I saw a shawl full of cigars, tied up, and a woman's cloak on the top of it, and on that <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi>, or crow-bar—I looked inside the bar door and saw the drawers were opened, and some of them on the floor—! just looked round the door into the bar parlour adjoining the bar, and saw the shadow of a man just turning round—I was not quick enough to see his person—he was in the bar parlour—I went and looked at the front door—that was quite safe, and the back door also—I went to the bottom of the stain and gave an alarm to Mr. Hickman—I hallooed to him, and the person in the parlour said, "Hold your tongue, or else I will <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> you"—I went up stairs, met Hickman coming from his bed-room door in his night-clothes, and we came down together—by that time the man was gone—he must have gone out at the bar<lb/>parlour window, which I found <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up, and a work-box put under it, to prevent its coming down—he could then go out and go over the wall—there was no other way he could have got out—I let in the police, I unlocked the front door, and unbolted the back door—when the police came I went to my work.</p>

                  </hi> I am a corporal in the 6th Enniskillen Guards. On this night I lodged at Mr. Hickman's—I was awoke between four and five o'clock hearing a noise in the back yard—I opened my window, looked out, and heard the voices of some men in the yard—I recognized the police by their lanterns—I saw a man going over the tiles opposite to my room-window—I called out "Police!"—the man had got into another yard—the policemen were in Hickman's yard or the next—I called sufficiently loud for the man to hear me—I said, "There is a man who has got over the tiles, and jumped down to the next lane"—on my saying so, the man, before he jumped over the wall said, You b—, I well shoot you"—the top of the wall has glass bottles on it—I heard the sound of a man dropping, after he climbed the wall—the wall is five or six feet—he was ten or eleven feet from my window—it was too dark for me to distinguish the person—after Scully was taken into custody I attended at the police-court and gave evidence—I heard him cross-examine the witnesses—my attention was called to his voice—to the best of my opinion, it was the same voice that spoke to me that morn<lb/>ing, the voice of the man who jumped from the wall—it was a peculiar voice, and when I heard him cross-examine the witnesses it immediately attracted my attention.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Police-force in this district. I was called to examine the hands of Scully—he told me he had had a little drop too much of drink, and fell down on some gravel on Constitution-hill—I found his hands wounded and lacerated, I have no doubt with glass—it must have arisen from being cut with glass, and could not be from the reason he assigned—the wounds were in an upward direction, towards the fingers, in a transverse direction—in the insides the fingers were lacerated as well, in a longitudinal direction, as if they had come in contact with the glass—there was a large transverse wound on the wrist, wounds in the hollow part of the hand, and on the sides of the fingers, but no wounds whatever on the prominent parts of the hand, which would be likely to come in contact with gravel, if he had fallen on it—the left wristband of his shirt was saturated with blood—they were exactly such wounds as could be accounted for by a person endeavouring to get over a wall with glass on the top of it.</p>

Last Monday week, the 7th of Dec, before the prisoners were brought before the Magistrate, I was at the Rochester-row station, in the passage of the cells—the prisoners were there, and a woman named Susan Watts, and Thomas Scully—in consequence of directions from my superior officer I listened at the cells, and heard a con<lb/>versation which was began by the prisoner John Scully—I reduced what I had heard to writing on the same afternoon—this is what I wrote—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)</p>
               <p>"About nine o'clock on Monday morning last I was in the passage of the cells, to listen to any conversation that might take place between the prisoner. 1 had not been there many minutes, when the prisoner John Scully called out, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I am sorry I sent Susan to your place: I did not think they</p>

John Scully said, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, I wish 1 could get to you only to say one word, everything would be as straight as a <hi rend="italic">die.'</hi> John Scully then said, '<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, they want to bring us in for a job done on the 21st of November;' when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'I shan't know anything about it.' John Scully said, 'What shall you say about it?' when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'That I am innocent; if I don't know anything, I can't say anything.' Charles Potter then said, 'And I am innocent; if I don't know anything, I can't say anything.' John Scully then said that he too was innocent; and if he did not know anything, he could not say anything. They all three then burst out laughing. John Scully then called out, '<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, did the policeman find anything at your place?' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'The knives, forks, and spoons.' John Scully then said, What are you a-going to say <hi rend="italic">V</hi> when <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, That I bought them of a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, and gave the value of them.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> then called, '<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, did they find anything at your place?' when <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> said, 'Yes, some knives and forks; I shall say I had them from you.' When <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'Yes.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> then said that the publican wanted to say they were his; when <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> said, 'Has he got any mark on them that be will know them by <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> said he did not know. John Scully then said, 'If we get off, I suppose I shall get my 3<hi rend="italic">;.</hi> 155. back. If they should ask me how 1 came by so much money, what would you say? I don't think I shall say anything until next time we come up. I think I can get some one to come up then, and say they gave it to me.' <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> answered, 'I could get somebody.' Charles Potter then said, 'We shall go to the Sessions.' John Scully said he did not think so, at least he did not think he should, as he had two witnesses to prove that he was in bed by one o'clock. John Scully then called Susan, and said, 'You slept with me that night; I left you at the King's Head, at a quarter before one; and when you came home, you found me lying on the bed, with my hands all over dirt, and that they had been bleeding, but they were not bleeding then, and that I was drank.' The female prisoner then answered, 'Yes.—I was then called from the passage."</p>

On the 4th of Dec, about six o'clock, I was in my shop—a large stone was thrown at the window—I next saw the prisoner's hand inside the window, taking up a tray of jewellery—he took it out of the win<lb/>dow, and threw it down on the pavement—it contained twenty seals, twelve rings, and two watch-keys—I did not pick them up myself—the prisoner was secured, and I saw him drop a gold key and a black brooch—he was never out of my sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I returned from Australia about five months ago—I am a labouring man—I am of no profession—I have wrought at different things. On Tuesday, the 13th of Oct., I was in Caroline-street, Bedford-square, about eleven o'clock—a person came up to me just at the corner, who after<lb/>wards gave the name of Captain Harvey—I had some conversation with him, and, in consequence of his invitation, I went to a public-house with him, and had some beer—the prisoner came in and joined us—he said he came from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184612140081"/>
               <p>America the week before—he introduced himself by asking if we could give him any information about the Museum, as it was shut that day—he showed some American small notes, by appearance, and some drafts also—he spoke about going to see a lawyer at Gray's Inn—my intention was to go to Caro<lb/>line-street, but it was too late then, and they said if I would go down into the City with them we would have a beef-steak together—I went with the prisoner and Harvey to Gray's Inn coffee-house—we had some more beer there—Harvey and I then came out, leaving the prisoner there—we were to meet him there at two o'clock—we went into the City—I had an order on the Bank of Australia, No. 8, Austin-friars—I went there, and they gave me a check to go to Smith, Payne, and Smith's—Harvey went with me—he showed me where it was, and went in with me—I there received seventeen 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Harvey and I then went to the Gray's Inn coffee-house, and saw the prisoner standing in the doorway—we then went to the Lincolnshire-house, a little further down Holborn—we had a beef-steak and some more beer—we then went to the Barnard's Inn coffee-house—the pri<lb/>soner made an offer of money to both me and Harvey—I did not accept the offer, but Harvey did—while we were in the Barnard's Inn coffee-house, the prisoner said he would go over to Gray's Inn and see if his lawyer was come—Harvey said something about his not returning—the prisoner took out his pocket-book, laid it down, and said, "If I am not back in ten minutes, there is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and bills in it"—he did return, and took his pocket-book up—Harvey then went out for a stamp for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which the prisoner had offered to lend him—when he went the prisoner asked him to deposit his pocket-book, and he did so—Harvey did not go out of the house altogether—he came back, and beckoned to me, and said, "I want to speak to you"—I went out, and when I was going I was accosted by the prisoner, who said, why did I not do as he had done and Captain Harvey—he did not say anything about my pocket-book—I took out my pocket-book and laid it down—I had taken out my pocket-book since I came from Smith, Payne, and Smith's—I am sure the notes were in it when I laid it down—I went out with Harvey, leaving my pocket-book on the table—I do not know what Harvey wanted with me—I knew that he was going for a stamp, at least he said so when he was going out—I accompanied him some distance down Holborn, leaving the prisoner behind, and my pocket-book on the table, and Harvey his pocket-book also—after I had gone some distance, I became alarmed for my pocket-book, and returned—Harvey did not return with me—he wanted me to go further on, and that aroused my suspicions—I said, "No, I will go back now"—I had not been gone more than three or four minutes—when I returned I did not find the prisoner, nor my pocket-book, nor Captain Harvey's—the prisoner and the books were gone—I gave information to the police, and described the person of the prisoner and Harvey—on the 23rd of Nov. I went to Giltspur-street Compter—I went alone—I was shown a number of prisoners, I should say from twelve to sixteen—I saw the prisoner, and identified him immediately—he is the person I was with—I was in company with him above three hours on the 13th of Oct.—we had been in several public-houses—I was sober when I was in Barnard's Inn coffee-house, and at the time I lost my book.</p>

                  </hi> I am a mariner, and live in King's-row, Horsleydown—I know the defendant—he works at Billingsgate. This happened between the 15th or 16th of Sept., about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night—me and my wife had had a quarrel during the day—Mrs. Pickard, who lives oppo<lb/>site, abused me—Susan Cole, Henry Pearman, and Ann Stephens, all lived in the house at the time—I was assaulted and abused by Susan Cole—Ann Stephens called me a b the prisoner was not there at all then—I went to bed about nine o'clock, awoke about twelve o'clock, and found my wife was not in bed—hearing people talking in doors I got up, and found Pearman, Pickard, and Cole, and my wife, at their door opposite—I opened my window, and saw the whole four—the prisoner was not there then—I said to my wife, "Why do not you come in doors?"—I came down to the door and stood there, persuading my wife to come in—the prisoner then came over, squaring up to me, and wanting to fight—I told him I had had no quarrel with him, nor he with me, why should he want to fight—he kept on squaring up—I said, "I do not want to quarrel, why not go away?" Pearman stood opposite and said, "It is me you want," and struck me with his life-preserver; which is a thing loaded with lead—I was gored in blood—Mr. Guthrie called a policeman, who showed his lantern—the pri<lb/>soner and Pearman flew in doors—the prisoner never touched me, only kept me in conversation for the others to fly up to me, to do it—he was taking my attention—as soon as the others got close to me, the prisoner stepped away to let Pearman come to me and strike me unawares with the weapon—I got three blows on my head—the bone of my arm was broken, but I sup<lb/>pose the blows on my arm must have been done afterwards—I have three cuts on the scalp of my head—I raised my arm—I suppose that was how I got the injury to my arm—there are several marks on my arm besides where it was broken.</p>

I took him before the Magistrate for aiding and assisting Pearman—the Magistrate did not say he considered there was no evidence against him, and he would bind him over to keep the peace for six months, as he squared at me—I did not ask the Magistrate if I could indict him—the Magistrate did not say, "What for? I have punished him"—he did not bind me over to appear here—I came to the Court and had him indicted—I have been drinking to-day—I had a pint of coffee at eight o'clock this morning—I did not know what you were enquiring about before—I have had a glass of rum, and 1 think about a pint of beer, and some bread and cheese—I was not going to beat my wife on this night—I told her to go out to avoid a knock—I had had beer to drink, and I dare say a little drop of spirits—I cannot tell how much, I do not keep a log-book to tell how much—I was sober enough to row about among the steamers.</p>

               <p>this night about eleven o'clock, and heard two females talking near my win<lb/>dow—it might be twelve or one o'clock—I got up, and saw the prisoner come down in his shirt, with the two females standing at their own door, aggra<lb/>vating Ellis—the bad language which came from them exasperated Ellis—they called him the worst of names they could—Stephens first came out in his trowsers, and I suppose his shoes, and wanted Ellis out to fight—Ellis said, "Go in, my good man, I have had no words with you; mind your own business"—he stood some minutes squaring before Ellis, who did not think proper to fight, till there was an opportunity for the man behind, named Pearman I believe—he went a little on one side to make room for the others running over the way—Pearman immediately ran over and struck Ellis—I will undertake to say the prisoner went out of the way to give Pearman a passage, and Pearman struck Ellis a tremendous blow with some instrument, I could not see what, being dark—I never heard such a tremendous blow in my life, and I have heard horses knocked down—I saw blood on the pave<lb/>ment, called for the police, and told them to take all four in charge—the policeman got hold of Ellis, and said, "I have got charge enough here"—while he was holding Ellis up, supporting him, I desired the policeman to take charge of them—Mrs. Pickard said, any b—entering her house she would split their b—skull—the policeman took Ellis away to the hospital—I was leaning out of my window, in my shirt—as I felt very much cramped, I did not go out, but next morning I traced the blood 200 yards towards the hospital, and the next morning I traced it 300 yards, where they lad led him away—I saw blood coming from him, but could not tell how—I suppose it was from his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 75, Ann-street, Kent-street, St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The prisoner, his wife, and two children, lodged in my second-floor front room. On the 7th of Dec. be came home a short time before eight o'clock in the evening—I heard him, as I thought, breaking some wood up stairs, in his own room—I was in the room under<lb/>neath him—his wife and children were out—a little before nine o'clock I heard a cry of "Fire I"—he had been in the house an hour then—I and my wife got up, and ran to the street door, and there saw a mob collected—I returned into the house, ran up stairs, and saw the prisoner on the bottom stair, coming down stairs, to go out of the house—I called him an old villain, and asked him what he set my house on tire for—he made no answer—I dragged him through the passage into the street—I then held him a few minutes—one person went up stairs, endeavouring to put out the fire, called out for water, and I let go the prisoner, to carry the water up, and went into his room—the flames had been put out, and the fire was all smouldering in the room—I did not see the flames at all—I saw no fire—the stuff which had been burning there was the stuff which had formed his bed, it was all scattered about his room—it was a parcel of cleanings from hemp-dressings—three separate parts of the floor were burnt—one part of the floor was burnt half-way through—the other two places were burnt black, but not through—the face of the boards were burnt off—his bed had been cut open, and the contents strewed about the room, and burnt very much—one chair had the wooden bottom pulled off it, which was found in another part of the room—there was another chair, which he had used to work on, with leather straps across it to make a seat, as it had no bottom to it, and the leather straps were burnt off—I went in search of him afterwards, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Tooley-street. I have a flour<lb/>loft over a passage that was formerly used as a back entrance to the Colonel Wardle public-house—that entrance is now inclosed for a coal-cellar—Wil<lb/>mott was my journeyman—on the 1st of Dec. a police-officer brought a loaf of cottage bread to my bakehouse—I was in the habit of allowing Wilmott four quartern loaves and one quartern of flour each week—they were delivered to him in the shop as he was going out—I have no recollection of ever giving him any cottage loaves—I am certain I did, not the last week he was with me—I never put any bread down by my flour-loft, into the coal-cellar underneath, and certainly never gave directions to any one so to do—when the policeman brought in the loaf of bread I told Wilmott it was abominable for a man like him to do it, with the wages I paid him—Beavis is potman at the public-house next door—I have examined the floor of my flour-loft, and find there is a loose board which will take up—on taking it up I could see into the coal<lb/>cellar below, which belongs to the public-house—the board was four feet long and ten inches wide.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be nineteen years old next Aug.—I live with my parents, at No. 24, College-street, and know Beavis—he is potman at the Colonel Wardle, which is next to Mr. Hunt's—I was employed by Beavis to clean out the tap-room, and to fetch coals and coke from the cellar which is under Mr. Hunt's flour loft—I went there about ten o'clock every morning,—on Monday, 16th Nov. I saw a bag and a string coming down, and a baker's hand, which was all over flour, through the flooring of the loft-there was something letdown—it appeared to me like bread—it was smoking hot from out of the bakehouse—I did not see Beavis while this was letting down—the person that let it down shook the string, and it broke—the bag tumbled down a little way—Beavis came in and put it into his wife's apron, and she went out with it, bag and all—some of the string that was let down was pulled up again—there is no cupboard in the cellar, there is in the tap-room—the next morning I was in the cellar, and a bag came down with flour in it—this was repeated every morning for a whole week.</p>
