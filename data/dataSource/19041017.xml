Catherine Road, East Ham—I formerly lived at 537, Victoria Road, Melbourne, where I supported myself by teaching music up to the spring of this year—I was a widow—my name was Liddle—I inserted an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Melbourne Age</hi>, and through that got into correspondence with the prisoner about May this year—I also met him in Melbourne; be gave the name of Ernest John Dacre—he said he was a photographer and importer, and that he had remittances of £140 a year from his estate in England, that he was born in Stepney, that his father was an officer in the Army, and was the owner of an estate in Gloucestershire worth £16,000, from which his mother was receiving an income, that he was two removes from the title of Baron Dacre, and was related to the Brandts, the Governor of New South Wales, that he had been an officer in the Army, and had got into debt to the extent of £11.000, and so had cut off his entail, but that his brothers were dead and the property would come to him—after a time I told him I was alone in the world and in delicate health—he asked me if I desired to get married, and professed to be very fond of me—at first he said we would get married and go to</p>

               <p>Sydney, and he wrote to Sydney, but he changed his mind and said he wanted to go to England, as his family was there and his mother was dying, and that he was in a delicate state of health—I told him I had advanced £400 on mortgage on a house in Brunswick, and that I had £140 or £150 in the Savings Bank, and two other loans amounting to about £100 on a promisory note and a bill of sale—he said of course I must dispose of my property, and he put advertisements in the newspapers—I paid for the advertisements—the marriage was fixed for June 28th, about a fort<lb/>night before that time, because he said he wanted to go home by the <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi>, he asked me if I could dispose of my property in the time—I said, "Yes, with a lot of hard work"; but I did it with his help—he did all the business of trying to get in the money—he said he had no money to take the passages, but if I would advance money to enable him to take them he would pay me back within two or three days after arrival in England, and I lent him £150 out of sums which I drew out of the bank—I agreed to take £380 in full settlement of the £400 mortgage money, and I was paid £380 in bank notes at the Union Bank of Melbourne—of that I lent him £40—he said, "You had better let me settle up, and he went to several offices, and eventually settled on Cook's—he asked me to make him a belt that he could wear it round his waist—I said no, I would have a draft—he said it was an unnecessary expense, and that Cook's, the tourists, charged £9—I gave him the £340 to get the draft, and when he came back he told me he had taken £15 out of the £340, leaving £325, for which he said he had a draft at Cook's—I did not authorize him to do that—he never showed me the draft—I went with him to the Melbourne Post Office on June 27th, the day before the marriage, to register a letter—the officials asked my name; I said, "Margaret Elizabeth Dacre"—I wanted to be married first and use the name of Dacre afterwards, but he raised objections of all sorts—I said I was doing all this, but I was not Mrs. Dacre—he said he had a lot of business, and if the marriage was the next day it did not mutter—he handed in the registered letter, and I saw him write on it—he said, "I will take charge of this"—(<hi rend="italic">Receipt produced for registered letter addressed</hi> "E. J. Dacre, London, England")—on the voyage he threatened to desert me, and I asked him for the receipt for the money, and he gave me this—I said, "It is in your name"—he said, "But the draft is in your name"—at Melbourne Post Office I did not know what the address on the letter was, nor the initials, nor what was in it, excepting what he told me—I had in Melbourne a piano, pictures, and books and music—I wanted to take the music—he said there was no necessity to take music, there was plenty at his mother's home—I said, "I wish to have my own music, it is very valuable, worth at least about £30," but I had to leave it behind and my prizes—the moveable furniture he took to the shipping agents—he said they had already gone by cargo ship and that they were consigned to King and Co., England—I thought they were in my name—he did not tell me the name—the value was about £300—it was consigned before I was married—I took some trunks in my cabin and there was larger luggage in the hold, not all mine—on June 28th I</p>

Jack"—I got two of his letters in London—on arrival in London on Monday, August 17th, I went straight to Scotland Yard—I received another £1 from him—I got two letters at Charing Cross—I stayed in Portland Street, where a detective told me to stay—I left word at the Plymouth Hotel to forward letters (<hi rend="italic">One letter from the prisoner stated:</hi> "I suppose you have been worrying about me, I have been very bad,' <hi rend="italic">and added that he had been taking advan<lb/>tage of his relative's kindness and care, and was signed</hi> "with love, yours, Jack.") the other enclosed a postal order for £1, and asked for a reply to be sent to "Poste Restante, Regent Street, S.W.," on account of the servants—I went to Charing Cross with the police on August 22nd to examine my luggage—I next saw my husband in Oxford Street on that day—I caught sight of him coming across the road—he stood looking at a shop window, and I waited for him—when he came up I said "Jack!" he asked me why I had come, and said that I had upset all his arrange<lb/>ments—he said, "Jump in a cab"—my lady friend was waiting—I said, "I cannot do that without speaking to <hi rend="italic">my lady friend</hi>"—he said, "Where is she?"—I said, "Over there," and as I turned my head he turned away into the middle of the road—a hansom cab stopped, and I went after him, and threw my arms around him, and called "Police!"—he struggled and broke my bag—he nearly got away, but a policeman came up—his hat was knocked off—it was about 8 p.m.—this slip of paper and the draft contain my signatures, "M.

Yes, that is my name"—I said, "I hold a warrant for your arrest for stealing some of your wife's property"—he said, "What is the charge against me?"—I said, "I will read the warrant to you"—I read it to him—he said. "Is that all? I can disprove that in two minutes, before the Magistrate"—the warrant charges him with feloniously stealing two sill: dresses, one jacket, two fawn coats, and a quantity of lady's underline:) to the value of £15—I said, "What is your address?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170011"/>
               <p>said, "I shall want to see a solicitor before I give you that"—I then searched him—in his trousers pockets I found £1 in gold, and in his jacket pocket five £5 Bank of England notes, Nos. 36693-7, dated April 4th, 1904—the prisoner then put his hand in his right hand back trousers pocket and gave me a bundle of twenty-two £5 Bank of England notes, the numbers of which are contained in the forty-five, numbered 97051 to 97095—I also found a watch and chain, latch key, three playing cards and eight visiting cards in the name of E. J. Dacre—I took him to Bow Street—on the way he said, "Do you call this fraud?"—I said, "The warrant charges you with stealing"—he said, "Well, I have travelled all over the world and have had to come back to England to learn that a man can be charged with stealing his wife property; I have written to her, and only last Friday sent her £1; we have been married two months to-day, and this is the end of it; fancy a man in my position being locked up in a cell all night; on our way here from Melbourne, if I passed a chair to another lady it was wrong, and she would tell me of it; I ought to have cut her throat; I ought to have told you before I have got some more money on me; it is <hi rend="italic">in my boot</hi>"—I said, "I shall have to search you again when we get to Bow Street"—he said, I forgot to tell you before"—on arriving at Bow Street, on the charge being read over to Aim, <hi rend="italic">he replied, "Very well</hi>," and <hi rend="italic">shortly</hi> afterwards said, "I can disprove that by telling you where the things are; the things she is charging mo with stealing are all in the cloak room at Charing Cross Station"—I proceeded to search him—he took off his right boot and sock, and from the foot of the sock he took 24 £5 Bank of England notes—all the notes are new and they make up the rest of the numbers already given—I afterwards went to Charing Cross Railway Station of the S.E. Railway cloak room, where a ticket was handed to me by Sergeant Burch, who had been to the prisoner's lodging and found a tin box and black bag, which Mrs. Dacre has seen—she identified the property at Charing Cross as hers, most of which is mentioned in the was in the name of Ward.</p>

On August 23rd I went to 1, Sherwood Street, Piccadilly, and found certain luggage in a room occupied by the prisoner; there were a wooden box and two portmanteaux, one light box, two hat boxes, a black Gladstone bag, and a kit bag—Mrs. Dacre identified some of it in separate boxes as that contained in her list—I also found seven certificates of character E. J. Dacre, John Dacre, and Ernest J. Dacre, from April, 1900, to 1904, one from A. M. Hilliary, photographer, of Mount Gambia, near Melbourne, Australia, as having given every satis<lb/>faction as manager and operator for six months, others as having held the positions of bar man, night porter, and boots at hotels in Australia.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live with my family at 10, Ridley Road, Dalston—the deceased was my daughter—she was 21 years old—I know the prisoner; he was engaged to my daughter—there was no proposal about being married—I did not understand that they were to be married sooner or later—they were walking out together for about four years—I did not see him often—about 18 months ago a disagreement arose between my youngest son Fred and the prisoner—the deceased was there when it happened—the prisoner hit my son, and I said to her, "I should think you have seen enough of this"—she and the prisoner con<lb/>tinued to walk out together till about the beginning of July—I forbid him the house at the time of the quarrel—he did not continue to come to the house, but on Sunday, July 17th, he forced his way into the house—that was the first time after the quarrel that he came to the house; I saw him—the deceased was at home—I told him he was not wanted—he gave me a push and sent me flying—I was in the passage—I went to the door and said, "I will get a policeman"—he said, "It will take three to take me"—he got in and saw my daughter; he said he wanted to speak to her—I said, "What you have got to say, say before her mother"—I did not hear what was said—I went to the door; my daughter came to me—I said, "Go into one of the neighbour's houses; perhaps he will go away quicker; I cannot get a policeman"—she went to Mrs. Worth's, at No. 8—the prisoner banged at the door of No. 8—he did not get in, and my son persuaded him to go away—he went to the end of Ridley Road—I do not know where he went then—I saw no more of him that night—I saw him again on the following Tuesday or Wednesday at the corner of Colvestone Crescent—I had no conversation with him—my daughter, who was with me, went over the road and spoke to him—my son was with her—she spoke with the prisoner for a few minutes—I did not hear what was said—I told my son not to leave her, but he did, and I ran out and stood within sight of them—on the following Saturday he came for a tin box which he had left at my place—it had been there a good time, I do not know how long—I told him he could not have it on the Saturday as I was busy, and he would have to send for it on the Monday—he said he could not understand why the engagement should be broken off—the deceased was there, and said, "We are not suited for each other; when I was first engaged I was too young and did not understand things, but every week as I get older I can see for myself that we are not suited in our dis<lb/>positions; each time we have met we have had quarrels lately"—he <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, "There <hi rend="italic">will be none of that when we are married</hi>"—she said, "If</p>

               <p>it is not that it would be other things, and we are not suited for each other"—next day, Sunday, July 24th, my daughter and myself went out for a walk about 10 p.m.; we got back about 11—my daughter had some supper, and went up to bed after 12—she sleeps by herself in a room on the first floor over the back parlour—I also went to my bedroom, which is an off-room on the ground floor at the end of the passage and over the wash-house—my husband and a young man were sleeping in a room at the top of the house, and William Tregonnin was in a room over mine; his room is nearly on the same level as the deceased; only up a few steps—when I went to bed I went to sleep—I was awakened by somebody forcing a door open and breaking a window—that was past 2 a.m.—I then heard somebody coming up the stairs from the basement—I called out, "Who is that, who is that"—I heard the steps go to my daughter's door—the instant the person entered her door, I heard her cry "Mother, mother!"—I ran upstairs and tried to burst the door open, but found it was locked on the inside—my daughter never locked her door at night—I screamed "Murder" as loud as I could—as I ran up Tregonnin ran out for the police who came in a very few minutes and burst the door open—they asked for some lights; I ran and got some, and when I got back my dear daughter was lying on the floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My daughter was about 17 when she first knew the prisoner—they were not on affectionate terms, they were on kindly terms—I was against the marriage—there were no prospects, and there were several other things against it—once he took hold of her throat at Berkhampstead, and said, "What could you do now?"—he did not seem very depressed when it was broken off—about 18 months ago he threatened her life, and said if he did not have her, nobody else should—when the man broke into the house he made no concealment; he did not walk quietly—I do not know if he knew that the persons in the house must have heard him—heavy sleepers might not have heard him—I did not suppose that the prisoner would do my daughter any harm—I thought he might try to hit her—they were not on affectionate terms at the last, because they had words—my daughter was not much downhearted about the engagement being broken off—I do not know if I saw the prisoner before he went to South Africa, but I knew very little of him—he was right in his mind while he was courting my daughter—I did not notice that he was very excited from time to time.</p>

I am the wife of William Reynolds, a stone mason, of 23, St. Jude Street, Mildmay Park—the prisoner is my brother, and stayed with me and my husband occasionally when he came to London—I knew he was engaged to be married to the deceased—about July 8th I heard of the engagement being broken off—I did not see the letter—I saw the deceased on the same day that I was told it was broken off—she came to my house that morning and saw the prisoner—he asked her why she had broken it off, and she said it was on account of her being unhappy at home—I asked her what she was going to do about it, and she told me she would come round about</p>

The prisoner was with me at my house until 12 a.m., when he went out for about an hour and met Mr. Collins: he then returned and had his dinner with us, and then went out with my husband about 2.45 for a drive—I did not see any more of him till about 11.15 p.m.—he was in a very low mood—I asked him how he had enjoyed himself; he said he could not enjoy himself; that Sunday was no day without Florrie; that his head was bad, and he fretted very much as if he was in great agony—he commenced to fret as he commenced to speak to me—he said the letter he had received from his young lady breaking off the engagement had troubled him a great deal, and he saw it on every wall in my kitchen, and he shaded his eyes as if the light was too much for him, and he said, "Yes, it is still there"—I went into the other room as it rather upset me to see him, and when I came back he was in the same position, as if he was still reading the letter, and he said it was still there and it maddened him—he took his coat off because he was feeling very hot; he hung it up on the door, and then sat and cried very much—I tried to comfort him—he said he would go out for a blow and he would feel better—I tried to persuade him to go to bed—he left me between 12.10 and 12.15; he was quite sober then, and had been all day—he had my latch key—I gave it to him in the morning—I saw him next in the hospital—when he was at my house he slept in the back room; I tidied it up for him and made his bed—I do not recognise this razor (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); my brother always carried his razor in his inside pocket; he had no other—I recognise his coat and boots (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my latch key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know my brother went to South Africa—I was examined before the Coroner, and said he was a farrier and went to South Africa, and whilst there he had fever and that he was wounded in both legs, but I have since found out that he was not wounded—it was my mistake—I think he came back about September, 1900—I saw him from time to time after that—I noticed his manner was very singular and strange; he would say things, and when I told him afterwards what he had said he would not remember them—when he stayed out on Hackney Downs for two nights, he told me that when he woke he found himself there, but did not know how he came to be there—he said he was frightened to go out in the sun because it made his head bad—that strangeness of conduct lasted from time to time right up till these matters occurred—after his return he was, from time to time, living with me or seeing me up to the time of deceased's death—on July 8th, 1904, I saw him with the deceased; they were very affectionate; she was sitting on his knee with her arm round his neck—as far as I could see they were a very affectionate and loving</p>

               <p>couple, and apparently attached to one another—from what she said I gathered the engagement was broken off in consequence of the disapproval of her parents—she herself was not desirous of its being broken off—on July 24th his eyes were very dazed and his conduct was very strange and odd; he seemed to be more cool and quiet when he went out; he was not excited then; he seemed to be in a wandering state in his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He was especially strange in his behaviour during the last three weeks—when he had any worry he was much more strange—between the time of his return from South Africa and the breaking off of the engagement he was always very irritable,—he said things and then could not account for then afterwards—sometimes on little family matters he would say things which I knew were not right, and when I told him of them afterwards he would almost stake his oath that he had not said it, or if he had said it he did not remember—after he came back from South Africa he worked as a farrier—Mr. Blake was one of his employers, Mr. Cooling was his last—I believe he gave satisfaction to his masters, and did his work regularly—he stayed in London from the Friday that he received the letter of the engagement being broken off till the Tuesday; then he went back and tried to work—he told me he tried his uttermost to work, but he was so dazed he could not—he came back to me on the following Saturday, which was a week before the 24th—he had been doing no work during the week—as far as I know he was sober during the week—he came to see me daily—he was fretting all the time—I did not notice anything very peculiar about him—he was complaining the whole time of his head being bad—he held it a great deal—he was very depressed and said the sun made a great effect on his head, and he would lie down and try to rest it—I did not take steps to have him looked after—he had been strange before, and I thought he would get right again—he had never been watched—I let him go out on July 24th; I thought he would come back—when the police came next morning I thought they were my brother coming back—I did not think there was anything the matter with him beyond being very much upset.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer at Brixton Prison—formerly I was medical officer at Holloway—during the eight or nine years that I have held those appointments, prisoners awaiting trial have been under my care, and it has been part of my duty to keep prisoners under observation to see the state of their minds, particularly in cases of murder—I have had the prisoner under my care since September 16th—I have had many interviews with him, and reports have been made by the warders as to his habits day and night—I have not detected any insanity during that time—I have heard the evidence in the case, and have made enquiries of the prisoner as to his family history—in my opinion he has been sane whilst under my observation—I do not think the evidence proves him to have been insane on July 25th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had the depositions laid before me—I made a report—I made enquiries from Mrs. Reynolds—she related to me what she has said here about the prisoner's strangeness—he seems to have been very much attached to the deceased, and felt very much the breaking off of the engagement—on one occasion he said he scarcely knew what he did during the rest of the week after it was broken off—he said he was very much depressed and miserable on the evening of July 24th—he did not speak to me about the writing on the wall, but Mrs. Reynolds did—more than once the prisoner said that from the time he left his sister's house on that Sunday until after the deed was done he did not know what he was doing—I think on July 24th he was in a condition of extreme mental worry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not find anything to account for his mind being a blank from July 25th to 26th—I only know of cases where a mind is active, then becomes a blank, and then is active again, in epilepsy, and I do not find any in him—there would probably be some history of it if it was there.</p>

I was coming along the Albert Embankment from Vauxhall Station, near the temporary bridge at Vauxhall, on the south side of the river, and walking as fast as I could, when the prisoner rushed from a turning, cave me a blow in the back, put his foot out. threw me, and then snatched my purse from my right hand; this is it—it contained three 2s. pieces, a half crown, a shilling, two sixpences, and <hi rend="italic">old.</hi> in copper—he gave me another blow in my back, or kicked me—I was on the ground—he put his hand over my mouth, and dragged me round the corner into Tinworth Street—I was unable to scream—he whistled like a bird, when five more young fellows came up—he held me in a recess against a wall in Tinworth Street—I was standing up—he then handed this purse to the young men who were round me, and one took the contents, and handed it back to the prisoner, who gave me my purse back, and said. "There's your purse, your money is all right," but when I opened it afterwards there was only a penny in it—he then put his hand over my mouth, and asked me to pull my clothes up—he said, "If you scream or make any noise, I'll put your lights out"—I did not scream, because he had his hand over my mouth—he then pulled my clothes up. and tried to do something to me—his own were open—I screamed murder as loud as I could. I resisted, and scratched his throat—a man passing went for the police—the prisoner dropped my clothes, and they all ran away—the policeman ran after him and caught him—I did not know any of them—I went to the police station with the prisoner and the police—the prisoner was not the worse for drink—he used filthy language—I had had a glass, but was not the worse for drink—I had left off work at eight, in the Belvedere Road, Westminster Bridge Road, and I had been at work at Thanet House, opposite the Royal Courts—I was coming from visiting my sisters, where I go every Saturday night, in Stewart's Grove, Wandsworth Road.</p>

I am a merchant at 87, Finsbury Pavement—I knew the prisoner when he was trading as Morant &amp; Co., nine or ten years ago—about two years ago I met him, and called upon him, thinking I might do business—it is not true that he was engaged by me as a buyer; there was no arrangement at all—I was subpœnaed by the prisoner to appear at the trial, but was not called.</p>

Mayward &amp; Co., 36, Copthall Avenue"—the adjudi<lb/>cation was March 8th—the liabilities were £8,046, liquid assets £686. out of which only £32 was realised—he was examined by me, and, amongst other things, described himself as a money lender—he has not applied for his discharge—the bankruptcy petition on December 3rd, 1900, was</p>

"You can search my boxes if you like, but I have burnt and destroyed all the papers in the case, as they refused me an appeal"—I conveyed him to London and charged him at Bow Street—he made no reply—when arrested, he had some letters on him that bear on the case.</p>

I live at 34, Wimpole Street, and am Consulting Surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital—I examined the prisoner before the trial of the action—I came to the conclusion that he was absolutely deaf in his left car but he could hear in his right—I thought it was due to shock, I did not know what—he told me he had been in a. railway accident—the mischief was in the internal ear—I should think it would be permanent, but some of those cases do eventually get better—I applied the tuning fork and other tests—when the Lord Chief Justice put to him very awkward questions he could not hear at all—he was nervous—he was a long time in the witness box—at my first examination there was present a doctor from Brighton, Dr. Godfrey, I think—I saw the prisoner on May 13th with Dr. Cheatle and other doctors—Dr. Cheatle did not explain to me the tests he was going to apply—he said he was going to block up the ear with india-rubber, and I thought he meant a solid piece—I think it possible for this hollow</p>

Thomas Wallis &amp; Co., Holborn Circus"—he then produced from his pocket half a sovereign, 11s. 6d. in silver, and 2d. in bronze, £1 1s. 8d. in all—he said, "This is all I have left; I must have lost a sovereign somewhere"—he was taken to the City—on the way he produced this unreceipted bill from his pocket, and said, "That is the bill; to tell you the truth I lost two sovereigns as I was on the way to pay it, and was afraid to go back"—he was searched at the station—this receipt for 2s. was found on him for' a phonographic form—it plays the tune known as "The Bobby's Patrol"—on the remand before the Magistrate he elected to give evidence on his own behalf—I heard him give that evidence, and saw him sign the deposition afterwards; (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) "George Parkins, the accused, on his oath, says as follows: I live at 66, Barlow Street, East Street, Walworth. On Thursday, 8th inst., Mr. Robinson gave me £3 in gold, telling me to pay a bill at T. Wallis &amp; Co., and bring him 11d. change. That was a little after four in the afternoon. As I was going along Charterhouse Street I felt in my pocket and found two sovereigns missing from my right hand side pocket, into which I had put all the money. The two half sovereigns were left. Then I did not like to go back, so I went home. When I was arrested I had half a sovereign in gold, and half a sovereign in silver on me, and 1s. 6d. of my own. I got change for the half sovereign in the Victoria public house at the corner of Barlow Street. They know me. That was on Saturday. The governor's son, Fred Rook, gave it to me. I find there is a hole in my right hand waistcoat pocket.—G. Parkins."</p>

I was leaving Younger's office in Belvedere Road, Lambeth, when I was accosted by the prisoners—they both rushed at me instantaneously, and Jones caught hold of my watch chain—one of them kicked me under my left knee and the other kicked me on my right knee, and I went down—Jones then kicked me in the body, and after that I had a succession of kicks—they then got away with my chain and compass—I saw Day running away—I do not know who took my chain and compass, which I have not seen again—there were about six other men there when I was on the ground—I was taken to the police station by a constable, where I reported the matter—at Bow Street police station last Friday I had no hesitation in identifying Jones from among twelve other men—as to Day I was not quite certain, and I went back to the gaoler—in consequence of instructions I went back again—I happened to turn round, when I caught an expression on Day's face by which I identified him—he had previously been contor<lb/>ting his face, which made me uncertain as to his identity—his descrip<lb/>tion exactly corresponded to the description I had given of him at the Kennington Road police station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Day.</hi> I did not say to the gaoler, "I think it is the fourth man"—I said to him, "I am certain of one, but I am not quite sure of the other"; and he said, "Take your time, and scrutinise the men again"—the detective did not give me any assistance.</p>

"Hold the man," indicating Jones, "There are two others who have robbed me of all my money"—another constable came up and we took Roberts and Jones into custody and took them to the police station—when charged, Jones said, "You have made a big mistake this time, guv'nor"—Roberts made no reply.</p>

I am a farmer and carter at Broughton House Farm, Thaxted, Essex, near Elsenham—Saunders is a farmer and pig dealer at Broxted, six miles from Dunmow—in January I was keeping some pigs for him—on January 18th he wanted me to fetch a ton of pig meal from Dunmow Station and store it in my barn for the pigs—it was in all sorts of sacks and bags, and not so good as that in Court—I fed the pigs with it—about a month afterwards Saunders told me he got it from Horncastle in London—I fetched a second ton on January 25th, and another lot on January 26th or 27th of five tons—these are entries I made at the time—on March 30th I started again—I carted about seven tons in January—he said in February he paid £3 15s. a ton in London for it—on March 30th I fetched three tons—some of it was very good, and some of it was very bad—it was in 2 cwt., Il stone, and 10 stone bags; the weight varied—that was used for the pigs—some was in lumps as big as a bushel; it had got damp, and we had to break it to pieces—some of it had been heated, and stunk horribly—one lot on April, 20th of 2 tons 18 cwts., came to Elsenham—the last time I went was on July 14th—altogether I brought away about 19 tons, I believe—some of it was very funny stuff, I do not know what to call it; it was damaged—some was black and looked like sweepings—I never carted more than a couple of tons like that—when the police came I had nothing left but the empty bags—I believe Saunders went with me to the station once to fetch it, when he signed for the stuff—at other times I signed—I had some of the stuff for my own use in payment for the carting—5s. a ton I charged for the hauling—the rate to me was £4 0s. 10d. a ton with the carriage from London to Dunmow station—the price varies from £6 to £5 for middlings. but I had bought it for 50s.—it is the offal that is left over when the wheat has been ground into flour; I do not call it flour—it looks like biscuit meal or something like that—I could not tell whether it is wheat or oat meal by looking at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at the farm just over eight years—I have known Saunders about two years—he is a neighbour, and is well known and respected in the neighbourhood—I first saw stuff like this in Court on</p>

               <p>September 9th, 10th and 12th—I instructed Inspector Nicholls to bring back 4 tons—I never received from Saunders any stuff of the quality produced—the only dealings I had with flour of this quality was when I carted it for the police from Mr. Lays to the railway—Saunders' stuff was not fit for feeding purposes, even for pigs—I keep from 20 to 50 pigs—I feed them on middlings—I use this book as my ledger to keep anybody's account in—my wife makes entries in it every day as the facts happen—I have seen Horncastle at Saunders' farm in the summer twice or three times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant at Thaxted, Essex, seven miles from Elsenham, and between Dunmow and Saffron Waldron—in March, Saunders, whom I did not know, called and said he had pig meal to sell, and produced a sample, about a handful, in a piece of paper—it seemed like middlings, it had a funny smell as if it had been heated or damaged—he said his friend bought it at the docks, and sent it to him—I asked him what price he wanted for it; he said £3 15s., or if he paid the carriage £4 0s. 10d. at Dunmow—I asked him if that was the lowest he could take—he said he could take no less—I agreed to buy some—he said the people he bought it from had a lot of it, and that they had bought it by auction—the first transaction was 4 tons 1 cwt. 2 qrs. on March 2nd in cwt. bags—this is the invoice I got from Saunders—I paid by this cheque, deducting £2 for bran I had sold him—I did not notice that the invoice calls it flour; I call it middlings; he called it pig feed and pig meal—I had lots on March 26th, April 7th and 23rd, July 3rd and 15th, and August 24th, making altogether about 38 tons—these are. the invoices, except of the last lot on August 24th, when the police came—I had then in my posses<lb/>sion 7 tons—the police opened some bags in my presence and took the stuff away, and 200 or 300 empty bags—it was stuff like this in Court, and all about the same grade, except the first lot which was not so good—the bags were marked "Army and Navy" the last two, and some "Chandos," and some had foreign writing on—I had told Saunders the stuff was bad, and I would give him another order if it was a better quality—we keep some of the bags—sometimes we are charged 1s. a sack—when we buy from abroad we get the bags in—some of them go rotten and are all to pieces—Saunders asked me to write a cheque to Benjamin—I wrote out two cheques for £8 10s. and gave Saunders the balance, £3 12s. 6d., in cash, because he had no banking account—he never told me who Benjamin was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sold the stuff for pig food—it is used for dog biscuits—we carted it from Elsenham station ourselves—it arrived there in bags sewn up—as far as I know the bags had not been sampled—they were consigned to Saunders, who gave me an order to the station master in his own name with the consignment note—the stuff is called by different names on the documents, which I did not pay much attention to—the transactions with Saunders took place at my shop as a rule, once or twice at the mill—it was stored at the mill and in the store room—there was nothing in the transaction to give me an idea the stuff</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I sold it at £4 15s. 5d. a ton, and some was mixed with other stuff—what the police fetched was what was left of the last two lots of 8 tons 10 cwt. 2 qr. and 7 tons—about 8 tons of those lots had been sold as pig meal at the same price as the rest of it, £4 10s. to £5 a ton—I sifted some that was heated, and some I gave my pigs without sifting.</p>

Millard, of the Dolphin Hotel, who is a customer—it is signed by my son. and "C. Palmer" is the signature on the railway notes produced—he brought it back the next evening, the 9th, like that—"H. W. Wood "is on the receipt for the railway carriage, £1 at 6s. 8d. a ton—I gave Hill the sovereign and the delivery ticket—I told him I should give him another delivery note for another three tons to go to Slough—he said the man wanted the money before he would part with any more—I told him I should have to have a receipt for the flour, which he had not got, but agreed that I should have it, and that he would take three tons more, he went away about 8 p.m.—after we were closed in the evening, he came back, knocked at the door, and told me he had seen the man the flour belonged to, and he did not think the receipt was necessary—I said I should not pay it till I had one, and even if I wanted to I had not the money, only a cheque—he said, "A cheque is no use to me"—I have not seen the flour, only the sample—on Wednesday 10th, I telephoned to Millard to ask him to examine the flour—on that morning I had communicated with the police because Hill's conduct about the receipt led me to be suspicious—Hill came in about mid-day—Detective Stevens was upstairs—I said he had better come in and see Stevens and tell him all he knew about it—he said he did not think it was necessary; he would go and get the receipt and bring it later in the day, and he left the shop saying he would seea Mr. Sale first, and that evening he would see Thompson and get the receipt from him—Stevens and I stopped him lower down the road and questioned him as to where he got the stuff—we all three went to the station—Hill was questioned there, and then allowed to go—he came again later that Wednesday evening and brought this receipt [<hi rend="italic">this was dated August 12th (Wednesday was August 10th), it had a printed heading, and stated</hi>, "Mr. H. Hill, bought of George Thompson, 49, Frean Street, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, 48 bags of damaged flour;"] Hill said he paid for it in the first place, and he represented it to be Thompson's transaction through Hill to me—he ridiculed the idea of my being suspicious, and told me it was all right, and I believed it was then, but I had not the money in the house to pay him in cash, so I did not pay him—he came again, I think the next day, with this bill, dated August 11th, "Debtor to H. Hill for 48 bags of damaged flour, £23s.," and on Friday 12th I went to 49, Frean Street, Thompson's address, but could not find him—a fortnight or three weeks afterwards I told Hill I had been to find Thompson—I was con<lb/>tinually</p>

Benton's stores at Lowell Street, Commercial Road, E., do hereby wish to make the following voluntary statement: About three months ago a man came to me, whose name I do not know, or where he lives, and asked me if I would cart one ton of flour from Benton's stores in Lowell Street (although at that time I did not know it was Benton's) to a flour factor's in a turning off the Holloway Road, near the Archway Tavern. I said Yes,' and arranged to draw it the next morning, which I did. The man paid me 10s. for the job. About a week after this I got friends with the man who gave me the job, through meeting him about, and he told me then that all this flour I saw in the railway arches at Lowell Street was for sale, and that a lot of it would suit pig dealers. In consequence I went and saw Mr. Harry Lay, pig dealer at Canning Town, and took some samples with me of the flour, and asked him, Mr. Lay, if he would buy some at £3 10s. per ton. Mr. Lay said £3 10s. was too much for pig food, and he could buy it for 55s. a ton. I agreed to take that price, and supplied him with either nine or twelve tons. He paid me all the money, and I gave him receipts for the same in my name. He had previously asked me where the flour came from, but I could not tell him. I drew all this flour from the railway arches in Lowell Street. The man Sailor Peterson, whom I see in custody, is one of the men who helped load my van. The reason I would not tell Mr. Lay where the flour came from was that I thought he would do me out of my commission. The man who first came about the flour sent me with either five or six tons of flour one morning from the railway arches to a big corn merchant of the name of Osborne &amp; Young, Limited, at Loughborough Junction. I did not sell or take the money for this, but he paid me 10s. per ton. He also sent me to the British Paste Company, Canonbury, with six tons. He paid me 7s. 6d. per ton for taking it there. I also sold six tons of the flour that I took from the railway arches at Lowell Street to a Mr. Harrison, Corn Merchant, of Broadway, Barking. He paid me by two cheques the sum of £15 for the same. I gave the cheques to Harry Hill to get cashed,</p>

Hill, I believe sold the stuff on "behalf of the man who first asked me to cart the flour, at any rate he is the man who gave me the order to cart.—Walter Carr.

Osborn and Osborn, of 56, Copthall Avenue; it was an appearance entered for the respondent by Messrs. Gribble &amp; Co., on July 25th—the petition was set down for hearing on September 2nd, 1902—no answer was filed by the respondent, and it went into the un<lb/>defended list, and was heard on November 24th, 1902, when a decree <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> was granted to the petitioner—Osborn and Osborn acted as solicitors to the petitioner—on May 26th, 1903, an appearance was entered on behalf of the King's Proctor, and on June 11th, 1903, the King's Proctor's plea was filed—the particulars appear on the minutes of the Court, and were filed on July 17—on August 13th, 1903, the second block was filed—the petitioner's reply to the King's Proctor's intervention is dated September 14th, 1903—the solicitors were Osborn and Osborn for the petitioner, and Gribble &amp; Co. for the respondent—the case was heard before the President and a special jury on a number of days between March 16th and April 21st, 1904, upon which day the decree <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> granted on November 24th, 1902, was rescinded, and there was substituted for it a judicial separation and custody of the child on the ground of cruelty—I produced all the documents put in in the case—they were left in the custody of the Court—I have checked the list which was made of the documents.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted.</hi>) I now live in Guernsey, but in March, 1902, I was living at Mrs. Macnamara's, at 7, Hillary Street, Jersey—I occupied room No. 4—Travert was also living in the house, in room No. 5—one night in March I remember three visitors coming to the house—they were in the sitting-room downstairs when I first saw them—two of them were a tall dark man (<hi rend="italic">Pollard</hi>), and a man with a big moustache (<hi rend="italic">Davies</hi>), who said he was the valet, and he paid for what was had in the house—I went up to my room with the third man, who was tall and fair—whilst I was there Davies came in, but as I do not understand English I do not know what he said—I went to the door of room No. 5—shortly afterwards I went downstairs—Davies paid me.</p>

                  </hi>. I now reside at 34. Headlands Park. Plymouth—with mv father and mother—I was married to Kate Pollard on July 4th, 1801—I continued to live with her until April 13th. 1901—upon that date I went to stay with my parents at Headlands Park—I have lived with them there ever since with slight breaks—when I went down to live with them I went with the assent of my wife and at her request, in fact, she made all the arrangements—when I was there I recollect in November, 1901, meeting Smith, who I knew as Roberts; he told me his name was Roberts—at that time I had not the slightest idea that I was being watched by detectives or at any time up to the trial in November. 1902—I was walking down one morning and I went into a paper shop on my way into the town—Smith followed me in; I think he asked me some common question, which I answered, and we entered into a conversation; he told me he was a stranger there; I had nothing to do and I chatted with him—that was the commencement of the acquaintance—I saw him from time to time after that—I ran across him accidentally so far as I was concerned—at that time I had very little means; my personal spending money was about 3s. a week, which my wife sent me, out of which I bought tobacco, papers, and small items—I remember in March, 1902, making the acquaintance of Davies—that was done in the smoking room at the Golden Fleece—I used to go into the little back parlour and have a glass of beer, and Davies came in there and made my acquaintance in a casual way—he said, "I know you"; I said, "I do not recollect you at all": he said, "Is not your name Pollard"; I said, "Yes": he said, "I used to know you when you lived up in Bedford Place somewhere"—I said, "Did you; I haven't the slightest recollection"—he said, "That is easily accounted for; I had not this then, you know." and he pulled his moustache, which is rather a long one—then we had drinks together—I presume Davies paid for them—I might have paid had I the money—I do not suppose I had—he met me frequently—we nude appointments, and he waited for me, and I met him whenever I went out—I ran across him sometimes by appointment and sometimes accidently—he said he was travelling—I understood he was in business with a brother or a brother-in-law—I did not see any business being done—he said he had been to South Africa for a trip on business and come back—on the occasions that he met me we generally went and had a drink, and then perhaps went for a short walk, and then perhaps had another drink—we had walks into the county, too—I showed him around the immediate district; just the prettiest places—one day he said, "Iam utterly sick of Plymouth; I must get out of it. I am going to have a change; I am going over to the Channel Islands"; that he had a little business there, and was going to combine pleasure with business, and he added, "Will you go with me?" I said, "I should like to very much, because I am thoroughly tired and sick of Plymouth, having nothing to</p>

               <p>do hero, and coming down every day and doing nothing." He said, "Will you come?" I said, "No, I cannot." He said, "Why not?" I said, "Well. I am too shabby, and I cannot go, I have not means of any sort." He said. "Oh, that does not matter: you come alone—what is the mattor?" I said, "I have not any boots for another thing"—he said, "I want a pair of boots; come down with me and we will get some"—so we <hi rend="italic">went</hi> down to a shop in Union Street named Oliver's, and we had a pair of boots each—he paid for them—he also bought me a new hat—he repeated the offer to take me on this trip several times—it was discussed on many occasions and I hesitated for a long time before I accepted it, which I did after great pressure—I believe we left Plymouth on March 11th, 1902—we went straight to Jersey to the Star Hotel—Davies paid the expenses there with the exception of some small items which I had the money to pay for—I started with about a a sovereign in my pocket—I went about with Davies there—after breakfast in the morning we would go round to a cafe and have a game at billiards, and probably several drinks, and then we would go back to lunch—one evening, it may have been March 12th, I went with him to a house of accommodation, that was after a long drive in the afternoon—coming back we called at many public houses—when we came back to St. Heliers we stopped at the first hotel, I forget the name, at the far end of the town and had more drinks, in fact the coachman had so much that he fell off the box and let the horses run away—during that day Davies paid for all the drinks and the cab, but he did not pay the cabman on that day—eventually he did, and he paid for the cabman's drinks—we went back to the Star and had dinner and I have no doubt we had more drinks—after dinner, Davies suggested we should go out and have a look round—we went out—we went into one or two places, and played ping-pong, I remember at one place, and then we went into a house in the front, which I remember had green shutters—it was a house of accommodation, which Davies knew—he took us there—there was another man besides myself—I think Davies said simply, "Come in here and have a drink"—I had a very good idea what the house was—I went in with him to that house—a bottle of wine was ordered, and two or three women came in with their hats on, as though they had come from a walk—one, I remember, had a perambulator with a baby in it—we left that house—Nothing happened there that I saw—we went from there to Mrs. Macnamara's, in Hillary Street—Davies found that house out—I had never heard of these houses before—I had never been in St. Heliers before—when we went into Mrs. Macnamara's, I think at first we saw only Mrs. Macnamara—some drink was ordered—I think it was claret or burgundy—Davies ordered it and paid for it—I did not see him pay for it, but I did not do so—there was no conversation between Davies and Mrs. Macna<lb/>mara when I was there that I remember, except casual remarks—two girls came down into the room where I and Davies and Mrs. Macnamara were—I am not sure that we were all there when they came down, but we were all there after—I had not said any</p>

               <p>thing about the girls coming down—I have not the least idea how it was they were brought down—I thought they came quite in the ordinary way—they were Mario Travert and Marie Leroi—after some lapse of time it was suggested we should go upstairs—I cannot be sure who suggested it—I was to go up with one of the girls and the other man who was there was to go up with the other one—that was suggested by Davies—I said: I have not got any money: I cannot go, and I do not want to: I will go home" He said: "Oh rubbish, that is all right: that is all right"—I did not hear him on that occasion re<lb/>present that he was my valet?—I went upstairs with Marie Travert, and into the room with her—I was partially undressed, not fully—I was smoking a cigarette and lying on the bed—the door was suddenly pushed open and the landlady and Davies looked in and made some remark—I cannot remember what he said—after that I got up and dressed and went downstairs—Marie Travert came down too—I imme<lb/>diately left the house, leaving Davies behind—I asked if there was anything to pay, and he said, "No, nothing," so I left—I returned to the hotel—on the 17th I stayed a night at Guernsey, and on the 18th went back to Plymouth—during all that time I had not the slightest idea that Davies was an inquiry agent or a detective—I never saw Davies after my return to Plymouth until I came up here to the Courts—down to July 10th I never knew that I was being watched—I do not know Bray or Pracey at all—I never recollect seeing him in Plymouth at all—on July 10th I got a note with a visiting card enclosed with the name of Albert Osborn on it—I had not the least idea who he was up to that time—I have tried to find that note and card, but I have been unable to do so—it said "I am in Plymouth, and I shall be very much obliged to you if you will give me a call during the afternoon"—it was headed "The Grand Hotel"—it was brought by a porter, and I said, "I am going out shortly, and I will come up"—in the afternoon I went up—just as I was entering the hotel Osborn came forward and said, "You arc Mr. Pollard, I believe?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I want to have a chat with you. Will you come inside?"—we went into a room just behind the office, a sort of small smoking room—we sat down and I think he asked me to have a drink—I had a whiskey and soda, I think—then he gave me a cigar—he said, "I have come down on behalf of your wife; you have been up to London kicking up a row, and she has decided to have no more to do with you." I said, "I am very grieved to hear that, and I am very sorry for having created any disturbance, but I was living under great tension at the time, and I regret it. "I appealed to him and I said. "Is there not any chance of making up?" he said, "None whatever. It is absolutely hopeless"—I said, "If it is, I think I shall clear out of the country; I shall go abroad"—he said, "I think it would be about the best thing you can do; it is a very good idea; your wife will take pro<lb/>ceedings against you"—I said, "On what basis?" and he said, "We know all about you in Plymouth; we have found out all about you"—I said, "You have found out nothing wrong as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170085"/>
               <p>regards women"—"Oh," he said, "we know all about that"; he said it in an insinuating way, as if he knew that I had had some connection with women, which I emphatically denied—when I appealed to him, and asked him could he not intercede or use his influence he said, "It is perfectly hopeless; she has quite made up her mind to have nothing more to do with you"—so I said, "Well, I must accept the position."—I should say I was there with him on that occasion about three-quarters of an hour—I never saw him again until the trial, when the King's Proctor intervened—within a week I was served with a citation from the Divorce Court at my mother's house by a Mr. Hamil<lb/>ton, as I know him now—I did not know who he was then—I know now that he was one of Slater's employees—I did not know it then—when I got that I went to consult Mr. Bennett, a solicitor of Whiteford and Bennett—he entered an appearance to the citation, and subsequently communicated with me on the subject of the petition—at that time I had no means by which I could defend the divorse proceedings—I endeavoured to raise means, but I could not—I had tried to raise the money to defend the case, I again saw Mr. Bennett on several occasions—if I had had the money I should most certainly have defended the case—on August 2nd I re<lb/>member getting a letter in pencil—I have not it now—in consequence of that letter I went to the Clock Tower on the Hoe, opposite the Royal Hotel in the centre of the town—I cannot remember the whole of the letter, but I can remember the gist of it—it said, "Dear Tom,—Will you meet me at the Clock Tower at 11 o'clock I should very much like to see you; just back from South Africa. Your old friend, Friend, "—I think it was—I did not know any such person, and could not make out who it was, but I went down out of curiosity, and I did not see anybody—I knew at that time that Davies' name was Frederick, but I did not know Bray at all—I have since that date seen Maud Good<lb/>man several times, and Louisa Ford once or twice—I did not observe them at the Clock Tower or about there—I should not be likely to do so; there is quite a wide space there—at that time I had not the slightest knowledge of their existence—I did not notice Bray there at all on that day—I had no knowledge of him at the time—I had no knowledge on that day that I was being watched or identified—I know Mrs. Dale—she is a sister of my wife's—I have not seen her for some years—I did not see her in the early part of August at Plymouth—I did not know she was there identifying me—I should not have recognised her had I seen her, because I have seen her since in the Courts and she is much changed—I received no notice that the divorce case against me was going to be heard—I saw in the papers that the Divorce Court commenced its work on a certain day in November, and I came up to London to the Courts in the Strand—I thought from the citation my case was coming on on that date—I made inquiries, not at the Courts, and I discovered that my case might not come on for weeks or months, so I went back to Plymouth—during 1902 I was in the habit of visiting a Mr. Thomas at Summerland Terrace, he was retired from the Dockyard—I forget the number, it was the last</p>

Dear Sir,—There are certain facts in connection with the proceedings lately taken against you in the Divorce Court of which you ought to be aware at the earliest possible moment. Should you be able to come to London the matter can be privately gone into at a personal interview at Longley's Detective Agency, Featherstone Buildings, Holborn. On calling at the offices suggested you will be given certain information which will enable you to approach the King's Proctor. As you will readily understand, it is not desirable to go into this matter by letter. An interview here would cost you nothing, and afterwards it will be for you to consider the advisability of seeing the authority mentioned.—I am, Sir, yours faithfully, Longley's—T. Pollard, Esq." "The next is January 3rd: "Dear Sir,—We are glad to receive your letter of yesterday, and wish to impress upon you the importance of keeping your own counsel at Plymouth. Do not try to trace the woman who was the chief witness against you, or make any local inquiries of any sort or kind. It is essential that you should come up to town as soon as possible, and bring with you the citation, all letters and telegrams received by you from Mrs. Pollard during your stay in Plymouth, a photograph of Mrs. Pollard, and also copies of the western newspapers in which the case was reported. We have no doubt but that we shall be able to come to some arrangement with you at a personal inter<lb/>view in regard to possible future expenses. Should the King's Proctor intervene, you will be to a great extent relieved from this financial burden. On second thoughts it might be as well to post us a copy of the citation, and also, as you suggest, a copy of your letter to the King's Proctor. Further, a slight sketch of Mrs. Pollard's life, so far as you know it. Would help us to corroborate one or two points.—We are. dear Sir, yours faith<lb/>fully, Longley's." January 6th: "Dear Sir,—We are obliged by your letter and copies of letters which reached us yesterday. Our Mr. Longley called on the Solicitors to the Treasury in the course of' the morning, and, at their request, a preliminary statement was later on submitted for the attention of His Majesty's Proctor.—We are, dear Sir, yours faithfully, Longley's"—on May 14th, 1903, I attended at the office of the King's Proctor's agents at Plymouth, Messrs. Watts. Ward, and Anthony, where I saw Mr. Murray, the managing clerk—I had previously seen him frequently and knew he was the managing clerk, and engaged for the King's Proctor—I also saw there upon that occasion at the office the woman I now know to be Maud Goodman, and another woman I now know to be</p>

               <p>Louisa Ford—Mr. Stredwick, who is the assistant in the King's Proctor's office, was also there—up to that date I had never seen Goodman on Ford before to my knowledge—there is no truth whatever in the sugges<lb/>tion that I ever had immoral relations with Maud Goodman; or that I had ever been at 3 or 9, Summerland Place; or that I ever met Good<lb/>man and Ford together—when I was in the office and these women were there, Maud Goodman said she did not know me—that was the first time, so far as I know, that I had ever been confronted face to face with her—this photograph is a photograph of me (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and had been originally a joint photograph; it was cut from one like this of myself and my wife—they were taken about fourteen years ago, when we were first married.</p>

I knew Longleys were detective agents; but why they were approaching me or writing letters to me I had no idea; I was rather surprised to hear of it—nor did I know of the existence of Cartwright or Stevens, nor had I any knowledge of what theey wre enquiring at the time—my evidence at Bow Street was read over to me, and I signed it as being correct—I had an office of my own to work at ten years ago in Gracechurch Street—I paid the rent, I believe, as long as I could; I gave it up in a perfectly friendly way: I did not run away—since then I have had no office—after my marriage I took my wife to Bedford Place to live—it is right to say that after three weeks I do not remember being turned out of there for not paying the rent—from Bedford Place we went to a coffee shop near London Bridge, kept by Mrs. Hill—I took one room with use of other rooms—I cannot say what happened—from there I forget whether I took my wife to the Great Eastern Hotel, Liverpool Street—I think we went to Clapham—I took her to Faulkner's Hotel, Newgate Street, but I do not know when, and I took her to the Temperance Hotel, Moorgate Street, one or two nights—I do not remember taking her to a coffee shop in Whitechapel, I will not swear I did not—I do not think I had to leave either of those places be<lb/>cause I could not pay—I could not say exactly how soon after my marriage my wife had to go and work, I think about two or three years—she worked at different places, amongst others Fuller's, in Queen's Road, Bayswater—she went to live at her mother's place and at her sister's place, but she always paid—from the time that she got situations—she was work<lb/>ing in different situations down to 1901, with certain intervals—before I married her I was in possession of a little money which came to me from my first wife, who died about three years after the marriage—she left a small sum of money in which I, was to have a life interest, and which was to go after my death to her child—it was settled so at my request—the child is named Leslie—my dead wife's relatives came over here and asked me to let him go to America, and I consented—that is ten years ago—I have made enquiries with regard to him since, but not of late years—I have not contributed anything to his support—he was taken with that proviso, and it has been unnecessary to do so—"I did mortgage my life interest for £500, but I do not recollect the date; it was twelve months after my wife's death; I think it was</p>

               <p>mortgaged through Mr. Cosens to one of his clients; there was a second mortgage to Mr. Cosens subsequently, but not on the same estate; I had nothing but this life interest that I could mortgage; from the money coming to me there had to be deducted the interest on the mortgage and the premiums on a life insurance, and Mr. Cosens paid my wife first 25s. a week, then 20s. a week, and then 15s. a week"—I believe that is correct—the money coming from Mr. Cosens, representing that life interest after the deductions was paid in the form of weekly payments to my wife—I do not think that was to prevent me spending it on drink—I quite agreed with the idea—I was not aware that it was to try and prevent me having the chance of spending it on drink—I might have pawned the sheets on one occasion, but not for drink—a sheet is a more convenient thing to carry than a chair or a table, a sort of thing you can put under your coat and pawn for a shilling or two—that was when my wife left me without money, which she frequently did—I may have pawned sheets at a pawn shop in the Uxbridge Road, close to the last place I lived at with my wife—on one occasion my wife found me in a public house with the child of my second marriage—I was talking to the barmaid asking her to serve me—the last house we lived at was kept by Miss Marshall—she did not give me notice that I should have to leave, or say she could not have my wife there while I was there—I do not know what she said to my wife—she went to her work every day—I spent most of my day strolling about in fine weather, if I was wet I stayed at home—I did not stay in bed—I do not care much for bed—I was not aware that Miss Marshall declined to have me there any longer—my wife told me that Miss Marshall had "given her notice, she did not give me notice personally—I said at the police court "While at Miss Marshall's I was once found at the Bush Hotel, a public house, with my child: my wife found me there; Miss Marshall gave my wife notice, I was told that; I had previously stayed at my wife's sister-in-law's house; I do not think it was through me we went; I think there was friction between her and my wife; we also stayed at my wife's mother's place at Fuller's, where my wife was em<lb/>ployed, in Queens Road; when Miss Marshall gave notice it was at that time that I went to Plymouth"—at that time I knew that my wife had been to a solicitor and a solicitor who knew me and all about my first marriage and the child, had written to me; I do not know what representations she made to him; he wrote to me on February 1st, 1901, saying. "Dear Sir.—We have been consulted by Mrs. Kate Pollard, your wife, with reference to your recent misbehaviour to her and the necessity of some action on her part in consequence. We have advised her that a deed of separation may be necessary, and before proceeding with this we appeal to you in your own interests to render it unnecessary by treating your wife with courtesy and respect, as we are instructed your recent conduct has been painfully the reverse. In the event of the separa<lb/>tion becoming necessary, the mortgagee of the Baltimore Trust Funds will be advised to retain all the income until the mortgage money, £750, is paid</p>

This will be the case unless an immediate improvement in your behaviour takes place as suggested. We have not lost interest in your concerns, but you never inquire after your son Leslie, or write to us."—The only means of livelihood that I had was what would come from Mr. Cosens through my wife—I arranged that it should come so—if that stopped I had nothing—at the time the divorce proceedings were commenced that money stopped as far as I was concerned—I wrote to stop it myself—I did not go to Mr. Cosen's office and complain that I was not receiving the money, and ask for it, and he did not insist on my going very quickly out of the office—the amount was about 25s. a week—I received it weekly from Mr. Cosens—it was reduced afterwards—I was never informed what the amount was—it was entirely through my wife, she did all the business—I believe the fund had been mortgaged, and there was due in reference to that, £750, so the amount was reduced until it first became 25s., then 20s., and subsequently 15s. a week—after the divorce proceedings commenced, I did not get any more money, or for some time before the actual proceedings commenced—I do not remember at what date the money stopped, but it was about that time—I did not complain in Plymouth to everyone I spoke to that the action of my wife had stopped my allowance—I did not make any public com<lb/>plaints to my boon companions or to my friends in the public houses—since I wrote to the King's Proctor in December, 1902, I have not done a day's work—I occasionally assist a friend of mine—I was in the tea trade at one time and went to China, and was there eight years—since I have been back in England I was an insurance broker for some years, and then I was ill—I had paralysis, and I had to give it up—that is the reason I went to Plymouth for the benefit of my health—I found out it was because I had paralysis that I could not work when I could not walk about—I am a very good walker now—I have not been able to walk about for the last ten years—I have not been absolutely tied to the house—it was ten years ago that paralysis prevented me from working—it took two or three years to wear off—when I went with a pair of sheets to the pawnbroker's, it was not very far—I have never before to-day said upon oath that the fact that I did not walk was due to the paralysis I had ten years ago—if somebody gave me an insurance I should take it to Lloyd's, and so should be an insurance broker, and I should get my commission on that, and also life insurance—I asked people to insure their lives or their ships—you go to various offices where you think business is to be done, and ask them whether they wanted to. be insured—I was not at all well when I got down to Plymouth, and I took a still further rest—since I wrote that letter to the King's Proctor my father, mother and brother had been supporting me—I think that is all—my sister helped me indirectly—I do not think I got all I could out of her—I dare say there are people I can borrow a sovereign from now and then</p>

               <p>if I liked to ask them—there is a limit to all things—the King's Proctor has assisted me to a small extent—he made me a small allowance while the case was pending—I think it was 15s. a week, but it stopped long ago—it went on for about two months—that was before the trial in the Law Courts at the begining of this year—before that I had nothing at all from them—I only got expenses which were incurred if I went on a certain business—if I had to attend a solicitor's office and neglect the insurance broking my time was paid for—I cannot tell you the scale, but it was extremely small—when it has been necessary for me to travel, and I have wanted necessaries, they have provided small articles like boots or clothes and very likely a hat—I may have had two suits of clothes—I had my grey or lavender suit at the police station—I got this one since for this trial—I may have been disreputable-looking, but I was not naked—they found me this smart suit which I have got on now when I came up the other day—I did not get measured for it after I came up—I was fitted straight away—I have not been staving at Matcham's Hotel while I have been in town, but in private apartments—I have one or two companions that I can talk to—there was a gentleman connected with a Government office—I have gone to the same place on each occasion because I have found it very comfortable there—I have had the chance of going elsewhere, but I said I preferred going there—when I was up at Bow Street, I had my suit of clothes and my hotel bill paid, but I only had my railway fare paid when I went back—I had my 'bus fares—I was not taken out in the evening—I had—2s. perhaps, to see me through the day, and I got what I could, I suppose—when I went to Plymouth, I do not think at first the 15s. a week was sent to me direct—I swore before the Magistrate: "At first, when I went to Plymouth, I think the money was sent to me," but not 15s.—I think it was 8s.—when I went to Plymouth first, the money was sent down direct to me by ray wife, and my mother complained that I spent the whole of it and gave her none, and then the money was sent to her in consequence of a letter from her—I said before: "The money that was for my support was sent weekly to Plymouth. I do not know if at this time my wife was receiving 15s. a week from Mr. Cosens. I believe it was 15s. The money sent by her to Plymouth, 8s. to mother, and 3s. to me, may not have been sent direct to me for fear I might spend it on myself"—that is perfectly true—when the money was sent to my mother in that way I succeeded in intercepting it on one occasion—I took a letter that was addressed to my mother with the money in it, took the money out of it and spent it—my mother was called as a witness in the King's Proctor's case, and the letters that she had written to my wife were produced in Court and put to her—it is correct to say, "From April, 1901, to July, 1902, I would not swear to how many times I wrote to my wife; I would not swear three times, or any number"; neither would I now—I wrote in reply to letters from her, but when I got no letters I did not reply any further—I said before, "The two or three letters I wrote from Plymouth were written when I first arrived; afterwards I ceased to write"—I knew that</p>

               <p>day at all, I was rather excited—I should say I was more or less under the influence of drink during the whole day—I had not slept the whole night, and it has an effect—I could not travel free from Plymouth, I had to buy my ticket—I had £2—the fare to London is 18s. and something—I think I had to buy some necessary articles with the other sovereign—when I spoke to the cabman in Edgware Road, I did cot leave a woman there—I am perfectly sure I did not associate with any woman in Edgware Road—I was by myself when I met the cabman, but I do not remember where it was—I do not think I had got the necessary articles with me that I had bought with the sovereign—I forget if I had any money, it is so long ago—I had a little—not very much—I explained to the cab<lb/>man that I had none—he was not. annoyed in the least—I brought a bag to town with me—I left it at shop in Praed Street, and asked them to kindly care for it—I bought some articles there—I never found the bag, I found the shop—I think I went to the shop I left the bag at—they said they knew nothing of it—of course I could not dispute the matter, I had no receipt for it—I went to my sister and asked for the money to pay my fare to go away—I had no difficulty in getting it—she gave me 25s. to go to Plymouth—I saw Osborn on one occasion only—he told me that he was acting in this matter for my wife, and complained to me of my conduct on that visit to London, and said that it was the climax—he warned me that my wife would have nothing more to do with me—I understood that this going at 3.30 a.m. drunk with a cab driven from London to Forest Gate was the sort of thing that did not want repeating—when I got there I walked quietly back from Forest Gate to London—I suppose it is nine or ten miles—I went to my sister's the next afternoon and asked her to lend me the money to go back to Plymouth—I went to Paddington and got the train back to Plymouth that night—upon occasions when I have got no money I can walk nine or ten or twenty miles—I should be very glad to earn money by walking—when I saw Osborn he was stand<lb/>ing in the hall—afterwards he had tea—I did not express any desire to take tea—I do not care for tea—I was in the tea trade once, and I have had enough of it—when he spoke to me about my having been in London that matter was fairly fresh in my recollection—I had hardly got over my adventures physically—I cannot repeat his exact words, but the impression was most defined on my mind that he insinuated that I had been with women in Plymouth, which I emphatically denied—he said "We know all about it"—at the Police Court I said: "At the interview Osborn said,' We know what you have been going on with in Plymouth '; that referred to women, and I emphatically denied any association with women whatever; loose women"—nothing had been said about divorce at all. but I assumed he referred to women because you have not the exact statement there—I assumed from his exact accusation put to me—I cannot say if he believed me when I said I had done nothing—I did not form any opinion—he laughed the idea off that I had had nothing to do with them, and said "Oh, yes, we know all about that"—that was the final remark as far as I re<lb/>member</p>

               <p>—he pretended not to believe me—I made a most emphatic statement that I had had no connection with women in Plymouth—I referred to Plymouth particularly, and confined it to Plymouth—I said. "Since I have been in Plymouth I have had no connection with any woman," or something to that effect—the proceedings were not mentioned; at the beginning the fact that my wife would not live with me again was only mentioned, that was the only point—nothing was said about proceedings at all—I was there about half an hour, and had one drink and one cigar, I be<lb/>lieve—I do not know if there was any more drink—I do not know whether I had two drinks or not—I am not quite sure about that—I think one drink is right, but I should not notice it much—that was the only interview that I ever had with Osborn, and after that, the next incident that occurred was that I was served with the citation—it was handed to me, and I took it as I should a letter from a post<lb/>man—I looked at it, and the man went away—I saw what it was very promptly—I did not make any denial then—I did not know who the man was who delivered it—the allowance was not sent down some time previously to that—I cannot fix the date—I said before, "When the divorce proceedings commenced, the allowance came to an end"—it was before that, I suppose when they commenced in London; before I got the citation. "I recollect going to Mr. Cosens' office about it. I did not go there; I wrote. In August I was not in London. I do not remember an interview when I asked Mr. Cosens to pay what he had been paying my wife to me. I have no recollection of his ordering me out of the office. I did not want the allowance paid to me if I received a portion of it. I certainly wanted a portion, to receive it through my wife. At the beginning of the divorce proceedings I did not want Mr. Cosens to pay the allowance to me." I went to Mr. Cosens about the allowance—eighteen months before, he had told me that as soon as there was any separation between me and my wife the allowance would come to an end—when the allowance came to an end I was in Plymouth, and no money was coming in—my mother is a comparatively poor woman—not very poor, I should think—I know that she describes herself as poor—she does not always speak the truth, or write it—to a small extent she was cooking for me and attending on me, and giving me what money she could—in December I wrote to the King's Proctor—I first saw Mr. Murray on receiving a communication from him after I had written to the King's Proctor and got a reply; after I sent in my petition, I cannot remember the date—I only went to see him when he requested me to go, about three times a week—I began to go there immediately after he was instructed to inquire, I have not got the date—it was soon after I had written to the King's Proctor, there was not a very great delay, I should think three weeks afterwards—I disclosed the fact that I had been with a woman in Jersey as soon as I was asked—I do not remember when it was, I did not admit it as soon as I knew they knew it—I volunteered it, so told them before I was asked, I believe—I cannot</p>

               <p>swear that, but I believe that is the case—I disclosed the whole thing right through—I did not disclose it when I wrote to the King's Proctor in December—it must have been some time after that; when, I cannot tell you—I cannot give exactly the date now that I first saw Mr. Murray, I should think it was in January—I used to call in there without his requesting me to do so—I frequently passed the office or close by there, and I used to look in to ask if there was any news, or anything required of me—that went on from January down to the King's Proctor's case—I was in Plymouth all the time, and in my morning walk I would drop into the office to see if there was anything moving—it was not till May 14th that Maud Goodman was brought to the office—I do not know how many times she was interviewed by Mr. Murray before she was ripe for being confronted by me—I saw her on May 14th—there was no conversation at all; simply "Good morning"—I walked into a room and out again, and stayed there half a-minute—I might have said, How do you do"—when I went there I knew that they would have to see me—I had said, "Let me see this woman at once"—Mr. Murray did not tell me how many interviews he had had with her—I never heard that there had been an interview the day before I saw her, when she was to be in the frame of mind that I was not the man, that she had made a mistake—there was another woman with her in the room when I saw her on May 14th—I think it was Louie Ford—my account of the matter was: "Maud Goodman and Louie Ford were not in the room with me more than half-a-minute, there was no conversation. I stayed a minute or two, perhaps half-a-minute, and they looked at me, and I went out. That is the whole thing"—I asked her no question at all—I was at the hearing of the trial when the King's Proctor intervened and gave evidence—my mother and Maud Goodman gave evidence—I heard Nellie Bell called and give evidence—with regard to Mr. Cosens I said, "Cosens' com<lb/>plaint in his letter was as to my conduct to my wife, and taking no interest in my child Leslie"—I never inquired as to the child through Mr. Cosens—I cannot remember when I wrote to the child—I have written to him some years ago; I cannot say how many—I have not written to him because he left when he was a baby, and, therefore, as I cannot have him back, I have not wished to disturb him—he was virtu<lb/>ally a baby—he was quite a young child—he went to Mr. Hill's coffee house where I was with my wife—I was not drunk all the time that I was at Jersey—I had lucid intervals—on going there I had some money—I can always borrow a sovereign on an emergency if I run across a friend—one of the places I was in the habit of going to was some place opposite Summerland Terrace—I knew somebody there—he was a man I could borrow money from—he has never refused me—I never trespassed on his generosity—he is dead—I could not have got money from my brothers; there is only one brother in England—I was in communication with Whiteford and Bennett, solicitors, at Plymouth—I don't think I wrote to Osborn and Osborn, the solicitors on the other side, and asked when the divorce case was coming on—I naturally should not make any enquiry—</p>

Sometimes I would be up at 8 and perhaps the next day at 11—I know I got up rather early on that date because I had to meet my father—then I went to the Clock Tower—there is a large open space in front of the Clock Tower—I said at the Police Court:—"There I walked up and down some time."</p>

He referred to women, and I very emphatically denied any association with women whatever—loose women."; and later I said, "I now remember on my previous evidence being read to me he said my wife would not live with me again, and was going to take proceedings. He said to me, We know all about you in Plymouth' That was the effect of it. I spoke to him some considerable time; I said I had been to China in the tea trade; I do not think I said I would not go to her any more.

               <p>and told Osborn that I heard it was about a divorce case and I would not have anything more to do with it—I gave the photograph back to him—he said there was no harm in telling what I knew—he wanted me to sign a paper—I think it was to the effect that I said I thought I knew that photograph—I saw the paper but not the writing—he did not say anything about what it was—I cannot tell you where he took the paper from—I saw it in the parlour in his hand—he told me there would be no harm in signing it, and I should hear nothing more about it—I said, "I will not sign it now"—while we were still in the parlour he made an appointment to meet me at 9 p.m. that evening, at the Victoria Hotel, Plymouth, to sign the paper—I said if I would sign it I would sign it later, and he then made the arrangement to meet me at 9 o'clock at the Victoria Hotel—I left No. 3 in his company and we went to No. 9 together—I saw Minnie Wilson—Osborn was not present when I saw her on my return; I was only with her a few minutes—I had some conversation with her, and then I left No. 9 and went back to my lodgings at 11, Trafalgar Street—when I left No. 9 Osborn was still in the house, as far as I know—later that day Osborn came to me there, between about 6 and 7; I do not quite remember—Minnie Wilson was with him—they saw me in the front room down-stairs—Louie Ford was also there—Minnie Wilson also went by the name of Mrs. Thompson—I knew Louie Ford beforehand; she was living in Trafalgar Street, and was a woman who had been in Plymouth for some time carrying on the same life as myself—Osborn produced the paper and still wanted me to sign; he said I might as well sign it now as later on, because I understood he wanted to get back to London again that night—I said I would not sign it then, but I would keep the appointment that had been made for 9 o'clock that evening at the Victoria—Minnie Wilson said I had got to sign the paper—she said I knew the gentleman, and it was just as well for me to sign it now as at any other time, because I had got to sign it—Osborn could hear that—he did not say anything that I can remember—nothing more happened at that interview, as far as I can remember—Osborn went away shortly after on the arrangement that we should meet again at the hotel in the evening—he went away with Minnie Wilson and Mr. Thompson—Thompson was present at that interview throughout—he lived at No. 9, as far as I know—he was the Mr. Thompson who gave his name to Minnie Wilson, who went both by the name of Minnie Wilson and Mrs. I Thompson—Osborn left in the company of the Thompsons, and I and Louie Ford were left behind—when the question of signing the paper was men<lb/>tioned I think a pen and ink were fetched—I cannot tell who it was who mentioned the pen and ink or who fetched it—I did not use it on that occa<lb/>sion—the next I saw of Osborn was at the Victoria Hotel at 9 o'clock—I went with Louie Ford—we went into the public bar—Mr. Thompson was there when we arrived, and two or three others with him—Osborn was there—I do not remember if Bray or any of the other prisoners were there—when I got into the bar Osborn spoke to me—I do not remember the conversation, but I know he asked me to sign a paper there—I said</p>

               <p>I would not sign it there—he then took me across to the Swan Hotel—I do not think anything was said about going to the Swan before we left the Victoria—before I left the Victoria I had some refreshment—I do not remember what it was or who paid for it—nobody besides myself and Osborn went to the Swan—we went together to the private bar of the Swan—he wanted me to initial a photograph to say that I knew the gentleman, and also to sign a paper to say that I knew him—I did not want to do it at first—he said I should not hear anything more about it. and offered me a sovereign, which he produced—he said if did not sign it somebody else would—I signed the paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in pencil, and he gave me the sovereign—I. Maud Goodman, say that I know the gentleman whose photograph is shown to me and to which I have put my initials, and he has had intercourse with me, Maud Goodman"—he produced the sovereign before I signed the document, and gave it to me after I had signed it—that was not the first money which Osborn had given me that day—he gave me half a sovereign in the afternoon at Mrs. Condon's—that was after I had taken the photograph into Nellie Bell and brought it back to him—he and I were alone in the room when he gave me the half-sovereign—I initialed this photograph (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—but this is not my writing—my initials, M.G., are there, but it is not what I wrote—the document that I signed was already written out when it was produced to me—I do not remember if I read it before I signed it—I think it was read to me before I signed it—I cannot say if the piece of paper Osborn produced in the day was the same kind as he produced at night—I left the Swan with Osborn, and I went to No. 3 or No. 9—I had some refreshment in the Swan; I cannot remember what—Osborn paid for it—on getting outside the Swan I saw Louie Ford, and went away in her company—Osborn came back with us, I think—we all three went back to No. 9—I think we saw Minnie Wilson when we got back there—I am not sure of that—I stayed at No. 9 on my return only a few minutes—when I left I went away alone—I cannot say if Osborn was there at the time I left, or if Louie Ford was there when I left—Minnie Wilson was there—I do not know if Thompson was there—I was not present that night at Minnie Wilson's to sign any document, or when any document was signed by other people—I did not see any such thing happen that night, or do any such thing that night at Minnie Wilson's—some time in August, after I had received a message, I remember going to Lockyer Street towards the Hoe with Louie Ford and Bray—I met them at 3, Summerland Place, Mrs. Condon's—I did not meet Mr. Bray at 3, Summerland Place, I made a mistake, it was at the Clock in front of the Theatre, or in front of the Royal Hotel, Plymouth—it was owing to the message I had received—that was the first time I had ever seen him, I think—he wanted me to identify the gentlemen whose photo I had seen, and whom I had stopped with, or supposed to have stopped with—I do not remember all the conversa-tion—we then all three went to Lockyer Street—when we got near to the Lockyer Hotel, Bray said, "There is our man," and pointed to</p>

               <p>Pollard, who came out of the Lockyer Hotel—I said, "I cannot tell whether I know him by his back"—he had his back to me at that time—I said. "If I see him face to face I will tell you if I know him"—Bray said, "We will walk on to the Hoe, and then you will be able to see his face"—we all throe went to the Hoe—Pollard had walked in the direction of the Hoe at that time—when we got on to the Hoe I waited till he got some distance near me, and then I looked at him—I thought he knew me, or at least Louie Ford said he recognised me. and I did not trouble to look whether he did or not—I never got close up to him—I was, I should say, a few yards from him—after Louie Ford had said that to me I said to Bray, "I suppose he knows me"—next, I was taken back to No. 3, Summerland Place to sign the paper to the effect that I identified the man—in Bray's company on that occasion, I think we went to an hotel and had some refreshments, but I do not know the name of the hotel—that was after I had seen the gentleman on the Hoe, and before getting back to No. 3—Louie Ford went with me—she had some refreshment, which Bray paid for—then I went back to No.3—Bray suggested going back to No. 3—I was not living at No. 3 at that time, nor was Louie Ford—I had an appointment to keep at 9, Sunderland Place in the morning, and I thought it was to see Osborn, but I was told to go to the Clock Tower and I should meet either one of the gentlemen, and I met Bray: that is all I know of him—he told me he wanted me to identify the gentleman—nothing beyond that that I remember—at No. 3 I signed this statement—I think it was already written out—I read it before I signed it—Louie Ford also signed a statement produced by Bray already written out—we were at No. 3, when we got back there, more than an hour, I should say—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) "I, Maud Goodman, say that I have to-day had pointed out to me a gentleman whose name I am told is Pollard. I have previously identified the photograph of the gentleman, and put my initials to the same"—the photograph was produced at No. 9 first, but not on this occasion—"The gentleman I have to-day had pointed out is the gentleman who went with me to No. 3, Summerland Place, which house is kept by Mrs. Condon. He there had intercourse with me"; and then there is "Louie Ford spoke to us. and he asked us to come and have some<lb/>thing to eat"—that is scratched out—that is a lie—it was scratched out because it was not right—I am quite sure I never spoke to Louie Ford on any occasion when I have been in the house with a gentleman—I said so at No. 3—I said that this was not right—Bray as far as I remember crossed the words through—they were struck out in pencil—"I made a previous statement to Osborn and identified the photograph <hi rend="italic">"—(This was dated August 2nd, 1902.</hi>)—I do not think the date was put in at that time—it is signed "Maud Goodman"—I think Nellie Beil was in the room when the statements were placed before us—she signed a statement, but I do not know what it was—some statement was produced to her—Louie Ford was not there when the words in pencil were struck out—Bray left me at No. 3—it was some time after that before I saw him again—within a few</p>

               <p>days of signing that document I wrote this letter to Messrs. Osborn and Osborn: (<hi rend="italic">Dated 7th August, addressed from Trafalgar Street to Messrs. Osborn and Osborn</hi>): "Dear Sir,—Just a line to let you know that the gentleman Mr. Bray pointed out to me last Satur<lb/>day in the presence of Louisa Ford was the gentleman I stopped with at Mrs. Condon's house, No. 3, Summerland Place, Plymouth. I also think that if Miss Wilson should be called she would only make a blunder in the matter, as she is not to be trusted as regards to the truth. Trusting for an early reply, I regain yours truly, Maud Goodman. Osborn and Osborn, Exchange Chambers, 56, Copthall Avenue, London, E.C."—Then: I should feel obliged if you would send my friend and myself a present for our trouble on Saturday"—the address must have been given to me, I do not know where I got it—oh, yes. Bray gave it to me the after<lb/>noon that I signed the statement at 3, Summerland Place—I do not re<lb/>member if he wrote it down, but I know he told me where to write—he told me to write and say I had identified the gentleman—this was the answer: "56, Copthall Avenue, London, 8th August, 1902. Miss Maud Goodman, 11, Trafalgar Street, Plymouth. Dear Madam.—Pollard.—We have your letter of yesterday's date, and Mr. Bray has already reported to us that you identified Mr. Pollard as the man who stayed with you at Summerland Place, and he has handed us the statements made by your<lb/>self and Louisa Ford. We herewith enclose you a postal order for £2. which is £1 for yourself and £1 for Louisa Ford, and we should be glad if you would both sign the enclosed form of receipt and return it to us. We are sending you this money for your trouble, and. of course, when you are required to come to London for the purposes of the case we will arrange to make the necessary provision for your expenses.—Yours truly, Osborn and Osborn" in writing: "I also think that if Miss Wilson should be called she would only make a blunder in the matter, as she is not to be trusted as regards to the truth." I was referring to the time that she said I had stopped with the gentleman on two or three occasions at No. 9, Summer-land Place, where she lived—Minnie Wilson had been saying I had stayed two or three times with a man at her house, No. 9—that is why I put that in—I knew that if I had stopped with a gentleman it would be at No. 3 and not at No. 9, as I had not been visiting that house for some months. She said I had recently stopped with him at No. 9, and I knew that was wrong, and I knew she would say I had been stopping there because she did not mind what she said for money—I understood she was coming here to the Courts in London, and she did not mind saying I stopped at her house—I did not write it, but I told Louisa Ford to write it for me, and she wrote it—I told her what to write—I knew myself that if she was called she would not mind saying I had stopped with a gentleman whether I had or not—if I had had connection with Pollard it would have been at No. 3, because I was not going to the other house at that time—I was made to believe he had had connection with me whether he did or not; I hardly knew whether the gentleman knew me or not—if I had been asked to say where it was he had had connection with me it would have been at 3, Summerland Place—if Minnie Wilson had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170101"/>
               <p>been called she had nothing to do with 3, Summerland Place, but she said that I stopped at her house with a gentleman; of course I said if I had stopped anywhere with a gentleman it would have been at No. 3. Summerland Place—if we had both been called and she said it was at No. 9 and I said it was at No. 3, I should have said she was telling a lie—so that there would have been one witness for the petitioner saying that another witness was telling a lie—when I went to identify the photograph she said, "Of course you know the gentle<lb/>man; you have stopped here with the gentleman"—I said, 'If I have stopped anywhere with the gentleman it is at No.3"—anyway I had not stopped in that house with a gentleman in those months—I do not think I had been given any document, any subpoena, by Bray on this first occasion, anything which would take me to court to give evidence on this first occasion that I met Bray—when I was taken to London the first time I gave evidence before Mr. Justice Barnes Louisa Ford was there, and Minnie Wilson, but I do not think Wilson was there on the first occasion—in the letter of Osborn's there was a form of receipt enclosed, as he says, to sign and return: "London, 8th August, 1902. <hi rend="italic">Be</hi> pollard. We hereby acknowledge to have received from Messrs. Osborn and Osborn the sum of £1 respectively"—that came to me with the penny stamp on it—I signed it—Louisa Ford signed it—I returned it to London, addressed to Messrs. Osborn and Osborn, and Louisa Ford and I continued to live on at No. 11, Trafalgar Street—I do not think that between the time I saw the gentleman on the Hoe and going to London for the trial I saw anything more of Bray—I remember going to London for the purpose of attending the trial—I remember seeing Bray about that time, but not the day—I think I saw him on the day I left Plymouth to go to London—if anywhere, it would be No. 3, Summer-land Place, because I think I was stopping there—I was told by Osborn that I had to come to London, and I said I did not want to do so—I saw him that day at No.3, Summerland Place—McKenna was present, and I think Nellie Bell—it is so long ago I cannot remember who was there—Osborn said I had to come to London, and I said I did not want to go—he said I had to go whether I liked it or not—he frightened me into going, that is all—he was not with me long—the reason I gave him was because I was not quite sure whether I knew the gentleman or not—he already knew I was not sure whether I knew the gentleman—I do not remember any more conversation—soon after that con<lb/>versation I started for Plymouth station—I had had a subpoena some time before, but I do not remember when—I left No. 3 for the purpose of going to Plymouth station to get to London with Mrs. Condon, Nellie Bell, Louise Ford, McKenna. Bray, and Osborn—I do not think Bray was there when I had the interview with Osborn, I am not quite sure—Bray was there when I left the house for the station; I remember that now—I know he was in the house—he was one of the party which came to London—I came to London that same afternoon, and arrived some time that night at Paddington—we ad travelled up together in the</p>

               <p>same compartment—on arriving we wont to Matcham's Hotel, and Mrs. Condon. Nellie Boll and I were put up there—Bray and McKenna stopped at the same hotel—Osborn did not stop there—they stayed with me there on the Sunday—they remained there on the Sunday on the Sunday night and on the Monday the case was heard—I wear to the Court on the Monday—McKenna and Bray took me. Mrs. Condon and Nellie Bell together—at the Court Osborn showed me the statements, and said all I had to say was that I him in June. July and August, and that I had identified the gentle<lb/>man—that was all I had to say in the Divorce Court and that I had identified the photograph of the gentleman—he said I should be all right—he looked out some papers—he did not read anything to me—I saw some papers, but I did not see what the writing was—when I saw Osborn. of course I asked him what I had to say, so he pulled out the papers and looked at them, and said:' Oh, it is June, July, and August. If you remember that you will not be asked anything else," and he told me I should be all right—I do not remember any<lb/>thing else he said—I do not think I said anything to him—he looked up some papers that he had in his hand then—not long after that I went in the witness box, was sworn, and gave evidence on oath—after the trial that night I stayed at Matcham's with Mrs. Condon and Louisa Ford—McKenna and Bray went with me—the next day I went back to Plymouth—McKenna and Bray took me to Paddington and saw me off—at the station I was paid my fees as a witness by McKenna—at Paddington Station before leaving for Plymouth I signed this document: "Exchange Chambers, 56, Copthall Avenue. E.C., London, 25/11 02. <hi rend="italic">Re</hi> pollard. Received £4 witness's fee. Maud Goodman"—the other three who had come with me, N. Bell, M. Condon, and Louisa Ford, received £3 apiece as witness's fees at the same time, and signed immediately after me—I was the only witness that was called of the four that were brought up—I got £4 and Louisa Ford only £3, because I asked McKenna for the other sovereign on Paddington Station—I next saw Bray after the trial, the early part of the year 1903 I think first in the street at Plymouth—I went to No.3, and he asked me if I had heard anything about the Pollard case—I said that I had not—he said if I did hear anything about it I must stick to what I had said—I do not know what answer I made—I suppose he meant what I had already said in the Divorce Court—up to that time I had not seen the gentleman I afterwards knew by the name of Murray, and when he was asking whether I had heard any thing about the Pollard case. I told him I had not—after that interview, Mrs. Stitson, a daughter of Mrs. Condon's, wrote this letter for me—I told her what to write—I was living at 3 Queen Street at the time—it was written <hi rend="italic">there—(Dated March 27th.</hi> 1903:) "Sir, Mr. Osborn, since I saw Mr. Bray on Monday (<hi rend="italic">the Monday preceding the 27th would be the 23rd March</hi>) Mr. Murray solicitor, has been to see me about the Pollard case: he tells me the King's Proctor has taken the case up, and I have had to make statements when I first met you, and during the time the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170103"/>
               <p>case came off, and they also want me to have an interview with Pollard himself. Of course I did not know anything about it when Mr. Bray were down, but I have since found out this has been going on for some time between Louie Ford and Miss Bell, and I do not know what has been said; of course Mr. Murray tells me quite a different tale than what Mrs. Pollard stated in Court, so I thought I would write to you as I did not know how to act in seeing Pollard. I saw Murray yesterday, and expecting to see him again during the week. Do not communicate with 3, Summerland Place, as this is private. Let me know what is best. Yours truly, Maud Goodman."—In answer I received this letter from Osborn and Osborn, dated March 28th—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) "Exchange Chambers, 56, Copthall Avenue. London Wall. Dear madam, re Pollard, We are in receipt of yours of yesterday's date, and note what you say, that a gentleman named Mr. Murray, who you state is a solicitor, has been to see you about this case. Whether this gentleman comes from the King's Proctor or not, of course, we do not know, but we think before you give any information respecting this matter you should be satisfied that this gentleman comes from the King's Proctor, and ask him to give you his card, and if you will send this to us we will write to the King's Proctor and ascertain whether this is right or not; but we have every reason to believe that this man does not come from the King's Proctor at all, and, moreover, we do not think the King's Proctor would send a solicitor, and we do not find any solicitor of the name of Murray in the Law List as practising at Plymouth. With regard to the matters that they ask you about, there can be no harm whatever in telling the truth and stating exactly what was stated to us as being the facts in connection with this matter. There is no reason why you should see Mr. Pollard or have any unpleasantness caused you in this case, and if you are caused any unpleasantness by anyone you can communicate with us, and we feel quite sure, if the King's Proctor is making inquiries, he would only make inquiries to ascertain the truth. We shall be glad to hear further from you in the matter, and there is no harm in informing the person who comes to you that you have com<lb/>municated with us and informed us what has been stated to you. You stated in your letter that Mr. Murray tells you quite a different talc to what Mrs. Pollard stated in Court. We shall be glad to know what this is, because Mrs. Pollard's evidence was given in respect of matters quite different to yours, and, therefore, we cannot understand why, if Mr. Murray comes from the King's Proctor, he should refer to Mrs. Pollard's evidence, because in seeing you his inquiry would only relate to the evidence that you gave, and to ascertain whether this is correct or not, because you do not know Mrs. Pollard, and have never spoken to her, therefore any evidence that Mrs. Pollard gave could not in any way affect you. Yours faithfully, Osborn and Osborn."—I replied on the 28th, and forwarded the name and address of Messrs. Watts, Ward and Anthony, the representatives of the King's Proctor in Plymouth—on April 3rd I received this further letter: "Dear Madam, re Pollard. We are in receipt of yours of the 1st inst., from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170104"/>
               <p>which we observe that Mr. Murray is now a clerk to Messrs. Watts, Ward and Anthony; we do not know who these gentlemen represent or whether they represent the King's Proctor. We have, however, written to the Kind's Proctor on the matter. We should be glad to know what further was stated to you when Mr. Murray called on you last, and if you hear anything further herein, we shall be glad if you would com<lb/>municate with us on the matter. As we before stated, there is no harm in your giving the same information which you gave to us in the matter. Yours faithfully, Osborn and Osborn."—After that letter had been written I saw Mr. Murray again, more than once—I remember attending at his office in May—I was with Nellie Bell—I did not then recognise Pollard except as a gentleman I had seen on the Hoe, but not as a gentleman I had stopped with, or was supposed to have—I said I did not know the gentleman—I have never had any intercourse with Thomas Pollard—I am quite sure—Mr. Murray and another gentleman were present—Bell and Ford were rot—I moved to No. 1, Summerland Terrace, I think the end of May, or in June—after I had removed there I remember seeing Bray—he love that I had seen McKenna, but I am not quite sure whether I saw him first, or Bray—I saw Bray, I think, at 3, Summer-land Place—I remember that I had seen McKenna first—he went and fetched some pipers—with the papers in his hand, he had some conversation with me—I did not sign any one of the papers he brought to me—<hi rend="italic">some</hi> days after, Bray told me Osborn had sent him down—as McKenna could not do anything with me, he had sent Bray down to see what he could do—he wanted me to sign this paper—I did not read it; I looked at it—I cannot say if it was type-written or written—I should say it was like this one—I do not think he read it to me—I said I knew I had made a mistake, and I would not sign any more papers—he went across to No. 1, Summerland Terrace with me, from No. 3, Summerland Place—my land-lady at No. I Summerland Terrace was Mrs. Bolt—in there he gave me plenty of refreshment—I do not know who it was fetched it, but I know we had it—he sent out for some whisky—it was in the evening, the interview at No. 3 was in the afternoon—he stayed with me at No. 3 until he went across to No. 1, Summerland Terrace—he left me some<lb/>where about 11 o'clock at night—he came to me in the afternoon about 5 or 6 o'clock; I do not quite remember the time—he was with me a great many hours that afternoon and evening—he was trying to make me sign the paper—I was not going to sign the paper when I knew I had made a mistake—I told him so—he asked Mrs. Bolt to fetch the pen and ink for me, and she did so—that was to enable me to sign it—I was drinking more or less all day—I did not sign it—he left about 11 at night, taking away the document with him unsigned—he called the next morning about 9 o'clock, very early, at 1, Summerland Terrace, where I was living, for me to sign the paper—he produced it again—he was not with me long then—I said I would not sign it—he went away with the paper and I did not see him again after that—I did not sign the paper—the last I saw of it was when he took it away with him—with that document in</p>

               <p>front of me I say that at no time do I think I saw that statement sufficiently to say what was in it at the time—looking at it now I find crossed out in pencil and underlined—"We then went to Minnie Wilson's house, where also were I, Louie Ford and Nellie Bell. Mr. Osborn had us there to make a statement to the effect that I knew the gentle<lb/>man "—I remember this being read to me at No. 3, Summerland place, and of course I told them it was wrong—I think McKenna read it when he came—I never signed any statement at Minnie Wilson's house—this was not read to me at No. 3, Summerland Place—I think McKenna struck those words out because I told him it was wrong—on arrival in London to give my evidence on the trial of the King's Proctor's intervention at Paddington I saw Bray on the platform when the train arrived—he said "I want a word with you in a minute"—I did not answer; I passed on—I have never gone at any time by the name of Maud Baker—I did not and do not know any woman of that name in Plymouth.</p>

I remember in March of last year Mr. Murray came and saw me at Summerland Place—some woman from the house was sent to find me, and I was brought to Summerland Place—I did not know who Mr. Murray was before I went there—from the time I saw him in March, 1903, I have not seen him upon many occasions—he got me to sign one or two statements—not a number—two, I think; I do not think any more—when he saw me at Summerland Place he might have said that poor Pollard had been badly treated, that he had not treated his wife badly, and had not been guilty of cruelty—something like that—I do not remember the conversation—it took place in March, 1903—I remember saying to you at Bow Street, "I do not know that I remember distinctly about either the 10th July or the 27th March"—I would remember March 27th better than what took place the year before—when I went to No. 3, Summerland Place, I saw Mr. Murray, and he told me that the King's Proctor had intervened, and he said that they would like me to see Pollard, and I think it was to see if I had made a mis<lb/>take or not; in regard to the cruelty he might have said that, but it did not matter to me whether he said it or not, because I was not interested in Pollard or Mrs. Pollard—if Osborn had told me as a gentleman who Pollard was, of course I should not have had anything to do with the case at all—what I had heard in the Divorce Court was the evidence of Mrs. Pollard—I do not remember what Mr. Murray told me, but I know this much, that he told me to tell the truth; he did not ask me to tell lies for money—I do not quite remember what the different tale was' of Pollard in the Divorce Court from that of Mr. Murray—that did not interest me—I was not told it was a pity I had done Pollard an injury, and that now he had nothing to live on—I was not told anything of the kind—nothing about his allowance—there might have been something said in regard to the cruelty, but in regard to his allowance or drinking habits I knew nothing about it—I intended my letter to be the truth—every time I have given evidence in this case I have always told the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170106"/>
               <p>truth to the best of my ability—I told you at the police-court, "This is the third time I have given evidence—every time I have given evidence I have always told the truth to the best of my ability"—that is correct—whenever I have written letters in the case, those letters have always been truthful—I went on to say, "And when I was in the Divorce Court the first time the judge told me I need not give evidence if I did not like; and I said I was willing to give my evidence, and then gave it"—that is right—with regard to the Pollard case, the total sum that I received was £7—this is correct, "The money I received had nothing to do with the evidence I gave"—I did not trouble to think whether I knew the gentleman or not when I signed the paper when Osborn offered me the sovereign—the £4 I had for the evidence I gave and the sovereign was for signing the statement, and the 10s. was for the trouble of coming down in the afternoon, and the 30s. was with the subpoena I had—I was four days in London—I got £4 with regard to that—I did not get the sovereign for the trouble of going on the Hoe—I was offered the sovereign to sign the statement—I did not ask for anything; I was offered half a sovereign for the trouble of my coming down in the afternoon—I remember writing to Osborn asking him for something for the trouble I had been put to—I got £1 for that—I got 10s. for my trouble in coming down on the 10th July, and afterwards £1—since I saw Mr. Murray in March, down to the present time, I have been living in Plymouth; and going about in Plymouth in the same way, living the same life, and meeting the same people—with regard to a woman living the life that I and the others were living we can please ourselves as to whether we give away a man who has been with us—I never troubled to think of such a thing—we can please ourselves—that is my only answer—there might have been a man with me in June at 3, Summerland Place, who was like Pollard—I said at the police court: "It is true a man did stay with me in June whom I had in my mind, a man whose name I did not know"—I do not remember saying that I stopped with a gentleman on June 3rd—I understand what I say affects the prisoners, but it does not matter to me, I shall speak the truth—I remember being at the Bow Street police court, being examined there, and giving evidence, that you asked me questions, that my answers were written down, that after they were written down they were read over to me, and that I swore to the truth of them, but I do not remember saying I stopped with any gentleman on June 3rd; I might have said I stopped with a gentleman, but I am sure I did not say when——that man I had in mind as having stayed with me in June was very much like Pollard—if he was not Pollard I have never seen him since—I do not know whether the Judge was kind or not; I thought I was speaking the truth when I gave evidence—I had no reason for not giving evidence then—I had Pollard in mind, but I go with different gentle<lb/>men at 3, Summerland Place—when I saw Osborn on July 10th, 1902, I was rather annoyed at having been brought there; because I was brought down about a divorce case, and about the manner I was brought down—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170107"/>
               <p>do not know that I showed it—when I went into the room I think Osborn showed me the same photograph that was handed me in the Divorce Court when I was before the Judge—I believed it was the gentle<lb/>man who stayed with me at No. 3 in June who was much like Pollard, and I went to No. 3 and saw Nellie Bell; it was she who told me it was about a divorce case—when I heard it was about a divorce case I said I would not say anything more, because I was not going to give a man away—it did not make any difference to me; if Osborn had come to me and told me what the case was I should not have said anything; he came to me and said it was a friend, and I looked at the photograph, and I said I thought I knew the man; they made me believe I did know him; it does not matter to me whether I knew him or not—after I had seen Nellie Bell I told him I was not going to say anything, but I did not say that I knew the gentleman—I did say: "After he had gone"—that is after Osborn had gone—"I told Minnie Wilson that I thought that I knew the gentleman, but it was not my business to give him away because the information was wanted for a divorce case"—I was not influenced by the fact that the information was wanted for a divorce case, but I did not want to give the man away—nothing of the sort—if I really thought I knew the man I should say so—I was told I did know him; I did not have any choice to think whether I knew him or not—if I said to Minnie Wilson that I thought I knew the man, but it was not my business to give him away, it is not to say that I did know the gentleman—Mr. Murray has not taken a statement from me lately nor read my evidence over to me—at the police court I came to town with Mrs. Emma Smith and two detectives—I travelled up with them—they never mentioned the case—I do not know their names—this time I came with Mrs. Smith, a detective, and Mr. Legge—there were one or two others, but I do not know their names—I have stayed at the Ship Hotel—I have never talked about the case, or about my evidence at all—it might have been talked about, but not to me—I saw Osborn at Trafalgar Street—Louie Ford was there—when I saw Osborn at Trafalgar Street, Minnie Wilson said in the presence of Osborn what I had said to her: that I did not want to give the man away because the evidence was wanted for a divorce case—she reminded me of what I had said, that I had said I might know the gentleman but it was not my business to give him away—I did not say anything about what the evidence was wanted for; she said of course I had got to sign the paper—that is all—Osborn asked me to sign it and he said I could say what I knew and it would do me no harm—I did not want to sign a statement in the presence of Minnie Wilson—I said I would be at the Victoria Hotel at 9 o'clock, and if I signed the statement I would sign it there and not in Trafalgar Street—the interview in Trafalgar Street did not last very long—the Victoria Hotel is a place that at that time I very often went to—it is a place with a very large open bar, and people were standing four or five deep there—it is a place in which there were usually at that time a good many people in the evening, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170108"/>
               <p>not a place I wanted to sign a statement in—I suppose it was because I did not want to sign a statement before a lot of people that I went across the road to the Swan—I know I went across there to sign the statement—Osborn suggested my going there—I said I would not sign the statement, and he suggested my going across to the private bar—I said I would not sign a statement before a lot of people—I do not know whether it is true that that was why I went across to the Swan—of course he suggested my going, and I went—I do not know whether I said I would not sign before a lot of people; I know Osborn wanted me to go across into a private place—the fact of the matter was, I did not know there was a private bar across there; it was the first time I had been there when Osborn took me there—I might have been unwilling to sign anything before a lot of people, but I did not suggest going there; it was suggested—I was made to believe I was telling the truth, whether I did or not—I have said this: "When I signed the statement that night I believed I was telling the truth"—very likely I believed I was telling the truth that the photograph was the photograph of the man who had stayed with me in June—the man who had stayed with me in June was very like the photograph—I remember giving evidence about this in the King's Proctor's case, and making some statements about it, but not saying at Bow Street police court that Osborn showed me a sovereign before I signed it—the only day I saw him, until I saw him just before the trial, was July 10th—nothing was said then about my evidence; the only matter that was discussed was that I was to come up to town—I do not think anybody had told me that I need not go up to town if I did not want to, but Osborn told me if I did not go they would make me go—I did not want to go to London—I did not want to leave Plymouth—when I saw the man that was pointed out to me on the Hoe, I said I could not tell him by his back—I said, "Let me walk on the Hoe and see him face to face, and I shall be able to tell you if I know him"—at that time Pollard was walking on the Hoe—I wanted to see his face—there was nothing to prevent my seeing him quite well—I did see his face—he was very like the gentleman who had stayed with me in June—I did not trouble to think anything about it, whether he was or not; I was told he was—I did not form an opinion whether he was the same man or not—I did not say I thought he was, or anything of the kind—I do not remember ever having said that the man stopped with me—I wrote, "Dear Sir,—Just a line to let you know that the gentleman Mr. Bray pointed out to me last Saturday in the presence of Louie Ford was the gentleman I stopped with at Mrs. Condon's house, No. 3, Summerland Place"—a few days afterwards, but that is not to say I said on the Hoe I had stopped with the gentleman—I was told that I had stopped with him, and I did not trouble to think whether I had or not, but I since know that I have not stopped with him—when I saw Pollard I knew I had made a mistake—I did not want to deceive Osborn at all—my friend that was with me said. "That is the same gentleman as you were with the other night," and I thought it was, and I said it was, but I did not</p>

               <p>think I was doing any wrong in saying it was—that it has nothing to do with Mr. Murray—I was not going to say I had stopped with a gentle<lb/>man if I had not—he was pointed out to me at once by Louie Ford passing in the street; she said she had seen him leave Summerland Place—I told Mr. Murray on March 27th at Summerland Place, when I gave my description of this to Mr. Murray: "After<lb/>wards I heard nothing more until Mr. Bray came to me asking me if I would identify the man in the photograph; I went up in the town with Louie Ford and Bray and stood on the steps of the Royal. Bray then said, "There is our man," and looking across I saw a man, and was not then sure as his back was towards me, and I said I would go on to the Hoe where the man was going and see his face. I did go up and saw the man and I recognised him"—that is what I told Mr. Murray at the first interview—I told him the truth, as I told every<lb/>body else the truth, or what I believed to be the truth at the moment—I suppose I told Mr. Murray on March 27th, "I saw a man and was not sure, as his back was towards me, and I said I would gsso on to the Hoe where the man was going, and see his face; I did go up and saw the man and recog<lb/>nised him; I have seen the man since, and I still think it is the man who stayed with me in the month of June"—I did not walk past Pollard—I did not say I recognised him—I was told that he recognised me—I told Osborn in my letter not to rely on Minnie Wilson, because she was a person who was not to be trusted as regards the truth—I do not know anything about myself, but I know she had said, as I said, that I stopped there with a gentleman—I myself cannot be bought with money as she could—I would not, for money, injure a person—I was cautioning Osborn about Minnie Wilson in the letter I wrote when I was at Trafalgar Street—nobody told me what to say in that letter—I intended to tell the truth as far as I knew—I never wrote any letter to Osborn telling him that Pollard was not the man who had stayed with me in June—after August I had no communication about this matter until shortly before the trial, when I was seen about coming up to town—I did not say that I had had advice upon the matter, and that I was not compelled to come up, and that I did not want anyone calling at my house about the matter—nothing of the sort—I remember telling you that at Bow Street—it was on the Saturday that Osborn saw me and said I was to go to London—I had been served with what I now know is a subpoena—he said I would have to go—at that time when he spoke about going to London, nothing at all was said about my evidence; was only a question of my going to London—this is my account of it, "Mr. Osborn said I was to go London that day. I said I would not go. Osborn said I should have to go I said, 'If I have got to go I will go.' I do not remember Osborn saying more"—we stayed at Matcham's Hotel both times that we came up on the divorce case—when I came up on the divorce case I was taken to a concert—when I came to London on the King's Procter's case I was taken to the Tivoli Music Hall—I said at the police court: "On the Monday I went to the Courts</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170110"/>
               <p>from Matcham's. We all six wont, including Bray and McKenna. At the Courts I saw Osborn in the corridor. Ho read over a statement. I think it was the one where I said I indentified the gentleman"—that was what I told you before—"' I saw Mr. Osborn in the corridor. He read over a statement. I think it was the one where I said I identified the gentleman"—I did not say I think at all; it was the state<lb/>ment to tell me what I had to say when I got in the Court—I think this is my first account of it: "On the Monday I went to the Courts from Matcham's. We all went. At the Court I saw Mr. Osborn in the corridor. He road over a statement. I think it was the one where I said I identified the gentlemen."—I can assure you Osborn did not read anything to me; he only told me what to tell in the Court, when I met him, when I identified the photograph and signed my name to the paper—he did not read a statement to me; he only told me what I was to say in the Court—what I said at the Police Court was wrong—I am tolling you as far as I can remember; of course, I cannot remember everything—I heard Nellie Bell examined in the King's Proctor's case—she was examined about the journey up to town—if she hoard it said that I was to confine myself strictly to the truth, or rather to say only that which I was sure of, I did not—I remembered having a talk with Mr. Murray, but I do not remember having any writing taken down—I did not believe I had made a statement, or that he had even asked me to do so, that I remember—Nellie Boll was at No.3, Summerland Place, when he came There—I found out that he had been seeing Nellie Bell and Louie Ford the day that I wrote to Osborn—I remember this statement; "I. Maud Goodman, say that I have to-day had pointed out to me a gentleman whose name I am told is Pollard. I have previously identified the photo of that gentleman and put my initials to the same. The gentleman I have to-day had pointed out to me is the gentleman who went with me to 3, Summerland Place"—the next statement I made was the statement made to Mr. Murray—I made a statement first to Osborn which was signed at the Swan—the third statement I signed for Mr. Murray—one is the statement I have no recollection of at all; it was read to me, I think, at 3, Summerland Place—I never told Mr. Murray that I had stopped with a gentleman at all—(<hi rend="italic">Reading from the first statement Mr. Murray got from the witness:</hi>) "Mr. Osborn and I went to No.3, and I then showed the photo to others in the house, and found out they had seen the photo before, and that it was about a divorce case. When I returned to the room to Mr. Osborn he told me who he was. and that he was engaged on the divorce case. I told him I thought I had seen the man once, and stayed at No. 3 one night with him"—I never told Osborn anything of the kind—I told him it was about a divorce case, and he told me I could say what I knew, and it would do me no harm, as I should hear nothing more about it—I never remember saying,' When I returned to the room to Mr. Osborn he told me who he was, and that he was engaged in the divorce case. I told him I thought I</p>

               <p>had seen the man once, and stayed at No.3 one night with him."—it does not matter to me—I can assure you I do not remember saying that—the conversation I had with Osborn when I went into the room was "It is about a divorce case; I will have nothing more to do with it"—he said, "There is no harm in telling what you know, as you will hear nothing more about it," and he wanted me to sign a paper, and I would not, but made an appoint<lb/>ment to meet him, and he gave me half a sovereign for the trouble of coming down—that is all I know about it—I do not know that Mr. Murray invented this—I am simply telling you what I said myself—I see my signature 10 it—I supposed I was signing right when I signed it—I signed it to say that I made a mistake in the gentleman—it was read to me as far as I remember—I did not tell Mr. Murray that I had stopped with him—I told him I thought I did—I never told anyone that I had stopped with him—I thought I had seen the gentleman—Osborn showed me a sovereign and told me if I did not do it someone else would—he told me the man's name was Pollard, when I went back into the parlour of No. 3 with the photograph—I did not know the name of the man who had stayed with me in June—I did not tell one of these girls that the man who had stayed with me in June had asked me, while he was with me, whether I had given him away at all, nor that anything was said about the man's name being Tom—I did not know the man's name who stayed with me in June—until I saw the gentleman in Mr. Murray's office I still thought he was the same man, or very like the same man—it was always Mr. Murray who saw me—it may have been once or twice between March 27th and May 14th—I never saw Pollard until I saw him in Watts, Ward &amp; Anthony's office—I did not write that second statement; I is nothing to do with me whatever; I did not write it or anyone for me—I do not know who wrote it—I believe Mr. Murray brought it for me to sign—I cannot tell you if it was at the office or 3, Summerland Place, I do not remember—I do not remember Mr. Murray writing statements at 3, Summerland Place or, as it is called, turning a brothel into an office, nor do I remember Mr. Murray writing that statement at 3, Summerland Place—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>) "In the event of Mr. Murray desiring to see me at his office I am willing to attend"—that is not to say he turned a brothel into an office—I do not remember where I signed this statement—I only saw Mr. Murray; I did not see any other gentlemen—I can assure you nobody else wrote this for me; it was brought to me—it must have been Mr. Murray, if any gentleman—I am not quite sure; it is so long ago; I cannot remember—I only know I saw Mr. Murray in connection with this case, and another gentleman I saw in his office; that is all I know—Nellie Bell used to go with me to Mr. Murray's office—she did not bring me that statement—it-was already written out when it was brought. I think—("I believe now that in identifying Mr. Pollard I have made a great mistake. In the event of Mr. Murray desiring to see me at his office I am willing to attend"—</p>

               <p>every time I received a message from Mr. Murray's office it was through Nellie Bell—when I went on Ma)" 4th to see the man, Pollard came into the room and sat down—I was told to have a good look at him and see it I recognised the gentleman—I looked at him and I saw he had never stopped with me, and I said so—I never spoke to him—I did not know who the gentleman was who was coming in—as he came in I was asked if it was the gentleman I stopped with; I said, "No, I do not know him"—that was all that was said—he did not speak to me—he sat down; I had a good look at him, and I said, "No, I do not know the gentleman; he never stopped with me"—that is all that occurred—I had not the advantage of hearing his voice—I did not take the trouble to look at him when I saw him on the Hoe—he was very like the man I saw on the Hoe—not as like him as the man I saw on the Hoe was to the man who slept with me—he was not the man that stopped with me—he might have been very like him but he was not the man—this is right, what I said: "I did not speak to him at the office, so I was not assisted by any conversation; there was no question of his voice; he sat down for a few minutes, then he went out of the room and left me there"—I do not remember saying that I knew the reason I had made a mistake was on account of his voice—I signed another statement on May 14th—I said. "I have now seen Mr. Pollard in Mr. Murray's room; I now say that I have never stopped with him at any time, and I have never spoken to him in my life that I am aware of; I have never stopped with him. The gentleman I stopped with and to whom I referred in my evidence was much like Mr. Pollard, but I am absolutely certain, now that I see Mr. Pollard face to face, that he is not the man I referred to. I did not identify him with any sense of doing wrong, and I am sorry if I have done him an injury"—I do not remember their telling me about the wrong I had done him and the injury to poor Pollard—I do not remember saying such words—I did not think about it—if I had done so I should have said so—I should not have thought of putting it on someone else—those who communicated with me never told me about Pollard—nobody told me to say anything, and nobody had said anything about my having done an injury—I did not think I had, and when I saw the man, I knew that I did not know him—I had never heard Pollard speak that I remember—I said, "There is no question, now that I have heard Mr. Pollard speak, that I must have been mistaken; when Mr. Osborn first showed me the photo I thought I knew the man as a tobacconist who lives at Plymouth"—I had never up to May 14th said that I thought I knew the man as a tobacconist who lived at Plymouth—I never said "I mentioned the name of the gentleman I thought it was to Mr. Osborn"—I do not remember any further statement—I saw Nellie Bell perhaps every day—I do not think I saw Mr. Murray again afterwards—the letter that Osborn wrote to me I gave to Murray—my only answer to Osborn was sending him a piece of paper with the name of Murray on it and Ward, Watts &amp; Anthony—I never wrote Osborn any letter to say I had seen Pollard and thought I had made a mistake</p>

               <p>or that I had made a mistake—McKenna called on me in the early part of the evening—he went and fetched some paper, and he commenced to read it, and I told him I had made a mistake—he asked me to read the statement and see if there were any statements I wished to correct—did not read the statement of July 10th—there was a statement he read to me where it is struck out, but he did not read any when he came that evening—he came in the early part of the evening and went away and came back again with those papers—at Bow Street I said, "McKenna had a conversation with me. I mentioned the case to him, and he said he was down on different business. I saw him again afterwards. He did not produce anything then. The second time I saw him he fetched some statements. He came to me at 3, Summerland Place. He said that he had come from the defendant Osborn. He told me to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth"—that is when he came in the evening—I told him that I found I made a mistake in the gentleman, so he said if I found I had made a mistake say so, and tell the truth—after that he went back to London—he said he was going back to Osborn, and they sent Bray down to me—I told McKenna I had made a mistake, and he told me I had done quite right in saying I had made a mistake—then they sent Bray down to me, I had said something to Mr. Kenna as to my having a doubt—I told him that I had a doubt about the man—I remember the fact of some alterations being made by him—Ford said she had seen Pollard leave No. 3 some time during the morning—early in the case in June or July I told Nellie Bell about the man who had slept with me inviting me to breakfast at a place called the Cafe—Nellie Bell was not generally present when I signed the statements for Mr. Murray—she was present the first time on March 27th when she went to Mr. Murray's office with me—I said at the Police Court: "When at the King's Proctor's case, I could not remember if the man who stayed with me in June had done so more than once"—I remember that between August 2nd and the trial in November I had nothing to do with Mrs. Wilson or Thompson.</p>

               <p>on the 10th July, nobody had soon me about this case at all, or about Pollard—I had not up to that seen the photograph or anybody what<lb/>soever in connection with the case—after the interviews with Osborn that I have told you of, he put me forward as a trustworthy witness in Mr. Justice Barnes' Court—from the time I saw Pollard in Mr. Murray's office I have never said that he was the man who slept with me in June—I have no doubt about it now—I had stopped with a gentle<lb/>man some little time before that who I thought was like the photo<lb/>graph—I had no date in my mind—Osborn did not ask me about any date—I am living at 1, Summerland Place now—I never lived at 3 Summerland Place; I used to go there but not live there—in June I made the aquaintance of gentlemen at Plymouth—I do not know how many—I was at that time with Miss Ford; she was not with me at all times—I went with gentlemen to a house of accommodation frequently—Mr. Murray as early as March 27th wanted me to have an interview with Pollard as I said in my letter—I remember getting this letter from Osborn: "There is no reason why you should see Mr. Pollard, or have any unpleasantness caused you in this case"—I remember sending up the address of Watts <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> anthony to Osborn—I got it at Mr. Murray's office—I recollect going there and asking for that address which they gave me—had with me when I went to Mr. Murray's office Osborn's letter, in which he said, "There is no reason why you should see Mr. Pollard"—I do not remember now whether I made any statement to Mr. Murray—I did not say anything about seeing Mr. Pollard that I remember—I thought I recognised the photograph as a person who had slept with me, because Osborn said that it was a friend of his, so I thought I must know him—I said in my statement,' I asked Mr. Osborn why he wanted to know, and he said he required to know because he had heard that this gentleman had stayed with me at a house"—he could not say he heard; he said it was a friend of his—on the 10th, the first day I saw Osborn, I went up to No. 3 and then back to No. 9, and then went away—I said something afterwards to Minnie Wilson before I saw Osborn again—she was in the house when I wont back with Osborn—I went away then—I saw Minnie Wilson when I went back to the house—I did not see her again till I saw Osborn and Minnie Wilson together in Trafalgar Street—I had a conversation with Minnie Wilson when I got back to No 9—I went away from Minnie Wilson's first—I left Osborn and Minnie Wilson there as far as I know—I did not see Minnie Wilson from the time I left No. 9 till I saw her at Trafalgar Street—I did not make any state<lb/>ment to her after I left No. 9 till the time I saw her at Trafalgar Street—since I gave evidence in the Divorce Court at the King's Proctor's intervention, I do not think I have spoken to Mr. Murray—no statement has been taken from me since—I was present through that trial, examined and cross-examined by Sir Edward Clarke—I do not think Louie Ford was there: she was examined, but not while I was there; nor was Minnie Wilson examined while I was there; nor Thompson—I went away before the case was over.</p>

I live at 22, <hi rend="italic">Selborne</hi> Road, Wood Green—I was Originally in the Metropolitan Police, from which I retired after twenty-five Yars' service, as a pensioned sergeant—in 1895 I went into the employ<lb/>ment of Slater's Agency, and remained there until July, 1903—I know Scott; he had the Agency under the name of Slater—at the Agency he was also known as Captain Scott and Captain Brown—I always thought he was the proprietor—I know Henry; he was the manager at the Agency—I did various things there, office work, and copying reports, and so on—my office was on the first floor, and was practically the first office that anyone would come to; the door was always open, and anybody coming to the place had to see me first—I kept a call-book—I know Smith; he was employed by the Agency, as a private inquiry agent, I suppose; his employment began in my time—I think ho was there about a year or two; I cannot toll without the book—I know Bray; he was employed by the Agency as a private detective; he was called Bray in the office—I cannot say how long he was there; he came before me, and remained on. after me—I knew Davies; ho was employed by the Agency as a private detective—I cannot say what was the length of his service; ho was there before me, and remained on after me—I should think about thirty were employed there as private inquiry agents—I know Osborn—I saw him at Slater's Office, at 1, Basinghall Street, several time—I invariably put his name down in the call book if he called—he used to come generally even day on some case or other; ho came sometimes more than once a day; I might put him down twice, but it was an understood thing his coming there; he came in and out as he liked—I might enter his name or I might not—there was private telephonic communication from Slater's to Osborn's office; no other people had private telephones to Slater's—during my time, Osborn had two offices, one at London Wall, and the other at 2, Coleman Street—he removed from one to the other—ho was in Copthall Avenue, and then he went to Coleman Street, which is quite close to Basinghall Street—I had some business cards in my office given, me by Osborn in relation to his business; I have not got one—Henry and Osborn suggested that I should keep those cards in my desk so that they could give them to clients when they came—to introduce business, I presume: it was simply for that; I did not give any of them to clients; I gave them to Henry, or anybody who asked for them: I kept them there for that purpose, to give them away—I gave them to the private inquiry agents; in fact, they used to help themselves if they wanted them; they knew where they were kept, and they used to take them—at I, Basinghall Street there wore three floors occupied by the Agency comprising twelve rooms: my room was on the first floor, and the other three upon that floor were used as consulting rooms—there were four rooms upon the second floor: one was the general office occupied by Cartwright and two clerks, and another was termed Slater's office, and was generally occupied by Hamilton; the next one to that was occupied by Henry and another clerks; and the back room was used as a consulting room and a sort of store room for books and papers—there were four rooms on the third floor also; of the two front rooms, one was used by representatives—next to that was another office used by two lady clerks; the next was used for</p>

September 22nd, and Simmonds left four days afterwards—I do not know that he was discharged; I believe he left of his own accord—that was on a Friday—I did! not know that whilst those three wore still in Slater's employ that they had agreed to set up a rival agency and to get Slater's business if they could—I never heard anything about that whilst I was there, or whilst they were there—I got to know it afterwards—I did not know that the idea was that whilst they were in Slater's employ and pay, they should start a rival agency and get Slater's business—I know that Simmonds' business was started' to compete with.

Someone called upon me from the Treasury to take me to the King's Proctor. That was after I had seen Cartwright and Simmonds"—that is right—I presumed that Cartwright and Sim<lb/>monds were indirectly in connection with the King's Proctor—I said at Bow Street: "The reports sent to Osborn would, I think, go to him in the usual way from the general office. After reports had gone to him, he would call on me in my office on his way upstairs. On one occasion I. said to him:' I understand from Mr. Henry that Davies reports are not required': Osborn said,' That is right: there is nothing in them"—that, is so—that matter that I was speaking of was something that had occurred about twelve months before I left—I did not make a note of the conversation; it was said in the doorway, on the landing, by the front consulting room; they stood at the door in the passage—I was in such a position that I could see them both; the conversation was directly opposite the door—after the conversation they went into some room—I had nothing to do with seeing any clients—after a caller came, if I knew <hi rend="italic">the</hi> name, I would enter it, and then telephone to the general office and communicate with somebody there—apart from divorce matters, there were inquiries upon a great variety of matters—I knew Osborn was a member of a firm of solicitors, Osborn &amp; Osborn—there were two, one Albert and one Oscar—it was very seldom that Oscar called, but he did sometimes—in 1902, there were several divorce oases going on—when Osborn came in and passed my room, he would go up to the general office—as a rule, I was on the first floor, and the other offices were higher up—the entries of Osborn's name that my attention <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been called to are entries on pages where there are a number of other names mentioned whose business I should have no knowledge of—I do not know the date of the conversation with Osborn with reference to the reports—I used to copy reports and do all manner of things—I asked' Osborn if I had copied the reports in the Pollard case correctly; he said, "Yes," I only want copies of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> originals"—as a rule, in reports, they write up the history of the case, but that was a fair copy of each report—I believe he was coming into the office when he said that.</p>

Henry was manager—he was employed the greater part of every day in seeing callers; that took up nearly all his time—Hamilton's position was not similar to Henry's; he used to come and sit up in Slater's room, and used' to go out on business, but I do not know what he did—lie did not see clients of late years—in 1895, when I first went there, he used to see clients, <hi rend="italic">end</hi> did so for two or three years afterwards, and then 'he left off seeing them and Henry saw them, all—I do not think he saw any at the end of the time—I believe he was a man in authority there—I cannot say that I looked upon him</p>

               <p>as being in equal authority with Davies—I was the first person to arrive in the morning—Cartwright did not come next; all of them came in then at different times—I cannot tall you what Cartwright did upstairs—the reports were sorted eventually and put into separate envelopes, one foolscap envelope for each case; the reports would be folded up to be put into the envelopes; they would be turned over once—I saw Davies' reports from Plymouth—I looked through Pollard's case, and found that the reports were, not there from Jersey; this one, of February 13th (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is in his handwriting—they are all on half sheets of note-paper; I cannot say that if the report; came on half sheets of notepaper, and half of it was not written on that thai, would be torn off before it was put away in the big envelope—when I came to copy them out, they were generally on half sheets of notepaper with the other halves torn off—these have never been folded, so they must have reached the office in envelopes of the same size as this is: envelopes of this size were not in common use in the office—I never saw these reports before I copied them; and I have never seen them since—I cannot recollect exactly what documents were amongst them and what were not—I did not see any letter from Jersey—I do not remember seeing this note dated! March 12th from the Star Hotel—I am not prepared to swear at this distance of time that that that was not there—this one dated March 14th, is on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> same sized paper as the one of March 12th, and also purports to come from the Star Hotel—I am not prepared to swear that that was not there—it was nothing to do with me what went on with regard to the reports between Cartwright and' the agents—I heard there was a petition in the Pollard case—I forget now how long after that it would be that Henry told me to copy <hi rend="italic">the</hi> reports out—I remember Cartwright leaving on September 22nd—I was asked in the Divorce Court, "Do you remember Wright's?" and I said, "Yes"—that is Cartwright—"Did' you copy out the reports before Wright left or after?" and my answer was "Before Wright left"—that is right.</p>

There was a system at Slater's of employing detectives known as the daily system; detectives went to the office to see whether their services were required, and if they were not they went away, not being paid—I think Smith was on that system during the latter part of the time—detectives were employed both for watching and making inquiries—I cannot say if Smith was only employed in making inquiries in the Pollard case after his return from Plymouth—I had nothing to say to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> preparation or sending out of the advertise<lb/>ment issued by Cartwright—I looked for employment after I left Slater's—I had at that time my first-class pension.; and I have it still; I had an excellent character when I went to Slater's—I was never put by Slater to do any inquiry work—I mentioned at the Police Court that I spoke to Osborn about the Jersey reports.</p>

Party in question supposed to live at 26, Doughty Street some time"—on the other side is "Client, H. <hi rend="italic">C.</hi> Knowles, 26, Vincent Square, Westminster"—I had to keep a cash book showing the payments made by clients to the Agency—I find in Exhibit 13 a number of sums of money under the heading of Pollard and the name H.

Guernsey, and on March 20th, 1902, £2 was requisitioned by me to be sent to him at Plymouth—I wrote to Slater when he did not attend at the office at all—on such days as he did attend at the office for only part of the day, I wrote him a report of what had occurred there, if there was anything important; when he attended throughout the day at the office, I would not write at all—that corres<lb/>pondence begins on October 14th, 1901, and goes down to May 13th, 1902; from January to April, 1902, Slater was away from this country—he made a round voyage to Australia—during that time I supplied him with reports from the office saying what it was in the way of business that had been conducted there—amongst the callers which I reported to him was "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, the Plymouth matter, called to discuss the further reports herein. Nothing else of importance." That is followed by a letter of January 23, 1902, apparently—I find Mr. Knowles' name mentioned in the same way in a letter of February 7th—and one of February 11th—the entry here is, "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, discussed reports; will arrange to let us have £200 or £300 further"—I was in the habit of telling Slater in my letters whether any and what amounts of money had been paid in in relation to particular matters of business—in the letter of October 14th, I find: "Mr. Knowles, Pollard, the Plymouth matter; called and paid £150 as arranged, and is calling again in a few days to discuss the account for the previous working and to see if 'there, is any balance Nothing else of importance"—on October 24th: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, the Plymouth matter: called to discuss reports herein and paid £25 on the old account"—October 28th: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, the Plymouth matter; called to discuss further reports herein and paid £100 further on account. This is the last money we shall have from 'him for some time"—December 5th, 1901: "Mr. Knowle re Pollard, the Plymouth matter. He has promised to call to-morrow and pay the sum asked for to make up the £500 for which sum he was in<lb/>formed we would carry the thing through, although there will be some extra expenses in looking after the witnesses"—on February 21st I wrote to Slater: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, discussed reports herein and paid £240 further on account"—on March 20th I wrote to Slater: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard matter, called to discuss matter and paid £250 further on account"—on March 24th: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, only called to discuss further reports herein."March 26th: "Mr. Knowles, re Pollard, only called for further reports herein, and will call again in a day or so to pay <hi rend="italic">the</hi> £150, further on account" April 2nd: "Mr. Knowles re Pollard, <hi rend="italic">Only</hi> called for further reports herein and will call again in a few days"—</p>

I live at 7, Richmond Road, Leytonstone, and am a private inquiry agent; I was employed by Slater's Agency for about four years; I left the employment in September, 1902; amongst my duties was one to attend to the reports coming from the private inquiry agents—those reports were filed in the general office—I had to take them off. the file and put them in the envelopes which were endorsed with the name of the case to which they referred—I remember Cartwright leaving Slater's employment on Monday the 22nd September—on that day I received instructions from Slater to collect all the papers in the Pollard case and two other' cases—I collected the papers in the Pollard case—amongst them would be the reports of the private inquiry agents—those were the only three cases which I had to collect; having collected the reports together, I gave them to Henry—when I entered the room I think Shayler was present, another clerk employed at Slater's—I gave them to Henry in the back room on the same floor as the general office—it was an office used by McKenna and Stevens for writing out their reports in—after I had given Henry the reports, I had to go back; I was looking for the Kitchen case; it was an old case that had been put away—I had to go back on several occasions after I had given <hi rend="italic">the</hi> reports to-Henry in Shayler's presence—when I went into the office upon <hi rend="italic">the</hi> second or third occasion, the papers were all strewed about the table—Henry, Shayler, and Davies were in the room—<hi rend="italic">they</hi> had the papers all over the table, and they were looking through them—I do not think there was anyone else there on that occasion—on five or six occasions I think I went into the room—en, the fourth or fifth occasion that I went into the room I saw some papers had been burnt in the hearth—they were smouldering then in the hearth—Henry and Davies were in the room then—I went in again and Davies was there alone—the papers had been put back into the envelope)—I went in for the envelope with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> pollard papers in; Davies said: "What are you going to do with those.?;" I said: "Puts them in the proper place"—he said: "Well, leave thorn here"—I am not sure whether I left them there or took them into</p>

I think it was—nothing took place in my presence except that as Cartwright came out of the room he handed over the keys to Scott and then <hi rend="italic">they</hi> went downstairs—I did not know that before Cartwright left on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> 22nd it was proposed to start a Detective Association by Simmons, Cartwright and Stevens—I heard it very soon after—I had a letter from Wright or Cartwright enclosing a card—that was about four or five days after I left Slater's, on September 29th, 1902; three days after Simmons and a week after Cartwright, and the next working day alter the adver<lb/>tisement appeared in <hi rend="italic">the Daily Telegraph</hi>—Simmons left on the Friday, the advertisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> on the Saturday, and I left on the Monday—I always had some idea of leaving the place; I did not want to remain there—I had never given notice—I told Henry I was leaving because I was going to America—that was the truth—I did not go, but I was thinking of it at that time, and had been for some months—I am sure that is what I left for—there was an object in going—I was going out to my uncle's place; that is what I left for—my uncle is still in America—I have not been to him—I left Slater's on the Monday—I think Henry said: "You had better go at once"—I do not know that he made it pretty plain that he thought I was working with the other gang—I do not think that was his view; he may have thought so—I do not know whether I told him what I was; going to do—I was really employed in the office as junior clerk—I used to go out occasionally, doing a little watching or something like that, if they were very busy—I did not tell Henry that I was going to America to put him off the scent—I may have said it to him, but I cannot swear to it—I did not take a passage to America, or take any trouble about, going to America—the idea of going to America, never came to anything—I never took any more <hi rend="italic">steps</hi> than having it in my head—I went to Simmons Detective Association as their employee on the following Monday—I did not give notice on the Monday because I was going to their employment on the following Monday—it was pure chance that they took me—I gave notice on Monday, September 29th, which expired at the end of that week, and should have been free to go to Simmons' on October 6th—that is the day on which I, in fact, entered their employment; and from which date I received payment—I did not apply to them before—I received a card and a letter from Cartwright asking me to call; I went and saw</p>

Who told you to make that collection—to collect these papers or documents? A. Mr. Henry"—I cannot understand how I came to say it—it was an untruth, certainly, if I said it—that is my view now because I am sure that it was Slater who asked me to get those papers—I collected them from the office—before I went to the Police Court I had never sworn before, that it was Slater who gave me those instructions—I did not get a rise in wages after I was at the Police Court.</p>

               <p>nor procured Maud Goodman to give false evidence, and I believe the evidence she gave was true. I should like to add that my connec<lb/>tion with the Pollard case commenced on July 8th, 1902. It was on that date I was introduced to Mr. Knowles by Mr. Henry. The only other persons employed by Slater's Agency with whom I subsequently had any communication in reference to this case were Iles, Pracey and McKenna. I had nothing whatever to do with either Smith or Davies in reference to the case. On July 8th, Mr. Knowles made a statement to me with regard to Mr. Pollard's treatment of his wife, and I was instructed to act in the matter. The following day (July 9th) I made a note which has already been produced in evidence of information given me <hi rend="italic">by Iles.</hi> I only saw Mr. Pollard upon the one occasion, which was at the Grand Hotel, Plymouth, and that was July 10th, about 5 o'clock, and I spoke to him on the subject of his having in the preceding month of June) created a disturbance at the house where his wife was staying. That was at 3 a.m., and I cautioned him as to a repetition of it The stated<lb/>ments by Stevens with regard to me are absolutely untrue. With regard to Maud Goodman's statement, taken on July 10th, I believed that she was telling the truth, and that her hesitation in making the statement was due entirely to her unwillingness, as she said, to give away a man who had been with her. I made her no promise, neither did I hold out any inducement to her to make a statement. On July 14th I saw Mrs. Pollard, who gave me an account of her husband's conduct during her married life, which she afterwards gave in evidence on the trial of her case. I was informed that Maud Goodman had identified Pollard on August 2nd, and I believed the letter Maud Goodman wrote me on August 7th was a truthful letter. Having been told that she did not want to come to London, I saw her on November 22nd. She did not on that occasion suggest any doubt as to the identity of Pollard, and I believe the only reason for her objecting to attend the trial was that she had been advised she could not be compelled to give evidence in the Divorce Court I told her that having been served with a subpoena, she would have to attend the trial. I did not then hold out any inducement to give evidence or make her any promise On the journey to London I told her, in the presence of Nellie Bell and others, that in giving evidence I wished her to say nothing she was not certain of On the morning of the trial, before giving evidence, I saw her in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> corridor of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> courts, and gave her the opportunity of making any correction in her statement if she desired to do so Before being examined in Court, she was asked by the Judge whether she was willing to give evidence and she said she was. From beginning to end the total sum of money paid to Maud Goodman was £6 10s., and that included' payment for <hi rend="italic">the</hi> trouble she had been put to in seeing me on July 10th, and for 'her attendance on August 2nd when she attended to identify Pollard, and also for her four days' attendance in London at the time of the trial. As to what subsequently occurred. I say, when she wrote me on March 27th, 1903, I did not know who Mr. Murray was I did not believe he was representing <hi rend="italic">the</hi> King's Proctor, and thought she was being approached by some one at the instigation of Stevens, Cart<lb/>wright and Simmons. As to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> King's Proctor's intervention, the whole</p>

               <p>of the material I had, and all <hi rend="italic">the</hi> documents that came into my possession, were placed before Counsel who conducted the case on behalf of Mrs. Pollard."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Henry Scott said:</hi>" I should like to say that in 1901, when Mr. Knowles first became a client of Slater's, I was in ill-health, and paying almost no attention to business. I never saw him until I was in Court in the King's Proctors case. I had no knowledge of what was being done either then or afterwards in the Pollard case. In the autumn of 1901, I decided to go for a voyage to Australia for the benefit of my health and for the same reason I spent a great deal of my time at Brighton. I never saw Smith's report which Cartwright says I handed to him until I was in the witness box in the Divorce Court. That report appears to have been written on November 13th, 1901, and would reach London on the 14th. On November 14th, 1901, I spent the entire day at Brighton. I had no knowledge of the telephone message mentioned in it coming from Smith, and I knew nothing of the telegram sent in reply. On January 16th, 1902, I left England for a second voyage to Australia and returned to England on April 13th the same year. I never heard anything whatever about the Jersey incident until after the King's Proctor intervened. It is untrue that Cartwright 'took any documents out of a drawer on the occasion when I discharged him, as he had no opportunity of doing so. It is also utrue that I was a party to or present at the destruction of any documents, or that I "was sent for (for that purpose as suggested in the evidence of Morrison I had no knowledge of any of the stops taken by Mr. Osborn in connection with the Pollard case until after the King's Procter's intervention, and in conclusion I think it due to Mr. Henry to state that when I said in the Divorce Court that he was a partner, I did not mean that he was so in any legal sense."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pracey said:</hi> "'I say there is no truth in the suggestion that I at any time conspired with the other defendants or any of them During the whole time I was in Slater's employ I never had any communication with Mr. Scott about this case I quite believed Maud Goodman had identified the photograph of a gentleman who had stayed with her at 3, Summer-land Place, in June, 1902. I further believe that when she saw Mr. Pollard on August 2nd, she believed he was the gentleman who had stayed with her there. Before the statement of August 2nd was signed by her, she had an opportunity to make any correction, she desired, and a portion of the statement was struck out by the at her request She never at any time suggested tome she had any doubt as to the identity of Pollard, and I always understood from her that the reason she was unwilling to go to London in. November, 1902, was that she had had advice on <hi rend="italic">the</hi> matter end had been told she was not compolled to give evidence. When I went to Plymouth early in 1903, to obtain a further statement from Maud Goodman, I heard she had been approached by a Mr. Murray, who was said to be acting on behalf of the King's Proctor, and whose description was driven to me. I made inquiries at Plymouth, but failed to trace anyone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170131"/>
               <p>of that name, and as the description' given to me corresponded with one of Simmons' employees, I came to the conclusion Murray was acting on, their behalf. I have never asked Maud Goodman to state anything untrue, and she has always had an opportunity of making any correction in any statement submitted to her in connection with the case I was subpœnaed by the King's Proctor as his witness, but was not called."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith said:</hi> "I state that about the middle of November, 1901, while I was in the temporary employment of Slater's Detective Agency, in which I was paid about the average rate of 4s. 6d. a day, I received instructions to go to Plymouth, and there make the acquaintance of Mr. Pollard, living at 34, Headlands Park, with the view to obtain information as to his past, and present mode of life and manner of conversation. This appears in my report of November, 1901, in which I say that I think it would be quite futile for me to try to become acquainted with him, in the street No one ever gave me instructions to endeavour to induce Mr. Pollard to commit adultery, and I have never seen nor had any communication with Mr. Osborn or Mr. Slater in connection with the case at any time. Four days after reaching Plymouth, namely, November 7th, an opportunity occurred of opening a conversation, with Mr. Pollard, and we then became on sufficiently friendly terms to occasionally go about together. I seat in reports giving particulars of the occasions on which I met. him and stating where we went on these occasions. I admit in tome of these reports I foolishly made statements concerning Pollard, being anxious to send in a good report of my work and thus improve my position with the Agency. At no time while I was in company of Mr. Pollard did we frequent the society of loose characters, nor did I ever make any endeavour to induce him to commit adultery. My reason for sending that report, Ex. 24, was the hope 'that should my suggestion be accepted, money would be wired to me from London. As a, matter of fact the suggestion was not accepted, and I was immediately called from Plymouth to London. the only work I subsequently did in connection with the Pollard case was to make certain, inquiries in London with a view of tracing where Mr. Pollard had previously resided. The last report made by me in connection with the Pollard case is dated December 27th, 1901; as between January and June, 1902, I occasionally did work for Slater in connection with other cases, for which I was paid on the daily system, which means I go to the office daily to see if my services are required, and if they are not I do not get paid. From June 13th, 1902, not being on the permanent staff of Mr. Slater's, I left London to undertake a commission for a friend, and I never heard anything about the presentation of a petition by Mrs. Pollard until my return from the country, where I had been several months. I was employed in December, 1902, and January, 1903, by Longley's Agency in doing chance inquiries. While so employed' I saw Cartwright at Longley's, and I "wrote the letters for Longley's at the in<lb/>stigation of Cartwright and Stevens. In February, 1903, I met Cartwright in London, in Holborn, and he asked me to make a statement about the Pollard case for the King's Proctor. At the suggestion of Mr. Cartwright I went to Longley's Detective Office and made a. statement there, which was handed to Cartwright and sent to the King's Proctor through Longley's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190410170132"/>
               <p>so that the information, might not appear to have come from Cartwright. About October 12th, 1903, I received a letter from the King's Proctor's Department asking me to call at his office. I went there, and was closely questioned by one of his representatives, Mr. Stredwick, who suggested I was anxious to screen Mr. Henry. I answered all the questions put to me truthfully and to the best of my ability, and I assured Mr. Stredwick I was telling the truth. Some time in November, 1903, I received a subpoena to attend to give evidence on behalf of the King's Proctor, and on December 9th, 1903, I was again seen by the same gentleman, who further questioned me in reference to my statement. I attended on my subpoena throughout the trial, but was not. called to give evidence. The trial ended April 21st, 1904, and I was arrested on April 26th, 1904.I have never conspired with any of the other defendants."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potatoes merchant of 126, Jed<lb/>bury Road, Plaistow, and am agent to Mr. Armstrong, a hay and produce merchant—in July I met the prisoner working on a building as a carpen<lb/>ter—he was helping to build a stable—I discovered he had been a car<lb/>penter on board ship, and had some knowledge of shipping and so on—he was practically starving—I had not known him before—I decided to start him as my canvasser in connection with my potatoe business, and I set up the business of George Thomas &amp; Co., for which he was to get orders—the business was mine entirely—he had to buy the potatoes to sell afterwards—on September 6th I gave him four guineas to go to Stratford market and buy a ton and a half of potatoes and deliver them to an order that he had already got in the Barking Road, and to collect the money and hand it to me—I hired a van and engaged a man to go</p>

               <p>with him—I heard no more of him till the 13th, when I saw him in the Barking Road, near Chalk's place—he caught sight of me and bolted through the shop and out at the back, and I saw no more of him—I received no return of my money—on September 7th I received a letter from him, saying, We waited for you this morning at the Three Nuns. Did you 'get my letter that I left?"—I had not then received any letter—(<hi rend="italic">The letter went on to state that he had not done much good, as the profit was only</hi> 15s., <hi rend="italic">but that he would call</hi>)—my reply was that I did not understand his note, and asked him to see me that night or in the morning; I did not see him—I got no satisfaction for my four guineas—on the 15th, the day he was taken into custody, I met him in Barking road; I said, "You bounder, where have you been to?"—he said, "I made a fool of myself, I made a mistake of half a sovereign in my change; I lost half a sovereign, and I was ashamed to come and see you"—I said, "It would have been very much better to have brought me the £14 10s."—he said he had given £12 to his cousin to hold till Saturday; that he would be able to get another £6 on Saturday, and he would pay all the money—he had collected other monies, and there is another charge for embezzlement—I said it would have been very much better to have brought what he had, and I might have given him the half sovereign he had lost had he not gone away for ten days—a warrant had at that time been granted, and he was taken into custody within a quarter of an hour.</p>

Forest Gate, and am Davis's brother-in-law—I was present at my father-in-law's funeral at the Railway Tavern on August 25th—about 3 p.m. the prisoner wanted to see me, and I told him to come back at 6 p.m., after the funeral, but he said that that would be too late—I then asked him in, and he said he was a reporter—we asked him for which papers, and he said, "The <hi rend="italic">Stratford Express, South Essex Mail</hi>, and all the morning and evening papers"—Davis, who was fetched, then asked him what moraine and evening papers they were, and he said the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Licensing World</hi>, but that he was sorry he could not get it into that week's editions of those papers, but would in the next—he then showed us a piece of paper on which there was a list of wreaths and mourners, which we corrected—he then said there would be a small charged of from a guinea and a quarter to a guinea and a half—I even<lb/>tually paid him £1 11s. 6d. for Davis, and he handed Davis a receipt on the back of his card as follows: "August 25th. Attending and reporting funeral of Mr. W. Davis £1 11s. 6d. Received with thanks, B. Friedburg."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the report which you showed me on the occasion before—you asked me if a reporter from the <hi rend="italic">Strat<lb/>ford Express</hi> had called, and I said 'No"—I do not remember your mentioning the <hi rend="italic">Leytonstone Independent</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Leytonstone District Times</hi>—I asked you to alter one of the names of the gentlemen who had given wreaths from "Tiger Fredericks" to "Walter Fredericks"—I did not say when you said there would be a small charge, "I know that; how much will it be?"—you did not say that you wanted the money first, because in the event of a misunderstanding after the reports had appeared you would not be able to prove that we promised to pay you, nor did you say that we could have our money back in the event of the reports not appearing—reports appeared in the four papers you sent to the house, which seemed to me to be rather alike; in none of them does the name "Tiger Fredericks" appear, and in three of the reports Mrs. Davis returns thanks for sympathy received—you distinctly said you represented the <hi rend="italic">South Essex Mail</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Stratford Express</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Licensing World.</hi>

I am a district superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway at Liverpool Street, and live at 21, Norwich Road, Forest Gate—on September 24th my wife's funeral took place; the prisoner culled upon me at mid-day and said, "I have been sent by the <hi rend="italic">Stratford Express</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">South Essex Mail</hi> to make a report of your wife's funeral," and he asked if I was willing to give him particulars—I had previously sent a death notice to the <hi rend="italic">Stratford Express</hi>, and I thought he had come because of that—I told him the names of the mourners and of the donors of the wreaths, of which there were about sixty or seventy—he said in consequence of the extra space that would be taken up by</p>

               <p>Hotel, 166 to 168, Westminster Bridge Road—they are in part used as coffee house, also as a hotel—I know the prisoner; I have seen him at the premises on several occasions—he is the proprietor of the establish<lb/>ment—I kept watch with another officer on the premises from August 22nd to 28th. between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m.—I made notes of the couples I saw entering—I saw 11 couples enter and 21 leave—"by couples" I mean a man and a prostitute, known to me as such—several of the women entered on different nights with different men—none of the 41 couples took any luggage; they pushed the private door open and were received—the door is left ajar most of the time, but about 12.30 it is closed, and to gain admittance it is necessary to ring or knock—I saw the prisoner open the door at times, and also a man in his employment—some of the couples I saw go in remained less than an hour, and when they came out they separated—I was stationed sometimes on the opposite side of the road, and sometimes on the same side—on looking at my note made at the time I find on the night of the 22nd and early morning of the 23rd, six couples entered and three left—the prisoner's servant admitted them—on the 23rd and 24th, five couples entered and two left, admitted by the servant—on the 24th, seven couples entered and three left—on the 25th, six couples entered and four left—on the 26th, five entered and three left—that night I saw the prisoner receive two couples and let one couple out, the first at 9.30 and the second at 12.14, leaving at 12.41—on the 27th I saw eight couples enter and four leave, received by the servant—on August 28th four couples entered and two left, that was up to 12 o'clock—that night the prisoner received a couple at 11.33, and he was at the door when a couple entered at 11.48, and another couple left at that time—during this time I saw other men and women going into the pre<lb/>mises but I have not included them, as I did not know the women as prostitutes—on September 6th I went with Inspector Spencer to search the premises—four couples there, whom I found in bed, made statements in the prisoner's presence—one of the women was known to me as a prosti<lb/>tute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found several other people there whom I should not describe as couples—there were three women occupying rooms by themselves, respectable people as far as I know—there were also six men in the house, not sleeping with women, three of them occupying one room—there was a large coffee house business carried on at the premises—they are opposite the Canterbury Music Hall—I said at the police court that it was a difficult matter for people to carry on the business respectably—there are 32 bedrooms there—the premises are four houses in one—there may have been 12 or 13 couples refused admission during certain nights.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There may have been between 12 and 20 refused during certain nights; that is an average of two or three a night—I should say they were refused because they were unable to pay the price of the room—they were rough sort of women.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Taylor, and now live at 10, Ontario Street, London Road, Southwark—in March and April I lived at 223, Southwark Bridge Road, when I had a machine on the hire purchase system from the Singer Company through a collector whose name is in my book, but he is not one of these men—Godby also collected—I saw Cowell three times, once with Godby, and once when he took machines away—whilst I was paying for my machine Godby asked me to take in another machine, because he had an order and the people were out all day; I agreed—I did not give the order for that machine—there is no Mary Taylor at 223 that I know, who is tall and of fair complexion—I know Minnie Taylor, aged 16, who lives at Surbiton—I know nobody called Milton of 202, Camberwell New Road—a machine came when I was out—a person named Keelson lives upstairs—the machine was put in the kitchen—I got no hire agreement for that machine—I never signed one for it in the name of Mary Taylor, nor authorised anybody to do so—Godby told me a superintendent was coming for the money in the afternoon, and he gave it me in the morning—I paid the 1s. 6d. in the afternoon back again to Godby in the presence of the superintendent—another machine was mentioned after Cowell had taken that one away—the hair was not then on Cowell's face, only a moustache; he is now growing a beard, but I picked him out at Southwark Police Station from a number of others—he said he had come from the Singer Co. for the machine; I let him have it—I had seen him with Godby before that—afterwards Godby came and asked if I would take in another machine,' as</p>

                  </hi>. I am married and live at 58. Neate Street, Camberwell—in August, I was living at 148, Westmoreland Road, Walworth—as a canvasser of the Singer Company I ordered a sewing machine from Cowell—my husband signed the agreement—I was present and also Cowell—I was out when the machine arrived; I found the machine there when I got homo—I paid Cowell 3s. deposit about nine weeks afterwards—about a fortnight afterwards I told him I wanted a larger, a <hi rend="italic">Jumbo</hi> machine—he said he had one at Boyson Road that could not be paid for, and was going to be returned—this happened in the Westmoreland Road—we moved to New Street on a Wednesday, about the middle of August—I told him I was going to move—he said he would take it there and then instead of moving it to the depot to save shifting—on a Wednesday in September my goods were removed by Jenner—I saw the machine in the road at the side of Jenner's van when the furniture was' moved in—I saw it put in the van as I went in—that was the last I saw of it—I never got the <hi rend="italic">Jumbo</hi> machine—I had paid 3s.—two or three days after Cowell called—he said he had been to see about the <hi rend="italic">Jumbo</hi> machine, and that if anybody called from Singer's I was simply to say that a carman had taken the machine away, but not to say who it was, and that he was going to bring tie <hi rend="italic">Jumbo</hi> the following Saturday—two or three days after he called and I told him two of Singer's men had called—Mr. Wilson had come for his first month's money, with Mr. Diamond—I told him I had not the machine—Cowell asked me to describe the men—I said they had questioned me as to where the machine was, and that I had told them it was not in my place, and that they had said it remained to be proved—I said, "If you go to the shop my husband works at he will give you the agreement"—Cowell said he would call in the evening—I never saw him again till I saw him in the Police Court about three weeks afterwords.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Mayall Road, Brixton—on August 11th. I was living at 23, Pulross Road, which is nearly opposite where the prisoner lived—on that day I was in my parlour and I heard a loud screaming—I went to the front door to see what it was—I saw Mrs. Williams run out of the house covered with blood—I went into the garden to call my husband, and when I got back again she was sitting on the ground by the railings near her house—I did not see the prisoner—I asked Mrs. Williams what I could do for her; she said her husband was indoors cutting his throat and she was sure he was mad.</p>

I am a greengrocer of 2a, Pulross Road—on August 11th, about midday, I was cleaning my shop windows—I heard screams; I ran out and saw Mrs. Williams on the pavement, bleeding from her throat—I afterwards went into a back bedroom on the top floor of the house outside which she was—I saw the prisoner on the bed and a baby in the cot—the prisoner was bleeding very much from his throat, which was cut—he saw me but did not speak to me—I took the baby down and then went back and remained until the police came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fully qualified medical practitioner and house surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—on August 11th the prisoner was brought in; I saw him—he had a gash in his throat 3 or 4 inches long just above the larynx—there was also a slit in the osophagus—he was uncon<lb/>scious when he was brought in; there were no big arteries cut—the wound might have been inflicted by one of these knives—I think it was certainly self-inflicted: it was a dangerous wound—he was kept in the hospital till September 7th—he had then a granulated wound in his throat, but he was out of danger—he was not under my charge, but I talked to him on one or two occasions, but he made no communication to me—I examined</p>

               <p>Mrs. Williams; she was brought to the hospital—she had a skin wound across her throat and chin and one on her right hand, dividing the tendons—the wound in her throat was in a dangerous locality, but it was not a dangerous wound; it was not deep—I should think the wounds on her fingers were caused by grasping a sharp knife or razor—she was discharged shortly before her husband.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a written statement, said that he suffered from severe head<lb/>aches; that previous to August 11th he had had no sleep for five nights; that on August 11th, while on the way to his work, he felt unable to go on, and after resting for a time he returned home; that his wife was out, so he laid down in a lounge chair; that he felt himself coming over faint, and then lost control of himself; that the next he remembered was seeing a policemen and finding his throat cut, and that the reason of his health giving way was his wife's adultery and drinking habits.</hi>
