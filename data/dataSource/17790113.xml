               <p>Where was that screaming? - In the house. There are five rooms on the first floor;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130003"/> I was in one of them. I ran out, and the first thing I saw was the prisoner coming down stairs. I was satisfied he was a thief. I said, you scoundrel, what do you do here? The maid called out and said he was a thief. He said he wanted Mr. Cook, who lived up three-pair-of-stairs; the maid persisted in his being a thief. I delivered him into the custody of a servant, and went to see if there were any more of them. I went up into the garret, and found a pane of glass taken out of a transom window. I concluded he came over the leads of some other houses and came in there.</p>
               <p>Do you apprehend he could have come in at that window? - He could have come in, and did come in; he said he was a good man and did not mean to steal.</p>
               <p>Who are the people that have any business in that room? - The servant maid has lodged in that room seven months. When he said he wanted a Mr. Cook, he spoke very good English; he would not speak English afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked for a French cook, not for a Mr. Cook; the gentleman ill-used me and took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did take him by the collar. When I wanted him to speak English, he laughed in my face. I said, you scoundrel, if you laugh at me I will knock your teeth out.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Harriott; I sleep in this room; it is three-pair-of-stairs backwards. There is a communication between the window of that room and the leads of the houses. I took notice of the window about eleven in the morning; there was no glass out then.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was whole? - Yes; when I made my bed about eleven the window was fast. About half after six in the evening I went up, took the key out of my pocket, and unlocked the door; then the prisoner came out. I always keep the door locked. I am sure I locked the door that morning.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the person that came out of the room could not get in through the door? - Yes. When I saw him I screamed out, ran down one-pair-of-stairs before him, and called for several persons who were in the house to come up; he followed me down.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - First I called to my master, then to my fellow servants, and said there were thieves in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see your master on the stairs as you came down? - I do not know that I did, I was so frightened. I went into my mistress's room and sat down; the prisoner was taken immediately. I am certain the prisoner is the person that came out of the room. I went up afterwards into the room, and saw a pane of glass was taken out of the window and laid in the gutter. The window was fastened again on the inside.</p>
               <p>Was that pane of glass so near to the fastening of the window that a man could put his hand in and open it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could he get in at the window? - Yes, any body might; I could get in myself. It is a casement fastened with an iron handle in the inside. I have lain in the room about seven months; nobody lay there but myself.</p>
               <p>Was it dark then? - Yes; we had a candle; it was about half after six o'clock to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming up stairs, and was at the door just as she was, to ask for the man.</p>
               <p>Phips. When I opened the door he came out of the room.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Harriott. What do you mean by a transom? - It is an iron transom casement; he took a pane of glass out of the casement.</p>

               <p>I went to enquire for that person; he was to have taken a post chaise to Bath, and knowing a milliner at Bath I wanted this cook to call upon her to get acquainted with her; this cook gave me his direction to this house. I went up into the three-pair-of-stairs after this girl; the girl upon seeing me immediately screamed out; the family being alarmed, about thirty people came up and took hold of me, and would not hear what I had to say. I am quite ignorant of the customs and ways of this country, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130004"/> thinking myself innocent I have called no witnesses.</p>

               <p>I was with Morant at the taking Russel and the chairman. I examined the chairman, and took from him forty-eight guineas in gold and one pound seven shillings in silver, at the public-house; some in his waistcoat pocket, and some in his breeches pocket. When we came to the Brown-bear, in Bow-street, not having found so much money as the gentleman had lost, I searched him again; in pulling his breeches off five guineas fell out of the inside of them. He lived with Russel, and went by her name.</p>

I asked him what he wanted with me; he said, pull up your petticoats and shew me your backside; he then asked me if I had any thing to flog him; I said I had not, but I would do it with my hand. He then took my hand and put it up his fundament. Another woman came up, he then said he had lost his purse; we looked about for it, but could not find it. I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hall. I was called up on Tuesday morning at two o'clock to go to Smithfield to my master to take care of his lambs as some had been stolen. I went down to the Bear and Ragged-Staff-yard, and saw two men in the yard I had a suspicion of, and watched them; I lost fight of them for about half an hour, in which time a lamb was missed. I saw them come down the yard again and stand by the pen this lamb was in. I concealed myself behind a cart wheel and watched them. I saw the prisoner go into the pen, lift up the lamb, and put it in a bag which the other man had.</p>
               <p>There were more rams there? - Yes. I saw the prisoner put the sheep in the sack; he was in the pen, and the other man on the outside; upon that I came directly out of the yard and saw them coming after me. I was about thirty yards before them.</p>
               <p>Who carried the sack with the lamb in it? - The prisoner; that very man; I could swear to him among a thousand. The bag was twisted, and he had it across his left shoulder. I walked before them to the end of Long-lane; there I stopped, and they came up to me; then I stopped the prisoner; the other man made off. I took hold of the sack, he struggled and wanted to get away; I gave him a fall and secured him, and took him to the Rose in Smithfield, and sent for Mr. Hall. I found the ram lamb in the bag with a handkerchief put in its mouth as you would put a bit in a horse's mouth, and tied round the horns to keep it from bleating. I found a knife in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Arnold made excuses about Lord Chesterfield's not paying him? - When Mr. Arnold had completed a watch, and delivered it at his lordship's house, I believe his lordship was out of town. Mr. Arnold went several times and could not meet with his lordship; it being a watch that came to a good deal of money he said he wished he could get it. I never heard him say that his lordship refused to pay him. I have lived with Mr. Arnold many years; I never knew him employ any person either in the house or out of the house without paying them as soon as their money was due, or before it was due.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Mr. Arnold ever made excuses, and said he could not pay us on the Saturday if he did not receive money from somebody besides his lordship? - I never heard Mr. Arnold say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time when I finished a watch of the same sort for Colonel Keppel, which he was disappoinded in selling, whether he did not send to a captain that owed him twelve pounds, and he not being at home, whether he did not give me a crown, and let you go without any money? - He never refused to pay me; I was generally paid first, and went away; he never refused paying any one to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This watch was given into my care; I appeal to your lordship and the jury whether this is stealing.</p>

               <p>On the 22 d of November I happened to to be in a public-house where the prisoner and two more were drinking. I joined company with them; afterwards they took an opportunity to jostle me. I sat down with them in the same box. I catched the prisoner's hand in my right hand waistcoat pocket; I had a half guinea and three shillings or more in that pocket. He took it out under a pretence of inlisting me for a soldier; and afterwards used violence to drag me out of the house. He was then in a plaisterer's dress; he was not in his uniform. They did not appear to be soldiers. I charged him with taking the money; he damned me, and opened his hand, and asked me if that was my money? There was a half guinea and three shillings, or more in his hand. I told him I positively believed it was. They then used force to take me out of the house; they pretended they had trepanned me. The landlord came in at the time, and said, you villains, do you mean to rob the man? and turned them out. They went immediately to the Savoy, and brought the serjeant of the guards, who demanded the door to be opened, and insisted on my going with him, or he would use force. I went with them to an officer of the Savoy; I told the officer I had been robbed; he said it was not his business, he could not decide it, I must go before a justice, or words to that purpose; immediately they dragged me by force along the Strand. I begged to stop at a house where I lived, they would not let me stop, but dragged me before another officer, Colonel Thornton, near Carnaby-market; I told him my story; he said it was not his business, I must go before a justice, and he discharged me on my giving him my word that I would appear with him before Justice Elliott in the morning. I went according to my promise, about ten o'clock, he came about eleven, and the justice granted me a warrant, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>At what time did you get into their company in the public-house? - I went to the public-house about four in the morning. I had been out in the evening, and staying late, was locked out of my lodging. I went to this public-house, and joined company with them between six and seven.</p>
               <p>How long had you joined with them before you found his hand in your pocket? - About twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>What had you been talking about? - I cannot recollect; I apprehend there was nothing material.</p>
               <p>What subject did you talk about? - No further than they accosted me, and said how do you do, sir, I think I have some knowledge of you; and they asked me to drink with them.</p>
               <p>Was you sober or not? - I had been drinking, but was as perfectly in my senses as I am now. I had had sixpenny-worth of rum and water at that house.</p>
               <p>Where is the house? - In King's-head-court, New Russel-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Do you usually put your money in your waistcoat pocket? - In company I frequently put it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>What occasion had you to take your money out? - To pay my dividend. I did not like the company, and wanted to get out of it. I threw down a half crown, they gave me but a shilling out of it, which I thought was an imposition.</p>
               <p>If no conversation passed but common civility, what was done to give you a dislike to the company? - They seemed to be of the sky-larking order, in the vulgar phrase, that is, wanting to take all advantages; they wanted me to pay more than my share. I threw my money down to pay my dividend.</p>
               <p>There was no behaviour that gave you offence before you threw your money down to pay the reckoning. The sky-larking conduct was after you threw down the money? - I wanted to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>What had you drank with them? - They had a pot of hot, I believe brandy and rum together. I drank but little to my share. I do not fancy strong liquor in a morning.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said to you about going into the army, or inlisting? - They said I was a proper person to serve his majesty, and such like; they did not direct that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130009"/> discourse to me, they whispered it among themselves. I saw their behaviour; that was the conduct I did not like.</p>
               <p>What more did the man say to you when he opened his hand with the money in it upon the subject of inlisting? - He d - d me, and said if it was my money, he would insist upon my going with him.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been said about your having taken any inlisting money before? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Do you think he took the money out of your pocket with a design to inlist you with it? - I believe if he wanted me to inlist, he meant to trepan me with my own money. I believe he had but little of his own.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he did not put it into your pocket? - I am very positive he did not, because I had it in my pocket before.</p>
               <p>Then you imagine that he took this money out of your pocket in order to trepan you to be inlisted? - If I had been foolish enough to take it of him again, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Then he did not mean to take your money to keep himself, but to give it to you to trepan you for a soldier? - Whatever might be his intent, he kept the money, he did not return it.</p>
               <p>Did you ask for your money again? - No; he said I should know more of it when I had had two or three hundred lashes; and spoke to me with indignation and scorn.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had the money again? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you the man of the house here? - No; he was not present when he took my money.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am foreman to a French trimming shop, No. 34, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I belong to the first regiment of Guards. The officer lets me throw up my pay and go to work. This Sunday morning I was coming from my duty and wanted something to refresh me. I met with two young fellows, plaisterers, who worked with me; I asked them to drink, and we went into this house, where this gentleman and another man were drinking together. When we came in they called for a pot of hot, we called for three penny worth of crank; when the pot of hot came in, he threw down half a crown to pay for it, the waiter took fourteen pence, and he gave the waiter four-pence; the other man took up the shilling and put it in his pocket; he called for another pot of hot, which the other man would not pay for; the waiter then asked the prosecutor for it; he said he had no money; the waiter said he would take any thing he would leave for it; he replied he would not leave any thing. I then said I must go to my duty, upon which he asked me if I was a <rs id="t17790113-6-deflabel33" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

I said, sir, you are joking; he answered no, he was not, he was willing to go; I told him if he was willing to go, I would give him a shilling; I held up the shilling and said, if you take this shilling it is to serve his majesty; he then took the shilling from me. I asked him again if he was willing to go with me before the officer. As we were going out, somebody informed the landlord he was inlisted, and he came and shut me out, and said we should not have him, and threatened me with a constable. I went and got an officer, and took him to the colonel; he then only charged me with taking a shilling off the table to inlist him; he said nothing about this money till he was before the justice; then he said I had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Lee. I was at the King's-head on Sunday morning the 22d of November. The prisoner and I, and several more were in company; Harris was in the same box.</p>
               <p>What passed on the subject of inlisting? - Harris talked of going for a soldier.</p>
               <p>Did Harris propose going for a soldier, or did the prisoner propose it to him? - I cannot rightly say how that was. I saw the prisoner give Harris a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the shilling given for? - He said it was to serve his majesty.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner's putting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130010"/> his hand in Harris's pocket and taking any money out? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Harris charging him with taking his money? - Yes; a good many hours after. When the prisoner gave him the shilling he was on one side of the table, and Harris on the other.</p>
               <p>Did they continue on different sides of the table the whole time they staid there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did he charge the prisoner with taking the money from him? - I believe about seven o'clock; he disputed, and would not go with him; and then charged him with having taken his money.</p>
               <p>Did you see any money pass between the one or the other, or held in either of their hands, except the shilling? - No.</p>

               <p>Was you at the King's-head on Sunday morning the 22d of November? - I believe I was; I do not know the sign; I was at the place where this fray was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing passing between the prisoner and Harris upon the subject of inlisting? - Yes; but whether it was the prisoner that asked him, or he the prisoner, I cannot say; but there was a shilling passed between them. The prisoner said to Harris, will you inlist? - He said I will. Then the prisoner said here is a shilling to serve his majesty. Harris took the shilling, put it down on the table, and then gave it to the landlord.</p>
               <p>Was there any dispute about the reckoning before that time? - Yes; there was some dispute about the reckoning, and then he paid the shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other money pass between the prisoner and Harris? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did they sit on the same side of the table or on different sides? - Harris sat down, the prisoner stood up on the opposite side, leaning on the table, and gave him a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you see any half guinea between them? - I did not see any half guinea, nor any gold in the company.</p>
               <p>Had there been a dispute between Harris and the landlord about the reckoning? - Yes; about a pot of hot. The waiter bid him pay the reckoning; he said he could not he had no money; the waiter said if he would pay the shilling he would pay the twopence for him; Harris gave him the shilling.</p>

               <p>I was coming along the Poultry on Saturday evening the 2d of January, between the hours of five and seven, it was dark. I saw the two prisoners looking in at Mr. Darvin's window; they were together in company.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Darvin's an open shop? - There were windows; it was not open as some are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130011"/> without glass. I saw the little one, Cowen, take something out of a window that appeared to be broken. I went over the way on purpose to watch them; it was taken out at different times; I could not see what it was as his back was to me. Whatever he took out he gave to the other man; they went backwards and forwards to the window. I watched them about twenty minutes or half an hour. I went and got a constable and we secured them. The stockings were found upon Denham.</p>
               <p>Cowen. He says he was gone half an hour for a constable? - He is pretty right; I was a good while gone for a constable. I went to Watling-street, and the constable was not at home. I returned and found them still stealing, and then went to Sir Robert Ladbroke's for a constable, and when I returned I found them still stealing.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of January, about seven in the evening, Mr. Orme, the constable, came to my house to borrow a staff; I lent him one, and went with him to assist him; when I came to the prosecutor's house, my brother had just taken Cowen. I searched him; there was nothing found upon him; then Denham was brought in by Orme and Dunnington. I was going to search him, but before he was searched he dropped the stockings by the counter.</p>

About seven in the morning he came down with a candle to get some coals; I saw him come round to the locker, and put his hand in, and take something out, which I supposed to be a head of silk; his back being to me I could not see it; he went backwards, and I heard him wrap it up in paper. He carried up three or four baskets of coals, he then came back and looked at the locker again; there were some potatoes lying by the locker, he filled his pocket with them; then he went to the locker and straightened the wrapper; he then went up stairs, but returned immediately and drew some small beer; he then went up into the shop and went out, and Mr. Hunter and I followed him, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130012"/> him by the Old Bailey, and brought him back; when we brought him into the shop, he pulled the silk out his pocket, and was going to drop it; I caught it as it was falling.

               <p>I was in the warehouse on the 28th of December, between eleven and twelve at noon; I saw the door open and ordered the porter to go and shut it, but he did not. This piece of cotton was doubled up for a gentleman that had bought it that morning, and lay on the counter four or five yards from the door; I took my eye off the door about two seconds, then I looked and missed the piece. I ran to the door directly and found one of the prisoners tying it up in the other's apron.</p>
               <p>Which was tying it up? - I cannot swear to that. I took them and brought them into the warehouse; we got a constable and sent them to the Compter.</p>

I said you have taken my rings off; she said, you dog; I take your rings off! I said, yes, d - n you, and if you don't give them me I will take you into custody immediately. The other woman asked what was the matter; she said the dog says I have taken his rings. The other woman said, d - n him, down with him! and they both fell upon me and knocked me down on my knee, and pulled my hat and wig off. I secured the prisoner, and charged a constable with her.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and said, she had robbed him of two rings; I searched her, and found a ring upon her. She was putting something under her stays; I took hold of her, and shook her, and the ring dropped from under her clothes. She at that time escaped, and was not taken till very lately.</p>

               <p>Last Michaelmas was twelve-month I met a gentleman in Fleet-street, and he asked me to drink a glass of wine; I don't know whether it was the prosecutor. I went with him to the Sun Tavern; we drank together; he said he would make me a present of half a guinea to be agreeable; he put his hand in his pocket, and said, upon my word, my dear, I have no money about me, give me a direction where you live, and I will leave something in pledge with you till to-morrow; I will then call upon you at eleven o'clock. I gave him a direction to Gray's-Inn-lane, where I live, and he gave me the ring. We went away together till we came to a passage; we went up the passage, and then he said, as I have your direction, give me my ring again, and I will call to morrow and make you a present. I said, sir, you will excuse me. He said he must have the ring, he durst not go home without it. I told him as he had made use of me, I did not choose to deliver it; then he said he must have it, and charged the constable with me. I believe the prosecutor is the gentleman; he is very much like him; he had very weak eyes at that time.</p>

On the 2d of January, between twelve and one, my landlord came and told me my door was broke open. I came home and found the prisoner in the custody of an officer. The things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were taken out of my box, and lay open on the bed. I left my box and room door both locked when I went out in the morning. I understood that the prisoner was taken in the room.</p>

               <p>The prosecutrix lodges in my house. On Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to the chandler's shop, about six or seven doors off, when I returned I heard somebody over my head, in the one-pair-of-stairs room; I thought it was very odd any body should be in the room, knowing the people were out. I went up and found the prisoner in the room, with the things in her apron. She emptied them in the room before my face. The room was broke open. I got assistance and secured her. I asked her how she came there, she said a person gave her sixpence to bring the things into the room.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

I went up stairs; I saw the prisoner standing in the room, and asked how she came to do such a thing; she said a person gave her sixpence to bring the things into the room. I said I thought they were the woman's things that lodged in the room, because they had news-papers over them; they were lying on the bed. I sent to the Rotation-office, and an officer came and took charge of her.</p>

               <p>Lynch came into the public-house for me to help him to carry some boxes to General Conway's; when we came out of the house one of the boxes was gone. A woman, who sells fruit in the street, told me she saw a man with a box turn the corner towards the Hay-market. I pursued him immediately; I turned up Pall-Mall, and saw a man with a box under his arm; I asked him where he was going with the box; he dropped it and ran away. I pursued him with the box as well as I could, and cried stop thief! and the prisoner was stopped in St. James's-market and brought to me.</p>
               <p>Did you keep sight of him all the way after he dropped the box? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No; to the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man that dropped the box. The prisoner was taken before Sir

I went to see him in Tothilfields prison; as I returned I called upon Mr. Pye; I said, so one of your shop-mates is in prison! he said he was sorry for it; that he would not appear against him only he was afraid of being turned out of his work.</p>
               <p>Pye. I said no such a thing.</p>

               <p>I was apprentice to Mr. Ramsden when the prisoner came to work there. I have known him four years. He always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Is it not usual for workmen to bring tools of their own? - At times it may happen so.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he bring any tools with him when he came to work at Mr. Ramsden's? - It is not usual; I did not see him bring any; I cannot say he did not.</p>

I went up stairs, and found my drawers broke open, and all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were gone; the locks were all broke. The drawers were locked when I went out, and the keys were in my pocket. She broke a fork and an old iron skewer in breaking the locks open; the fork was in the drawers, and the skewer on the table by the drawers.

               <p>I was met by the prisoner and another girl on the 20th of September last. They came up to me, and asked me to give them something to drink; I said I would not. They asked me to go with them; I said no. The prisoner said to me, my dear, you had better come with me. I went with her and her partner to their lodgings, in the house of Mr. Burn, in <placeName id="t17790113-17-crimeloc98">Buckler's-street, St. Giles's</placeName>

There was no light; the prisoner said, young man, we have have eat no victuals all day, nor drank any thing. I said I had eat and drank enough, thank God, and put my hand in my pocket, and gave the prisoner a shilling; the other girl went down stairs, and brought up a loaf, some meat, and some beer, and a candle lighted. I stripped and went to bed; they were eating their victuals when I was in bed. I put my watch on the mantle piece over the chimney; it was a silver watch; the maker's name Bland, No. 2839. They eat enough as they said themselves; then the other girl came to bed. She pulled off all her clothes, but her smock. I was in bed. The prisoner pulled off her petticoat, her bonnet, and shoes. She went to my watch, and took hold of it; I asked her what she did with that, and bid her let it alone. O, my dear, said she, I am only putting it farther on, that it may not fall. She locked the door, put out the candle, and laid down on the bed without pulling any more of her clothes off; this was between ten and eleven o'clock. Soon after that I fell asleep; I awoke about one o'clock; I said I would see what o'clock it was, and put my hand over this way (describing it) and missed the prisoner. I awaked the other girl, and said where is your partner, I cannot find any of my things? just so. I got up in my shirt and felt about as well as I could in the dark, and found the door open; the other girl got up, and could not find her gown, one of her shoes, and one of her stockings; the prisoner had run away with them; so I came down as well as I could in the dark. I began to feel about the place down stairs till I came to the landlord's door; he called out, who is there? I was feeling about every where for this woman; the landlord asked, who is there? A friend says I; he said, what do you here? I said, indeed, I am robbed, I have lost all my things up stairs by one of the women. He got a light; I went in in my shirt. He said to his wife, God's blood and zounds, what is all this? what lodgers do you keep up stairs? His wife said, what brought him into my house, send him to the round-house? I said it was a pity to send me to the round-house, at that time of night, when I was naked; I said do not do it. The prisoner could not be found for ten weeks after; when she was taken I was at work in Grosvenor-square. The constable sent for me to Justice Welsh's office.</p>
               <p>All your clothes were taken away? - I was in my shirt. I searched the room, and all my clothes were gone but my shirt and my shoes. I went to the justice's at five in the evening, the day the constable sent for me, and saw the prisoner coming from the round-house. I knew her in a minute.</p>
               <p>How came the constable to know that this was the girl that robbed you; had you given a description of her? - Yes; at Justice Welsh's office the next morning; the other girl could not go with me for want of her clothes. I went to the justice's with the prisoner; he bid her tell what the had done with the things; she said she did not lie at home that night. The justice asked me if I knew her to be the person; I said I did. I have seen many women's faces. I knew none to be the woman, but this. She was sent back to prison till Wednesday to see if she would tell where the things were. I went again to the office at five o'clock on Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130019"/> night, and the prisoner would not tell any thing about it. She only laughed at the justice; the justice told her she was a hardened wretch, and he would commit her to Newgate; she laughed, and said that was the place she wanted to go to. I was desired to come to Hick's-hall the 11th of January.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your things? - Not a halfpenny worth.</p>

               <p>Could you see him? - Yes; it was only next door; He went a few doors farther, and put them in his pocket; he then returned, I thought, to take some more. I went over the way, and told the watchman of it, who was at my master's door.</p>

I went to lay hold of him, and he made a stroke at me with a stick, and ran away. I pursued him and took him. I asked him what he had done with the pots; he said they were Mr. Firmage's pots, that he was only playing the rogue with the boy, and would bring them to Mr. Firmage. I secured him, and brought him to Mr. Firmage's. The pots were not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Firmage. When the prisoner was brought to my house, we got a candle and lantern and searched the stable yard which he ran through, and found the pint pots on a dung-hill in the corner of the yard. Ayres was not with us when we found the pots.</p>

How long was it after you lost the things before you took the prisoner? - I went to synagogue at seven, returned at nine, and found my door broke open; the prisoner was in the house when I went out; she was out when I returned, and did not come home till noon; then I got a warrant and took her, and had her before Justice Justice Sherwood, and she owned taking the things to the officer. I did not hear it myself.</p>
               <p>Did you hear own it yourself? - Yes; at the justice's I heard her own it; I told her before we went to the justice, if she would own it it would better for her, and I would pay for the things; but she would not. I made her no promise afterwards.</p>

            . On the 23d of December, about eight in the evening, the prisoner came into my brother's shop, and asked to look at some children's ribbands; our journeyman served her with a yard, or a yard and half, which she paid for. I was marking some ribbands I had bought that morning; she came and looked at them, and desired me to cut her a yard and half off a piece she fixed on. While I was cutting it off, she took up two pieces which were lying on the counter, and dropped one of them into her apron, which was tucked up; her stays preventing it falling into her apron; she was obliged to shrink her belly in to let it fall in; I saw it in that situation; she paid me, and went out. I called to my man, who was then shutting up the shop to stop her, which he did; the ribband being not found upon her, I ordered her up stairs into the kitchen; my mistress and the servant searched her, but the ribband was not found. We had no other piece of that pattern.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - No; I believe she was connected with them, I apprehended that they were thieves, and looked sharp after them. I showed them the articles they asked for; they objected to it, and were going out; I said they had better let me cut them half a yard off; with that one came to the counter side, the other stood by a horse that we hang linen on to show. The prisoner stepped up on the step, and took this piece of printed linen from the horse. I stepped round the counter, called my wife, and went out after the prisoner, and saw it under her arm. I took her and brought her back. When I brought her into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130024"/> the shop, some of the neighbours came in; she up with her sist, and threatened to knock my wife down.

               <p>I lost a piece of cotton cloth last Friday. About four in the afternoon the prisoner and another woman came into shop to look at some cotton for a gown; while I was serving the other woman, the prisoner went to the farther end of the shop. When they went out, I thought the prisoner had something under her arm; I went after her and found the cotton upon her.</p>

I said if he had any he might let me have a sack; he said he would let me have it presently. He did not come again till about ten o'clock at night; then they both came; Mays brought the sack and shot it in the bin. I looked at it, it was a very bad sort. Harper said he had two sacks more that I might have; I said I did not choose to have them; he said if I would have them we should not differ about the price, and he would bring them; accordingly they brought the other two sacks and pitched them in my granary; I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130025"/> did not know the value of them, I did not know how the markets went, I would enquire and give him accordingly.

I said I had; he said he had lost three sacks out of his waggon.</p>

               <p>How was this confession made, did you make him any promise to induce him to confess? - No, there was no promise made him whatever, nor any thing of that sort hinted to him. When we carry our files to the file cutters, as they have so many, they mark the names of the persons they belong to upon them; my files were so marked. There is about a third of them are broken off just at the mark; I am certain to about thirty of them, the quantity laid in the indictment, being my property. Hedge very well knew Baylis was my apprentice; my dwelling house is at a distance from the house of Hedges but the place where I work is within ten yards of his house.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took Mrs. Hedge up on being informed by Mr. Jackman that these things belonged to him. I went with Jackman to Hedge's house; we found him in bed; I found the things mentioned in the indictment in his shop; they lay about the shop; some in one place, some in another, some of them rather out of sight; the mandrell was open in the shop. I took Baylis, and told him the best thing he could do for his master, now he had robbed him, was to confess what he had taken.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I borrowed the Mandrell to round some handles, and the screw I borrowed to mend a brass fronted stow; as to the box and pin the young man asked me to let him leave them there till he fetched them away. I have often lent him tools out of my shop for his master's use. I thought there was no harm in borrowing a tool of a man.</p>

               <p>I live at Brentwood. On the 6th of January, about half after seven o'clock, I went into <placeName id="t17790113-26-crimeloc145">New-street, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

                        targets="t17790113-26-off143 t17790113-26-crimeloc145"/>, to enquire for a person. I could not find the person; I met the prison Wright, and enquired of her if she knew such a man; she said she did, and took me into a house, where she said the man lived. She went up stairs, and came down and told me the man was above and would come down presently; I sat down and sent for a pot of beer. When I got up and was coming out, Perry knocked me down, and took my money out of my pocket, my watch, and my knee buckles. I struggled and got my watch again; my buckles and money I never got; I was glad to get out of the house as soon as I could. I went and got a constable, and returned to the house, they were not in the house; then we went to the next door to see after them, and as we were coming out, we met Perry coming in with a quartern of gin in a glass. I said to the constable that is the woman that knocked me down; she said she never saw me; I said constable that is the woman, take her. As we were coming out with her she produced the buckles to the constable; as we were going out Wright came in, and we took her also.</p>
               <p>Wright. Did not you spend two shillings in liquor, and one shilling in victuals? - No.</p>
               <p>Perry. I fetched in the liquor? - I believe she did, and locked the door on me. When they got me in she took the key in her hand, and swore, you bloody buggering villain, if you do not deliver us your money we will kill you. When they had got my money they opened the door and turned me out; then I went and got a constable.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On the sixth of this month, between ten and eleven at night, the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130027"/> said he had been robbed of his buckles and seven shillings. I asked him if he knew the prisoners that had robbed him; he said yes. We went to the room, the prisoners were not there; we went into the next room, and the tallest woman (that is Perry) came in with some liquor in her hand, and the prosecutor gave me charge of her. I said if you have the buckles let us have them? She went to the chimney-piece, and gave me the buckles. I searched her and found a shilling and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>(The buckles were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Wright came in, and we took her, but found nothing upon her; she had no pockets on.</p>
               <p>Wright. Did not I say if he would give me the three shillings for lying with me, I would give him the buckles? - No.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in Bishopsgate-street, just come from work. I saw this man; he asked me where I was going; I said home. He went home with me, and sent for something to drink. He spent three shillings; he had no more in the world. When he was going to bed; he said, my dear, I will make you a present of these knee buckles to sleep with you all night. I went to bed with him; he got up in a rage, and said he would not stay any longer he was going into the country. He took his watch, and said give me my knee buckles; I said I would not, he might stay all night if he would, and he gave me a smack of the face.</p>
               <p>PERRY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was washing next door to this place; I was just finished. Wright came and asked me for the key of the room, and she and this man went in. I fetched two or three pots of beer, then a shilling-worth of ham, and he gave her the buckles to sleep with her.</p>
               <p>Wright. He was very much in liquor.</p>

               <p>What age are you? - Thirteen. The prisoner came to our shop last Saturday, and bought a handkerchief; she then asked to look at some lace. I sent a little boy into the parlour, where m y mistress lay-in, to bring a little box of lace out, and I showed her several pieces; there was none that would do. As I was putting the lace into the box off the counter, I saw her take a piece, and lay it on the paper her handkerchief was in, and put it altogether in at her pocket hole. When she had done this, she was going sharp from the counter; I called out stop ma'am. She was opening the street door in a great hurry; I ran round the counter, laid hold of her gown, and called for nurse, who was in the next room, to come and assist me; we took her, and brought her into the parlour. I charged her with stealing the lace; she instantly denied it; she was very willing to be stripped and searched twice; the second time the lace was found. I was not in the room when it was found.</p>

             asked me how I did, and how all the people at Tothilfields did. We went up stairs, and sat about half an hour with a shoe-maker. Marshall asked Wilkins what o'clock it was; it was then five minutes after seven o'clock. Marshall asked me to go down stairs; Marshall went down, I followed him, and the prosecutor came after me. Marshall called Minsham out of the other ward; they shut to the door. I was shoved behind the door; I heard the prosecutor cry out, Gentlemen, do not burt me, take what I have and welcome.

I had notice from my client, that no such note or letter had come to hand, I read Mr. French's letter in the presence of the prisoner and two others of my clerks. On receiving the letter from Mr. French, I told my clerks I was sure the letter had not gone fairly out of the office, that I suspected one of them, and if any one of them would confess taking the letter, and let me have the letter again, it should go no farther; none of them would confess it; upon which I took them to the Rotation-office, and they were examined. I went to the Bank, and found the note indorsed,

I took the prisoner on the 1st of January, after he had absented himself from my service nine days; he then showed great concern, and desired to speak to me in private, which I refused to do. I charged him with stealing the letter and taking the 20 l. note out of it, and he offered to give me a note for the 20 l. I refused, and ordered him to be taken to the Rotation-office. On the Thursday before he absented himself, he desired me to settle his accounts. I was going out in a hurry to settle some deeds. I said I would when I came back; when I returned, he was gone. I saw no more of him till I took him on the 1st of January; he had absented himself previous to this, from the 10th till Monday the 14th, under pretence of having cut his thumb; that was before I knew that the note was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This conversation about giving of a twenty pound note was on the 1st of January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After you had said in the office that it was better to restore the note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You took him in his own lodging? - Not in his own lodging; when we went after him, he fled into a two-pair-of-stairs room, where he never was before.</p>
               <p>There is a door out of the office into the street without going into the house? - Yes; there are two doors to the office, one into the street and the other into the dwelling-house; but my orders are that the door into the street shall always be kept shut when they go out of the office; and I believe they were complied with.</p>

I said before the magistrate that I would have given forty pound for the letter.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Frost. About the 5th of December last Mr. Frost wrote a letter to a Mr. French, and threw it down upon my desk and desired some of us, meaning the clerks, to put it in the post.</p>
               <p>How many clerks were in the office then? - Three of us. Some time after, wanting to go to dinner, I desired Mr. Bonney, the youngest clerk, to take the letter to the Post-office; he desired I would take it; I told him I should not, and desired he would take it, as he had taken a copy of the bill which I believed was in that letter; I left the letter and went out; the prisoner was then present. Mr. Frost gave Mr. Bonney the bill to copy; the prisoner examined the bill with Mr. Bonney; I was present at the time. When I left the office, the letter was lying on my desk; the prisoner was standing by the fire, and Mr. Bonney was at his desk. I did not return till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Frost came into the office and gave the intimation that the bill was missing? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Frost say on that occasion? - He came in, and told us it was a very serious matter, that somebody must have taken the letter, meaning, I imagine, one of us; he said that if either of us would acknowledge that we had the note or the letter, that he would really forgive it, and take no farther notice of it.</p>
               <p>The note or the letter, was it both? - Either.</p>
               <p>None of you did acknowledge it at that time? - No; we were all taken that evening to the Rotation-office, and examined; when Mr. Frost again repeated, that he would forgive the person who had taken the note or letter, provided it was either of us. We all denied knowing any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day of the month when this promise was made, and you were taken to the Rotation-office? - I cannot exactly remember the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner continue in the office till you had notice that the letter was missing or miscarried? - Yes; all the time; he was absent, after the letter was missing, from Thursday to Monday. I do not know the day of the week; he was taken upon the first of January; I was present when he was taken; Mr. Frost charged him with taking the note that had been missing; he said he hoped he did not intend to charge him solely with it; he said he certainly should, for he had received the money; then he wanted to speak with Mr. Frost in private, and said that he would give him a twenty pound note.</p>
               <p>Did he do that of himself, without any promise or threat whatever? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he intimate what the twenty pound note was to be given for? - He said he would give him a note for twenty pounds; he wanted to speak with him in private, but Mr. Frost refused it. We had received a letter on Wednesday from an acquaintance of Mr. French, informing us, that Mr. French had not received the letter. Mr. Mollineaux came in the evening, I think, of the Wednesday, before Mr. Frost came home, and told us he was surprised to find Mr. French<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130031"/> had not received the letter and the twenty pounds. Just as Mollineaux was going out, I said it was very surprising what was become of the note, somebody must have it; it would come out; the prisoner said, do not acquaint Mr. Frost with it now, stay till another time; I said why not?</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this? - I believe it might be about six or seven; our candles were lighted at the time. When Mr. Frost came home, I was going to tell him; he turned away and met Mr. Bonney, the young clerk, who informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You knew in the office that this note was missing before you saw Mr. Mollineaux? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was no secret in the office, Mr. Frost knew of it before? - Yes; but he was not acquainted with the contents of Mr. Mollineaux's letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost knew that the letter was missing before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost. I knew of it on the Monday, this was on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Frost. On the 5th of December Mr. Frost gave me a note of twenty pounds to take a copy of.</p>
               <p>Did you examine it with any body? - Yes; with the prisoner. When I had copied it I delivered it back to Mr. Frost.</p>
               <p>How long after you gave it back was it that Mr. Frost gave the letter to go by the post; did he say that the note was to go by the post when he gave it you to copy? - Yes, and gave me the outside of the letter to copy.</p>
               <p>Did he make this declaration in the presence of the prisoner, that it was to go by the post? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long after did Mr. Frost leave the letter? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you carry the letter? - No; it lay some time on the desk where Mr. Frost put it. Mr. Williams was going to dinner, the prisoner was standing by the fire; Mr. Williams and I had some words about taking it as he was going out.</p>
               <p>Did Williams give any reason why he would have you take the letter more than any of the other clerks? - Yes; because I had taken a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Williams go away? - Yes; and left the letter behind him.</p>
               <p>Did you take it? - No; the prisoner and I went into another room to look for a book; when I went out of the office, I locked the door that opens into the street.</p>
               <p>You left the letter in the office? - I am not certain whether it was there then, it was there when Williams went from the office; after we had been looking in a room or two, we returned into the office and the prisoner took his hat and we went out again and went up stairs; the door was then locked; we could not find the book; I let him out at the street door into Charlotte-street, then I returned into the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see the letter, or do you know whether it was in the office at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the letter again? - No; I sat down and wrote some time; the letter came into my mind I looked on the desk it was not there; I searched a little time, but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to be so careful to lock the office every time you go out into any room in the house? - I always do if there is nobody in the office.</p>
               <p>There is a door out of the office into the street, and a door into the house? - Yes. When the prisoner returned from dinner, I asked him if he had taken it to the post; he said, as I understood, that he had taken it and given it to James, Mr. Frost's servant, he seemed to laugh at me for thinking it was not safe.</p>
               <p>Did you think it was not safe, by asking after it? - I thought it was safe when he told me he had taken it. On the 10th of the same month he went out about twelve o'clock, and never returned till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was the 10th? - Thursday; Monday was the 14th. Mr. Frost came to town on the Monday morning; we received a letter for him on the Saturday before, from Mr. French.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130032"/>Did he tell you that he had received a letter from Mr. French? - Yes.</p>

            , Tatonhall, Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire; there are the initials of my name to the copy.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Frost say to you when he found Mr. French, had not received the letter? - What he said was after Mr. Mollineaux came, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you in the office when Mr. Mollineaux came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was your master? - Gone out. I went out just as Mr. Mollineaux went out; when I returned I met Mr. Frost as I came in, and told him what Mr. Mollineaux had said. The first time I spoke to the prisoner about it was before Mr. Mollineaux came. When I found that the letter did not go safe, I asked him if he did not give the letter to James; he said no, he did not; that he said perhaps James might take it; I told him I thought he said that he had given it to James. I was not certain what he had said to me; I was doubtful.</p>
               <p>You doubted whether he had said perhaps James might take it, or whether he said he had taken it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think now he said James had taken it? - Yes. Upon Tuesday the 22d of December Mr. Frost came into the office, and told us it must lay amongst us, it must be one of us that had taken the note, and that if either of us would confess it, and give him the letter, he would forgive the note.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was his expression? - Yes, my lord, I am pretty certain of it.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you, or did he give you any, why he was anxious to have the letter? - He said there was something private in it, that he would not wish any one to know but Mr. French and himself.</p>
               <p>Then you were carried before the justice of peace? - Yes; we were all examined there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner continue in the office all the time after that? - No; the next day he was very anxious to see Mr. Frost, to settle his accounts; that was the 23d, I believe, between ten and twelve in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Frost settle his accounts? - No; Mr. Frost was going out about a good deal of business; he told him he could not do it then, he would when he returned.</p>
               <p>Did he stay till Mr. Frost came home? - No; he said he was going out and would return again; he went out and presently returned; then he said he was going home to dinner, and went away but never returned again.</p>
               <p>You never saw him afterwards till he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was taken up? - No; I saw him at the Rotation-office.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>At the time the prisoner was absent from the 10th to the 14th, Mr. Frost himself was out of town, was he not? - No; he went out of town on the Saturday, and returned on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his saying that the reason why he could not come was because he had cut his thumb? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that you thought at first he said that he had given the letter to James; when he said he did not say so, but that perhaps James took it, you doubted which was the expression? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he give any reason why he wanted his accounts settled? - He said he was going to see his sister in Hampshire.</p>
               <p>You did not see the Bank note put in the letter? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Did you ever receive a letter, or take a letter from the office? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prisoner, about any letter being taken out of the office? - No.</p>
               <p>That is all you know about it I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Frost. There is another note which has not been mentioned, which the constable took out of his pocket, which is another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130033"/> 20 l. note, which I lost from a drawer, marked with the letter N in my office, where I usually keep these notes; I gave that note to the prisoner the latter end of August, or beginning of September to receive; the woman that drew it desired me to wait a little while. After the time was expired, I gave it to the prisoner to present to the Board of Green Cloth; he returned it to me again, and to the best of my rememberance I put it in the drawer. When he was absconded, I looked in the drawer for the note, and missed it, and said, that he had taken that as well as the Bank note.</p>
               <p>You said you gave it to him first to receive; that an excuse was made desiring you to wait a particular time, and he then gave it you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You gave it him a second time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you think he gave it you again and you put it in the drawer? - Yes; I think I asked him for it and he gave it me, and I put it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>And the moment he absconded, you looked in the drawer where you expected to find it, and it was gone? - Yes; and I went immediately into the office, and said he had got the note of Mrs. Carter's too with him.</p>
               <p>(The note was read in court, and answered the description given of it in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Was that drawer locked or open? - Open.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you do those things, it is a great temptation? - I would not have kept him in my office, if I had not thought him honest.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and searched him by the order of the magistrate. When we went to search him, he objected to it, and strove very much against it; but when he found that he was rather overpowered he clapped his hand in his left hand breeches pocket and pulled a paper out of it, it was immediately observed, and twitched out of his fingers.</p>
               <p>He did not deliver it to you? - No; it was taken by force out of his fingers.</p>
               <p>Do you know what it was? - It was delivered into Mr. Frost's hands; I saw it opened.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Frost. Is that the paper that was delivered into your hand? - Yes; it was delivered to me immediately.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the time the bill was returned unpaid the second time before he absented himself? - I think it was returned the second time in November. I did not look after that note till he was absconded. I had given her time, and the Board of Green Cloth had given her time the second time.</p>
               <p>Was the time they had given her expired? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were there other letters besides this left that night to go by the post? - Not one.</p>

            , came to acquaint us that the house was robbed. I went down directly as soon as the horse was put to; Mr. Wood having been ill, we had not been down from the 5th of November. I went down and found the door that opens into the garden on the back part of the house broke open; the staple had been wrenched; but that is not the door we went out at when we left the house.</p>
               <p>Was the fore-door locked or not? - It was locked as it was when I left it; the pair of gates which go into the garden were forced open; when I went in I missed three towels, five keys, and all the other things mentioned in the indictment; they had broke into the cellar and cleared away almost all the liquors. I imagine they drank some in the house, for I found in the fore-parlour a cup that had rum in it; there were three candles that had been lighted, and candle grease dropped about the house, and particularly in one closet where I had never had a candle.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman at Hampstead. On the 18th of December in the morning, about three o'clock, as I was crying the hour, I met a farmer's cart with some lambs; the carman told me there was a little cart coming behind very much loaded. I kept calling the hour. Presently I saw another cart, there was one horse drawing it and a little horse beside it, on which two men rode; there were three men on the cart. I said, good morning to you, and stepping out of the causeway into the road, said, what have you got in the cart? They made no answer, but began whipping the horses, and drove as fast as they could, and drove the cart against the wall of a broker's shop, and overturned it, and broke the shafts. The men on horse-back rode off as fast as they could. I made a stroke at one of them with a hanger as he turned the corner; I missed my blow, and had like to have fallen, but recovered myself. Ball came up, I asked him where he was going to; he said, he did not belong to the cart; he was just come down the town. I asked him what house he came out of, he said out of no house, and made a stroke at me with his fist, and struck me in the neck. I up with my hanger, and said, if he offered to strike again I would cut him down. I secured him, and took him to the cart, and desired my partner, another watchman, to take care of him. Edwards the constable came, and I gave him charge of him; and went and took the goods out of the cart, and delivered them into the custody of Mr. Muddocks, another constable.</p>
               <p>Did you observe, in the overturning of the cart, whether any one of the men in the scuffle lost his hat? - No. Muddocks found a hat as he was carrying the goods up to his house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130035"/>Do you know the persons that attended the cart? - Yes; Osborne was the first man that rode on the little horse.</p>
               <p>Are you able to speak to the other? - Yes; by the colour of his clothes; he lay upon the cart.</p>
               <p>Osborne. How can you swear to me by seeing me in so dark a night? - I have known him many years; he lived with Mr. Greenall, and drove his cart.</p>

               <p>Did you go to Mr. Wood's house to try the keys that were found upon Ball? - I did. When we came to the house Mrs. Wood imagined these three keys to be her's. I went to the different locks she said they belonged to, and tried them, and they fitted exactly. One is the key of the wash-house, another the key of the pantry, the other is the key of a closet in the kitchen. This pick-lock key I tried, and found it opened the front door. I apprehended they opened the front door to get in; and got out at the back door; it was broke open in the inside. There was the track of a cart and one horse from the back door. I tried the chissel and crow found on Ball, with the marks of the door that was broke open, and other places that were broken, and they fitted the marks exactly.</p>

He candidly told who were concerned with him in the robbery.</p>
               <p>To M'Donald. In consequence of an information you had received did you go after the prisoners? - Yes; I found Osborne and Hilsdon at the house of a Mr. Davis in Fetter-lane, up two pair of stairs; they were lying on the bed in their clothes; their shoes were all over country dirt. As I was going to hand-cuff them, Hilsdon put his hand in his pocket and pulled out two keys, and was going to throw them away. I asked him what he was going to throw away; he said only two keys that he had had six weeks, which he picked up. There was a towel lying on the bed between them that belongs to Mr. Wood. Grubb who was with me took care of it. There was a crow hid in the chimney. I went to Mr. Wood's house and tried the keys; they fitted the locks of the two closets of the fore-parlour.</p>

               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners on the morning of the 18th of December? - I do not recollect the day of the month; it was the morning of the report of this robbery at Hampstead. As I came through Hampstead, about six o'clock, I heard of the robbery. In coming to London on horse-back I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130036"/> middle man, that is Hilsdon, at Battle Bridge; he had an handkerchief about his head. Seeing him without a hat, and having heard that one of the men had lost his hat, I had a suspicion of him, and looked hard at him. He came towards me and I thought was going to attack me. I looked very hard at him, and believe Hilsdon is the man. He had on a blue jacket, like a sailor's jacket, very much worn. I told the turnpike men of it, they said if he came that way they would take him. I will not swear positively to the man, one man may be like another, but to the best of my knowledge he is the man.</p>
               <p>Grubb. He had a blue sailor's jacket on when he was taken.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Wood. I saw the things in the hands of the constable, they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muddock. The things that Mrs. Wood saw in my custody are the things that were taken out of the cart. There is a tea chest which has been broke open; the mark where it has been broke open, exactly corresponds with the chissel that has been produced.</p>

She then came out; I told her I was in danger of being taken up for things I had pawned for her out of her ready furnished lodging, and that I had no lodging; she said they could not hurt her as they turned her out. Mrs. Fielding said I might stay there; I asked Mrs. Lloyd to give me some shoes, she said I might take some of her sister's things, and say nothing to her; she would fetch them out without telling her of it. The maid and I had a quarrel, and she told her mistress I had taken the things; Mrs. Fielding said if I would give her sister a receipt in full she would not hurt me.</p>

               <p>Is it a part of the house? - We go through it into the house; there is a way out of the house into it, and a way out of the street into it; it is directly under the door-way that goes into the dwelling-house. I put them there between five and six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Was the way out of the street into that place fastened? - I cannot say. I was informed on Monday that there had been a man in the house; I went down stairs, got a candle, and went into the tackle-house; I found the door open that goes into it, which I had fastened on Saturday night. I missed this shovel, the first thing. One of the men went after the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the place where the shovel was fastened up on Saturday night? - I am certain it was.</p>
               <p>Has it a communication with the dwelling-house, is there a door out of the dwelling-house into it? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you said there was? - No, there is no door out of the house into it.</p>

I heard it was broke open on the 7th of January. I sent my daughter to the house on the 4th, when she returned she said that every thing was safe. I went down on the 7th, and found the shutters of the window that looks into the garden broke all to pieces, both inside and out; the iron bar that fastens the window was broke. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were all safe when I left the house on the 24th of December. I was informed a woman was stopped with some of our chairs upon her. I saw the prisoner at a publick-house in Shoreditch, and went with her before Justice Wilmot.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop at Kingstand, rather more than a hundred yards, from the prosecutor's house; as they dealt with me and the house had been broken open twice before, I made it my business to go now and then and look at the house. I went and looked at the house on the 6th of January, between four and five o'clock, all the doors and windows appeared then to be fast.</p>
               <p>Could you see the window that looks into the garden? - No, I could not, because the garden gate was shut. Between three and four o'clock, on that day I had seen the prisoner and two other women go by; I looked after them and saw them take particular notice of this house. About half after seven o'clock in the morning of the 7th, as I was opening my shop, I saw a man and woman coming with some goods about a hundred yards off; presently after I saw the prisoner come by with two chairs; when I had fastened my shutters back, I walked down to Mr. Allen's house and met the prisoner coming out of the gate with two chairs; I let her pass me, and then went into a field and round to the back door and found it was fast, I got over a ditch and pushed the gate that goes into the yard, and found it was broke open, the back window was broke all to pieces, and the iron plate bent; I immediately followed the prisoner; and between my house and the gentleman's which was broke open, I met a man, and asked him to assist me to take a person that had broke a house open; he went on before and took her on the other side of Shoreditch turnpike, and stopped her till I came up; when I came up to them she had one of the chairs upon her head, and the man had the other; she asked me if they were mine; I said no, but I would keep her in custody till I sent for the gentleman whose house they had been taken from.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of last month, about twenty minutes or half after six, I was going to the lottery-office; I saw the two prisoners and two others in company together; as I was coming back I met the prosecutrix going towards Bishopsgate-street with a bundle upon her head; they made up to the woman.</p>
               <p>Did you see them make up to the woman? - Yes; Bird knocked the woman down. I cannot say whether he struck her over the head, or over the shoulder, or over the back, I was so terrified.</p>
               <p>Was the other man with him? - They were in company together.</p>
               <p>Had you known them before by sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoners were the men? - Yes. I made up as quick as I could to an officer,

               <p>Was you in company with Binns on the 8th of December? - I cannot say with regard to the night; he was with me at dinner; I cannot speak as to the day, I am no scholar, I believe it was the day he was charged with that affair.

               <p>You are certain the body had been entered? - Yes; the hymen was broke, and there was an inflammation and other appearances of her having been entered.</p>
               <p>If such an injury as that had been recently committed on such a girl as that, must it not have appeared? - Yes; it had been done some time; the inflammation had subsided.</p>

               <p>- JARVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the girl was foul. I went up into the nurse's room, and asked her how she came so; she told me first that a boy had been concerned with her; I said I did not believe that, and bid her tell me the truth; then she said her father had; that he took her out to Bartholomew fair; took her to a house in Bunhill-row; that she had the head-ach and lay on the bed, and that he ravished her.</p>
               <p>Did she say that he did it while she was asleep? - She said she was asleep and that he put his hands up her coats and waked her, just as she told Mr. Noakes.</p>
               <p>To the Girl. How came you to say a boy was concerned with you? - The boy did it after my daddy did it.</p>
               <p>How long after was it that the boy did it? - A good while after.</p>
               <p>How soon after it was done did you feel yourself ill? - I felt a pain about me soon after.</p>
               <p>Hooton. I washed her linen; it was stained very bad.</p>
               <p>How long after Bartholomew fair? - Not above a week after.</p>
               <p>To the Girl. Where does this boy belong to that you said did it? - He is in the work-house.</p>
               <p>How old is he? -</p>

               <p>A woman came to me while I worked in Bunhill-row (I worked there two days and a half) she came to me on the Saturday afternoon and said the child was not well; she believed she was fretted at not going to Bartholomew fair; I went on Monday and took her to Clothfair, to an acquaintance; we staid there a while for the rain, and then I took her and the gentlewoman's child to the fair and gave them a ride round in a coach; I took her afterwards to Bunhill-row, and left her in the room while I went to the Sheers to drink. I had no bed in the room; a gentlewoman who is here was in the room all the time.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw him the last day of Bartholomew fair at the Hand and Sheers.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - Nobody but the people of the house; he said his daughter was gone home with the nurse; if I had come a little sooner I should have seen her.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at your house? - Yes; pretty near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>What was his behaviour? - Very civil as far as I saw. I never saw the child.</p>
               <p>Who washed his linen? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any marks upon it about the time of Bartholomew fair? - I employ a washerwoman; I saw nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to believe he had the foul disorder while he was at your house? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When did he leave your house? - The Thursday after Bartholomew fair.</p>
               <p>Jury to the surgeon. Whether it is possible for a man who has not the foul disorder to give it to a child of that age? - It is not; there may be such appearances, where it is not really that disease. My only reason for believing it to be that disorder is its giving way to the usual medicines on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hooton. You said the stain on her linen was very bad; what do you mean<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130047"/> by that? What sort of stain was it? - It was of a white colour.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other stain on the linen before that? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you never find any blood? - No.</p>
               <p>Surgeon. The appearance she has described is usual in the venereal.</p>
               <p>If such a child's body is entered, it must be by a great deal of force and violence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would not that occasion a great discharge of blood? - Certainly; but it was five weeks after the time that I examined her. There could be no appearance of it then.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether the effect is the same with a child as it would be with a woman after she comes to have her proper courses? - Undoubtly so.</p>
               <p>Then there must be blood? - Yes.</p>

I counted the money in the till before I went to bed. In the morning I staid up stairs till after breakfast to give them an opportunity to come; when I came down I counted the money, and found there was only six-pence farthing more in the till than there was over night. I then went to Mr. Bailey to know if he had sent; he said he had sent his boy with a marked shilling to lay out eight-pence halfpenny. I then went to Mr. Ward, he had not sent; he said if I would go home and send my wife up stairs out of the shop, he would send his man with some marked money I did, and then returned to Mr. Ward's, and he sent his man, whose name is Dunbar, for some beans; Dunbar came back, and said the prisoner served him, and took the money; on which I went home, and looked in the till, and found the money was not put in the till.</p>

               <p>Court. How came Dominiceti to pay you a debt due from Forman to Harris? - I was in some particular circumstances; I went to France; when I returned Forman, who was my servant, had entered into partnership with Ramponi; he had these things of Mr. Harris my brother at Bath. I found he had got in debt, and told him he must get out of it as well as he could; he said Mr. Dominiceti would see him out, and he brought Dominiceti with him to my house and he gave me this note; Dominiceti said I am always doing good; I must get these poor devils out as well as I can; he gave me this note for six months and the rest in cash.</p>
               <p>Did you give a receipt at that time? - I signed that receipt; the doctor dictated it, my wife wrote it, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Your servant Forman and Ramponi, as you understood from Forman, entered into partnership together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the course of that business your brother-in-law at Bath furnished some goods only on the account of Forman, to the amount of twenty-four pounds fourteen shillings and six-pence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was for Birmingham ware? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon this Forman and Ramponi disagreeing they dissolved the partnership? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the partnership was dissolved you wanted to have the twenty-four pounds fourteen shillings and six-pence, and Dominiceti came with Forman and paid you in this way? - Yes; that was the very way of it.</p>
               <p>(Shown the bill of parcels.) That is the bill of parcels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You wrote that receipt by the direction of Dominiceti? - My wife did.</p>

               <p>When was the first time; I should like to lead you right; perhaps it may be two months ago? - I cannot say. I have a great deal of business.</p>

               <p>At what time, and in what manner was it afterwards discovered, that that note was in the state it is now a 20 l. note? - After that note was inserted the account was cast up.</p>
               <p>Court. The sum total as it stood before was cast up, and the prisoner was going to sign it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was added to the other total? - Yes. Then Ramponi was called into the room, and the doctor informed Ramponi, that the account current was ready to be signed. Ramponi was going to sign the account; but observed to the doctor that he had charged him with this 20 l. note, which he should not have done. The doctor asked him the reason; he said, doctor you are to recollect that I paid into your hands the sum of 30 l. 12 s. 11 d. the amount of Mr. Van Dutchet's bill, not only to discharge the note, but to discharge the whole bill of Mr. Paris; there was some altercation upon the occasion, when the doctor said, I must have laid out that money for you for some other purposes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130052"/>What did Ramponi say when the doctor said he had laid out that money for some other purposes? - Ramponi said, very well, sir. I said, will it not be better doctor to put this among the other charges? because there were some passages in the account current they did not approve of, and a memorandum was made of it to be settled another time.</p>
               <p>Court. There were some charges not liquidated then? - There was some charges in the account current that were disputed, and were to be settled at another time, which memorandum was signed by Dr. Dominiceti; this was added to the memorandum.</p>
               <p>Read from that memorandum in English what relates to this charge; I see the memorandum is in Italian.</p>
               <p>(Reads.) The following articles to be considered, repeated, and for the discussion and effectuation of them, the parties are ready to refer themselves to two common friends, a satisfaction relating to two promissory notes of Mr. Sackney of 20 l. each, charged to Dr. Dominiceti, to what relates to the workmanship for the opening and shutting three doors, to whatever relates to Mr.

             the carpenter's bill, to the amount of the iron gate or door, to the amount of the bulk for emptying the necessaries, blacksmiths, colourmen, painters, slatemen, upholsterer, paper-hanging, and whatever other expences occurred to render the house in the present state, in which it was found at the time Dr. Dominiceti took possession of it; and to agree to the contents this is signed by our hands in the presence of the witness.</p>
               <p>Is that all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have not mentioned a word of this note? - It was inserted after Dr. Dominiceti's signing it.</p>
               <p>Read what was done after that? - After this was drawn the doctor signed it; then the article relating to the 20 l. was inserted. (Reads) The surplus of the amount of the 20 l. note of Mr. Parys.</p>
               <p>That addition finishes the memorandum? - Yes; although it was signed before that was inserted.</p>
               <p>Read what relates to this note in English literally as it is in the memorandum. - The surplus of the amount of the 20 l. to Mr. Parys.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think you say, during this transaction nobody was present but you three, Dr. Dominiceti, yourself, and Ramponi? - I beg your pardon, Ramponi was not present, it was only Dr. Dominiceti and I except the black servant, who went backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>How long after the account had been signed was this memorandum signed? - The memorandum and the account current were both signed at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was not the doctor's son present? - No; he was not.</p>
               <p>How came he to be a subscribing witness then? - He came between the hours of six and seven that he might sign the memorandum; we waited for him, that he might witness it.</p>
               <p>And not the account current? - There was no witnesses to the account current.</p>
               <p>How long after the account current was the memorandum signed? - They were both signed at the same time.</p>
               <p>Within five minutes of one another? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came the young doctor to witness it if he was not there? - It was lying on the table when he came in, and he signed it; we waited for the young doctor three quarters of an hour; he was busy in town.</p>
               <p>The sum paid for Parys was 24 l. 14 s. 6 d. whereas the sum charged in this account is only 20 l. is there any charge of the 4 l. any where? - No.</p>
               <p>You told us just now that the doctor after the items of the account had been inserted and cast up, said to you, stay, I recollect I have a note of Ramponi? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he produce the note? - Yes; he took it out of his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>He recollected that circumstance and added that to it out of his pocket-book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was not a dispute whether he had paid 16 l. or 20 l. or 24 l. it was agreed afterwards to set it down and see what Parys's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130053"/> bill came to? - There was not a word mentioned of Parys's bill.</p>

               <p>When Ramponi was going to sign he observed to the doctor that he should not have charged this 20 l. the doctor asked why; Ramponi said,</p>

            's bill, not only to discharge the note, but to discharge the whole bill of Mr. Parys." The doctor said, I must have laid out that money for you for some other purposes; Ramponi said, very well, sir; then you said, it was better to put that among the other charges, to be settled another time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whether there was not a doubt between the parties how much he had paid to Parys? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came it to be entered in the memorandum</p>
               <p>"the surplus of the amount of the 20 l. note to Mr. Parys," how came that to be entered in that way unless there was a doubt between the parties what was paid to Parys? - There was not a doubt about the sum paid to Parys.</p>
               <p>Did not you formerly live at Dr. Dominiceti's, in his service? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long a time? - Almost a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>How came you to be dismissed from that service? - because I did not like to transact business in the way Dominiceti directed.</p>
               <p>If so, how came you to write such strange letters (shows him a letter) is that your writing? - This is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Was not that wrote in answer to a letter from young Dr. Dominiceti, charging you with forgery, upon your oath? - I do not recollect to have received a letter from young Dr. Dominiceti about the forgery.</p>
               <p>I mean a letter charging you with forgery? - I do not recollect receiving any letter from the doctor.</p>
               <p>From the young doctor? - I do not recollect receiving a letter from him.</p>
               <p>No; don't you beg in your letter in answer to his,</p>
               <p>"no, never was it my intention to exculpate myself, much less to lay the crime on others; what you charge me with I tacitly confess"? - Is that the contents of my letter?</p>
               <p>Translate it yourself. - (Reads) Much less to appropriate those faults to others, and whatever I declare myself I do rectify.</p>
               <p>Was that in answer to any letter you received from young Dr. Dominiceti? - I do not recollect to have received any letter on the occasion.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - A writer. I was employed three years by Mr. Martinellis, as an emanuensis, in writing the history of England.</p>
               <p>How long have you lest that business off? - Six years.</p>
               <p>What have you done since? - I instruct gentlemen and ladies in the languages.</p>
               <p>You have been abroad I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Craigh? - To my mortification I do?</p>
               <p>Why to your mortification? - Because I did not act as an honest man would have done.</p>
               <p>Explain yourself; how long have you commenced this new trade of honesty? In what did you not act the part of an honest man? - Being with some officers, they directed me to act a part an honest man would not have done.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Craigh is Governor Advocate at Gibraltar. How long have you acted the part of an honest man? - I have endeavoured to act the part of an honest man since that.</p>
               <p>Pray, upon the settlement of the account, as I have it, there was due to Dr. Dominiceti<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130054"/> on the balance 343 l. 17 s. 3 d. is that right? - Yes; it appeared so.</p>
               <p>In order to make this balance of 343 l. there is an item I see of the difference of 4 l. in the account. I wish to know as that was the balance due to Dominiceti; what were Ramponi's circumstances at that time, was he solvent? - I think he was not.</p>
               <p>Did not the doctor propose, if he would give him security, to take 10 s. in the pound? - He said if he could pay him the sum of 100 l. he would discharge him of the whole.</p>
               <p>I see according as you make the account, the debtor side is 944 l. 2 s. 4 d. the creditor side is 600 l. 5 s. 3 d? - It is.</p>
               <p>I see the first item in the account is to the amount, in sundry promissory notes paid for his honour, 1776, 1777, and 1778, 400 l. 17 s. 6 d. Had not Dr. Dominiceti been extremely a friend to Ramponi? - I do not know, Ramponi as far as I understood had paid the sums of money into his hands before he gave the notes.</p>
               <p>How comes it to pass, if these various sums of money had been paid by Ramponi into the hands of Dr. Dominiceti, for which the doctor should be made debtor, that none of those articles are charged in the account, nor entered to be referred; how came that about? - I cannot say; I

             the account between them as far as they gave me instructions.</p>
               <p>They signed and approved of the accounts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to say there were sums advanced by Ramponi? - I understood Dr. Dominiceti had cash lodged in his hands before these notes were given.</p>
               <p>This article of 20 l. for the note was inserted after the account was cast u p? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The account was cast up on the debtor side 928 l. 2 s. 4 d? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the 20 l. is added, making 944 l. 2 s. 4 d. which in fact is adding but 16 l. how is that? was that a mistake in casting up, or was it agreed that it should stand for 16 l. only? - There was no agreement made, nor nothing about 16 l. mentioned.</p>
               <p>How came 928, and 20 added not to be 48, but 944 only?</p>
               <p>Court. The figure appears to have been altered.</p>
               <p>You had cast it up 928, and only added 20, instead of making 8 and 8 16, you make 8 and 8 12, you make 8 added to 0 to make exactly 4; how do you account for that?</p>
               <p>Court. If that balance was paid, Ramponi would answer for the note at 16 l. only.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>In both the papers, the 8 is altered to 4.</p>
               <p>I believe the way in which this balance was settled between Dr. Dominiceti and Ramponi was, Ramponi gave a note for the 43 l. and a bill of sale on his goods for the 300 l.? - He did so.</p>
               <p>First of all, as to the note, he is in Newgate at Dr. Dominiceti's suit? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the 300 l. satisfied? - By the bill of sale.</p>
               <p>What did the sale produce? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard? - No.</p>
               <p>How is it that you cannot recollect why you altered the figures in the accounts? - I cannot recollect indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible that you should not recollect; it is a strange thing; it may not happen in the whole course of a man's life? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Counsel. It happens in truth according to the casting up, that the doctor is paid but 16 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the papers, and see if the fours in the original account have not been eights? - It appears to have been an eight.</p>
               <p>How came you to alter the 8 and make it into a 4? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. You appeared to me to be very exact in giving this whole account of the transaction. I understood you as telling the whole that passed word for word; now the particular thing in the whole account you do not recollect? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>I wish to ask you a few facts. Did you make the eight into a four? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130055"/> collect it appears to me that I did; the circumstances I cannot bring to mind; it appears to me to be altered by my own hand.</p>
               <p>Court. If it was altered by him, it was certainly by the direction of the parties.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>I am one of the assignees under the commission.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suggest that the prisoner is guilty of perjury? - His own confession; it is signed by Alderman Plomer, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>ALDERMAN PLOMER sworn.</p>
               <p>(The confession shown him.)</p>
               <p>Is that signature your hand writing? - Yes; it was taken before me the 19th of October, as it is dated; the prisoner swore it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUSSEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the commissioners under that commission; I saw the prisoner sign that deposition; it was a voluntary confession before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Court. The deposition before the commissioners is defaced; it appears to have been struck out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. It was fair when he made it, he signed it before me; it was left in the hands of the solicitor; it was afterwards taken out of the hands of the solicitor, and put into the hands of Mr. Langstaff.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langstaff. It was defaced when it came into my hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. We were informed that there were a number of persons who intended to prove debts which never existed, and that the bankrupt was at a house near Guildhall supplying them with materials to prove their debts; the first man, not being versed in the business, stumbled at the threshold, and we rejected his debt. This man, the defendant, was more hardy, he swore to a debt of 50 l. lent all in money at Mr. Hewitt's house at Edmonton; it was suggested to me that he had never seen the house. I asked him several questions about the situation of the house, whether it was in the high road or in a lane, or whether or no there was a porch before the door, with many other questions. We found he was perfectly ignorant of the house, and he was taken from the room where we sat, before Alderman Plomer, and examined on a charge of perjury; he was ordered for further examination, but when he was carried out, he desired to be had in again, and then he made a voluntary confession,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130056"/> that what he had sworn before the commissioners was false. He said he was employed by one Shears to prove a debt against the bankrupt, to get him through his bankruptcy as he called it, and he was to have half a guinea for it. He was asked, if he knew any false debts besides his own. He said one Arnold was supplied with a note, by the bankrupt, at a publick-house, to prove a false debt; that the note was antedated; that looking like new paper he rubbed it in his hands, and said, that would do to make it appear old. The prisoner said, that he was applied to by one Shears, to prove a debt under Hewitt's commission, in order to get Hewitt through his commission. The bankrupt, he said, did not owe him any money; he said he understood he was to receive half a guinea; that he had not received it.</p>
               <p>Did he say, he did not know Hewitt? - I think he said he never saw him till that morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langstaff. I was present before the alderman when the prisoner was examined, he said that he had no consideration for the note, nor did Hewitt owe him a single shilling.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have had bills from the country before to prove, and I did not understand that I was doing a wrong thing.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
