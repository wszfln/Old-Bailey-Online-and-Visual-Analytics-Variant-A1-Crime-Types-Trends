                  </hi>. I am a zinc manufacturer, carrying on business at Tavistock Crescent, Westbourne Park—on 26th August the prisoner came to my place of business and brought these two letters, and showed them to me. (These purported to come from a Mr. Quick to a Mr. stanskey with reference to a loan of 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had sold them for 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and would reference to a loan of 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had come from Mr. Quick, a solicitor, and had bought some cigars for 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and had sold them for 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and if I could help him to get the money to get the warrants he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said the cigars were lying in the office of the East India Docks—I then asked him who had introduced him to me—he said "A friend of mine, Mr. Stanskey, a solicitor," and asked me if I could advance 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for half an hour—I said I knew a gentleman who would do it if it was legitimate—I knew the name of Stanskey—I did say that I would lend it—said "Go and see Stanskey, and under his advice I will do it if he says the warrants are good"—he went away and came back again, because Mr. Stanskey was not at home—I then said "I am going to the City, and if it is a legitimate transaction I will do it"—he said "It is quite legitimate; you can have your money back in half an hour"—said "Will you take a cheque?"—he said "No, I must have cash"—I said "If you don't keep me long I will take a cab and go to my bank and draw the money"—I went to the bank with him and drew the money out, and then went in the cab with the prisoner to cheapside—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310002"/>
               <p>he got out, and said "I should like to go to my office to see if there are any letters there"—I waited below, and when he came down I said I wanted to go with him to 150, Finsbury Pavement, to Mr. Choppin, the man who had bought the cigars, but he said "No, it will look bad; he will see what profit I have made"—I then said "I will go with you to the solicitor who sent in the dock letters"—that is Mr. Quick—he was not at home, and then he said "We are near Fenchurch Street; we had better go to the docks," and we went to the East India Dock's cigar warehouse in Fenchurch Street—we went up in a lift to the tobacco stores, and saw the cigars in boxes, and a gentleman standing among them—the prisoner said "There is the official who holds the warrants"—I afterwards discovered his name was Macnamara—the prisoner went up to him and spoke to him, and after saying "Good morning," he took some papers out of his pocket, and said "Have you got these warrants in your pocket?" and called out several numbers, and Macnamara said "Yes"—we then went down to an office, where there were 40 or 50 clerks, to pay the money and get the warrants—there was an office where you transact the business, and Macnamara went into the office where the clerks were, and came out with pen and ink, and asked Gurney to endorse the warrants, and he did so—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the warrants—I took them in my hand, and passed my money to Macnamara, who like snapped the money out of my hand—I said "You had better look at it"—as I was going away Gurney said "There are two warrants in those seven worth all the money"—I said "It makes no difference as I shall have the money back in half an hour; let us go to the purchaser now who bought these cigars"—each of these warrants purports to be for one case of Havannah cigars—we then went to Mr. Choppin's, but the clerk said he was not in—the prisoner said "He knew I was coming; has he left an open cheque?"—the clerk said "No, he has gone to lunch, and will be back at 3 o'clock"—I and the prisoner went there again at that time, but he was not there—the clerk showed me this telegram, "I am going to Colonial Exhibition; if Gurney calls ask him to call at 1 o'clock to-morrow, sharp"—I went there next day at 1 o'clock without the prisoner, and saw the clerk downstairs, who said he had sent a telegram to me—in consequence of something he said to me, I went to the docks and had two of these cases opened; one was Japanese cigars, all laid loose in the box, and the others old mouldy cigars of 1879—Stanskey went with me there, and I also had the warrants with me—I then went to Choppin's, he was not in, but the clerk handed me another telegram—I left a note there saying that I was going out of town, and also that all the warrants lay in my solicitor's hands if he liked to complete—I went abroad then, and returned in about a fortnight, but found the transaction had not been completed—I then went to Mr. Stanskey, who introduced me to a Mr. Noemark, and I went with him to 9, Union Court, where I had seen the prisoner go upstairs—Mac<lb/>namara came downstairs, and Noemark said to me "Is that the man?"—I said "Yes, he is the one I gave the money to"—he had had his whiskers cut off, but I recognised him—Noemark then went with me to 62, Leadenhall Street, where I tried to get information about the cigars, but I did not succeed—I asked them to give me the address of Macnamara, but they would not—I went there again next day, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310003"/>
               <p>could not get any information—one of these warrants is for a case of cigars shipped by the Gem, from Yokohama, to be delivered to G. Gurney and it is endorsed "G. Gurney"—the prisoner said they were old Havannah cigars of the best brand—I believed that and also that he had sold them for 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with my money if I had not believed these representations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not enter into the transaction on account of the value of the cigars, but to earn 10. commission—I did not say before the Magistrate that it was not the statement a. to the value that influenced me; I know nothing of the value of cigars—I had no conversation with the prisoner about cigars—I did not know that the cigars were in bond and that the duty had not been paid; I did not know that I had to pay the duty before the warrant were issue—I Can't say that the prisoner called out the numbers from this paper—Mac<lb/>namara did not sign the receipt, he ran out with the money, the prisoner was signing the warrants when I gave it him—I have never advanced money on cigars before—I thought this was a legitimate transaction—Mr. Quick is a solicitor, and as I thought a respectable man—he is not here to-day—the prisoner did not tell me that macnamara was carrying on business in the City Road—I have never seen this invoice; I have seen no paper at all—Mr. Stanskey is a friend of mine—I did not say to the prisoner that I should want 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said that he should give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Quick, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Stanskey, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me out of the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit—I did not ask him whether Choppin was all right—Mr. Stanakey has gone to the Cape—I have been in this country 26 years—I did not look at the contracts between the parties, I saw no paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Stanskey went abroad about three weeks after I arrived from the Continent, and before the commencement of these pro<lb/>ceedings—he is in business in Kimberley—Macnamara has not signed anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 20, Regent Street—I am solicitor to Mr. Lichwitz—on 28th August he lift with me seven warrants—on 2nd September the prisoner called at my office—I had previously recieved instruction from Mr. Lichwitz—the prisoner com<lb/>menced by asking me if I had the warrants—I asked him why he asked that question—after a few words he said because he wished to go with me to the City to get the money—I said "Certainly I have them, and I went to my safe to get them—immediately I produced them he said "I don't think we will go to-day"—I then took off my hat, which I had put on to go with him—he said "Let us say to morrow at I o'clock"—said "Very well"—I did not go next day, I handed the warrants to Mr. Slesinger, who took up the matter for me—he brought back the warrants—on 6th September I received this telegram: "From Gurney, Barnet, to witness, 6th september., '86 Cannot do anything to-day"—I did Not see the prisoner again until he was arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Choppin was summoned before the magistrate—there is a warrant out against him and Madcnamara—they have never been found—when the prisoner came to me he wanted to know if I had the warrants—I have no recollection of his saying he should require to have them produced when Choppin was ready to settle; I can't say he did not.</p>

               <p>Rubenstein handed me the warrants produced—I went with them to 115, Finsbury Pavement, where I found that Choppin had an office—I there saw Choppin and Gurney—Gurney asked Choppin whether he was ready to take up the cigars—Choppin said, "No, not to-day; we missed the last mail, by which I could have shipped them, and I shall have to wait till the next ship goes in about a week's time"—I asked him to give me the name of the ship or the particular line of steamers, but he did not do so—I then left with Gurney and went downstairs—Gurney then said that he had had previous transactions with Choppin, and that he had always paid him cash—I said, "I wish he would do so this time, and pay me the money"—he showed me the contracts between himself and Choppin—I said, "I don't think they are worth anything, they are not worth the paper they are written on; it seems to me that the whole affair is a swindle"—I do not know what remark he made on that—I said, "The cigars are 1879 cigars, consequently they would not be worth the money that has been advanced upon them"—that was practically all that was said on that day—I went to Choppin's again on the following Wednesday; I then found he had gone, and there was a man in possession of the place—I did not see Gurney again till he was arrested—I subsequently went to the dock warehouse and saw the cigars referred to in the warrants—I saw five cases—I took the warrants with me—the cigars were in bad condition—I did not see the Japanese cigars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The last five warrants I always thought referred to Havannah cigars—those I inspected were of bad quality—I know nothing about cigars—there are 100 boxes in a case—there is a separate contract for the Japanese cigars; they are two cases of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a case; putting those and the Havannahs together, Choppin would have to pay 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not show me Macnamara's receipt for that amount, he only showed me the two contracts—I fancy I know Macnamara's handwriting, I will not be certain that this is his—I find on this invoice a description of the cigars sold to Choppin, I think that corresponds with Choppin's bought note—I never went to Macnamara's place of business—I did not hear Gurney say to Choppin, when at his place, "Are you prepared to take up the warrants and pay the 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he asked whether he was pre<lb/>pared to take up the cigars, not mentioning any amount—Choppin said, "I can't do it today, the mail went out two days ago by which I intended to ship, but I shall be prepared to pay the money on Wednesday next"—I believe Gurney said something to this effect, "It is very unfortunate, I should never have had the money to take up the warrants if I had not relied upon your paying"—he did not ray he knew nothing about cigars himself; he said he had had several transactions with cigars.</p>

I am a money lender, of 7, Wells Street, Oxford Street—I produce a bill of sale of 12th May, 1886, executed in the name of Ellen Alexander Silk, the prisoner—when she applied to me for this money two other bills of sale existed not fully satisfied—I said "If you wish me to lend you another 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then I shall want you to give me your jewellery as security"—she said she would not give it—I said "Then I cannot lend you the money"—that was a week or two before the execu<lb/>tion of the bill of sale—she came again in the interval, and, I think, asked me whether I could not do without the jewellery, and lend her 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I don't see any harm in giving me your jewellery, you can wear it the same as usual; it will not prevent you wearing it"—she was anxious that something omitted from a prior bill of sale should be pro<lb/>tected in case a bill of sale was put in by Mr. Dutton—I think on that occasion I offered to lend her 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or less without the jewellery as security, but she wanted 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and could not do with a less sum—she said she would consider it, and send me a telegram whether she would give the jewellery or not, and she would then let me know when she would call, and I was to wire whether I would be ready for her at the time—she telegraphed, and arrived at my office at the appointed time, on 12th May—I said I would not interfere with her wearing the jewellery—the bill of sale was not ready, because I had not got a list of the jewellery—she only had one or two articles of jewellery on her, and she described the rest for me to put into the inventory—among the articles was this bracelet—after the inventory was completed the bill of sale was executed, and I gave her a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she was to pay 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; the first payment being on 12th June—between 12th May and when I took possession she had paid me about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to 30th July I had had perhaps 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the landlord distrained for a quarter's rent in at the end of October or beginning of November, and he appraised the goods on 3rd November, when I bought the greater part of the goods under the appraisement—she continued to live there up to the time the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I secured her attendance there—I have not recovered possession of all the articles mentioned in the bill of sale—I have only got possession of this bracelet and one or two trifling articles—of every payment she made part went towards the principle and part towards the interest in proper proportion—more than 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid—the last payment on the first bill of sale was two or three months prior to the distraint, in August or September last—I should think there would be owing on the first two bills of sale when the third was made over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 57, St. Clement's Road—about three weeks before Chirstmas the prisoner Neal came to lodge there with the child in the room below—I used to hear her beat the child every morning—in the christmas week I used to hear her beat it against the boards very severely—I did not hear any language, the door used to be shut and I used to be doing my work—I heard the child cry—this went on every morning—I have been in their room—I one saw the child with a black eye; I could not say on what day; in was in the Chirstmas week—the prisoner said it had it had fallen out of the chair bedstead.</p>

On Monday morning she done it again, and I slapped her, and the woman in the next room abused me about it, and said she should fetch you over to take the child from me, as I was not a proper person to have the care of her, so you had better come and take her away.

Lilly and Skinner—on 24th December I called on the prisoner at the shop in Goswell Road—I asked him for his cash; he said he had not got it—I said, "Send it down the first thing Tuesday morning," that is follow. ing Christmas—he said it was at his own house at Hornsey, that he had moved the night before and had taken the cash with him, as it would not be safe in the shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 284). A few minutes past 12 on the 28-29th December I was on duty in the Goswell Road—I saw smoke issuing from between the shutters of No. 347—I went down the passage to the back door, which I found open; I entered, and found the prisoner standing at the back of the shop—not knowing his name I said, "Mr. Lilly, do you know your house is on fire?"—he said, "No, where?"—I then proceeded to extinguish the fire—smoke was issuing from beneath the trap-door in the back of the shop; the prisoner was about three feet from it; he had his great-coat and hat on—Bonner came in afterwards, and we extinguished the fire by hand-grenades—I tried to get the flap up, but was unsuccessful; there was no ring, there was the place where the ring had been broken off—I blew my whistle, and Constable 182 came in response; I sent him for the fire-engines—I smelled the smoke, which was very dense—I saw the trap-door opened—underneath it were</p>

               <p>several feet of paper, straw, and wood from broken boxes—this is a sample of the wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, The Red Lion public-house would be 12 to 15 yards from the back door, and in St. John Street Road—the night was slightly hazy—the hand-grenades were in the back of the shop in a wire rack; there were three—the trap-door was prized up with an axe—there was a desk about six feet from where the prisoner was standing; a few loose papers were on the desk—the prisoner was standing—he was not very drunk, he was not sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). On 29th December I went this shop about 12.5, having seen smoke issuing from the shutters and heard the alarm of fire—I saw the prisoner with Snelling—I said, "Where is the fire?"—the smoke was so. dense I could not see it—the prisoner said, "There is no fire, you are making a fuss about nothing, there is nothing"—I saw the trap and said, "Where is the fire?"—he said, "It is in the basement"—I then noticed a slight fire through the cracks of a trap-door—Snelling handed me three hand-grenades, which I broke on the trap—the prisoner was still standing by the side of me—there was a great smell of gas—the smoke became so dense I was obliged to leave—Inspector Burnham came up—after the fire-engines had arrived I examined the premises with the engineer—on the staircase I found the small lead gas-pipes were cut—Burnham questioned the prisoner, who said he had cut them, and when asked if anybody else was there said, "I do not wish to get anybody else into trouble"—there was one light in the shop—the prisoner was afterwards taken to the station—the trap I saw was in the center of the shop—underneath was a deep cellar filled with rubbish, card boxes, and that sort of thing—the prisoner had on a tall hat and a long, thick Ulster coat, being dressed about the same as he is now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was one gas-burner alight in the shop, very low down—I did not hear every word of the conversation with Purnham—the prisoner was asked why he cut the gas-pipes—there are two meters, one for the shop and the other for the upper part of the house where the prisoner had been living—the gas-pipes have been flattened as if to prevent the gas from escaping—I heard the prisoner say to Burnham that he had used some of the <hi rend="italic">governor's</hi> gas upstairs—I saw some of the rubber tube which had been used—I had no reason to doubt the prisoner's story—Burnham and I had to pull the prisoner out of the shop—I am quite sure the prisoner had been drinking, he was certainly dazed, drunk.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). I examined the shop and shutters a little after 12 o'clock on the 29th—I went in at the side door—I found Bonner, the prisoner, and Snelling there—the shop was full of smoke, suffocating—I also smelled a strong smell of gas—I brought the prisoner out, and advised the others to come out; they were nearly suffocated—I heard a dog bark upstairs, and went up—the dog would not allow me to touch it, and I got another man to go up, who brought the dog down—fire-engines arrived—I afterwards looked at the cellar underneath the trap-door at the back part of the shop—I saw a quantity of packing-cases—I produce a piece of the charred wood of the packing-cases—I asked the prisoner several times where the gas-meter was;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310034"/>
               <p>I wished to turn the gas off as I was afraid of an explosion—I went along on my hands and knees and tried to find the meter, but could not find it, and had to return, the smoke was so dense—I afterwards examined the house—Bonner called my attention to the piping being broken and the gas escaping—portions of the pipe were missing—I asked the prisoner if he could account for the fire—he said, "I cannot"—I asked him if he could account for the gas-piping being" cut—he said, "Yes, I cut it"—I asked him why he cut it—he said, "Because I have been using some of the gas supplied by the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> for my private use, and as I was going away I cut it off"—I asked him if any one was there with him—he said another man was there—I asked him who he was—he said he did not wish to get anybody into trouble—I found these three pieces of gas-piping—the gas-piping had been pinched together—the pipe ran from Sir. Lilly's gas-meter—I also found 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the prisoner said belonged to the firm, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. his own money, which was given up to him, and with his sanction the firm's money was given up to the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I know the Red Lion—I made the plan produced—by the side of the shop there is a public passage—there is a back entrance leading to the Red Lion, which was very much used—the public-house closes at 12.30 on a week day—the prisoner was drunk and confused.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The plan is a quarter of an inch to a foot—roughly I should say it would be about 10 feet between the passage and where the fire was—there is no means by which a person outside in the passage can put a lighted substance into the shop—the whole of the cellar was blocked up with packing-cases—you could not get down without pulling out the burning ones—the handle of the trap-door looked as if it had been broken for years—it was prized up—we had to use a fireman's axe—it was easily prized.</p>

I am engineer at the Paddington Fire Brigade Station—about 12.24 on 29th December I received a call, and went to this shop in the Goswell Road—I found the smoke very dense—I could see the fire was somewhere under the floor—I closed the door, got a hand pump and buckets, and the fire was put out—I afterwards examined the cellar, and was shown another trap-door into the cellar—there were no steps leading down the trap-door where the fire was—I did not go through the other trap-door; the firemen did—I did not find the trap<lb/>door difficult to open—the man who was with me lifted it up with his fingers—I saw a piece of flexible tubing in the back room on the first floor hanging to the gasalier—from the outer court to where the fire was it would be about nine feet—there was no fire in that space of nine feet—the fire was immediately under the hatchway—I lilted some of the wood.</p>

               <p>acquaintance five years ago, at Doncaster races, in September—he came to me at the barrier at Finsbury Park Station, asked me to have a drink, and I went with him to Finsbury Park Tavern; we had a chat there and he said "I am going to Doncaster races to-morrow, can you give me a few tickets to come back with, all you can get?"—I said I would try, and we arranged to meet there the next night—we did so, and I gave him 10 or 12 tickets from Doncaster to King's Cross which had been used that day—it is my duty when I collect tickets to cancel them and send them to the audit office at King's Cross—that is the invariable custom all over the line—Alfred Day gave me a sovereign, and said that he could always do with a few when there was a race meeting on our line—I said "I will see what I can do"—between September, 1881, and the following spring I saw him continually there or at other places in the neighbourhood, and tickets sometimes passed for small meetings—in 1882 I gave him tickets several times both for Huntingdon and Doncaster, which are both on our line—30 or 40 of the tickets were for Doncaster—the same thing continued up to the end of 1885—I made David Day's acquaintance a year after his brother's—he came to me at the station and asked me to go and have a drink—we went to the Blackstock public-house, close by Finsbury Park—he said he was going to Doncaster races; it was in September, and he said "Will you give me some tickets? you have got some for <hi rend="italic">Alf"</hi>—I said "I will try"—I met him at the Clarence, Seven Sisters Road, on the Monday night before Doncaster races, which begin on Tuesday—I took with me 10 or 12 spent tickets which I had collected that day—he asked me how many I had got, and I handed them to him, and he gave me a sovereign—I saw him several times after that, year by year, and supplied him with one or two tickets for some racing places on our line—I have seen Alfred and David frequently together up to 1886, sometimes two or three times a week, and then not again for a month—they have been together when I have given tickets to one of them—I have known Henry, or <hi rend="italic">Farmer</hi> Day about four years—he came to me in the Clarence alone one afternoon and asked me to have a drink, and said he had got some friends coming from Leeds, and could I get him some tickets for them to come up with; he did not mention any names—I knew him before by seeing him with his brothers, and knew he was one of the Days, but he had not been present before when I handed anything to the Days—I got him two return half tickets from Doncaster to Finsbury Park—from that time year by year I have continued to give him tickets for the race meetings over our line, about 100 or more each year—on 23rd March, 1886, I saw Alfred Day in a public-house in Finsbury Park; he asked me for some tickets from Lincoln, and I got him five or six return halves from Lincoln to King's Cross, for which he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next saw him at his house by appointment on 19th or 20th August, the Sunday before York races, and he said he was going to York for a week's holiday, and asked me to get him all the tickets I could—I gave him about thirty spent tickets available from York to King's Cross, and on the following Sunday morning he gave me three sovereigns—prior to the Doncaster meeting in September, on Monday the 13th, he came to my house and brought a fowl for my wife and said he was going down to Doncaster and I was to save all I could and meet him on the St. Leger night at the Earl of Essex—I did so, and gave him about thirty tickets from Doncaster to King's Cross—an appointment was then made</p>

               <p>to meet on the next night, and I did so—his brother David was with him then—he said he had got no money for me, and made an appointment to meet me at his house the next Sunday morning—I went and found him alone in his front room, and he gave me two sovereigns—I again saw him about 29th September at the station—he asked me to go and have a drink, and we went to the Earl of Essex—I handed him two tickets available from Cambridge—I gave no more to Alfred after that—in 1886, about a week before the Stockton races, David Day came to me at the barrier at Finsbury Park Station, and drink—I went with him and he said he was going to Stockton, and nipped ones would do—tickers that I collected at Finsbury Park which were legitimately handed up would probably be snipped with a machine before they into York Station—a ticker collector goes along a platform and snips the tickers and then there is no more snipping until you get to Finsbury Park, but they sometimes look at them on the road—he would satisfy the officer at York by producing the ticker from Stockton to York—these are tourists' tickers, they last from 1st May to 31st December—I gave him seven or eight tickers from York to London—about the time of the St. Leger meeting last lest year I saw <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi> Day—I had received a letter from him asking me to meet him on the St. Leger night at Pool's Park Tavern, leading out of the Seven Sisters Road, and I was to give him all the tickers I could, from Doncaster to London—I met him on the 15th and gave him about twenty tickets from Doncaster to London and he said he would forward the money to me next day—he said he was going to Doncaster and would order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and cashed and signed it now appears at the Finsbury park Post-office—it was sent in a letter with just a piece of paper saying "I send you what I promised. H Day"—about 12th October I received a registered letter from him from Edinburgh—I had not seen him in London prior to that—I have destroyed it—it asked me to do something, and after I had received it on 12th October I sent a registered letter to him—in his letter was enclosed a canvas envelope ready addressed to Henry Day, care of miss Thompson, somewhere in Edinburgh—I put in it some return tickers from York to London, and registered it at the Finsbury Park Post-office—there was no transaction with <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi> Day after that—on 16th October I was away at St. Note's on leave—Alfred Day had promised to meet me before he went away and give me some Note's, and I received back therewith this postal order for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. payable to Mr. Stocker—Mauchline was a railway policeman at Finsbury Park, and occasionally tickets—he was there five or six years, and left in September, 1886—I have been with him and Alfred Day together to Finsbury Park Tavern, and also to the public-house opposite—he knew David Day, and with both of them, but I only saw him once in company with <hi rend="italic">farmer</hi> Day—we call these tickers "Briefs" and "York<lb/>shire Hams"—a person using the York tickets which were sent to Edinburgh would have to take a ticket from Edinburgh to York, and then ho would have the other ticket in his pocket—a tourist's ticket could be used all the way back from Edinburgh.</p>

During the season there are a great many race meetings on our line, and I know a lot of the persons who travel year by year to those race meetings—I spoke sometimes to others besides those in the dock—a return ticket beyond 50 miles is avail. able for a month—the tickets I speak about are for a month—the public. houses in which I was with David Day are all close to Finsbury Park Station, being a ticket collector I cannot go far away—money is some<lb/>times left with the landlords by passengers fur the ticket collector to have a drink if we cannot get away—I have a bet on races occasionally, and I have <hi rend="italic">tips</hi> now and then by persons travelling on the line, and then I have a drink with them—I don't mean that all the persons travelling on the line are defrauding the Company of tickets—these are the only persons to whom I sold tickets; I am sure of that—race meetings occur on our line sometimes twice a week, and sometimes there is a month between—Scarborough and York are in the same week—I have drunk with David Day in various public-houses in the neighbourhood of the station—seven or eight times in a year.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. It is true that I have been systemati<lb/>cally stealing these tickets from my employers—these return halves of tourist tickets enable a passenger to come from some distant place to London—he would have to pay the full single fare to the place before he could use them—cheap excursion tickets are only issued to Doncaster and Huntingdon; they are the same price as the full single fare—tourists' tickets are not always clipped when they are given up at Doncaster; for instance, they never cancel the tickets before leaving, nor on the way—I was not taken in custody; Detective Rogers told me I was to go with a clerk from Mr. Parish's office to King's Cross, and I was detained there six hours as a prisoner—I was told some people were in custody, and what their names were, but I did not make a statement for some time—I was told that I was to stop till Mr. Parish came home—I then made a statement, and I was released, and taken as a witness—I also stole excursion tickets from Doncaster in the race weeks; they had not been clipped—I can't say whether there is any person here who can show me one of the tickets which I stole—a man could not use 20 tickets himself on a return journey—my wife had just been confined when Alfred Day gave me the fowl—it was on a Monday; he brought it himself—I knew he was employed at the poultry market—that was the only occasion.</p>

I live at 45, Bacchus Walk, Hoxton; I have got no work to do—in 1883 I was a bookmaker's clerk—I have known all the Days for six years or more, and knew they attended races, and I saw them at pretty well all the north racing meetings—I was at Musselburgh Races in 1883, but I did not lodge with the Days—I have seen the Days at Rutherford's Tavern, Leith Walk, in 1882 and 1883, and have asked them if they had got any <hi rend="italic">briefs</hi> or tickets for London, and <hi rend="italic">Farmer</hi> Day said they had not got any then, but they would have some—I asked how much, and they said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was first-class—I said "Oh, that is too much!"—he said "That is the price," and that he could not take less, as they belonged to his brother—I had bought <hi rend="italic">briefs</hi> of Henry and David before, from Edinburgh to London, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three—I gave David the sovereign; that was in 1882—in 1883, a day or two before the Musselburgh races, I saw <hi rend="italic">Farmer</hi> Day, and asked him if he had any <hi rend="italic">briefs</hi>—he said "Yes"—three were purchased when I was not there, and I received one of them from a man named Clare, and we went on the Saturday to Edinburgh Station to leave for London by the 10 o'clock express train; when we had got into the carriage we heard "All tickets ready!" called out—Clare was with me, and we each had our own tickets—when they were examined I was asked to walk out, and I was stopped, and the train went on without me—they then asked me if I had the money to pay—I had, and I paid, and came up by the next train—Clare had to pay also, and came with me—my name was asked for, and I gave the name of Harrison, 45, Bacchus Walk, Hoxton—a week or two after that I saw Henry Day, and asked him for my money, as I had paid for a ticket which was no good—he said "All right, I have not got it now, I will give it you another time when I get it"—I said "You might have got me <hi rend="italic">run in</hi>; you gave me a ticket that had been used before"—he said "It was all right, it had not been used before"—I said "No, it was all wrong, yon could see where it had been clipped and made level"—he</p>

In consequence of instructions I received early in September last, I commenced to watch Alfred and David Day, and I also had instructions with reference to the ticket collector Manley, and watched his movements, and I con<lb/>tinued to watch those three persons till the end of October—from time to time I reported to my superior officer, and I put down in writing in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) day by day what I noticed as regards them—the first date I speak to is September 10th, 1886—I only saw David on that day at King's Cross—I followed him by train to Finsbury Park, but I did not see him take any ticket to there, or hand one up as he passed through the barrier—he went to the Railway Hotel outside the station, and I saw the ticket collector Manley follow him—they had some drink and conversation, and then parted—on 16th September I saw Alfred and David Day about 11.15 p.m. at the Station Hotel, Finsbury Park—they appeared to be looking for some one—Manley joined them—I had watched him before—the two Days went to the Earl of Essex, Stroud Green Road, and in a few minutes I saw Manley looking in at the door, but he did not go in—the two Days then left, and walked to the corner of Hanley and Regina Roads, and as they parted in the road David said to Alfred "Shall I take tickets in the morning?"—Alfred answered "I don't think I shall go down in the morning now"—Manley had walked towards the station—Doncaster races were then on—on 23rd September I was waiting outside Finsbury Park Station about 7 a.m., and saw Alfred Day arrive at the station from Stroud Green Road—he went up on to No. 2 platform and into a room marked "Private"—that is where the ticket collectors sit, so far as I know—he stopped there about two minutes, and then came out and got into a Moorgate Street train—on September 29th I saw Alfred Day arrive at Finsbury Park</p>

On the night of 12th January, about 11.30, the prisoner came to the station in company with Mr. Izons—I told her I should take her into custody for unlawfully exposing her child and causing danger to it—she said "I did it, Mr. Izon told me to do it"—when the charge was read over it stated that the child was 16 days old; she said "It was 16"—I went to this urinal about 5.30 in the morning; it has a stone floor, and is about three feet long and a foot and a half wide; it was in a most filthy state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the nursery at St. Pancras Workhouse—this child was received by me on 12th December, and I had it until it died—on the 13th I called the doctor's attention to it; its eyes and nose were running, and it was very stuffy at the chest, breathing hard—those symptoms continued—when I first examined it it had two marks round the neck, as if from dribbling—it appeared to be well nourished.</p>

I said. I would stop as a servant, and did not want money, if he would keep me and the baby. He said he did not want me. That was in the middle of the week. On the Friday I said to Mr. Izons, 'Don't chuck me down, for I have got no home if I don't atop here.' He told me to go and do this with the baby and I should be all right; he asked me to do it on the Friday. I stopped two days longer; he was cross and stopped in the shop and did not want to come up to the room for dinner or to sleep. I told Mrs. Izons I would not stop longer;</p>

I am an upholsterer, of 301, Brick Lane—on 21st Sept. the prisoner called on me and asked me whether I wished to be insured—I said "Yes, what insurance company?"—he said "I am an agent for the Patriotic Fire Insurance Company of Ireland; you will have to give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a deposit"—I said "Very well," and I did so—he wrote out and gave me this receipt—on 29th October he called on me and said "The Patriotic Fire Insurance Company has accepted you, and if you pay a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you are insured, and will receive a policy a month afterwards"—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he wrote this receipt on the back of the former one which he had given me.

I am a clerk in the office of the Patriotic Insurance Company of Ireland, 49, Cornhill—the prisoner was for a short time one of our agents from 8th September, 1886—his agency was cancelled on 7th December—he submitted to the office a proposal received on 27th September for insurance on behalf of Morris Klein—that was declined on 2nd October, 1886, by a letter of which this is a copy from our office to the prisoner—in that I mention five policies which are declined, including klein's, and four which are accepted—on 11th October I wrote again to the prisoner a letter of which this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">This referred to certain proposal, saying, some should be surveyed, and that others were declined.</hi>) On 11th October I received a letter from the prisoner referring to my previous letter—on 6th December, the day before we discharged the prisoner, Klein came to our office and made some inquiries—the prisoner had never told me he had received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Klein in certain cases agents have a right to receive deposits, but the prisoner would have no right to do so in Klein's case; he had been told not to do so in hazardous cases such as Klein's was—if a proposal was declined his duty was to return the deposit at once; he would have no right to receive any further money after the proposal had been declined—we pay our agents 15 per cent. on the premium of accepted cases—we send policies through the agent unless he desires one sent direct to the proposes; so that if Klein had been accepted his policy would have been forwarded through the prisoner—in this case the agent would have given us notice to make out the policy, and we should have forwarded it to him—Poplar's proposal received on October 16th from the prisoner—it was declined verbally on the same date by the manager, Thomas Henry Owens—the prisoner did not tell me that he had received a deposit of two guineas from Poplar, or</p>

               <p>came and had lunch with Mr. Owens things would be all right—after I had seen Owens we met at the Bell—I did not invite you to stand drink on the strength of the proposals—I once borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of you, that was all; I have not returned it—I do not owe you between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—I asked you to return me an I O U for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had it back, I never had the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I sent to ask you to lend me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and put an I O U in my pocket—I did not ask you to put it away; I asked for it back, and it was destroyed—I do not owe you the money for it—it was a private matter—I asked you to lend it to me—I did not have a bottle of whisky on that occasion—on Saturday evening I got home and found you had left a bottle of whisky for me—I asked you to buy me some more, and you gave me some more—I did what I could for you in the office; we were friendly—I did not tell you to take money—I did not more frequently come to your office and tell you of business than write—I often came, but only on the Company's business two or three times—I did not call on you about the date of the rejection of Kelly's proposal—on 14th September you were instructed not to take deposits on hazardous risks—I believe one insurer called at the office, and showed his receipt after the 14th; none before—Mr. Baines and Mr. Woodhouse called after the 14th—I received Woodhouse's proposal on October 2nd—I knew he had a receipt—these are the printed terms of your agency and your appointment—the terms are 15 per cent. on the first year and 15 per cent, on each subsequent renewal—you were paid solely by commission—an account was to be rendered to you each quarter if you went on straight<lb/>forwardly, and would include all proposals accepted during the quarter—I believe an account was rendered to you on 5th November for the Michaelmas quarter—if they had been accepted we should possibly have sent you the account in December—an account received and accepted after September 25th would be sent in in the December account, I suppose—Klein's money you received on 29th October, Poplar's on November 11th, and Rowlands' on December 24th, I believe—you were our agent on each of those dates, but you had no right to receive the money—E. Rowlands was trading as Rowlands Brothers—her proposal was never surveyed—I believe the manager had a letter from you asking us to produce the surveyor here—we received a telegram some time after Poplar's proposal asking our surveyor to meet you at Shoreditch Church, not stating what for—he started to meet you—he is Mr. Belcher, of Adelaide Chambers, London Bridge—I do not know the number—I did not say at the police-court that I did not know the number; you asked Owens then—I still say Poplar's proposal was received and declined on the same day—I don't know that Owens has stated that if he did not accept Poplar's building he would accept the contents—we had a proposal on Poplar's before you came in, and then you sent in one on Poplar's stock—we were insured on the building; we are not now—our agent did not cover the building by deposit—Mrs. Flowers declined to pay the rate—we had accepted the proposal and held the building covered—we very rarely accept a proposal and survey a building on the same day; sometimes we do—you may have taken the surveyor anywhere—there are three telegrams of yours here—it is not because the fourth one, asking the surveyor to meet you at Shoreditch Church, would prove that Poplar's proposal was not declined on the 16th that I do not produce it—it may have been handed to the surveyor—Poplar said at the police-court that the surveyor did call—I did</p>

               <p>not hear his evidence here—Poplar's proposal was declined verbally on the 16th, and never reconsidered—it is not usual to decline verbally—I cannot show anything in writing that we declined it to you—at the time it was declined I entered in red ink in this book "16, 10, 86, declined verbally"—I swear that was entered on the 16th—I did not say I could not swear it was made within seven days—you questioned me about it at the police-court—across Poplar's proposal is written "Declined verbally, 16th October"—I could not swear when that was written within a few days—I did not swear at the police-court that was written on the 16th—I could not swear when it was written; it would be somewhere about the 16th, in all probability within seven days, but I cannot swear it was—I would swear it was within 14 days—you have in some cases suggested at what rate a case should be taken—we look to our surveyor for guidance—I do not find that you got the deposit notes back in the other cases declined in the letter of the 2nd October—I can't say that you did in Peek's case—I went with you to Peek's, and he said so—I don't know that Cole's and Lovell's covering notes are not in their hands—neither they nor Bailey have complained—the only person who has been to com<lb/>plain is Klein—I don't know that you have taken a penny on behalf of the Patriotic Company since 8th December; I cannot say—I did not tell you Mr. Owens would forget in a few hours what had happened—I said that the business all went through my hands—nothing in declining or accepting risks was done without my knowing it—I did not know you were agent for other offices at the time you began as agent for us—I believe you became agent for others—I advised you myself to submit proposals rejected by us, to other offices—I was your referee—I inferred that you were a gentleman then, not a convicted felon—I am certain this "declined" across the proposal is in Gray's writing—I was on terms of intimacy with him; he was always with you—I have come to you without asking you for money—I said you had better pay the Michaelmas account to me instead of to the office—I did not want to use it for my own private purpose—we have not yet had it at the office, and I don't think we shall now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Immediately a proposal was declined it was my duty to enter that in this book—I entered it in pencil when it was declined to save time, because I was entering others, but afterwards I went carefully through, and entered in red ink, and rubbed out the pencil—I hate no power to reconsider proposals, being only a clerk—Mr. Owens had nothing to do with anything I have had to do or say to the prisoner—I did not lead him to suppose that any of the three proposals charged had been reconsidered after they had been declined—other persons who made proposals were at the police-court, and I believe some are here to-day—I heard from them at the police-court that they were treated by the prisoner in a similar manner to the three prosecutors, because the prisoner called them, and they were cross-examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am London manager of this Patriotic Com<lb/>pany—on 27th September I believe Klein's proposal was made to us and declined by letter on 2nd October—occasionally I reconsider proposals, but I rarely reverse my decision, except in reduction of rates—I believe I did not reconsider Klein's proposal after we declined it—I have no recollection of the prisoner suggesting that it should be reconsidered—we issued no policy, and the prisoner was not entitled to receive any money</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310067"/>
               <p>from Klein after that time—it was contrary to his instructions to take in advance any deposit of money and give a receipt for it except on certain. non-hazardous risks—this was a hazardous risk—Klein came to our office and communicated to us on 6th December, and that was the first I had heard of the prisoner having taken these sums—next day we cancelled his agency—in Poplar's case the proposal was declined verbally on 16th December, by myself, at the office—I did not, to my recollection, recon<lb/>sider that—in the case of Rowlands, the proposal was made on 29th October, declined on 4th November, by letter, and was not reconsidered, that I can speak positively to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You were with me for an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half on a Saturday, on the subject of the proposals contained in the letter of 2nd October—I probably rang for the proposals to be brought in, and you may say I reconsidered them—I believe I did re<lb/>survey Peek's under the circumstances that I met you by appointment one day to survey another risk, and then you took me—you telegraphed me to meet you at Shoreditch Church, and we went and surveyed Tate's—on 6th October I think that was—I have no recollection of recon<lb/>sidering Bailey Brothers, I may have had the proposal brought in—I do not know you got the covering note away in that case—I can't say if we have ever been applied to by Bailey and Coles—probably I refused to reconsider Coles and Lovell's—Nichol's rate was altered from 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Lee's appears here at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are ones that were rejected—Miller is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Watts, quoted at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I may have done so at your suggestion if it would help your agency—I say Klein's proposal was declined, and always declined; I am very clear that I never accepted it—when I refuse a risk I rarely accept it afterwards—I don't think any of the other people have applied to the office—that does not show that you obeyed my instructions—I have been applied to about several of your receipts—the surveyor is not here—he is not my surveyor, but a profes<lb/>sional man; I gave you his address, and you could have summoned him—I don't know his number in Adelaide Place, my clerk always addresses letters, but there are only five houses in Adelaide Place, and there would be no difficulty in finding him—I told him he was wanted as a witness—I believe the telegram was lost or destroyed; it merely made an appoint<lb/>ment—in answer to a telegram, the surveyor met you at Shoreditch Church—I had one proposal in Poplar's name, and one through another agent in the name of flowers—I took the proposal on the bricks and issued a policy on them, which was paid for a short period, then there was a dispute about the rate with Mrs. Flowers—if a fire had occurred on Klein's premises it is a legal question whether we should have been liable—I never accepted Poplar's; as far as I remember his premises were never specially surveyed by my surveyor—I do not produce him, you can—I believe we did not survey Mrs. Rowlands'; it is a class of risk we decline without survey—sometimes we receive, and decline, and survey a risk on the same day; very rarely—Poplar's risk was received and declined on 16th October, because I had a report of Mrs. Flowers's building before me—I declined Mrs. Flowers's building and Poplar's contents—I believe Poplar stated that some one called with you on the 20th and looked over his place—he may have suggested a structural alteration—I have com<lb/>municated with the surveyor, and he said he had no recollection of it—I gave you the surveyor's address at the police-court—I did not know that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310068"/>
               <p>Klein frequently saw you—matters in connection with your agency only took place on one or two occasions—I don't know if you complained in October about the manner in which your proposals were accepted—I altered the rate in each accepted case—you took me to Peek's under false pretences—I told you before I went the risk would not be accepted—I went for your satisfaction—I cannot say if I objected generally to your risks before 26th October—probably that is the first time I wrote objecting to your risks—the Patriotic was comparatively unknown in London 12 months ago—several persons called at the office to inquire about it, and produced their receipts—we were probably not in ignorance that you were issuing these receipts, although it was contrary to your instructions—these books contain 20 receipts each—you obtained a second book by saying you wished to leave one at your office and carry the other one with you—I did not say that if you had taken a deposit in Tate's case I would have clinched them—I did not say a deposit clinched a case—I did not say so when we had refreshment—very likely I said a survey put us to expense—it is not part of my commission—I did not tell you not to send me more surveys than you could help—I may have said do not send proposals that you do not think will be accepted, as it put the Company to the expense of survey fees—"Interim receipt" means pending the ultimate decision, and it is a legal point whether it would protect if a tire occurred—I certainly did not tell you to take a deposit for the purpose of saving a survey—a person who pays a deposit is probably more likely to be accepted than a person who only gives a proposal—it was open to you when Klein's risk was declined to propose it to another office—I have nothing to do with your dealings with other people—I do not know whether it has been proposed to another office—your duty was to return to Mr. Klein on 3rd October the guinea he had paid—I have a fairly good memory—I am very clear as to Klein—I do not impute fraud; I am only a witness;—I have found no money for this prosecution directly or indirectly—if these three proposals had been accepted I should have had to render you an account on them from December—an account was rendered and not paid, and we rendered no December account, because you had not paid the Michaelmas—I cannot say if you ever received a penny on behalf of the Patriotic since your appointment, ceased—I had written asking you to return all the deposits you had accepted—I have no recollection of any particular letter—it is a legal question whether you are entitled to 15 per cent. on all who do pay—I hold that when an agency is cancelled the late agent is not entitled to commission on old policies—we only render accounts for policies issued—we were under the impression in December that you had returned all deposits—we had not found you out then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I gave the prisoner Belcher's address at the police-court on Tuesday week or fortnight—Belcher had no recollection of having surveyed Poplar's—an interim receipt is a receipt from the time of pay<lb/>ment of deposit till the decision, of the office is known—it is no cover after the proposal has been declined, and the deposit should then be immediately returned—the prisoner has received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as deposits and balance in these cases—I have never received any part of that—I went with the prisoner to Peek's to oblige him; I knew I should not do it—I have never been surveyor to the "Mutual"—if he represented to Peek that I was it would be an untruth—what the prisoner says in his letter</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—on 13th January I was at Liverpool Street Station with my three children, two of whom were going by the 3.20 train—my brother-in-law was with us on the departure platform just outside the barrier—he opened this bag which hung on my left arm, took out my purse and put two sovereigns into it, then put the purse back into the bag, and I clasped it, having first seen the purse in it—we were then facing the barrier, my brother-in-law and children being a little to my left, and in front of me; the two prisoners were between us and the barrier—we advanced to the barrier, and as my brother-in-law spoke to the ticket collector I was pushed back by Webb, and then Franklin at my left pushed me at the side forward again—they were in front of me, and passed to my right—my bag was in front of me at my left side—they then ran back quickly to the booking office, from where you can get into the street—we passed on to the platform, and not half a minute afterwards I noticed my bag hanging open on my arm—my purse could not have dropped out, there was nothing else but it in the bag—I noticed no other person on the platform but my brother-in-law and the children and the two ticket inspectors at the barrier—I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310070"/>
               <p>to the police-office on the arrival platform and made a communica<lb/>tion to Inspector Robinson—I was with him possibly ten minutes—when I came out on to the arrival platform I recognised the two prisoners; I watched them go the whole length of the platform and down again, and then up and down again, very quickly, as if about to run from the station, and then slowly up again, pushing in and out of the passengers—a lady was standing to my right; one of the prisoners pushed between me and her, and opened her hand-bag hanging on her arm—I put my hand over the top and cautioned her; the prisoner could not hear me—then I went back to the police-office—Robinson came with me on to the platform, and I pointed the prisoners out to him—the prisoner did not know I had cautioned the lady; he had passed away from her before I put my hand on her bag—I pointed out the prisoners, who were together, to Robinson—they were taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I had been waiting at the station perhaps five minutes before my brother-in-law came on the departure platform—the train was going to Norwich; other passengers were going by it, 12 or more had passed me—there is only the one entrance that I know of to the platform—a ticket-collector stands on each side of the barrier—I might have been 20 yards from the barrier when my brother-in-law put the two sovereigns in my purse—the children were standing round me—I saw no one standing about or waiting to go through the barrier, no one else was there—I was late for the train—the prisoners were strangers to me—they were standing between me and the barrier; when I advanced to the barrier they were between me and the ticket<lb/>collectors with their faces towards me—I should say the collectors would have me and them under their observation—I was hustled at the barrier—I am clear those are the two men; I absolutely swear to one of them, and I swear to both of them being on the arrival platform; beyond all doubt the prisoners are the two men who were at the barrier—I said before the Magistrate, "I would not like to swear; to the best of my belief those are the two men;" and on the second occasion I said, "I could not swear Franklin was at the barrier; I swear Webb was there, and to the best of my knowledge Franklin was there"—I say as I said then, that to the very best of my knowledge those are the two men that were there, and that I have no doubt—my impression is, those two men were both at the barrier—I got through the barrier before I discovered my purse was gone—I recognised the two prisoners on the arrival platform at once—I watched them for five or six minutes—they were walking together—once they passed close to me, touched me when they opened the lady's bag—they faced me; I was looking down, I thought the men would recognise me—they opened the bag as they passed—I instantly put my hand on the bag to prevent them taking anything—I was not a second with Robinson the second time—I came back with him and Power to the prisoners about two minutes after, and found them where I had left them—there were a number of passengers arriving at the station—I heard the prisoners charged on suspicion of having stolen my purse—the superintendent did not say, "But as she is not sure of that, you are again charged with opening another lady's satchel"—I have never had a shadow of doubt as to the prisoners—I positively swear to Webb as being at the barrier, and I have no manner of doubt</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoners were nearer to the barrier than to me—when they passed between me and the barrier their faces were towards me—I never said I could not swear to them—Webb said at the police-court, "She said last night she could not swear"—I made no answer, and I assume my saying nothing gave assent to it, and that is how it appears on the deposition—I did not hear the word "swear" used at the police-station the night before—I have not the least doubt as to Franklin—I gave Robinson a slight description of the two men; the prisoners answered that description—when I put my hand on the lady's bag the two prisoners were both behind me, my back was to them—I could not say I prevented them from robbing her; the prisoners had passed away from her then—I said at the station I had no doubt whatever as to the identity of the prisoners; to the best of my knowledge they are the men—I think Robinson took down the description I gave him.</p>

My office is on the arrival platform of the Liverpool Street Station—at 3.13 Mrs. Makins came in and made a communication to me, occupying 5 to 7 minutes—she left and returned in 5 or 6 minutes as near as I can guess, and made another communication—I went out with Power (neither of us was in uniform), and Mrs. Makins pointed out the prisoners to us; standing together talking—I put my right arm into Franklin's left, and said "I want you to come to my office with me"—he made no reply, but turned with me, and we walked to my office—I put a very slight pressure on his arm, sufficient for him to understand what I wanted him to do—we had gone about 40 yards, and were about 10 from my office, when he said "Where is it?" alluding to my office—I said "Just here," or "here it is"—nothing else was said—we went in—Mrs. Makins came in after me, and Webb was brought in—I said to both of them "I want you to answer me some few questions; please answer me truthfully"—to Franklin I said "What is your name?"—he said "Franklin"—I asked his address—he said "8, Borough Place, waterloo Road"—my chief clerk took it down as I asked the questions—he said in answer to my questions "I am a painter; I am married; I went into the railway station to meet a man named Mr. Nicholls, who was coming by train from Norwich"—I asked Nicholls's address—he said "I don't know it"—I said "What is he by trade?"—he said "A painter"—I said "What is your place of business, and for whom do you work?"—he said "I decline to give you my place of business, or any further information"—Webb being cautioned, I asked his name—he said "Henry Webb, of 80, Crampton Street, Newington Butto"—he said he lodged with a man named Walker, a traveller and dealer in dogs, and his business was clerk to a betting man; that he came into the station at the departure entrance at 20 minutes to 3 o'clock—he declined to give me the person for whom he was clerk, or any further information—I told them Mrs. Makins charged them with stealing her purse, and attempting to steal from another lady's bag on the arrival platform—Franklin said he knew nothing at all about it, and that he did not do it, and that he was not on the departure platform at all—the departure platform had been mentioned—I think Webb made no reply—I sent for a policeman, and gave them in custody—I afterwards followed them to</p>

I have had food generally to eat, not always I have been out all day sometimes, some<lb/>times late at night. I have been living a very unhappy life, and my husband has frequently assaulted me.

Mrs. Neale came to me and told me that the child had died that morning—I gave a certificate of death—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found the body extremely emaciated, with hardly any superficial fat—on the surface of the body were marks of excoriation on the upper parts of the thigh—the skin was very flabby and wrinkled—the muscular tissues were very flabby—I weighed the child; it weighed 6 3/4 lbs.—the normal weight of such a child would be about 12 lb. at that age—I attribute the excoriation to neglect and want of cleanliness—the air passages were generally inflamed—in the stomach there was about a tablespoonful of milk, and the intestines were slightly coated with digested milk—they were shiny and glazed externally—there was no fat in the intestines—the weight of the child, the character of the skin and the intestines,</p>

               <p>were attributable to inanition, resulting from want of nourishment—the cause of death was the exhaustion primarily which followed on the want of nourishment—it had also inflammation of the air passages, but not enough to account for the death—the other organs were healthy—Mr. Warne was with me when the post-mortem examination was made.</p>

I have been Mr. Symond's clerk some years—in October, 1885, we sold Mr. Coley a parcel of wine, some which we had received direct from Moet and Chandon—the labels had their private mark on the back, "6. v. 6"—about December 3rd I went to Angel Court; no name was up, and there were no signs of business being carried on—the place appeared to be closed and empty.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> While the police proceedings were pending I went to the prisoner's hat shop to look over the cellars, and he assisted me frankly and without hesitation in showing me over his place—it is a large shop—you have to go up a little passage to the cellar, which is under the pavement of the street—there were over 100 oases of wine there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. Southard, a wine broker, who holds periodical sales of wine—before 26th August a man named Moncier called and inquired when the next sale would be, and gave me the particulars of some wine which he desired us to sell—I wrote it down, "139 bottles Moet and Co.'s champagne mosseux, 20 cases, one dozen each, O. Moncier and Co. old landed dry champagne, more or less"—I asked him whether the Moet was old landed—he said that it was, and I wrote "Old landed" on it—he said that the Moet was at 83, Regent Street, and the other at his address 3, Angel Court, and that his own wine was in cases, but the Moet was loose—it is not usual to have a large quantity loose; it is generally sold in cases—I asked for samples, which he supplied next day—the Moet was sold to Mr. Coley at a public sale on the 26th, and I gave him a delivery order—he had it, and I paid Moncier a cheque for it, which was paid to our bankers, and came back through the London and Westminster Bank, St. James's Square branch.</p>

               <p>empty, and in one of the cellars I found several empty wooden cases and straw wrappers for champagne bottles, the other cellar was completely empty—the stones in the brickwork of the floor of one cellar appeared to have been removed as if something had been placed there, and new shutters had been fixed to both windows—I entered the cellar through the cellar flap with a key which I found on Moncier—that is the only entrance to it—there was no name up or any appearance of any business of any kind—I after that went to 83, Regent Street, the prisoner's premises, and went down into the cellar—I found there 100 dozen of champagne in cases, and the prisoner said "That wine belongs to me, I bought it of my half-brother, I will show you the cheque I gave for it," which he did—he did not say when he had seen his brother last—I do not know what brand the wine was, but two bottles were submitted to a gentleman now in Court—I found this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on Moncier with the impression of the Clicquot cork stamp upon it—the prisoner was afterwards summoned on a charge of conspiracy with Moncier—on 10th December Moncier was brought up at Marlborough Street, and the prisoner tendered himself as bail for him—I did not then know where Henson was, I have a warrant for his arrest, but I have not been able to execute it—I did not know of his being at Windsor till some time after<lb/>words—the case was remanded till the 17th, and the prisoner appeared to the summons—it was again remanded to the 24th, and on that day I wrested the prisoner—I read the warrant to him, which charged him with fraud in connection with the Clicquot case—he said "I must see my solicitor about it"—he was brought up and required to find bail; and at the next hearing Moncier did not appear; he has absconded—they were both there on the 24th, and were bailed—I don't know anything after that, because I was in Birmingham.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was on the printed form of Leon Fossett and Co., signed by the prisoner, and stated: "Dear Sir,—Kindly call to see me without fail, for I have to ask you to make me something in a very short delay."</hi>) In consequence of that I went to Regent Street and saw the prisoner—he said his brother was agent for Clicquot's, in France, and wanted some Clicquot labels done, and he showed me one of Clicquot's labels—I don't think he said anything about a plate, but it could not be done without a plate—I told him I could do it as cheap as any one—he said he wanted it done by the Thursday before Good Friday, as he wanted to take the labels to France, or Paris, with him, I don't know which—I took the original label away with me, and went and saw Mr. Baxter, a friend of mine, an engraver, who had worked for Parkins and Gotto, and who is now a member of the firm of Langstrong and Co., of 40, Gerrard Street—I showed the label to him, and employed him to make a plate for me—he executed it and gave it to me—the prisoner had told me to get 50,000 labels printed—when I had got the plate I went to the firm of Willis, and bought paper to match the label, and then I took it with the plate to Martin, Hood, and Co., of Newport Street, St. Martin's Lane, and ordered them to print 50,000 labels from it and deliver them at 83, Regent Street—after they had been delivered, and while the prisoner was away in Paris, I called at his shop, and saw Moncier sitting at a desk, but I merely said "Good day" to him—before he went to Paris he had paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of this—when he came back I went and saw him at his shop, and he said there was a mistake made in the plate; that the letter "A" before the name of the firm had been left out—as he had just got home from Paris he was very tired, and he asked me to call again in a day or so—I did so, and he then gave me the plate back, and asked me to get it altered, and gave me an original label, and asked me to get him 10,000 labels printed—I took the plate to my friend, and got him to alter it, and then went and got the paper, and then took it to the printers again, and got them to print 10,000 labels, and asked them to send them to his shop as the last were—I saw the prisoner again about a week after that—altogether I was paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner has a banking account at the St. James's Branch of the London and West<lb/>minster Bank, at the corner of St. James's Square—he gave me a cheque for the balance, and I cashed it there—I paid Baxter and the printer</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper at 38, Chapel Street, Clerkenwell—in June last I entered into partnership with Mrs. Michaels, the prisoner's wife, under this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the partnership lasted till 12th Novem<lb/>ber—the prisoner was appointed manager from the start, and as manager he would buy goods for the shop from persons like Roberts and Glave—before he went out he would ask me for the money, and I would advance it to him—the receipts he would bring back with him, and if there was any money to return he gave it to me, and I would enter it in my book—if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310087"/>
               <p>the account was above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would not pay it at all, but would have it sent in by the firm—having filed these receipts with me it would be his duty to enter the amounts of the receipts in his book, and for the sums mentioned in these receipts he would get credit—he gave me all these six receipts—all he brought back I kept—at the dissolution of partner<lb/>ship they were still in my possession—we did not go through the books when we dissolved—nothing was said about the books, but he stipulated that all these receipts should be burnt, and the books destroyed—I said I could not do that, as perhaps some one might come on me again, and I should wish to refer to them—the dissolution was in writing; we mutually dissolved—it was signed by Mrs. Michaels and myself on 22nd November—we dissolved on the 12th, but I called at the solictor's office to get it put into writing, and we signed it that day—after the dissolution I went into the books, and put them into an accountant's and then discovered on these receipts what I allege are forgeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I once lived in Liverpool Road, and Mrs. Michaels lived within 200 or 300 yards—she had a draper's business—I had a confectioner's shop in the Liverpool Road, and I had a coffee stall in the street outside the Angel, which I went out to at 5 a.m., and afterwards I went and attended to my shop—my wife helps me in business—I bought the lease of 38, Chapel Street on 16th April, and got possession then, and opened it as an eel-pie and stewed-eel shop; that only lasted a week—we opened the drapery shop about 18th June, and this agree<lb/>ment was signed about two days after, or the day before it was stamped,—the date on the stamp is 22.6—I knew nothing about buying draper's goods—my wife and I lived on the premises—Miss Shand was employed as assistant, and a young man Turle, whom I have now—I did not originally offer to take Mr. Michaels as partner—he had been to me a dozen times when I had the other shop—his wife's name was not used, because a previous landlord would not let him off the liability of a house, and because if his name appeared the landlord might put an execution in—I never heard anything about that—the Michaels put 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of goods into the business, but no money—I did not notice that the partnership deed says the partner shall give all his time—Mrs. Michaels carried on the business in the Liverpool Road in her own name at the time—there is a provision about her banking account, and that the partners shall pay by cheque anything above 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we never opened a banking account—if we had gone on we should have done so—the prisoner put down 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week under the word "partner"—he did not do it every week—Mrs. Michaels took 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I have paid her myself, but mostly the prisoner paid her—I think we did not draw the first week, but the second week I believe we did—sometimes she sent for her money at the beginning of the week—she used to borrow money from me—I have paid her 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have several times given her a sovereign when she has sent over for it, and at the end of the week when the prisoner made up the books I was given credit for that—here is an entry of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that she had; I might have entered that "Michaels" and not "Mrs. Michaels"; it was not for goods, it was only as a memorandum for myself—I find that most of the payments of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are in Mr. Michaels' and not Mrs. Michaels' name—I did not always</p>

               <p>put down the payments I gave her like that—I never took a receipt from her, nor from the prisoner—I never paid her by cheque—I have paid her 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Sunday night in her own house for one week in respect of partnership money, in her husband's presence but no other witness—Michaels did not object to my going to the Angel with the coffee-stall, he advised me to sell the goodwill of it and put the money in the business—I sold it in July, two months I think, after the business commenced—I objected three or four times to Mrs. Michaels being at the Liverpool Road shop—I asked her to come to 38, Chapel Street—she said she would not unless she was paid extra for it, as otherwise there would not be enough to keep her family—we bought job lots of drapery—I believe Michaels had been buying job lots for many years, and was acquainted with it—he never asked me to have a petty cash book for his expenses of omnibuses and cabs ingoing about to buy goods—I did not suggest that the actual sum should be put on the face of the invoices—all these invoices have had at their back carbonised paper, which shows what was originally written on them and where they have been altered—on 4th July 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been altered to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is shown at the back but not the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was certainly not with my full consent and knowledge that the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was put on by the prisoner for expenses; I should not have known where the expenses were, I had no cash book—on 16th July the receipt was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which has been altered to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the face—the prisoner had no cabs or omnibuses he had my pony and trap; when my pony was ill for seven weeks we hired one—he has used a cab—Mrs. Michaels has come to 38, Chapel Street to see goods the prisoner has bought, and she has bought them back from us—part was not bought for us, and part for her; I have always objected to that—I swear I never knew she was supplied by her husband's pur<lb/>chases—I never brought out what the profits of a month's trading had been—I believe the prisoner has done so for himself—I do not know what we made in the first month—I know since the accountant went through it we paid 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than we received—I was head of the shop; it was my money; I had control of the entire sales—the prisoner did not com<lb/>plain that goods had been sold by me and not entered—Miss Shand left for an hour each day for dinner—she said nothing to me her return about finding I had not entered a single sale—I never sold anything—my wife was there while Miss Shand was away, and my wife is at the business now—the shopman was away at dinner at the same time as Miss Shand—everything sold was entered in this book, it shows the takings—the prisoner put about 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of goods in the business that was not agreed to be treated as separate from the capital of the business—it was arranged they should put 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in; I never saw it—this 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid for all claims was written by the prisoner on the last day pretty well, when we dissolved, when he had the books—we never settled up between us about the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I never came to terms with him about it—neither I nor my wife ever sold milk or eggs at 38. Chapel Street, after Mrs. Michaels entered into partnership—I might have had a cup of coffee that was left over for a friend—the prisoner was not my partner—he may have spoken of me as his partner to his friends without my taking much notice, because I did not think it would interest any one, but in business matters I always acknowledged Mrs. Michaels as my partner—I never heard the prisoner speak of me as his partner to Selwood, Eaton</p>

               <p>and Co.'s manager; I did not acquiesce in it to him; nor to French nor Eaton: he may have done so in a public-house, and I should take no notice of it—I don't think I ever interfered with his business of selecting goods—he bought where and for what price he pleased—I objected about a month or six weeks before we dissolved—I don't think I said to Tamil I could not engage Williams, the errand boy, till my partner, Mr. Michaels, had seen him, I could not swear I did not—I do not think I said, before engaging Turrell, that I could not engage him before I had seen Mr. Michaels, my partner—I never said a word about Mr. Michaels being my partner—I don't think I ever spoke to Turrell, about him as my partner, I could not swear—Mr. Michaels brought Williams to me—I believe in several weeks it occurs in the book that Michaels' wages are entered 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then there is a cross entry, so that he gets none of it—I explained it at the police-court—putting down the wages was not part of the plan to prevent judgment and execution being levied on Michaels' goods by using Mrs. Michaels' name—this book is all in the prisoner's writing; he received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—the cross entries on pages 11 and 12 against the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wages are for goods that were sold—he used to sell job lots, that we could not sell to another job buyer, with my knowledge—I never before heard of any complaint that goods were taken out of the shop—no partition was put up in the shop—I signed this which the prisoner wrote: "12th November, 1886. In consideration of your having this day dissolved partnership with me I hereby agree to pay all debts and outstanding expenses due by the said partnership to any person whatever;" and I signed this also: "12th November, 1886. I hereby agree to pay you 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as follows, for your share in the partnership: 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th December, 1886; 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th March, 1887; and 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th June, 1887; the payment of the above two last sums to be paid by bills"—I paid him 60/. cash, and gave him a bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a month, and two bills for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each at four and seven months—the bills were addressed to Mrs. Michaels—I think the prisoner, Mr. Faulkner, Mr. "Woolf, Mr. Cook, and Mr. B as witch were present when the bills were signed—on my oath I did not on that occasion say, "Some of these invoices have been altered"—I did not know it—the prisoner did not say, "Yes, you know the expenses were added'1—I did not say, "Then that is all right"—the arbitration was on 12th November, that was the night we settled up—they were all the prisoner's friends there—Cook is a solicitor's clerk, he is my friend—I diet not fetch Mr. Baswitch; he and Woolf are the prisoner's friends—I went to Baswitch's office, not to fetch him—that was after I had fallen out with the prisoner—disputes were going on between us for pretty well six weeks I should say—Cook only acted for me on that night—he did not prepare the dissolution—he might have written out the partnership and the bills—I have no recol<lb/>lection of saying there had been mistakes made on both sides with regard to bills and invoices—neither the books nor anything were gone into when Baswitch and Woolf came; they said they would not go through the accounts; I think they put aside the books altogether and heard our verbal statements, and then awarded that I was to pay 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the way mentioned, and I consented to that—I did not know that before they said they would throw aside the books and papers, the invoices, then having additions to them, were mentioned; they were not mentioned—I swear that in the presence of Miss Shand I have never</p>

               <p>stood by while the prisoner put in the pencil figures on the documents—I paid the prisoner the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave notice that I should dishonour the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill which became due on 16th December—I sought an interview with Mrs. Michaels before the bill became due, but did not see her—I sent over to her only once—my wife wanted me to see her the night before I gave the prisoner in charge, which was a day or two before the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due—I swear I did not say I would not go on with the charge if the bills were given me—they have been to me a dozen times and asked me if they gave up the bills would I give up the prosecution—I should say. I first consulted any one about charging him about a fortnight or more before the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill became due—I found it out about a week after I had paid him the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cook gave me advice—I went to Mr. Morris—I got no summons or warrant against the prisoner, but told a constable—I charged the prisoner with falsifying the accounts and forgery—I did not leave Mr. Morris to find out what it was, we had found it out before—I charged him with what I was told to—I did not say anything to the constable or inspector about forgery; it was the Magistrate first inserted forgery, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I gave Mrs. Michaels these bills, to pay her out of the business when we dissolved—the prisoner's name was not on them at all—on this invoice for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. not only has the total, but the amount for each bonnet has been altered—I bought a pony and trap for the prisoner's use when he was out buying—once when the pony was ill I hired another one; that appears in the book—when cabs were necessary, as the trap was not available, he charged for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 41, High Street, Islington; Edmonds and Michaels are neighbours of mine—I have known Michaels 12 or 14 months; I knew him in business in Chapel Street, and knew his wife had a separate business in Liverpool Road—on 12th November Mr. Edmonds' son called on me—they sent a second and third time, and then I went to Chapel Street, where I saw Mr. Edmonds—he said "I want you to act on my behalf as arbitrator"—I said that I would—in the room upstairs I saw Mr. Baswitch, Mr. Howes, Mr. Faulkner, and the prisoner—I asked Mr. Edmonds if I was to act as arbitrator for him and try to settle the case—he said "Certainly"—Mr. Howes was arbitrator the other side, Mr. Baswitch was stocktaker, and Mr. Faulkner was umpire—the books were brought forward; they were kept so badly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701310093"/>
               <p>we could make nothing of them—I saw neither of these books looked into—we put them and the papers and invoices on one side; Mr. Edmonds quite agreed to that—Edmonds said nothing about the invoices in my hearing, but I had to go back to my business—we ultimately arranged that Edmonds was to pay out the prisoner, not Mrs. Michaels, with half the money that the stock was taken for; 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in cash, and the rest in bills—I think the cash was paid a few days afterwards at the Piebald public-house; Faulkner, Baswitch, Edmonds, and another gentleman were there then; he gave him three bills and gold—the conclusion was come to that 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid after Mr. Edmonds and the prisoner had been heard and stock had been taken—nothing was said about the invoices in my presence, but when it was all over, and we were having a friendly glass, Mr. Edmonds said to me that Mr. Bastwitch had taken stock, but he, Mr. Edmonds, had got the better of him; he said "He thought he was a better man; I had him for 1501."—on 7th or 8th December I saw Edmonds again—he said he had charged the prisoner—I was surprised to hear it, and said I thought everything was settled quietly and amicably—he said there had been some bills altered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an agent of 7, Grocers' Hall Court—I have known the prisoner for three or four years or more, and Mr. Edmonds for some time; the prisoner introduced me to him as his partner, at my warehouse in Manchester Avenue—since June I have had considerable business transactions with the prisoner—I had a conversation with Edmonds as to the relations between him and the prisoner; he said he had had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the prisoner, and had charged him with the stock being 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short, and he asked me to come up at 4 o'clock and take stock—that was on 8th November—I went and took stock—Mr. and Mrs. Edmonds called them out and gave me the prices, and sometimes they appealed to the prisoner as to the price, and he decided—I found there ought to have been about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more stock there—Edmonds said he could not understand how it was short, but they said it was arranged that Edmonds should buy the business—a few days after Edmonds, the prisoner, Woolf, myself, Faulkner, and Howes met in the shop at Chapel Street about 7 o'clock, and they said they intended to settle the business,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This conversation about withdrawing from the charge was a few days before, when the prisoner was taken—I heard it proposed on the part of the prisoner that the bills should be withdrawn, and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to the prosecutor—Mrs. Michaels refused it; I do not know that the prosecutor refused it, or that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought here—I said to Mr. Edmonds that commissions and expenses had been put on the invoices instead of keeping them separate, perhaps a week before they were dis<lb/>solving partnership—he never spoke about my commission—I had a com<lb/>mission of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid me from the firm by the prisoner and Edmonds, because I introduced them to firms in London—I only knew on the even<lb/>ing they dissolved partnership that Mrs. Michaels was the partner—Mrs. Michaels was upstairs then on the Friday night.</p>

I paid him 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weekly wages—I still swear that, after my attention was called to an agreement produced at the police-court—I gave him into custody for stealing the money and falsifying the books—I first associated myself with the prisoner in business about 12 months ago—I entered into this agreement with him dated 25th January, 1886—this is my signature—I believe I understood it. (<hi rend="italic">By this the two parties agreed to assist each other in erecting six houses, the prisoner to receive 21. per week and the witness</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per week, the profits to be equally divided, and if there should be any dispute, to be settled by arbitration, six months' notice to be given by either of dissolution of partnership.</hi>) The prisoner had all his money; I never had mine—I drew up that agreement myself—I think he was my servant under that agreement—the six houses were finished; neither of us then gave notice to dissolve the partnership—I agreed with him to go on with other buildings on the same estate—there was a written agreement as to</p>

               <p>that; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, dated 9th August, 1886—by this each of us was to receive 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; I never had a penny; I was to have it if there was any after the building was finished; it is not finished—I also entered into another agreement at the same date with regard to the Woodside Estate—these are the three agreements under which the prisoner and I were carrying on these building operations—I still swear he was my servant at weekly wages—nothing has ever been removed off the estate since the prisoner has been in custody, only from one house to another—I do not know that the prisoner called in the assistance of the police to stop the removal of property; he had no right to stop it—there was a quantity of plant branded with the initials "T. &amp; N." that belonged to us as partners until the agreement was abandoned—I bought a new brand nearly 12 months ago; it was not last September—no profit was made on the Abbeville Estate, it was a loss; about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is owing to me, I never had a shilling—I know that the prisoner says there was a profit; I have not heard him say that he is entitled to half, I do not know that he claims it—there is an account to be opened as soon as I have time to make it up—there is an action pending in the High Court of Justice for an account to be taken between us; I have been served with a writ for it—as to the Clock House Estate, it was left to the prisoner in a great measure to engage nearly the whole of the men; I was sometimes consulted, and sometimes not—the prisoner arranged with the men what wages he should pay them—the men knew me; I was there several times a week—on some occasions one asked me 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour, and I refused him—I have not refused on other occasions to allow 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour and said I would only allow 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have been told since that there were two Union men there—I know that Union men will only work at a certain price and for certain hours—those two men are the prisoner's relations, Allen and Mackay; one is said to be a brother-in-law, and the other a cousin—I believe they are to be called as witnesses—I refused to let men have advances during the week, but it has been done—I refuse a man more than he is worth—a memorandum was made of advances, you will find <hi rend="italic">"Sub"</hi> in some places; about two, I think—I found all the money—it did not all come in the shape of advances from the freeholder; I am responsible for it; the bulk or it came from the freeholder—the Abbeville speculation is not commenced, only bought the land—the Clock House Estate is not finished; nothing has been made on it, not a penny; the building is still going on—the prisoner would be entitled to half the profit if he was a partner; is he a partner? that is the question—on 10th November a plan for building four houses in Cavendish, Road was sent in to the Board of Works of the Wandsworth district in the names of Tytherleigh and Napier, but that was sent in without my consent; I say that positively—there are two more houses to be built in Cavendish Road; they are not commenced; that is part of the Clock House Estate—I went and saw the men who are to be called before calling them as witnesses, every one of them—one of them, Hardy, left on his own account some months ago; I do not know that the prisoner discharged him, I never heard it—the day I gave the prisoner in custody I discharged four men; Allen and Mackay are two of them; that was in consequence of stealing—I also discharged Marsh; he was an accessory; I do not know whether he is a relation of the prisoner—I have never had any wages; I never</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I brought the books to the police-court, and they were there for examination—they were never called for—I have not been asked to bring them here, nor has my solicitor, to my knowledge—I gave the prisoner in custody on 21st December—no writ was out then, as far as I know—before I gave him into custody I had made a careful inspection of my pay-books, and had also inspected my plant at the different places—I did not find it correct; I have lost a lot of things—in the building trade the foreman, not the master, usually engages the men and as a rule dismisses them—I think the prisoner did find 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the first start of the Abbeville Estate; that was the extent—I went on in the ordinary way; as the surveyor measured up the buildings I borrowed money on mortgage, and when there was not any I found it myself; there as nothing unusual in that—on the Woodside affair the prisoner had to find 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I lent him a portion of the money, and I have paid considerably more since on his account, more than over-balances it—that estate is not yet commenced, I could only get the land—there is nothing due to the prisoner from me at this moment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). On the evening of 7th January, about 8.30, I saw a brewer's dray with a pair of horses driven by the prisoner across the circus at the rate of about seven or eight miles an hour; it was coming from the Obelisk to the Borough Road—people were crossing from Blackfriars to the London Road side and back again—I saw people run to get out of the way—an old gentleman was crossing the road; he was not able to get out of the way; he was struck by the pole, knocked down, and the wheels passed over him—the prisoner went driving on; he made no effort to stop—I ran after him by the side for about 40 yards—I called to him to stop, and put my umbrella up, and he stopped—I told him to get down—he said "What's the matter?"—I said "Do you know you have run over a man and knocked him down?"—he said "No"—there was another man with him sitting by his side—the prisoner was driving—they both got down; they were both drunk—the prisoner was taken to the station; another constable took the deceased to the hospital.</p>

As far as I know this is correct—I did not see the van till it was coming past the Obelisk; it came on the river side of the Obelisk—I saw it for about 20 or 30 yards before the accident, and for about 30 yards after—I am sure it was going more than six miles an hour; it was going at a full trot—I have been to the spot since, at night—I know the urinal; there are two lights on it—I do not know whether a driver coming from the Lambeth Road would pass on the south side of the Obelisk or not, some come one way and some the other—the urinal would not shut out the whole of the roadway from a driver coming from Lambeth Road; it would be more awkward to see a person passing—passengers pass on the west side of the urinal—two boys were crossing the usual way; they stepped back—the other passengers had passed before—the two boys and the deceased were all I saw at the time—the van belonged to the City of London Brewery Company—the man not driving was seated on a barrel on the near side of the driver—the horses were trotting very fast; it would make a noise—Ellis was the man with the prisoner; his name and address were taken at the station—he was sent to the brewery to state what had happened; the prisoner was detained—he was drunk, not fit to have charge of horses, or Ellis either—he denied it—the doctor said he was drunk, and not fit to have charge of horses—the urinal throws a shadow on the roadway—I don't call it a deep shadow.</p>

I am barman at the Masons' Arms—on 15th January, about 1.30, Simpson came in, who I knew as a regular customer—he called for half a pint of beer, and gave me a half-sovereign, which I put into a glass—there was no other half-sovereign there—in 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour Brown came in, and Simpson said "What will you have?"—he said "Half of mild and bitter"—Simpson put down 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Brown then called for two <hi rend="italic">smokes</hi>, price 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a bad half-sovereign—I showed it to Mr. Lock—Brown ran out without his change, and Mr. Lock ran after him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coin—as soon as I found it was bad I went to the glass and found somebody had put another half-sovereign in; there were two then, one good and one bad—I cannot Bay which of them Simpson gave me—other people were serving in the bar who had access to the glass—the bad half-sovereign was taken out of the glass and given to the constable—I had seen Simpson in there earlier in the day—he had some drink and I changed a sovereign for him—there was a half-sovereign among the change I gave him, which was good as far as I can tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, of Wells Street, Blackfriars—on 15th January, as I went into the Masons' Arms about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came out—I went in, and heard some talk between the landlord and the barman about a half-sovereign, and Simpson went out—I went out, and saw the prisoner not quite 100 yards off—Simpson made signs to him, and they walked together through the railway arch—I went back and spoke to Mr. Lock, who followed them, and gave them in custody.</p>
