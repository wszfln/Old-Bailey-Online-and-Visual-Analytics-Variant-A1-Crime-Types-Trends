On the 19th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went out to buy a candle - it was dark: I left nobody in the room; I locked the door, and when I came back I had a candle - I got it lighted before I went into the room; when I got to the room-door I found it partly open, and saw the prisoner in the room - he told me some man had been into the room: I asked what business he had there - he immediately rushed by me, and ran down stairs; I followed him, and when he got to the street-door it was shut - he opened it: I followed close after him - he tried to shut the street-door, but I caught it in my hand; I went out to my father, who was in the stall under the window, in the street - it is a shoemaker's stall- I told him; the prisoner ran towards Wardour-street, and my father followed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who does your father hire the house of? A. Mr. Hammond, of Marlborough-street, who does not live in the house; he collects the rents himself - nobody belonging to the house lives in it; there are lodgers on the second-floor, and at the top of the house; there is a private and a shop-door- I locked the room-door, and took the key; I did not lock the street-door, but left it shut - my father and all the lodgers have a key of the street-door; my father does not pay taxes: I found no marks of violence on the door- it must have been opened with a key; I had lighted the candle at my father's stall, before I returned - when I ran down I spoke to my father immediately; he directly ran out after the prisoner - I could see him all the way he ran, but not till he was taken; I did not run after him: I did not lose sight of him for five minutes -I never saw him before; there are two gas-lights opposite the house - I had been gone about ten minutes for the candle. No property was missing.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAWRENCE. I am thirteen years old - William Lawrence is my father. On the night in question I was playing at marbles before my father's door, and saw the prisoner come out of the house; he ran towards Wardour-street - my sister went to my father, and said there had been a thief in the room; my father followed him - I ran to the corner of St. Ann's-court, and saw the prisoner coming towards Wardour-street again, running fast; I laid hold of him by the tail of his coat, but could not stop him - I fell down, and called Stop thief! St. Ann's-court is in the way from our house to Wardour-street: I had been playing at the door about a quarter of an hour, but did not see my sister go out, or any body go in - I saw the prisoner stopped in Chapel-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen your sister go out? A. No, I was over on the other side of the street once, and came over again; I was not near my father's door -I could see the door on the other side; Chapel-street is about five minutes' walk from our house - I caught hold of the man by the tail of his coat, and fell down; I got up and followed in a minute and a half, but had not lost sight of him - he ran across the road, and then kept going along Wardour-street; I kept him in sight till he was taken - I lost sight of him for about a minute, while I was down; a good many people ran when I cried out, but he was the first of them - he is lame, and cannot run very fast; he kept before the people who followed: I went before the Justice the same evening, and told all this, and was examined again next day - nobody told me what to say; my father told me to say what I had seen, but did not tell me what.</p>

On the 19th of December my daughter came out of the door, and gave me information- I followed the man, whom she pointed out, towards Wardour-street, across the street, into Ship-yard; I ran round into St. Ann's-court, and then into Wardour-street again - I did not see him taken: I afterwards went home, and examined my room; the lock of the front door appeared to have been picked - it was not forced open, as there was no mark of violence; the bolt of the lock was back - I examined a drawer in the room, and found it had been cut open; the wood-work, where the bolt of the lock goes, was cut out: there was wearing-apparel in the drawer, but nothing was taken away; I had another drawer in the room, with money in it - that was partly cut open; others were cut, but not sufficient to open- nothing was taken; it was about half-past six o'clock: there are two gas-lights opposite the house, which enabled the boys to play at marbles.</p>

I have known the prisoner many years; about the 3d or 4th of November he called on me, and asked if I could tell him of a house and shop to let in the general line; I told him I thought he did not want a shop as he had before called on me in a similar way in consequence of an advertisment - he accounted for his not coming forward before about a shop, on account of his father's death; I said I had a shop to dispose of - he asked the terms; I gave him the address, he went and looked at it, and returned to me the same day, saying, he thought it just the thing he was in want of; I mentioned 40l. as the price of the shop and fixtures - he then proposed to give a bill of exchange for that amount, which I objected to in the first instance; he said the bill was as good as money - that his cousin, who was to be the acceptor, was a very respectable merchant, residing in the City, in Cateaton-street, and said his name was

               <persName id="t18290115-6-person150">drew</persName>
             the bill, and he took it away, and brought it back with an acceptance on it; I gave him the balance, which was 10l. - this is the bill (looking at it), this acceptance was on it when he brought it back - I gave him 10l. in cash, and gave him possession of the premises a few days after, according to agreement: when he brought the bill back, he said, "Here is the bill;" I said, "Is it accepted? you are quite sure it is your cousin's acceptance, the party who you took me to see on Saturday in Cateaton-street?" - he said it was. I paid the bill away to William Hall of Judd-street a few days before it was due- it was only drawn at one month; I have endorsed it, and the prisoner also endorsed it - I wrote his name, at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150007"/>his request, as he could not see to write, and he made a mark: I believe he is not accustomed to write, but puts his mark. The bill became due on the 11th of December, and on that morning Cotterell came to me with a message; I took him with me to Mr. Hall, and afterwards went with Cotterell and Hall's son in search of the prisoner - he came to us at a public-house; we were desired just to step in there and he would come to us with the money; he came up to me and said, "Have you got the bill?" I said, "I have not, I paid it to Mr. Hall, and he has sent his son with the bill;" he said, "I have not the money at the present moment, but I shall have it in half an hour - I am going to receive 94l." I told him he had better speak to Hall's son, who had got the bill, and I believe he told him he would come down in half an hour and take it up - that he had got to go as far as Covent-garden for the money; I went to Hall again about one or two o'clock, and found it was not taken up - it was returned to me, and I presented it at

               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has been blind from his birth? A. He could see the money when he took it off my counter; he is near-sighted, but not blind - he is not led about. I wrote the direction on the bill, as well as the body; I received it from Hall on the 11th, when it was due, and gave it to the officer at Hatton-garden, it was given up to me yesterday. The prisoner was apprehended about a week after it became due - he lived in the house from the time I gave him possession till he was taken; he told me it was an understanding between him and his cousin, that if he could get any business for that amount, he would give him his acceptance: I only went to his cousin's once before the bill was drawn - I did not entertain any suspicion when I asked if it were his cousin's acceptance; I had inquired and considered Mr. Hunter's acceptance good.</p>

            . I have a warehouse in Cateaton-street - my father's sister married the prisoner's father; she died childless, and there was a second marriage- I have known the prisoner many years; the acceptance on this bill is not my hand-writing - I never authorized him to accept it in my name, When Morley presented the bill, I really was so staggered, I hardly knew what I said; I saw the embarrassing situation I was in, and declined giving any answer - I had told the prisoner if I saw he had an opportunity of setting up in the world, I might assist him, and I should have assisted him; I had not told him if he took any premises I would accept for the amount - I have told him at various times I would help him; I, in conjunction with others, was to assist him - I did not send any message to Morley that I was sorry I was not in the way - I did not know he had called.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has the prisoner been blind from his birth? A. He is not blind; he can neither read nor write: he can just grope about the street - he has not been educated, except in music; he was under Mr. Parkes, a blind musician: he has but one eye - any one would think him blind; he bore a good character - I have assisted him materially at times: he knows nothing at all about negociating bills - he may know what a bill of exchange is; I should not think he knew of three days' grace being given on bills; I believe he expected my assistance if he could get a shop - he formerly had to draw a bill, and was so ignorant I was obliged to draw it for him.</p>

            . I live at No. 112, St. John-street. About the beginning of November the prisoner applied to me to write his name across a bill, as he was blind, or nearly blind - I am sure he said his name; I am confident of it: I asked what I should write - he said, "Accepted,

            ;" (looking at the bill) this is my hand-writing - I have written something for him before: I asked him to put his mark to this bill - he said he would do that in the presence of the person he paid it to; at the same time saying it would not be taken without he put his mark in the presence of the person he gave it to; he left the shop - he said he was a neighbour up above, and would be a customer to me - he was very much obliged to me for my kindness, and wished me a good morning; this was at Hoxton, in Middlesex - I was in the service of my master, who has a shop there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often had you seen him before? A. Only once, about four days before; I did not think this an odd request, as he appeared extremely deficient in sight - I did not doubt his being the person he represented.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 24th of December, I was passing along Bishopsgate-street; I observed a coach back into Devonshire-street- I went up, and saw a man shutting the door and going away; the coachman said, "Where am I to drive to?" the man was at that time shutting the door, and seeing me went away without answering him, as I said, "Never mind. coachman, I will tell you in a minute;" I opened the coach-door, put my head in, and the prisoner jumped out as quick as he could at the door I stood at; he could not get out at the other door, as this bale of goods was there - I laid hold of him; he said, "Let me go:" I called for assistance, and he was secured; he certainly jumped out as if to escape, but I detained him, and found a large bale of goods in the coach, and a bill of parcels, which led me to Mr. Burbidge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You and your brother were on the look out? A. Yes - the coachman is not here; he said nothing in the prisoner's presence: he did not say the prisoner was never in the coach - I did not speak to him, except telling him I would tell him where to drive.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite certain the prisoner was in the coach? A. Yes: I never let him go - he had not got half a yard from the coach.</p>

            . I am beadle of Devonshire-square. On Thursday morning, the 18th of December, I was on duty in a watch-box in the square; the box commands a view of the prosecutor's premises - about eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner and two others walking to and fro; the reason I noticed the prisoner was that he came to my box door, and hallooed out, "Jack, Jack" - I looked out of the window, and saw one of his companions walking round the square; I suppose he came there to see how far my window commands a view of the square - I could see the prosecutor's door from the box; they passed to and fro - the prisoner gave his umbrella into the hands of one of his companions under the archway; he then crossed towards me, and then took a circuit to Mr. Otley's door, walked up the steps into Mr. Otley's warehouse, and laid hold of the tea-chest - it was too heavy for him, as I suppose; he laid hold of it, and at that moment Mr. Wormald opened the counting-house door: I saw him clap his hands on the tea-chest, which was within the door - the door was open, and I could see the chest: in order to have a better view of him, I drew back the slide of my window, and when I again looked he was in the act of dropping the tea, and Mr. Wormald was at the door; the prisoner ran away - Mr. Wormald called Stop thief! I opened my box-door, with a little difficulty, to run round under the archway, which leads into Borer's-buildings and Still-alley - I went another way, and met him and his two associates in Borer's-buildings, within three or four minutes of my seeing him run from the door, and am positive of him, and his companions also; I went up, collared him. and said, "You are my prisoner;" I had no sooner said that than the other two attacked me, cut my cheek, and bruised my head - the man who had received the umbrella from him knocked me about my head and legs, and then they dragged me into Cutler-street, and rolled me into the kennel; I was a good deal ill-used, and the prisoner struck me several times with one hand, which he had at liberty, but I never let go my hold of him - assistance came, and the others got away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Not the prisoner - I lost sight of him for about four minutes, as I went round to meet him; it was about seven minutes from the time the umbrella was changed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150010"/>till he ran away - I was not struck till I seized him; I told him what I charged him with - I will not say that was before I was attacked, for the attack was almost directly; I think I should know one of the other men again - my attention was directed to him also; the warehouse is twenty or thirty yards from my box - what I saw was through my window, which is about a foot and a half long, and a foot broad.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. From the time you saw him till the chest was taken were you watching them? A. Yes- I observed the prisoner particularly, and am certain he is the man who went into the warehouse and took the tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The street-keeper says he was not more than four minutes going four hundred yards - that is the distance he went, and I was taken not fifty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell whether the man taken, was the man who ran from you? A. No - it was not very dark, but I should think too dark to swear to a man; I had just paid the coachman - I felt the reticule pulled and missed it immediately; the person did not come in front of me; it is very possible it might have dropped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you say it was snatched? A. I felt some one pull, and felt a jerk at it, then missed it - a lady called out "You had better go forward, the man who has robbed you, is taken."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it dropped, or was taken? A. It must have been taken, I think - I felt a jerk and immediately missed it.</p>

I was in Smithfield: about twenty yards before I got to the prosecutrix, I saw her, and a man, I believe - I thought him a middle-sized man - I walked down and got within four yards of them, and saw the man make a sort of a wrestle, then run away, and the woman screamed out directly; I ran after the man and was very near getting hold of him - he turned down Hosier-lane, through a passage; I fell over some rails instead of jumping over them - I got up and followed him again, calling Stop thief! five or six people ran after him; I pursued the same man who took the articles - I believe the man I followed was taken; he might be out of my sight in the middle of Hosier-lane, but I do not think he was - the same man was taken; I was out of breath - I cannot say whether the prisoner is the man, in the dress he has on now; I have said I could swear to him when he had the other clothes on - he had a light waistcoat on at the time; I saw the same person taken who I pursued, and that man I saw at the office - the man at the office was the man who robbed her; if the prisoner be the man who was at the office, he is the man who committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you think the wrong man was taken for this? A. I do not think it myself - I am tall; I thought he was a middling sized man - I called Stop thief! after I could run no longer; I was never out of this country; I was on the Chatham river for about three years, sometimes fishing and sometimes sailing: I was transported for theft, but it was proved I never did any thing of the sort - I am "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A.

On the 21st of December I heard an alarm in King-street, opposite Hosier-lane - I saw the prisoner running down the lane, and several persons pursuing him; he was the first man, and I stopped him - I did not see Stantide till at the watch-house- he there said he was the man; nothing but a pair of scissors was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the boy asked the colour of what was taken? A. Yes; he said it was black, and said he had been thrown down - Carter was in the watch-house, and said he was a shoe maker.</p>

The prisoner was brought in; the boy told the story he has now - the prisoner said he was a tailor, but there being no marks on his finger, I doubted it; he then said he was a ca<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150011"/>binet-maker employed near Spafields, but would not tell the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you send persons out to search in the tract? A. Yes; they found nothing - the boy said he thought it was a bag that he snatched - he could not exactly say the colour, but thought it was black; Smithfield is well lighted - the robbery was committed in the darkest part, but that is not too dark to see a person.</p>

            . I never said I was robbed in a public-house, or in Smithfield; I stated what I have here.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I went into the Cooper's Arms public-house to have a pint of beer; the man was there having gin-hot - he asked me to drink, which I did; he had a glass of rum and water, two quarterns of gin, and a pint of porter - he came out of the door, and went away with two girls.</p>
               <p>SHAW'S Defence. I was going along, when he asked me to have something to drink; he treated us with liquor - I took this young woman to have some; he wished us good bye, and went off with two young women; we went into a house to have a pint of beer - the officer came in and took us; he said he was robbed there - the landlady can prove he was not.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIAMS. My husband keeps the Cooper's Arms public-house. The prosecutor and some girls were drinking there on the evening of the 19th - that is all I know; I do not know how long he was in the house - my niece served them; they had a pint of hot beer with a quartern of gin in it, and a glass of gin and water between them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it your custom to take account of the articles delivered to the men? A. Yes, and they are responsible for them at the end of the week - if any are deficient they are not to be paid for by them; if a man was to say, "Here are two hats short, which have been stolen," I should make him pay for them - such instances have occurred.</p>
               <p>HENRY JONES. I am in Mr. Moore's employ. On the 2d of January I found these hats concealed behind the steam-boiler, in the shop where the prisoner was at work- they were unfinished: I took them out, and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of them - he denied it, but afterwards said they were his: he took them, and went to open them - I went to a distance, saw him crush one up and put it into his hat; in a few minutes he did so with the other, and put a piece of slate over them - I went and told the young man in the shop below; he came up and said, "Whose are these?" the prisoner said, "They are mine" - he then went and got the watchman.</p>




               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person named Holmes in the employ of Mr. Moore? A. Yes - he was examined before the Magistrate; he is not here - he did not say that he hand put one of the hats into the prisoner's hat; it was about twenty minutes to nine o'clock when I saw the hats - Holmes and Almond were working in the shop at the other end; I asked the prisoner who put them there - it was the prisoner's duty to work on hats in the warehouse; these hats were crushed up, and put behind the steam-boiler - a person might go to the boiler without seeing them, as there was no light near there, I went to the boiler, and put my hand accidentally on them- there were five or six lights in the room; it is about ten yards long - the boiler is there for the men to put their hats on; I saw the prisoner put them into his hat - I do not think he knew I saw him; I said I thought it was not a fit place for them to be in - after that he put them into his hat, and a piece of slate on, which he had his work down on; he did say he thought it was a silk handkerchief - I have seen him wear a handkerchief; when he came in the morning he used to take off his handkerchief and put it into his hat - he was at work that night without a handkerchief; Holmes was discharged by Mr. Moore because he worked in the same shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Holmes have any thing to do with the hats? A. No - I spoke to the prisoner and Holmes about them; they both denied knowing any thing about them - I did not leave the shop; I saw him put them into his hat in about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner said, "They are my property" - the young man said, "Are they not Mr. Moore's?" he said No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ALMOND. I received information from Jones - I took a light, and went up stairs to the steam-copper; my brother was working at the other end - I looked into the copper; the prisoner then had his back towards it -I saw his hat on a shelf near the boiler; I took it and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "They are my property;" I said, "Are you sure they are not Mr. Moore's" - he said, "No, they are my property;" I thought it very odd - I locked the two men in the room, and went down to Mr. Moore - he said they were his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150013"/>hats; I went and got the watchman, and took him up stairs - the prisoner had then got his clothes on; I went and said to the prisoner, "Where is the other hat?" which I had left in his hat - he said, "What hat? I have seen no hat;" I went round to the steam-copper, and this hat was put into a small hole where the steam came out - he was then taken to the watch-house, and there he said they were Mr. Moore's hats, which he had to finish.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Holmes was then in the service of the prosecutor? A. Yes, but has been dismissed; Holmes had been there three or four months - he was accounted a good steady man; the prisoner generally wore a white handkerchief, but I cannot say what he wore that day - he said before the Magistrate that he thought it was his black silk handkerchief, but I had taken one hat out and shewn it him; he could not think it was a handkerchief - if these hats had been delivered to him to finish he must have returned them, or given some account of them; I do not know whether he would have had to pay for any that he did not return.</p>

            . I am night-constable. The prisoner was brought to me with the hats; I asked if they were his - he said, "No, Mr. Moore's."</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE re-examined. Q. Why did you dismiss Holmes? A. They were taken before the Magistrate together, and I have no doubt but he knew the prisoner stole the hats; it is most painful to me to bring the man here - he is married, and has a family; he has behaved well till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Two men called at the shop and I went to give them some refreshment - I came back in about three hours; Jones brought the hats, and put them on my board - I know nothing about them; I asked Holmes how they came there in that state - he said he put one there; I took one and steamed it, and then I certainly did put them into my hat - I told Almond they were mine, being my work.</p>

On the night of the 25th of December I saw the prisoner on the premises, about seven o'clock; I watched him, and saw him go to a fence at the end of the engine-house; he got a ladder, and got on the top of the fence, and said, "It is all right" - I got behind a crane, and presently saw something put under the fence; the prisoner came round, drew it through a hole, and passed me - it appeared to me like a pig of lead; I went out at one of the gates, and round to Nightingale-lane, expecting to meet him, but he did not come - I went back, and got behind the crane; he came and passed me again - I again went to Nightingale-lane, but he did not come; I then went more on the works of the Docks, and in a few minutes I saw him and another man go down Nightingale-lane, without any thing; the prisoner went into a marine-store shop, and the other went away - the next morning I went in the track which the prisoner had passed along, and found one large pig of lead, and at a distance some other pieces, which appeared to have come from a melting-pot; I concealed myself that night, and saw the prisoner and another man come and cut one piece across - the prisoner took a piece up, and concealed it about his person; the other man went away: I ran across the works, and met the prisoner in Burr-street - the other man was not there; I asked the prisoner what he had got - he said nothing - I snatched his hands from his coat, which was clasped round him, and his small-clothes gave way; this piece of lead fell out - he said, "I suppose you know where I got it."</p>
               <p>THOMAS HAYNES. I am a labourer, in the employ of Messrs. Boulton and Watt; they are engine-manufacturers- they have a large quantity of stores at St. Katharine's Docks; I have the key of them. On the 26th of December I saw the window of the engine-house had been opened- I missed four large pieces of lead, and some which had been melted in a pot; I have no doubt that this piece of lead is a part of one of the large pieces which had been in the engine-house, but it has been cut across - I had locked the engine-house on Christmas morning.</p>

            . I took up the prisoner on the 30th of December; I waited at a private house, which I understood he frequented - when he came I told him I had been waiting for him some time, and I wanted him for a gun; he said, "What gun?" I said, "The gun you have taken from Mr. Egg's;" he said, "I know nothing about it" - that it was a foolish thing, and a drunken thing: as we went along I accused him of dropping something from his left hand, and I told a person to pick it up - the prisoner said he had dropped nothing; he had got the duplicate - we went to Mr. Egg's; I searched him, and said, "You have not got the duplicate - I must strip you;" he then gave it me from the cuff of his coat.</p>

I said "I have not," but I looked down, and said "Yes, I have;" I went back and begged his pardon - I had no intention of robbing him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What sort of purse was it? A. A long red silk purse, with money at each end; I had it on my arm when I came from home.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR. I am a baker. I was in the shop at the corner of Gilbert-street, about a quarter before four o'clock- I saw the prosecutrix pass, and saw the prisoner close to her; I saw the purse fall, but did not see from whom - the prosecutrix went on - the prisoner picked up the purse; I went and told her that I thought it belonged to the lady who had just gone on - she said it was 3d. she had got in a piece of brown paper; I did not see what it was - I could not leave my business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not ask what had fallen? A. No; I knew what she picked up, but I did not ask her- the lady had gone on five or six yards; I had some things in my hands, and could not go - I supposed it was the lady's purse; the prisoner had a barrow near that place, but she did not stop.</p>
               <p>MARY KING. I was at the corner of the street; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150015"/>soner asked me if I knew whether Mr. Bullock was giving coals away that day - I said I did not; she then picked up what I believe was a red purse, and I saw her put it under her apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see what it was? A. No; she said it was three penny-pieces in a brown paper; I have known her twenty-five years - she sells things in the street, and had an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to her about its being a purse? A. No; I thought it was a red purse when she picked it up, and I said "Halves if the lady don't own it;" she said it was three penny-pieces in a brown paper, which she had dropped; I had nothing more to say about it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said before the Magistrate you said "Don't say so, it is a purse, and there is more than that in it?" A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say "There is only three half-crowns and one shilling?" A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then that is a falsehood? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES SELBY. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found 10s. 6d. on her, two half-crowns and five shillings in silver, and sixpence in copper; she denied having seen the purse, and I found none on her - she said the money was what she had taken in the course of the day for fish; she generally stands close by that shop - I had not been there that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband bought some soles, and I was selling them; Mrs. King passed, and I asked if Mr. Bullock gave out coals - I took four penny-pieces and a sixpence out of my pocket, and I dropped 3d. out of my hand; I saw nothing of the purse.</p>

On the 24th of December I wanted a great coat, and went out to purchase it, about nine o'clock; I met a Jew, of whom I had bought things before, and asked him if he had one; he said he had not, but he had a waistcoat, of which I had before asked him about; he asked me 10s. for this waistcoat; I said I had but one sovereign and 3s., and I would not give more than 7s. for the waistcoat: he then proposed that we should go to Mr. Baker's shop, where he said we could pawn it for 6s.; I went there, but they would not lend more than 4s. on it: on the 30th, I went to redeem some articles, and Mr. Baker asked if I had a waistcoat of that pattern; I said I had - the prosecutor then came to me and said, it would be a serions piece of business if I did not return the waistcoat; I redeemed it, and then said I would go and find the man; he said be would be glad if I would go to his shop, which I did, and I was there an hour before the officer came: in September last I was down in the North, and bought a number of clothes of a Jew, which I pawned, as they were articles which would not sell in London, and that accounts for my having so many duplicates; I would have found the man, if the prosecutor would have gone with me; he is a Jew salesman, and it is my firm belief that he is acquainted with him; I pawned the waistcoat between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; it was two when I was at the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Griffin and Hillhouse. I took the parcel, and gave it to a man to put into the warehouse; I saw it there between ten and twelve o'clock the next morning - I did not miss it that day, but on the 24th, when I went into the warehouse, it was gone; I know Welch very well, and on the 23d he came there with ten casks of tallow in his waggon - he was in the employ of Mr. Bryan; the tallow was put into a warehouse nearer the street than where this parcel was; and, as the waggon stood, no person could get into the warehouse where the parcel was, unless they came under the shaft horse's head, as the waggon was drawn right across the door; Welch was there fifteen or twenty minutes, while they were striking the waggon - Welch had been there twice the week before, and many other times; I thought he was rather quick in getting his waggon out - the door of that warehouse is generally shut close; we are not in the habit of locking it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there? A. Yes; I was at the tail of the waggon - we unloaded it as quick as we could; when it drove off I was gone to put up the last cask of tallow: I cannot say where Welch was - I did not see him going away; the warehouse was between where the books were and the street: a person must pass the warehouse I was in to get to that one - I cannot tell whether it was open; we had been putting goods in there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. One warehouse is not within the other? A. No. I should think the parcel of books weighed half a cwt.; there were several other persons about, outside the gate - I cannot say who was inside.</p>

             KAINES. I am a bookseller, and live in the New-road, St. George's in the East. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 23d of December, Welch came to my house - I was at the parlour-door, inside my shop, and there were some persons in the shop; Welch called me to the door, and said, "I have a parcel of books belonging to a young man, a friend of mine, if you like to buy them;" I asked where they were - he said in his waggon - I said I could not buy them without looking at them, and he said if I would go with him I should see them; as we were going along to Princes-square, where the waggon was, I asked him if it was all right, as it was not proper to go and buy books in a waggon in the street; he said Yes, they were all right, or he would not have come to me - when we got to the waggon I found Turner; Welch called him by some name, and said, "Jump up and show Mr. Kaines those books:" Turner got up at the hind part of the waggon, and showed me one book, which was Goldsmith - it was a little way in the waggon, and covered with the till; I asked if they were all like that - Welch said he did not know that they were; I said that was not a proper place to look at them, and I should like to see them at my own house - Welch then said, "Take them round to Mr. Kaines;" Turner took them on his shoulder, and brought them to my house - they opened the parcel, took out the books carelessly, and seemed very much flurried, which excited my suspicion; Welch seemed in a hurry to get his horses home, and I said, "You had better put your horses up and come again;" they went away, and returned in about twenty minutes - in the interval I examined the parcel; I found these books and maps with this invoice, and the direction- I sent to Lambeth-street, but the officer had not come; when the prisoners returned I told them I had not had time to look over the books, and they had better come again in half an hour - they went away, and I gave the watchman directions to watch outside; they came again, and I gave charge of them on suspicion - I asked them if they came honestly by them, as I did not think they had, and Welch said by G-d they did; Welch also said I might as well have told him they were not all right, and avoided bringing him into trouble - it was as near seven o'clock as possible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Welch exclaim by G-d, in a way of surprise? A. No, but that they were his own property; I knew Welch before, by his driving and passing by me, for Mr. Bryan - I had spoken to him; Welch said at the watch-house that Turner was to give him a shilling for carrying them.</p>

            . I am a watchmen. I was sent for, and took the prisoners - Mr. Kaines took the parcel to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN CARTWRIGHT. These books were delivered to me by Mr. Kaines, and I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Welch say he had been employed to take them for sale? A. Yes - I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150018"/>him claim them as his own; I asked Turner how he came by them - he said he picked them up on the wharf; he told the Magistrate so too: Welch did not say that he had received them from Turner, but that he was employed to carry them - Turner said Welch knew nothing about them, that he was as innocent as I was. The direction was on the parcel, "Mr. Bartlett, Plymouth."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WELCH'S Defence. I suppose I was not ten minutes unloading - I do not know that I ever got unloaded quicker. Turner tapped me on the shoulder on London-bridge, and said he had a parcel on the tail of a waggon, which was not very heavy, and asked where I was going; I said to Ratcliff-highway - he put the parcel into the waggon, and went on behind; when I got to my stable, I said,"You must take them out here, and give me the shilling;" he said, "I cannot till I have sold them," and he asked where he could sell them; I knew Mr. Kaines, and went to him - I said, "Here's a young man got some books to sell, perhaps they will suit you;" he went to the man, but Mr. Kaines kept speaking to me - he never said a word to him at all; I said, "They do not belong to me - I know nothing at all about them, and he appears quite ignorant;" Mr. Kaines said, "Come again in half an hour;" I went and put up my horses - Turner came into the yard, called me out, and said, "If you will go with me to the bookseller, perhaps he will give me more for them," and I did go with him.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did he say that Turner was the owner? A. He said they were a young man's, a friend of his; he afterwards spoke of Turner as the person who owned the books: I asked them both how they came by them; Turner made no answer, but Welch said they were honestly come by - Turner had an apron on: my house is about a hundred yards out of the way from Beal's-wharf to Mr. Bryan's; I did not see the direction on the parcel in the waggon - there was a cloth over it.</p>
               <p>TURNER'S Defence. Welch knew no more what was in the waggon than any gentleman of the Jury; I asked him, as a favor, if he knew of a bookseller, and he said he did.</p>

Yes - I have not been able to find Dunlock since; Mr. Dunlock was in my shop three or four times - he had dealt with me for harness, and owes me about 43l.; the prisoner and a man brought a horse to the door at the time he borrowed the saddle - it was not borrowed on his master's account; I did not give it to him on condition that be was to pay 4l. if it were liked - I never said to any body that I told him the price of it was to be 4l., if it were liked; the price I asked for it was 3l. 15s. - I have seen

               <p>SAMUEL BEAZLEY. I was in the employ of Mr. Dunlock; I do not know what he was - he appeared to me like a gentleman, but he is gone I do not know where. The prisoner went to the prosecutor, and got the saddle, but whether he bought it or borrowed it I do not know; I had a horse at the door at the time - the prisoner and the prosecutor came out together; the saddle was put on the horse, and Mr. Langdon girted it on - three or four days after Mr. Langdon called, and asked me where the groom was; I said I believed he was gone round to my master - he then said, "Where is the saddle?" I said, "I know nothing about it - I believe the groom has lent it;" "Oh,(said he) I told him the price of the addle, but he did not say exactly he would have it then;" I am sure he said that, and he said the prisoner called two days after, and said he would have it; Mr. Langdon said, "It does not belong to me - it belongs to a gentleman I have got it to sell for, and the gentleman has altered his mind, and he must have it back."

On the evening of the 10th of December a young woman came and told us a cloak had been taken from the door; I went out, and found it on the prisoner, who was walking along Windmill-street, about a quarter of a mile off - it might be an hour after I had noticed it in the shop; I asked him to let me see what he had got in his handkerchief - he said Yes: I said, "Come to the light," and he ran away; I pursued, and took him.</p>

               <p>ELLEN WEBSTER. I was near the shop, and saw the cloak taken from the door, about six o'clock; the person pulled it down as he went by - I cannot say who it was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Castle-street, and saw two men turn out of Friendly-place, one of whom dropped a bundle; I took it up - two young men came and asked what I had got: the witness then came up, and through fear I did run away, but I stopped when I had got about twenty yards.</p>

               <p>SOPHIA BURNHAM. I live with the prosecutor. The prisoner came one morning about four or five months ago, and asked if Mr. Joseph Shick was at home; I told him No. - he said he came after a pair of boots that were to be stretched - I went up stairs, and asked my young mistress - she told me to give them to him; I gave them to him to be stretched: I had never seen him before, but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDREWS. I took the prisoner on another charge I found nothing on him relative to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Islington, and met the prosecutor; he asked me to go and take a glass - we went to a public-house: he there said he had got a pair of boots at his house which wanted stretching, that he was going out the following Sunday, and was afraid of being hurt with them; I went and got them stretched, and was returning - I went into the Blue Coat Boy public-house, and there was a large party at skittles; I laid down the boots, took off my coat, and laid it down over them - when I came to put it on, the boots were gone.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SHICK. I never gave him authority to go and take them; it was mentioned that they wanted some alteration, and my sister thought I had sent him for them.</p>

               <p>MR. FALKARD. I am a pawnbroker. This mantle and handkerchief were pawned with me - I am certain the prisoner pawned the mantle on the 10th; I am not quite so sure she pawned the handkerchief - that was on the 15th; I gave these duplicates for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did the person come to you? A. I think in the afternoon - I cannot swear to the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

On Friday, the 26th of December, I left my daughter in my room, about nine o'clock in the morning, and went out - I returned about five in the evening, and found the room broken open; my box was broken open - the room door was not injured; I had left there two coats, a pair of shoes, and two razors in a case- I gave them to my daughter to put into the box; I found the lock of the box broken, and these things gone- I had left the box sound; the officer has the things in his possession - I found him in the room with the articles; I am certain they are mine - I swore to them at Worship-street Office; I missed a sixpence from the corner of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150021"/>box - it was silver, but so thin as not to be passable; I shall know it again - I saw it before the Magistrate; I went there on the Wednesday - a cupboard in my room was broken open, by the top of the door being broken; I heard a noise in the court when I came home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. He is a neighbour's child; I support my daughter myself - I have not many visitors; I know one Hooper - he might be acquainted with my daughter, but not in my place; I would not permit it - I do not know where Hooper is; the value of all the articles is 14s. - all the rooms in the house are let out in separate apartments; there are two other lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how often Hooper has been tried here? A. No.</p>
               <p>JANE MULLINS. I am going on for seventeen years old, and am the prosecutor's daughter; I lived with him at No. 28, Cock-alley - he left me in the house on the 26th of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I remained at home about an hour, and then went out - I am quite sure I locked the door; I was gone about half an hour - on returning I found the door locked as I had left it; I unlocked it, and came into the room - I found no difficulty in unlocking it; I heard a noise under the bed, and saw the top of the cupboard-door had been broken inside; the cupboard is in the corner of the room, and one end of it comes into the staircase, and there is a little board like a window in the partition - he had broken through this piece of board to get in; the board was nailed like a window that opened into the cupboard, and then the top of the cupboard-door was broken - it could not be unbolted, because there was a bureau bedstead against it, but it was broken away sufficient for the body of a person to come through; a box, which I had left on the bureau, had been taken down and put on the chair - it was not locked; I had left some clothes in it, but not my father's clothes in that box - there was another box under it on the bureau and that had been broken open; the lock was broken quite off, and two coats taken out which I had put there in the morning - I saw them on the bed, also a pair of shoes, and a sixpence; the two coats were on the bed - I did not see them on the bed when I came into the room at first, but I did afterwards; I saw the prisoner searched, and the sixpence found on him, but before that I had given an alarm to the neighbours - I locked the door and went out; I had not seen the prisoner in the room then - I went over to Beavis the constable, and gave an alarm, and he came back with me; I then found the prisoner sitting on the chair - the constable searched him, and found a sixpence, a bad sixpence and 4d. on him; I had locked Mrs. Betty in the room when I went out to fetch the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you there when the clothes were found? A. I saw them on the bed; I knew the prisoner as a neighbour's child - he used to come to my father's, but had not been there that morning while I was there; a Mrs. Farrow, who my father knows, had come up - I locked the door when I went out, and left nobody in the room; nobody else had been there - I am not acquainted with Hooper; I know him - he had not been there that morning, nor had I seen him.</p>
               <p>MARY BETTY. I live opposite to Mullins; she gave me an alarm out of window, and I went up to her room - I heard nothing, but she said somebody was under the bed; I then looked and saw the prisoner under the bed - he came out; she then locked me and the prisoner in the room while she went for the constable - she returned in about ten minutes with an officer, who took him; I saw him searched, and two bad sixpences found on him, and while Beavis was looking to see if there were any more property on the bed he ran away - the officer ran after him and stopped him, and then he was secured.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BEAVIS. I am a headborough of Norton Falgate. In consequence of the alarm I went to the prosecutor's room, about one o'clock in the day, with Mullins, and saw the prisoner - I found in his waistcoat pocket a sixpence, mutilated; she said it was her father's -I was looking about the room, and he made his escape down stairs; I ran down, and look him - I returned to the room, and found two coats on the bed - some person handed me a pair of shoes and a razor-case, which they found under the bed; I found an old chisel on the floor.</p>
               <p>JANE MULLINS. These are the two coats, which I locked in the box, and these shoes - they are my father's; these are the razors and case which were in the box which was not locked, and were taken out of there - this is the sixpence; there are only three rooms in the house, one above another - the landlord does not live in the house.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MULLINS I know these coats to be mine, the shoes, the razors, and the sixpence - the chisel does not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the 4th of October last, the prisoner, and a man named Samuel Lee, came to my house - two neighbours brought them into my yard, and asked me if I had any pigs to part with; I agreed to sell them seven pigs for 16l. 12s. 6d. - they were to be paid for and delivered the same day; I was to receive the money, when they were delivered, at White's place, in Leather-lane, Holborn - the prisoner and Lee agreed to pay for them on delivery in Leather-lane; I, and my boy took them in a cart the same day - we put them up a gateway just below White's door - I left the boy with the cart, to take care of them, while I went to receive the money; I saw both White and Lee in the house - it was a very wet day; I sat down some time, and had some refreshment - some time passed, and Lee went out with White's son; we had some bread and cheese and porter - Lee went out, with White's son; my boy, Mack, came to me, and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that Lee had told him the pigs were settled for - they had not offered me a farthing in payment; I stopped there till Lee came in, which was in about half an hour - he did not say what had become of the pigs; Lee said, in the prisoner's presence, "I have got nothing but a 50l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150022"/>cheque (putting his hand into his left-hand pocket), if you can give me change?" White went over to the public-house to see if he could get change, as he said, but he did not take it with him - Lee did not give it to him; he came in again, and said he could not get change; White sat down and said, "We must draw up a bill," and sent his eldest daughter out for a stamp, and drew out the bill: I did not at that time know the pigs were gone - my only reason for selling the pigs was to settle with my landlord for my quarter's rent; I told him so, that money I must have, and I could not go out of the house without it.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when your boy came in, he did not tell you the pigs were gone? A. No, not till after the bill was drawn; the officer has got it - this is it (looking at it); White wrote it - Lee could not write, but put his mark to it, and made me put my mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you received that bill. tell us what took place? A. My only object was to receive the money for my rent; I objected to take the note, for I wanted money, but at last took it, as I thought I had better take it, as I could get no money; I was to have been paid by one o'clock on Monday - I did not know the pigs were gone till Lee came in and began talking about payment; I then knew they were gone - the bill was not paid; I have not received a farthing: the pigs were worth what I sold them for; after I knew they were gone Lee gave me a sovereign as a deposit, and said that was all he had - I could not see the cart the pigs were in, in the room I sat; it was just beyond the gateway - Lee left the prisoner in the room when he went out; he was talking to me about one thing or another - I was not willing to part with my pigs without ready money, for they were my whole dependence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known Lee? A. I never saw either of them before - the bargain was made openly in my yard; I have seen Lee since: I never supped with him off a fowl in my life- Lee and White are partners; the cart was mine - Lee lent me the horse to bring the pigs up; White's son came the same night, and fetched the horse home; I knew the pigs were gone when I took the deposit and the note, because I had nothing else to take: I took the note, expecting to receive the money; I cannot say whether the note was read over to me - they told me I was to receive my money on Monday at one o'clock: I do not think the note was read; I have not employed Lee since to buy me some pigs at Romford-market: when the note became due I went to their house. and saw them both in White's house, where the bill was drawn - I went there full twenty times after it was due, and saw them sometimes; they had not got the money to pay me - I saw White in Smithfield-market acting as a pig-jobber, and asked if he meant to pay me; he said he could not stop, but would meet me at a public-house; I staid there two hours, but he never came: he moved from his house, and was taken on another charge on the 26th of December.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I went in the cart with the pigs to White's house; I waited with the cart while mistress went into the house: I was about half a dozen yards from the door - I staid there about half an hour; Lee and the prisoner's son came out; be gave me a drop of beer and a bit of biscuit, and then went in doors again - he came out again in about half an hour, and told me the pigs were settled for; he took the horse and cart away with the pigs: I went into mistress and told her the pigs were gone - I sat down and had a drop of beer before I told her, for I thought she knew it; I told her in the prisoner's presence what Lee had said - the prisoner said nothing to that; I staid there till Lee returned, which was about an hour; the prisoner was present - he told mistress he had no money for her, except she could give him change for a 50l. cheque; she said she could not, she had not got a farthing in her pocket - White then said he must draw up a bill; he sent his daughter out for a stamp, and drew the bill; mistress said a bill was of no use to her without the money - she came away with the bill after a bit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who gave the bill to your mistress? A.White - Lee signed it; she took it after I had told her the pigs were gone, as she found she could get nothing else; they brought the cart and horse home the same night, and the horse was taken away: the bill was not read at all; mistress did not ask to have it read - she has sent me four or five times since to see White; I sometimes saw them, and sometimes nobody; mistress has not had a pig since.</p>
               <p>The bill being read, was drawn at four days after date, and signed

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to SARAH COLWIN. Q. Did you not agree to go to Romford with Lee, to buy some pigs? A. No, I had some porter with Lee at a public-house the day the pigs were agreed for; it was before they were taken away- they endeavoured to buy them on the Wednesday, but on Saturday I took them home; I met Lee in Smithfield one day and asked him for the money - I never met him by appointment at Lambeth-marsh.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL WATSON. JUN. I am nephew of Mr. Watson and live with him. On the night of the 16th of November the cabinet of curiosities was safe - the China ornaments were on the mantel-piece; I went out early in the morning and, on returning, I heard here had been thieves in the house - I tried the door on the landing-place about twelve o'clock, and it was fastened inside; I went to the top of the house, and made a rope fast, then got out of the kitchenwindow: Kinchlea came and got up the bow-window, over the water - he ascended by the rope, got in at the window and opened the door on the landing; I went into the room and found it in a very disordered state - some things had been packed up in one of the chair-covers, and several were gone; there were dry and footmarks of more than one person having been there - the ornaments were gone from the mantel-piece, and a variety of other things, which we have not found; a great many things were taken out and put into a chair-cover - the China box was gone from the mantel-piece, and the pasteboard ornaments; the sterling value of all the property lost was about 7l. - I gave information at the public-office, but could find nothing out. On the day after Christmas-day, I was dining with my uncle, and, in consequence of a communication, he went out - after dinner I went out, and found Brinkley with my uncle; he asked my uncle if he had been robbed, he said he had; Brinkley said he could give him information (a reward had been offered by the parish for the discovery of several robberies) - the prisoner then said he could give him information respecting the property, but as he was then at dinner he would go and get a pint of beer and come when he had done: we finished our dinner and my uncle sent me to tell him he was at liberty - he came and went into the parlour; I was not present then, but on his coming out I was desired to go with him to a neighbour, named Holiday, who had been robbed, and on our way he asked if we had lost any stamps, or a small silver milk-jug, very stout and thick, or a Canary bird; I said No, and asked if he had seen any thing of some Maunday money - he said he had, and that all the things had passed though his hands: while we were waiting for Mr. Holiday, he described several articles they had lost, as well as a table-cover which we had lost - they had lost one, but ours was a blue one; he sat down for a little time, and seemed to be in thought - he said as they were very busy over the waters, he had a great mind to go and unbosom himself at the office below (the Thames Police), and that there was a man in custody at Union-hall -I asked how he supposed they could have got info our premises; he said the usual method was for two or three to go in a boat and row under the premises; one of two would get in at the window, the others row about, and when they had got what they wanted they gave a signal, and the boat rowed underneath and took them away - that the young fellow in custody could climb like a squirrel, and he had no doubt he was one of the men; Mr. Watson came and took him to another person - I saw him again at my uncle's, next day; he wanted him to give him money as he had been the means of giving information - he said he was a poor man with a family, and had lost a great deal of time in trying to find out an owner for the property: my uncle said he had not offered any reward, but (pointing to a bill in the shop) said the parish had; he then said he hoped he would speak a good word for him, as he was the first - he then went away; on the first day he came we received a letter from Union-hall, and my uncle went there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What is the value of all the articles? A.7l. - they are fancy articles.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL WATSON. I live at Wapping. On the morning of the 27th of November I found my summer room had been entered, and missed this property. On the 26th of December Brinkley came and asked if I had been robbed; I said I had lost a pheasant's tail and the chap-sticks, and he mentioned the shells as pearl plates - I believe I asked if he had seen a pair of sugar-tongs; he said Yes, they were marked on the bow - he described several articles which I had lost, and said they had all gone through his hands - that he had been disposing of several things, and a person was in custody in whose house some of the property had been found - that he had called at the Borough Compter that morning, and was acquainted with one of the turnkeys; he said he was a poor man with a family, and hoped I would give him something for his day's work, for he had lost a great deal of time about it; I took him to the summer room and shewed him the mark of a screw-driver, near the lock - he said he knew a tool that would fit that. I found at Union-hall next day, the vases, a small round China box, three shells, the pasteboard ornaments, and the pheasant's tail; I afterwards saw a pair of large shells and the chap-sticks in possession of Willis.</p>
               <p>JOHN GROSSMITH. I am an officer of Union-hall. On the morning of the 23d of December I accompanied Pople to the Minories and apprehended Williams - Brinkley was present and spoke to him; we had been in conversation with Brinkley, and agreed that if he touched his shoe, we were to apprehend Williams - this apprehension was made in consequence of a communication made to us by Brinkley; we went that day to No. 12, Wickham-street, Vauxhall. where Williams lived - he has since told us it was his house, and I have since seen his wife, who was there; he is a waterman and lighterman - I found these two vases and a snuff-box on the mantel-piece in the front room, the phesant's tail in the cupboard, and three shells, the pasteboard ornaments were on the mantel-piece, Brinkley had before that mentioned these articles to us, but never said to whom they belonged - he said nothing to me about the robbery at Mr. Watson's: I recollected an advertisement in the Police Gazette - Mr. Watson was written to from Union-hall, and identified the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Williams was not present at this conversation with Brinkley? A. No - Brinkley never mentioned Mr. Watson's name to me; I saw Williams' wife in the house, and she was in the coach with him to Union-hall - he called her his wife, and spoke about his children; I never took him to the house.</p>

               <p>CHARLES THOROWGOOD. I am an officer of the City. I was on duty in Cornhill, and saw the prisoner, in company with another person, following a gentleman into Finch-lane, which induced me to watch them; they returned from that gentleman - I still watched them, and observed Mr. Tabor walking arm-in-arm with a gentleman in Cornhill, and at the corner of Bishopsgate-street there was a stoppage with the carriages; I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Tabor's pocket, and take out this handkerchief - I took hold of him: he turned round, and dropped it at his feet - I said, "What have you got here?" he said he knew nothing about it; his companion ran away.</p>

On the 17th of December, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I was engaged in the front of my shop with a gentleman; the two prisoners came in together, and said they wanted a pair of shoes - I told them to go into the parlour; my boy went back with them, and in a few minutes he gave me information - I went into the parlour, and asked the prisoners if they could not find what they wanted - Brown said No, they would be measured for a pair; I left the lad to measure her, and returned to the gentleman - there were a quantity of shoes packed up in the parlour, two pairs in each parcel; they came into the shop, and Brown sat in a chair - Cannon hurried her to go away - they then left the shop, and before they had well got off the steps the female witness came and gave me information;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150025"/>I followed them to the door of the next house, opened Cannon's cloak, and said, "Give me those shoes which you have got;" she said, "Well, here, take them," and delivered them to me - they dropped on the ground; I knew them to be one of the papers of shoes which were in the parlour - two pairs were in it: Cannon resisted violently; I held her till my boy came - I gave her in charge, and then went to Brown; I found another paper on her, containing two pairs - she said she had picked them up; it was perfectly clean, and it was a very dirty day - I am certain it was one of the papers of shoes which were in my parlour; Cannon bit me, and fought desperately.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Your attention was directed to the gentleman? A. Yes, but I am certain of both the prisoners; Cannon was quite sober - I never expressed a doubt about her: a great crowd collected, but I did not observe any women except the prisoners.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Scott. The prisoners came into the shop; I went into the parlour to attend them - I cannot swear positively to Brown; I have no doubt of Cannon: they both went into the parlour, and Cannon asked for a pair of shoes; there were plenty about, but none suited her - no other women came into the parlour; the other person who came with Cannon desired to be measured - before I had half done measuring her she wanted to hurry out of the shop, and said they would call to-morrow; they would hardly give me time to write the name on the measure: we received information - my master went out - I saw him take two pairs of shoes from under Cannon's arm, at the next door; that parcel had been papered up in the shop: she was very resolute, and fought- I held her while the officer was fetched; Brown was about a yard from her: there were only these two close together - I should not think she could be any other person than the woman who had been in the shop; a paper, containing two pairs of shoes, was taken from her - she went quietly, but we were obliged to carry Cannon to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You have some doubt of Brown? A.Very little; she had the shoes, and she very much resembles the person in the shop - they were both walking close together; my master got out first, and I was not a minute after him - there was nobody else near when we got first out; Cannon was quite sober.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was any other woman besides Brown within twenty yards of Cannon? A. We heard a person was waiting outside for them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Scott. I saw the two prisoners in the shop when the shoes were stolen; I am quite certain of them both: they both went into the parlour, and sat down on two chairs - before Burgess went into the room Brown said she wanted a pair of shoes; he then went into the shop, and got a pair to fit her- Brown went into the shop, and was fitted there with a pair, but did not take them; Cannon remained in the parlour the while I went up stairs to the kitchen to fill the kettle, and when I came down I saw Cannon adjusting the shoes under her arm - I informed my master as they were going out; he went out after them directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you a house servant? A. Yes; I did not serve the prisoners - I am certain of Brown- I was in the shop all the time, except when I fetched the water, which took about three minutes; I left the boy with them then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was Cannon alone in the parlour? A. No, Mr. Scott's sister was there; the boy was in the shop, looking for shoes for Brown.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM COLEY. I am a street-keeper. I was coming up Holborn, and saw Mr. Scott run across the way - I ran with him, and took Cannon, who made a very violent resistance; she was within one door of Mr. Scott's house: while I was endeavouring to take her I saw Holland, who took Brown - I saw him take this pair of shoes, in a paper, from under Brown's arm; the shoes were given to me as soon as I came up, and stated to have been taken from Cannon; I saw no other female near them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You ran across the way with Scott? A. Yes - he had run over for assistance, and I went with him; it was opposite St. Andrew's church -Scott's young man was holding one of them; Holland came up with Brown in less than a minute and a half.</p>

            . I am a drover. On Sunday night, the 21st of December, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Smithfield; I was at work in the pens among the sheep, close by where the guard, and the man he was following, ran - he was pursuing only one man; I had seen nobody running before - I saw him following a man in a smock-frock; he came down close by the side of the gas-light, and jumped over the pales - no one was following the guard; the man got some distance before the guard got over the pales - it was a very moon-light night; I looked forward, and the man was gone - the guard must have lost sight of him; the prisoner is not that man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far was the guard from the man in the smock-frock? A. The length of two pens; I am sure there was but one man, and he had a dirty smock-frock on - my attention was drawn by the man in the smock-frock calling Stop thief! and jumping over the pens; I never saw him before - I did not go after him nor try to take him; I was busy among the sheep, and could not get out of them - the man had got nothing; I did not point him out - I did not see him afterwards; the guard was as close to him as I was, and could see him - there was no other person running than the one in a smock-frock, who the guard was pursuing; I will swear that (not that I saw) I saw no other; and swear he was following no other; the prisoner was stopped nearly a quarter of a mile off; I was close against Cloth-fair, and he was stopped by Mr. Blacket's - I was two or three hundred yards from the Fortune of War public-house - I did not see the prisoner after he was stopped; I never saw him till to-night.</p>
               <p>Q.How then did you know he was the man they took? A. I heard Gardner, the officer, say they had stopped a man for stealing a coat off a coach - I did not go to see the prisoner, but I can swear he is not the man the guard was following; the man went through the bullock-pens, then through the sheep-pens again - the guard passed me; I did not speak to him - the man must have lain down in the pens while the guard passed, for I did not see him till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the guard that was the man? A. The guard was a long way off - when he jumped over the pens he had gone by.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found you out to tell this story? A. Mr. Gardner was talking about having a man; I said, "If you have a man of that description, it is the wrong man, for he had a smock-frock on;" Gardner applied to me to come here -I have known him some time; he is an officer in the market- I never saw the transaction till the guard followed the man down the pens; I never saw the prisoner till to-night, and have no interest in this affair - I am in the service of Mr. Coleman, a drover; Gardner subpoenaed me to come here on Monday last.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH COLEMAN. I am a Smithfield drover - Painter has been in my brother's employ about twelve months; I was with him in the pens about half-past nine o'clock on this night, but not quite close to him (I have been in my brother's service for seventeen years - he lives at Holloway) -I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw two people running; I do not think the prisoner was either of them - I never saw him before to-night, to my knowledge; the person I saw running before the guard, had a smock-frock on - I cannot say whether the prosecutor is the person in pursuit; it was a tallish man - I am certain the man pursued, had a smockfrock on, when I saw him go by the gas-light - he went by where Painter was putting up some sheep; I saw nobody else running, not to know them - I was busy among the sheep, and did not join in the pursuit: I do not believe the prisoner to be the man - I have no interest in saying so.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw the man before who was running in a smock-frock? A. No, I was not close enough to see his face - I can only tell he is not the man, by his dress, and he appeared a very short man; I heard a cry of Stop thief! but never saw the man after he went round the pens; the guard kept following him, and was closer to him than I was.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he had a better opportunity of seeing whether he had a smock-frock on? A. I am certain he had one on- just as he passed me I heard the cry; I looked round, and saw two persons running, and one had a smock-frock on - I did not point him out; the guard was only pursuing one man - where he went to I do not know; he ran down the alley, and jumped over the pens at the bottom - the guard might be fifteen or twenty yards from him then, and must have seen him jump over; I did not appear before the Magistrate - I did not know a man was taken till Gardner told me of it a fortnight after: I heard no other cry of Stop thief! and did not hear of a lady having been robbed at the same place that night - Gardner served me with a subpoena to come here.</p>
               <p>- GARDNER. I am a Police officer. I served these witnesses with a subpoena last Monday: I never saw the prisoner in my life till the night he was taken, when I saw him in the watch-house; I had been out that afternoon, and as a party had tried to rob another coach, I went to look for them, and soon after that a lady was robbed - I was rather too late for that; I went into the King's Head public-house, sat down, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and tried to stop the person - a hurdle laid in my way; I stambled over it, and a person took the prisoner before I could get up - I returned to the King's Head, and who should be there but Painter; he said, "Well, have you got the prisoner?" I said Yes - he said, "For stealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150027"/>the coat?" I said, "I don't know what it is for;" he said,"Well, I believe you have got the wrong person, for I was in the pens, and a person came running by me in a smockfrock, and a person pursuing him;" I then went to the watch-house, and said I believed they had got an innocent man - that I understood what was lost was a drab great coat, with two or three capes, and a certain party hid it in the sheep-pens, and some time after the guard was gone by, one of the party came and took it out of the pens, and ran up Cloth-fair; I stated what I had heard of the coat before I saw the guard, and when I saw him, he described it, and it answered the description - I went in pursuit of the party, who I knew, and one of whom has since been taken for felony, but is not committed - it was for stealing a handkerchief last Friday: I never saw the prisoner till he was in the watch-house - I have heard Painter's and Coleman's evidence; Painter told me the same he has stated here -Buckland, the attorney, applied to me, or I should not have been here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then you know nothing about the actual fact? A. No; I did not go to the pens to look for the coat, because I was informed the party had taken it away before I heard of it, and I went to a certain house - the man's name was Mike Reid, a very bad character, a cad in Smithfield; I did not look after the coat for I was informed it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.And you do your duty as an officer, when you are told property is moved, not to go and see if it be so? A. I followed the party who I was told had carried it away; I went to the prosecutor, and asked him to point out the way the thief had run, and he pointed out the same tract as Painter told me he had run; the place it was said to be hid in, was about one hundred yards from the public-house, but I followed the party to a house, and if I had gone to look for the coat I might have got there too late - I found a party at the house, and they were all in a flurry, but they had nothing; I have been an officer twelve months - Mr. Buckland came and asked if I would serve Painter and Coleman with subpoena's; I said I would, as I knew the public-house they frequented - I did not appear before the Magistrate next day; I was busy in the market, and was up till half-past twelve o'clock that night - I knew nothing of the transaction; I am a City officer appointed by the Lord Mayor; the description given to me answers the description of Mike Reid, who I knew before - I was told the party had just gone off with the coat, and went to look for him; Reid has been in custody since, but I did not know it till he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>HENRY HORTON. I did not see Painter or Coleman that night, not to notice them - my object was the prisoner; I followed him till he was taken, and never lost sight of him - I saw nobody dressed in a smock-frock; the man I pursued was not dressed in a smock-frock.</p>

             and Co. keep it. On the 30th of December, between one and two o'clock, I received a parcel, directed "Messrs. Jervis and Co., Hinkley, Leicestershire," and booked it; it was given to the porter to take to the coach - the prisoner was a stranger in the yard; I was fetched from the office into the yard about five or ten minutes after I had given Thurlow the parcels; I saw the prisoner standing by the Hinkley coach-door, and the guard holding him - he charged him with abstracting this parcel from the coach; he said he was only standing by there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On which side of the coach was I standing? A.On the near-side, the left side; I was coming across the yard when I saw you - you were standing by the near fore-wheel of the coach.</p>
               <p>JOHN THURLOW. I am a porter at the inn; I convey the packages from the booking-office to the different coaches. On the 30th of December I took this parcel out of the office, and put it at the bottom of the coach with others: I put it at the bottom of the coach - I put the off-side door too; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, was on the near-side of the coach - I put the off-side door too; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, was on the near-side when I saw him; I did not see the near-side door open then - I told the guard I had better begin to load the fore-boot; I got up on the box to do so; I had not observed the prisoner then - I put the luggage into the boot as the guard gave it up to me, and I heard the guard call out to the prisoner,"What business have you there?" I did not hear him give an answer; the guard jumped over the pole, and said, "You have got a parcel under your arm" - I did not see it under his arm myself; the guard brought the parcel from the near-side of the coach to shew it to me -I could not see where he took it from; the prisoner stood at the side of the coach: I am certain I had put the parcels at the bottom on the off-side, and closed the door; I put it down at the bottom, not under the seat - this was a quarter of an hour before the coach would set off; the guard and the prisoner walked across the yard to the book-keeper - the guard had not laid hold of him; the book-keeper came out - the prisoner had a large bag on his shoulder when I saw him by the side of the coach; it appeared to be empty: he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How many parcels did you put into the coach? A. About seven or eight; I did not count them - I put this one on the top of the others at the bottom of the coach, where the people's feet go; I put them there for the guard to sort them.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN COOK. I am guard of the coach. The prisoner was a stranger to me, and a stranger at the yard; I observed him against the pole of the near-side door of the coach - the door was then open; there was no other person near that I could observe: I asked what he was doing there - he said nothing at all; he had a bag over his shoulder - he did not appear to have any thing in it: after.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150028"/>I spoke to him I observed this parcel under his left arm -I asked what he did with it; he went to the coach-door, and threw it into the coach - I did not know what it contained; I am sure I took the same parcel from the coach - this is the cover of it; it is directed "Messrs. Jarvis and Power, solicitors, Hinkley, Leicestershire" - I sent to the book-keeper to come out, and told him he had taken a parcel; he said he could take his solemn oath he had never meddled with it: an officer was sent for, and he was taken - he did not tell me what brought him into the yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you see me take it out of the coach? A. No - I might be three-quarters of a yard or a yard from the near fore-wheel; when I saw you, you were just opposite the door, as it stood open.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had a parcel under my arm, what occasion had you to ask what I did at the coach? A. I did not perceive the parcel under your arm till I spoke to you - you had the bag over your arm, and the bag did not quite cover it; it did not cover any part of it: there were seven or eight parcels in the coach; I did not say at Guildhall there might be nine or ten.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner for stealing a parcel from the coach; he denied having taken it: I asked what brought him into the yard - he said he had no business there, curiosity brought him there, merely to see the coaches load; seeing that he had a black bag, I asked what he dealt in - he said he was a dealer in old clothes: I found 1s. 3d. on him - there was nothing in the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Does it seem feasible, that if I wanted to steal the parcel I should take the smallest, when I could have taken others much more handy, and from the shape it is evident it could be of no value.</p>

            . On the 17th of December I was looking out of my window, opposite the prosecutor's shop- I saw the prisoner, in company with a young man, walking backwards and forwards, looking into the shop; it took my attention: I then saw the prisoner go into the shop - he had an apron on; I saw him take something from the shop counter; when he came out he had something in his apron: I ran down stairs, and informed the officer - when the prisoner came out he began to walk very fast; I saw the officer go and take him - I am sure he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where were you? A. Up stairs; our window is much lower than Mr. Hodge's - his shop goes up three or four steps; I only lost sight of him while I came down stairs - it was not five minutes from the time he went into the shop till he was taken back; the officer lives nearly opposite: I did not lose sight of him while I called the officer, as he stood at his door - when he was taken he was untying his apron; it was dropping from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where did the prisoner come from to your master's service? A. I have heard him say that he lived with Mr. Fletcher many years - I have told him not to take money out of the till to repay himself for what he lent me; I did owe him half a crown, but that was a private account - I borrowed it on a Sunday; I have borrowed on several occasions - sometimes for the till, when I was short; I did not tell him what this half-crown was borrowed for - it was to come up to London: I had forgotten to pay him - I sent it after him by Jones, and I believe he refused it at first; I did not inform my master that I borrowed money from him - it is very usual to borrow if we are short of silver; I told him it was for the till.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have I not given money for oil of a morning, and taken it out of the till afterwards? A. Yes, when you have told me of it.</p>

I apprehended Hall, and, in consequence of what he said, I went to Chamberlain's about the 16th of December; I found him at his master's, a cheesemonger, in High-street, St. Giles' - I asked if he knew a person named Hall; he said he did not - I asked him again, and he again denied it; I asked if he meant to say that Hall had not been with him on the Sunday - he said he had not; I then said, "I am an officer, I give you time to consider, and then give your answer; do you mean to say you do not know a person named Hall?" he said, "I do not;" I then said, "I know that is untrue, I know you do" - after some hesitation, he said he knew a little boy named Hall; I said, "The person I mean is taller than yourself - did the person you speak of, give you any thing on Sunday?" he said, "He did not;" I said I knew more than he was aware of, and I was aware he had given him something: after some hesitation, he said he had some bits of carpet - he had asked him for some bits to cover a stool; I asked if he knew who Hall lived with, and what his master was; he said he knew that he lived with a carpet-manufacturer, and he had told him the cuttings were of no use, and his master cut them up, or sold them to Jews - I went with him to a house in Vinegar-yard, where he opened a drawer, and there were these carpets rolled up - he said Hall had been there on the Sunday, and dined with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.When you went and asked the question about Hall, did you not say "Little Hall?" A. No - I do not know a person named Hall in the employ of the prisoner's master - I do not know of any other Hall.</p>
               <p>ALFRED KING. I saw the prisoner and Hall at the Police office; Chamberlain said there, that he had seen Hall some days previous to the Sunday.</p>
               <p>JAMES REVLEY. I am in partnership with Mr. Alfred Lapworth - Hall was in our employ for about six weeks; this pattern of carpet is made for us particularly, and no one else - we sell it at 8s. a yard; this other I believe is ours.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are these remnants? A. This one is a remnant, but the other piece (if it is ours) is cut off a whole piece - I cannot swear positively to that; we never dispose of remnants to Jews, or in any other way, because they would come in in rooms, as well as if they were a whole width.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you ever permit your servants to sell any thing? A. No; there is a specific in junction that they shall not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer told me he was an officer, and I was frightened - he said, "Recollect yourself" I said, "Do you mean Hall that works for my master?" he said No; he said, "Recollect yourself," and I then said"I do," he was at my house on Sunday, and gave me two bits of carpet, and I will go and fetch them;" I met Hall, who I had not seen for two years before - he asked me to give him something to drink; I said I could not as I was going on an crrand - we parted, and on coming back, he saw me loading a cart at my master's door; he said"Jem, where do you live?" I said in Vinegar-yard - he said "I will call;" he called, and saw a stool with three legs, he said, "I have a bit of carpet at home, I will give you to cover this stool," and he brought one of the bits - he then said, "I have got another bit at home, for when we take out carpets, these are what we take out, and they are our perquisites:" on the Sunday fortnight he brought it, and threw it down, and said, "There, Jem, it is no use to me, it is my perquisite;" I said, "I thank you, I hope I shall get into no trouble about this" - he said, "Oh! no, it is perquisites;" I said, I would not have it, if I knew he came by it dishonestly - he went to market with me and my wife, and got a bit of meat for dinner; he went for a pot of beer, and I sent for a pot of porter.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at his lodgings, and found some duplicates there - here is one of a hearth-rug which had been pawned in Mary-le-bone-street; I found another hearth-rug at Mr. Burchett's; the prisoner (without my making him any promise or threat, as Hall and Chamberlain were going from the room) called me to him, and said "Here, here, what a bl-d rascal that Hall is:" I went after him, and he again said "What a bl-d rascal that Hall is;" and said he saw Hall cut the carpet off the length, and bring it out - he then said that Hall had given him the rugs to pawn - that Hall had most of the money, except 18d., I think it was to redeem a waistcoat; he also said that he had given him some drugget, which he had pawned at another place; he said he saw the carpet cut off at Mr. Reyley's shop; in consequence of what he said, I went to Mr. Burchett's, and there I found one rug, and at Mr. Ross's, another, of which this is the duplicate, which I found in the prisoner's wife's hand - she was endeavouring to conceal it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Paddington-street. This rug was pawned with me by the prisoner; I asked if it was his own - he said it was; that he made them on his own account; he asked me, I think, 12s.; I said I would make it 10s.; he said "If you make it 12s., I have two other duplicates which I will redeem," and I did; he pawned it in the name of William Seele - my man wrote the duplicate.</p>
               <p>JAMES MEEDY. I am shopman to Mr. Ross, a pawnbroker, of Paddington-street. On the 13th of November the prisoner pawned this rug in the name of David Evans; I asked if it were his own; he said Yes, he dealt in these things, and they were worth from 30s. to 35s. a piece; I lent him 10s. upon it; on the 18th of November, another man came, and had the same rug put in the name of John Williams.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was it 10s. or 12s. I asked for it? A. Ten shillings; I am sure I asked you those questions; I said at the office another person came and paid the interest, and it was so.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Waterhouse, of Lad-lane. I bought these two whips on the 16th of December, of the prisoner, for 1l. 2s. - he gave me this receipt;(read) "One chaise-whip and one hunting ditto 1l. 2s. - paid, T. Wood."</p>
               <p>MR. PALLISER re-examined. Q. How long after did you discover this? A. I had occasion to suspect him, and I had market these goods; I employed Mr. Clarke to buy them; when he rendered his account on the Saturday, I particularly asked him if this was a correct account of all he had sold; he said it was; it was his duty to account to me every Saturday night; he ought to have entered there 22s.: if I had been in the shop I should have sold them for 24s., which was what he asked for them; I am sure he said, and in the presence of my clerk, that the account was all correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you pay for them? A. I do not like to tell that; I should not have sold them for less than 24s., and then I should have got about fifty per cent; he came into my service form Window Grice: there had been no disagreement between him and me about working over-hours; there is a custom among our men not to work by candle-light for twelve nights before Christmas, but it had not come to that time; there were no mistake about any collars.</p>

On the 27th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked to look at a pair of ear-rings; I took the tray from the window, and shewed them to her; after looking at them some time, she said she would call again on Monday: I then missed a pair of ear-rings from the tray which she had been looking at - I said I missed a pair of ear-rings which I was confident were there when she came in; she said she had not got them - she asserted that over and over again; I still stated that I was sure she had got them; she had a pocket-handkerchief in her hand, and I asked her if she would shake that, as probably she had taken them up in a mistake; she shook it, and said "It is not here - it is not here;" and if they had fallen then I must have heard them; she was then shuffling her foot on the ground, and I asked her to move from the counter, as probably they had fallen; she moved a little backwards, and as she moved she scraped her foot again, and got these ear-rings to the step of the door, which was not far from where she stood; she then stooped, snatched them up, and ran away; I got from behind the counter, and gave an alarm - she ran to Castle-street, which is about thirty or forty yards off, and there she was taken; I ran after her as fast as I could, and was not far from her when she was taken: I have never seen the ear-rings since, but I am positive and certain that I saw her take them from the ground, and run away with them.</p>

On the 1st of January, I fell in with the two prisoners, in Wapping-street, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, in company - Donald was carrying this box; I asked where they brought it from, and where they were going - Donald said he did not know exactly where he was going, but that he brought it from Cherry-garden stairs; I said "I must take you into custody:" he said I might do as I liked about that; he then said he found it at the corner of Hermitage-street: Cockfield also said they had found it - I took them to the watch-house, and found the prsoecutrix - it had not then been opened, but the prosecutrix produced the key the next morning.</p>
               <p>DONALD'S Defence. We had been drinking with two shipmates, and came home at twelve o'clock, and then went out again to go to another house; in coming home, I saw this box in Burr-street, and a sailor standing by it:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150034"/>I had taken a glass or two, and I asked the man what he had got - I could not make out what he said; he then went away, so we took up the box, and went to our own door, but could not get in; I then took the box to a young woman's mother, where I thought we could get a lodging.</p>

               <p>Prisoner JOHN MACDONALD. Q. When you counted the carpet there were five breadths, and there are five breadths there now? A. No - if that were so, how could this breadth be here? this quntity is deficient.</p>

            . I was an apprentice to Richard Caneding, a carpenter's tool manufacturer. On the 1st of December Mr. Levy put the prisoner in possession; on the Wednesday, just after dinner, I had to go into the shop, and the prisoner said to me, "I want somebody to take a parcel into the City for me - I do not mind paying them for it;" I went over with my mistress to my master, and my master told me to take the parcel - I went over and said I was going out with the horse and chaise; the prisoner then asked me to take the parcel and gave me a direction where to take it and a note - it was directed,"Mr. Levy, pen-cutter, Chicksand-street, Osborne-street, Whitechapel;" I believe there was a direction in the parcel, but I do not remember what it was: I took the parcel to my master, and he opened it - it contained all the articles stated - a great number of tools.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not heard your mistress say, that she gave the prisoner these tools? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that all he said? A. Yes, to my remembrance; he did say that Mrs. Canedine said he might have a thing of a sort, and Mrs. Canedine has confirmed that to me - the goods were sold by a bill of sale; Mrs. Canedine is lodging in the house, but she is not in possession - her husband is in the Marshalsea; I have a person in possession of the goods: my man is serving in the shop; the apprentice is merely employed to tell the prices - Mrs. Canedine is not selling the things.</p>

               <p>Newgate, December 22, 1828.</p>
               <p>DEAR FRIEND, - I take this opportunity of sending you these few lines, to see if you will he so good as to send me the small sum of money that is coming to me from Bembridge, and to send me my clean shirt; if you speak to Mrs. Weston to give you the shirt, not the apron nor the other - please to let some of the shopmates come to see me, and bring me them; I do not like the place I am in, but I have got justly what I deserve - you know the reason I took the box, was that I could not get it no other way; the reason I did not give it you when you asked the office-man what time it would go, and he told me it went off at six o'clock in the morning; I have not got a penny to buy paper to write to my parents - any one coming to see me must be my father or my brothers; they will be admitted from ten till two o'clock any day but Sunday. Your's, most, &amp;c. ANDREW CALDWELL.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he charged me with stealing it he said he would let me off, and then he said he would transport me; so I thought, when I came here, if I confessed he would send me the money, and would forgive me.</p>

Yes, on the 15th of March, 1825, I went to Mr. Satchell's, and there found my mare - I am quite sure it was the mare I lost from the stables on the 28th of January; I have since sold her to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150042"/>Satchell, for 21l. 5s. - I went before the Magistrate, but did not see the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Satchell had taken a fancy to her, and bought her? A. Yes - I had not seen the prisoner near my premises.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, at Millhill, Hendon. In 1825, I saw the prisoner - I cannot say whether it was February or March; I saw him at Millhill - he was riding a brown mare, and offered her to me for sale; I did not purchase her, as she was not big enough - Satchell had previously asked me to look out for a mare; I called him over, as he was standing at his door; it was shown to him - I afterwards saw her in his possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This might have been in March? A. Yes; I knew the prisoner before - he was bred and born near me; he called at my house - it was day-light; there was no concealment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he put it up at your stable? A. No, it stood at my door - Satchell bought it immediately; he was to have it on two days' trial, and if it suited, then he was to give 14l. for it - but if not, he was to pay 10s, for the use of it; the prisoner used to come backward and forward to see his mother - I do not know what his business was.</p>

            . I live at Millhill, and am a butcher. In January, 1825, I knew the prisoner - I bought a mare of him, about the latter end of February, or the beginning of March; it was the mare I saw when Dossett was there - I gave him 14l. for it; I had her from Saturday till Tuesday, to try her - I was to give 10s. if she did not suit; she was claimed by Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When it turned out all was not right, he paid you by instalments? A. Yes - he had not desired me to conceal her at all; I did not ask how he came by her - I considered 14l. a fair value, from her appearance, but I found she suited me very well, and afterward gave 20l. for her; she was worth that to any man, who knew her value by trying her.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street horse-patrol. In March, 1825. I apprehended the prisoner, at Dossett's, the King's Head public-house, Millbill, - about the 5th of March; I apprehended him on the day he received the money - I went before the Magistrate, Mr. Clark, of Hendon, who is now dead; I could not produce any owner for the mare, and wished to have the prisoner remanded; he was discharged on his own recognizances, to appear again on the Saturday following, in case he was wanted - he never appeared again; I went all over Highgate, where he lived, to see if I could find him; at the time I discovered the owner, which was near a fortnight afterwards, I could not find the prisoner - he had not himself informed me he lived at Highgate; he told the Magistrate he lived at Highgate; when I apprehended him, I told him he was charged on suspicion of stealing two horses - it was not on this charge at all, and on asking where he lived, he replied at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding he had sold Satchell a mare, he was discharged, to appear on Saturday, if called upon? A.

            . I am a constable of Surrey. On the 29th of December last, I assisted Myers in apprehending the prisoner, at the corner of Plumtree-street, St. Giles's; he asked on what charge it was - I said, on suspicion of horse-stealing, and that I had several charges; he asked me the particulars - I told him he was suspected of stealing a black horse, or gelding, from Millhill, which his brother was in custody for; he said his brother would be tried that day, at Kingston, but he had nothing to do with it; his brother was not to be tried that day, for I had to attend the trial myself, on the Tuesday, but I did not contradict him - I told him I suspected him of stealing a mare advertised in the Hue and Cry, from Mr. Duke, of Ratcliff-on-Trent; he said he knew nothing of it - I said there were two horses stolen from Chiswick, about a fortnight back; he said he knew nothing of it - he said, "Huffey White has been saying something about me;" I said he had been hung years ago - he said No, he was in Newgate now; I said there was a man named White there - he was tried yesterday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He used the phrase "Huffey?" A. Yes - I did not mention Coleman's horse to him; I had heard of this charge, but it did not occur to my mind.</p>

I was called into Nunn's house, and saw Jennings in his custody; as soon as he saw me, I said "Is that you Bill?" he said "I know you are an officer;" I was then going to search him - he put his hand into his right-hand breeches-pocket, pulled out 10s. which he counted, and said he should keep that: I said I did not want to take his money; I searched, but found nothing on him: Nunn delivered me a handkerchief, this hat, a lantern, and crow-bar, in his presence - I have had them ever since; I afterwards compared the crow-bar with the drawer which was locked, and also to four doors, and they exactly matched with it; I sent for my handcuffs - Jennings said "I will walk with you, but if you handcuff me you shall carry me;" I was obliged to send for a coach, and take him to the watch-house; from the description Nunn's brother gave me, I went with Perrence and him in pursuit of the other man - we went to the Globe, in Steven-street, Lisson-grove, looked into the tap-room, and saw six or seven people; I charged Nunn to be particular, as I would not take away the liberty of any innocent person - he looked round, and pointed out Giles immediately; I called to him, and said "George;" (I knew him before) - he then came to the bar: I again said to Nunn "Be positive, for I won't take an innocent person's liberty away" - he said he was the man: I then took him - he walked very quietly with me to the watch-house: I searched him, and found a common latch-key on him - I examined Nunn's premises, and over the wall there is one brick fresh broken off, and just to the right, out of the yard of Sewell, a carpenter, where the jump was made from the wall, there were footmarks of shoes half-soled - there were the marks of the slip where the jump was quite fresh: when I got him to the watch-house, I asked Giles to take off his shoes: he said I might take them off, which I did - I compared them next morning with the place, and they tallied - there were the very impressions exactly, and here they are with the mud on them still.</p>

I went in search of the prisoner, and found him on the 13th, about one o'clock in the night, coming to his lodgings: I took him to the cage - I went to his lodging before that, and in his box found this brooch and miniature, but not the bag: his door was not fast, but a chair against it: when I took him he said, "You have taken my box away -I heard that at the Nagg's Head public-house;" I said I had; I took him before the Magistrate next day, and he asked my leave to look into his box, which was on the ground - the Magistrate then asked if that was his box; he said it was: that was the box I found the property in- I had been waiting three hours for him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent there to inquire about a place; I was two hours in the kitchen, and as I walked out of the house I picked up the property - Gidding had asked me to come and dine there on the Sunday, and bring her sister; I thought if the property was inquired after I could tell them I had got it, but as I heard nothing of it I threw it into my box. <rs id="t18290115-101-verdict516" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>SAMUEL DAVIS. I am an officer. About twenty minutes to eleven o'clock at night I was walking along the Poultry, and saw the prisoner with something under his left arm, and looking about him very suspiciously; I went by him, and saw he had this brawn wrapped up in a flannel apron - I saw a knife in his right-hand, as if he were cutting it open, and when he came under the light I saw him cut a piece off, and put it into his mouth; I then asked what he had got there - he made no answer, but turned round; I took it from him, and asked where he came from - he said he was going to take it to a customer, at Kentish-town, and had got it from his master's, in Leadenhall-market - he named a person who I never heard of; I said it was odd he should be cutting it - he made no answer; I took him to the watch-house, and found only 1d. on him - he then told me he had left home in the morning with 10s., and went to Billingsgate and bought this brawn there for 7s.; I locked him up, and next morning inquired of Mr. Myers, who claimed it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the end of Little George-street, and saw the two prisoners in company together, in George-street, which is no thoroughfare; I went up the street, and they came down on the opposite side - in going up the street I kicked against the head of one of these drums; I saw Baker with something very bulky in his apron before him - they were about twenty yards from the drumhead: I looked after them, and Brown made a stand; I immediately went up to Baker, and said, "Young man, what have you got there?" he d-d me, and said what was it to me; I pulled out my staff - he immediately let the two drums of figs fall at my feet, out of his apron -I immediately laid hold of him, and he began to struggle with me; Brown then came up, and struck me a most dreadful blow on the cheek-bone - it cut the flesh off the bone; I staggered, and fell against a gate - I was obliged to let go of Baker; they then both immediately fought me - I began to make a noise, saying, "Why, you are going to murder me!" and they ran away, leaving the figs behind them - (about half an hour afterwards Holditch came to the watch-house, saw the figs, and claimed them); when the prisoners ran away I pursued them and never lost sight of Brown till I had him in custody -I lost sight of Baker for about five minutes; he was taken in John-street - they had separated in New-square; they were both secured in the watch-house about the same time: John-street is in the City, and so is the place where I found the figs; they were afterwards claimed by Mr. Borer - I saw the letter B in a chalk-mark on them; the drums are here - the greater part of the figs were taken while I pursued the prisoners.</p>

Nobody that I saw; I first saw the prisoners together in Little George-street - they were together when I first saw them; Brown might be about five yards off when he stopped to look at me: I was not pursuing him more than half a minute - he might run three hundred yards; he turned one corner - I was close at his heels, and am certain of him; I never said I thought he had not taken an active part in ill-using me, or that I was not certain of Baker.</p>

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker, and live in Goswell-street. I was coming down Holborn-hill a little after eight o'clock, and saw four young men in company with each other - the prisoner was one; Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150047"/>Jones was coming towards me - I saw them all four follow him up as close as could be, put their hands into his pocket, and lift it up two or three times; at last they took the handkerchief out - the prisoner and another were close together behind him, and the other two were behind them; the prisoner, I think, was the one who took it - I saw his hand near the pocket; I saw Brown, the watchman, coming up - he put his light into two of their faces, and said to the prisoner, "What handkerchief have you got there?" he had a handkerchief in his hand - the prisoner replied, that it was his own to be sure; I thought the handkerchief was red and yellow - I could not see whether it was silk; he walked away, and Brown put his light into the other's face, and then they all walked away together - Brown went after them; I spoke to the prosecutor - he felt, and missed his handkerchief; I went with him, and saw the watchman at the end of Field-lane - I turned up Field-lane: the prisoner was coming down the lane again - I said, "This is him," and he was taken; I am certain he was one of the four - he was searched, and nothing but a handkerchief found on him; I thought it was the same I had seen in his hand - he had stopped at the corner of Union-court, and wiped his face with it: Jones did not claim it - he said it was his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That handkerchief is the same colour as the one you saw in his hand? A. Yes - I did not see the watchman till he put his light in their faces; I then followed the other two: I had not time to tell him, there were so many people passing; I went after them directly, and when I turned round, I could not see the watchman again - I am in Mr. Gibson's employ; I did not see a handkerchief in the prisoner's hand before the pocket was picked, but a minute or two after he was wiping his face with one; it appeared to me to be red and yellow - he was taken in about eight minutes; I know Kennedy - he worked with my father; I never received any money from him - he is a trustworthy man, as far as I know; I received no money from any woman, in his presence, on any account - he never asked me for a receipt for any money; I was at the Maidenhead public-house, in Goswell-street, with him - I had some gin and beer; Kennedy was there, and a woman, who said she was the prisoner's wife - I refused the money; I did not say I would not take it before a third party: his wife paid for the gin; I thought it no harm to drink it -I doubt her being his wife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this before or after the prisoner was committed? A. After - about a fortnight after he was taken up; I do not know where the woman lived - she found me out, and not I her.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn. I was calling eight o'clock, and passing down the hill - there were a number of people together; I looked round, and saw some characters I did not approve of - the prisoner was one of them; I knew him before; I had just come out of the watch-house - I turned round, and perceived the prisoner, and another by his side; I was on the curb, and did not see Mr. Jones, to my knowledge - I turned my light round, looked very sharp towards him, and saw him; I believe it to be him, but the other was not much unlike him, either in person or dress- I saw him rising, and taking up a handkerchief from the ground, as I considered; he put it up to his mouth: I put my light up towards him; it seemed a sort of red and yellow, or red and white, handkerchief - I turned round, and threw my light into his companion's face; I then went round to a third one - I knew them all to associate together on the hill; I saw a female there, who, I believe, passes as the prisoner's wife - she avoided me; I turned, and saw the prisoner pass down Field-lane; Toole came running up to me, in two or three minutes, and said the gentleman who had been robbed of his handkerchief was coming back, and informed me of the robbery - I then went with him down Field-lane, and saw Dyer coming up: Toole said he was the man who took the handkerchief: he was alone, returning towards Holborn- I then apprehended him, and endeavoured to take him to the watch-house, but not without considerable resistance, fighting, kicking, and taking hold of me by my neckhandkerchief; I was obliged to tear his clothes to hold him. and called the neighbours to assist me: Toole had hold of him, as well as me; I told him what I took him for - on our way to the watch-house, two of those I had seen in his company before he went into Field-lane, were pressing very hard upon me, and his resistance becoming stronger, I was obliged to use my staff to protect myself, and threatened them - I should know them again; I saw them the next day, in Guildhall-yard, and pointed them out - he was searched, but nothing found on him, except a handkerchief, with a kind of chocolate bird's-eye, that I had seen in his hand in Field-lane; it was folded up, as if it had come off his neck: Mr. Jones said it was not his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not the prisoner a neckhandkerchief on? A. Certainly; he had this in his hand- he had a light handkerchief on when I held my light to his face; I could not exactly see what kind of handkerchief was on his neck, as the one he held in his hand concealed it: the other man was near him; I had to walk a little way to put the light in the third man's face, but he avoided me - the prisoner knew I was a watchman; there are twenty places where he might have got rid of the handkerchief - the one he had when taken, was not the one I saw him rising with; it was not a chocolate colour, I will swear: I said to the prisoner, "You have picked up a handkerchief;" he said, "Well, if I have, it is my own:" I did not then know of the robbery, or I should have taken him; I described the handkerchief I saw him with - Jones, and a lady who was with him, said that was the colour; I have seen Toole before at different times - he attends there to assist the officers, or watchmen, I understand.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. From your observation of the handkerchief he had, and the one found on him, can you, with certainly, say they were not the same? A. I am positive of it: I told the prisoner it was not the one I had seen him with.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS TOOLE. Q. Have you never assisted the officers in seizing people? A. If there is any thing amiss, and they call me, I suppose I am compelled to do it - I cannot say how many charges I have given evidence on; I am not out except on Sundays - I may have given evidence seven or eight times; I was refused my expences once, because I was not exactly on the trial; I never did it for lucre - I never got above 10s.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the watch. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I searched him and found a handkerchief in his pocket and 6s. 6d. -Jones did not claim the handkerchief: Brown said the one he saw taken was a red and yellow one; Jones and the lady said that was near the colour - it took ten of us to keep the gang off, as we took him to the Compter - it was as much as we could do to handcuff him; knowing him to be a desperate character we wanted to handcuff him behind, but could not: as we we went along, he said, "Let me take out my chive," (which means knife) previous to that he floored me in the street, by putting his feet before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was a knife found on him? A. No; we were dragging him along, his hat fell off and he would not go without it - he said, "Now put my handkerchief into my hat, or else I won't go;" the watchman carried it - he said, "Now put it on my head," and he did so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he make a violent resistance before his hat fell off? A. No, afterwards in Skinner-street - persons surrounded us all the way from the watch-house.</p>

             re-examined. I saw Brown in the watch-house, but did not hear him describe the handkerchief; I had a lady with me - I do not recollect her making any observation about it - it was brown, yellow and black; the same as this border. (producing one.)</p>

            . I worked with Toole's father at shoemaking, about five years ago - I now work for myself; I was at the Maidenhead public-house with Toole, and the prisoner's wife; I saw two sovereigns laid on the table- we had some gin which she paid for; I heard her ask Toole for a receipt outside the door - he told her it was all right, there was no occasion for any receipt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who put the sovereigns on the table? A. The prisoner's wife; she put them to Toole to settle the business between the prisoner and Toole - I have known the prisoner four years, by mending his shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner's wife? A. She came to the shop where I live, in Lower West-street, and asked if I knew young Toole; I told her I did - she begged me to come with her to Goswell-street, where he is employed; I believe she knew him before: she asked me to go to settle the affair between Toole and her husband, he being confined in Gaol - I heard he was confined, being taken taken up by Toole in Holborn; I did not know what for - she did not tell me, but when she offered the money, I heard her say he was never guilty of taking the handkerchief; I would not have wished to be present if I had known any thing about it - nothing was settled before me; I did not see Toole take the money, only she laid it down before him - he called her out, and said he wanted to speak to her outside the door; she and he went out - the sovereigns then laid on the table where I sat; there was nobody inside the room but me - she said she had borrowed the sovereigns and it was more than she could afford; he then said he wished to talk to her outside - she came back and said to me, "He won't come in; he don't like to take the money before you;" I said, "Come in," and he said,"Yes, I will, if you will go out" - I came out and he went in: I saw him come out again - she then said, "I should he glad to have a receipt for the money;" he said there was no occasion, he would make it all right.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had the prisoner been in Gaol? A. I was informed he was taken on Sunday - this was the next evening; I never told this to anybody till I came here - I never mentioned it to the prisoner's attorney, or to anybody till a little before five o'clock this evening; I was told I had to come into Court - I had never mentioned it even to my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the woman this was a very improper thing? A. Indeed I did not understand about that; that laid in the man's own breast - I said to Toole, "Now you know best, whether it is best to take it or not."</p>

            . I can contradict this altogether; Kennedy came to me at different times, and asked me to take 3l. to settle it - I said I would take no money whatever: he then asked me to make the thing as easy as I could - I said I would not say more than I had before the Magistrate; they came two or three times to make it up, and Mr. Gibson came and fetched me to make it up.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you drink with the prisoner's wife? A. I did, and she proposed to give me 2l.; I said I would have nothing, and I told Mr. and Mrs. Gibson so- Kennedy was the first person who came to me and said I had better take it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Before the prisoner's wife appeared, did you not propose to Toole to take money to make this up? A. No; I told him she would give him 2l. as she told me, and said, "You know the difference, whether you will take it or not" - that was before he saw the prisoner's wife; just before, she was standing alongside of him, but he did not see her; it was the night before we met at the public-house, and he said, "Make up as much as you can - come on Monday night and we will settle it."</p>

No; it was the same night- she got him the money that night, but he did not take it, and on Monday she offered it again; I believe it was on the Monday night following, but I cannot say - I know Mr. and Mrs. Gibson.</p>

I have known the prisoner eight years - he has been an honest industrious man: Collett came to me one day, and said she was going to appear against Leggett: it was much against her will, but she was obliged to go - I had been with Leggett, drinking in Mr. Roberts' house, for three hours that day, and on my oath he came out with nothing but his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day of the month was this? A. The 26th of December; we were there from between two and three o'clock till near five: I assisted him to do the bell - we had two or three pints of beer, and went to the bar to get something to drink; I was taken to Queen-square, and was accused of having taken a pail - I said they must prove it; we came out together, and I can swear he had nothing - I took the ladder there; I cannot swear I did not see the goose: I saw a leg of mutton there; the waiter made some observations about the mutton - my foot was then at the bottom of the ladder - there was no goose near that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who came out with Leggett? A. Burgess, Darby, and I; I did not see the ladder in different places.</p>

            . I am a cooper. I was in the house, and went out with the prisoner - he could not have had a goose without my seeing it; he had his apron on as he has it now, and had no goose in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any other apron on? No, I had had part of two pints of ale, and had been in the room up stairs; I did not see the ladder - I only came down after he had done his work: he came into the room, and we came out together; there were three of us, but no one had a bundle that I saw; I had been about an hour with him; he came into the room, and said he would be a pint with us.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and am son-in-law to Mr. Robinson - he had thirty-three fowls in his premises; I was acquainted with them: this is one of them -I know it by a particular mark here; it was bred on the premises: I locked up the hen-house door myself, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 4th, and saw the whole of the fowls there; when I went in it happened that dinner was announced, and I did not put the key in its usual place, but put it into my pocket, and it was there till ten o'clock at night - the premises are surrounded with a paling, about five feet six inches high.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear positively to this fowl? A. Yes - I sometimes took them their food; Skill did not live in the house - he used to feed them, and knew them: the cut in the wings was his own cutting.</p>

             re-examined. I am out-door gardener to Mr. Robinson; I have examined the cut on the wing of this fowl - I cannot say whether Mr. Robinson had such a fowl; I never took notice of any particular fowl, so as to know it again; he had fowls something like it: I cannot say that this wing is my cutting, as I did it in the dark, with a large old pair of sheep-shears, about a fortnight before they were stolen; I have been listening to what the officers have said, and I believe it is true, as I heard it before - there were footmarks of more than one person, but I did not take particular notice; I went with Morgan and Mayor when they measured the footmarks, and every thing matched as he says.</p>

I saw the body of the railing there, but I cannot say I saw this rail; this is a particular pattern, which you will not find any where- it was lying piled up in the middle of the square, ready to fix; I should think it is two miles from Bethnal-green: it is a particular model, which we had from the surveyor.</p>

On the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was in the shop - I believe I had forty customers; I cannot tell whether she came in alone, or not - she came to me for some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed her three different parcels - she did not like any, and sent me back for another parcel; while I was gone she took two silk handkerchiefs, with my mark on them - I saw her put them under her gown into her pocket; when I came back I taxed her with it - she denied it, and asked if I meant to insult her; I jumped over the counter, and she dropped them on the floor, with this piece of lace - these are the two handkerchiefs; here are twenty-nine yards of lace - I had seen a young man on the opposite side shewing her some lace, not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is that young man here? A. No - his name is Elim; there were some people near her: the firm is not Graham and Nixon - it is Mr. John Graham only; she had bargained for one handkerchief with me - she came from the window, and was to have paid 9 1/2d. for it; she did not say she was putting her hand into her pocket to pay me - this could not have fallen by accident.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Written.) I was going home, running down Southampton-buildings; a short distance from the top of the street, a young man (running in the same direction that I was) as he passed me, slyly pushed something into my hand folded in a very small compass, which on opening I found to be a pocket-handkerchief; I directly threw it down, still continuing to run as before, until hearing the cry of Stop thief, I halted to ascertain who they were in pursuit of, and I, together with the young man who gave me the handkerchief were immediately taken and charged with the theft; but upon the witness, who has given his evidence against me, pointing me out as the thief, the other young man was suffered to escape - I solemnly declare that I never saw the young man who gave it to me before.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Was the man in the room when the woman went out? A. I believe he shaved himself, and went out after her - I went up just before, and saw him shaving himself; she had the key of the room when she returned - there is a private door, and we were in the shop; she told me she did it by his desire.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you have any reference? A.She told me she came from a good way off - I think Hampstead-road, and said she was going to bring in a mahogany table and a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Marshall put in a written Defence, pleading extreme poverty, and stating that she has been respectably situated in life.</p>

On the 5th of January, I went out to spend the day - it was late in the evening when I went home; when I got into the air, what little I had had took an affect upon me; the prisoner picked up with me in the street, and said he would take me to a lodging; I cannot say what street it was: he was quite a stranger to me; we went to a house where we slept in the same room - in the morning, the landlord awoke me, and asked if I knew the young man, as he had got all my clothes on; I do not know what time it was.</p>

I went to leave a white four-post furniture, and this was with it; I had taken it to Newington; I rolled it up in the wrapper, and was taking it home- I was coming down Field-lane, and this Jew woman said"Have you got any thing to sell?" I said No - she laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150058"/>hold of me, and said,"Let me look;" she dragged me in, and the watchman took me directly.</p>
               <p>MR. SADGROVE. He was out with furniture that day and the day before, but with none of this descripution; he had to take a set of scarlet curtains to Shacklewell - he packed up the parcel: we have several blankets to pack goods in - the prisoner said he had done it by mistake; he has lived four years with me.</p>

            . I let the prisoner out about eight o'clock that evening; he was then to go home - he had gone out about four o'clock in the afternoon, to take the red curtains home; he came back about eight in the evening, and went away immediately - he took no parcel with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then when he was going out for the evening he had no bundle? A. No; I cannot exactly swear who packed up the bundle he took out in the afternoon - the orders were for him to pack it up, and take it to Shacklewell: it was about four o'clock in the afternoon: the porters do one another's work, unless they are heavy goods; I am sometimes away - they might, in my absence, assist one another with light goods.</p>

               <p>Q. When you entered this man's place, did you not point out another reason why you knew the mutton to be yours? A. I said the suet was taken out of one loin, and not out of the other, which I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, upon your oath, did not the man point out the suet that had come from that loin of mutton? A. Yes, he did shew it to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you said, "That is my loin of mutton, because the suet is taken out"? A. Yes; he said, "Here's the suet," and showed me some which was broken into twenty pieces, but there may be twenty pieces of suet which appear the same.</p>
               <p>Q. But now you swear to it by something else? A. I missed two, and I thought this had been the other, but I found it was the one which I had chopped off, and I said to my boy, "I think I have chopped it off as clean as if I had sawed it:" I missed two loins of mutton - one was of a wether sheep, and this was it; the other was a ewe one, which I have not seen - there are strings to a wether sheep, but not to a ewe.</p>

I secured the house myself on Wednesday night, the 22d of October; the door of the hall, at the back of the house, was quite secure - I locked it myself; the iron door, leading to the garden, was secure - there is an outer door, then a hall door, and then an inner door, which opens immediately into the house; they were all quite secure - I fastened them myself; I was alarmed about half-past one o'clock by the female servant - I got out of bed, partly dressed myself, got a cord and lowered myself from the window by fastening a cord to the bedstead; I took a loaded gun with me - on turning the corner of the house I saw four men, and desired them to stop; they were then coming out of the stone hall, all four of them - I discharged my gun at them and missed fire; the prisoner is the man I knocked down on the lawn of the shrubbery - I am sure he is the man - it was a beautiful moon-light morning; I hit a second man, and knocked him off the gate - he was taken into custody, tried here last Session, and convicted; I conveyed that man away that morning in a cart - I saw the prisoner again on the 10th of December at the Swan with two Necks public-house at Whetstone - I knew him the moment I saw him; this was about a quarter of a mile from Mrs Mountain's - I examined the house after taking the man into custody, the lock of the outer door had been picked, and the pannel nearly cut out of the inner hall door- it had been pierced through nearly all round the pannel with a centre-bit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say it was a very moon-light night, and before you took the man tried last Session, you knocked a man down? A. Yes; the prisoner, now at the bar, is the man I knocked down in the shrubbery - I am quite positive, I cannot be mistaken in his person; I said he was the man immediately - I had my senses about me perfectly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What dress had I on? A. Not the same you have now.</p>
               <p>Q. If you saw my face of course you could tell the colour of my coat and handkerchief? A. You had a black or dark silk handkerchief - I cannot exactly say the colour of your coat; I had a full view of your face as you ran along, and when you were on the wall - at the time you came out of the hall I was fifteen or sixteen yards from you: I had a perfect view of you then - I was close to him when I knocked him down and had a full view of his face; my attention was directed more to his face than his coat, and as such I could see the handkerchief - I had gone to bed about half-past nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Baker of the Swan with Two Necks, at Finchley. On Thursday, the 23d of October. I heard of Mrs. Mountain's house being broken open - I had seen the prisoner on the 22d in company with three others at our house, from half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, or from that to five; our house is a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Mountain's - they had a pot of beer and four empty pipes; I am quite sure the prisoner was one - I saw him again on the 10th of November at Mrs. Baker's, there were two more men with him then; they had a cart, and took some refreshment - and a fortnight after Lord Mayor's day I saw him again at mistress's; I saw him a fourth time on the 10th of December, when Laurence came in and identified him at once - I am quite sure he is the man I had served with the beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who waited on him on the 22d of October? I did; they were not in the house, but drank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150062"/>their beer outside the door - we had lights in the house; they did not come into the tap-room - it was not dark; I could see them distinctly - I served them, and a tall man paid me; I had the means of observing them - I did not notice the prisoner's neckcloth, but am quite sure he is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say four pipes of tobacco were had? A. Four empty pipes; they had them ouside the door- I did not give them a light; the tall one went into the parlour for the light.</p>

I recollect hearing of the attempt to break into Mrs. Mountain's house, and recollect a man being conveyed away in a cart, in custody, by Laurence next morning by the Bricklayers' Arms public-house - I had seen four men together the day before that (Wednesday) walking at Whetstone about a quarter to five o'clock in the afternoon; the man I saw in the cart was one of those men, and the prisoner was one of them - I am quite sure; I was standing against the turnpike-gate when I saw him - they had pipes and were all four smoking.</p>

               <p>The prisoner then made the following defence, most of which was written: - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, -Being deprived by law of the benefit of the eloquence and arguments of Counsel on my behalf, I am compelled (and I am very unfit,) to address a few words for your consideration. I am aware you will consider the awful situation in which I am placed, and under such consideration I feel confident of your favourable indulgence - that you will excuse my timidity in addressing you, rather than leaving the case against me as it now stands, to your Lordship's unbiassed judgment. Through a mercantile life of twenty years, during a part, at least, of which, I have been perhaps useful in my generation, though it has been sadly checquered by misfortune, I have never until now been criminally charged before a Magistrate, nor until now did I ever open my lips in a public audience, however small. Upon the evidence produced against me, I shall make no comments, leaving that to one who is able and competent to the purpose, and who will give me the benefit of any decrepancy, should any appear there - in: I am charged with having paid, or uttered, a forged cheque, knowing it to be forged, and should you consider the evidence sufficient, and the instrument a forgery, I am afraid I shall have little left to do but to entreat, under circumstances, your favourable recommendation, and, viewing the amount and circumstances of the case, I hope such recommendation may not be denied me; but, Gentlemen, there is a point, of which, I trust, you will fully satisfy yourselves before you return a verdict of guilty, viz. That I knew and considered the instrument to be a forgery at the time I paid it away - for I conceive, that unless you are satisfied that I considered it a forgery at that time, I could not have paid it with a guilty knowledge; and, Gentlemen, I most positively aver, that taking the case as proved against me, as far as regards the payment of the order, that I cannot even now bring my mind to the conviction that I have committed a forgery. Upon whom have I forged? On no person living. Whose name have I used for the purpose of ob taining money? No one's; that I may have spoken falsehoods, and made false representations, may be true, but that I have committed a forgery, in the common acceptation of the words, is not the case; it possibly may, by law and precedent, be considered otherwise, but what is true in fact, law and precedent ought not to make wrong - there are precedents for burning women for the supposed crime of witchcraft, and men as wizards, and precedents for the putting to death one sect of the professors of the all-merciful religion of Christ by another sect, because they were at variance in some doctrinal point, or in their modes of worship, but will any of you say such precedents ought to be followed? No, not one; Gentlemen, the severity of the law of forgery seems to have aimed at the protection of great mercantile bodies, or individuals, upon whose firms or names (as third parties not present, to protect themselves,) credit or property was obtained - a person pays a forged Bank of England note, the credit of property given in exchange is not given upon the credit of the person paying it, it is given upon the faith of the security given them by the note on a Company well known - so is the case as to small Companies, or individuals; the tradesman knows the character and responsibility of another tradesman, and though he may not know, or be sufficiently acquainted with his handwriting, so as to detect an imitation, yet, from his knowledge of the individual, he takes the order, or bill of exchange, upon such knowledge, and the credit is given on the supposed security of a known individual; how different is the case before you - I shall take the case as in some measure proved by the witnesses; they say I called upon them, and inquired for so and so, and presenting an order, purporting to be one for money, drawn by a person they had never heard even a whisper of before, in fact, it is sworn no such person does exist. Upon whose credit then do they take it? Upon the credit of a non-entity; certainly not, for they could attach no credit, or conceive they had any security, by holding the order of an individual, who, if in existence, might not be worth a straw - No, Gentlemen, the credit they gave, or property they parted with, must have been so given or parted with upon the representations of the party offering it, and not upon any supposed security of holding an order of a person, of whom they knew nothing, therefore the crime is in the appearance of the instrument offered. Such being the view of the case, and, I conceive, is the common-sense view, will place me out of the reach of the forgery, and especially if you believe that a party may pay away such an instrument without knowing that law constituted it a forgery - Such, Gentlemen, will, I trust, be your view of the case, but should you think otherwise, let me humbly entreat you to weigh the case as it affects the interest and peace of the community, and, taken in every point of view, you must agree that it is a comparatively slight offence; and here I dare not trust my feelings, but, Gentlemen, is the offence to be compared in magnitude of moral guilt, with the panderer who seduces from the parental roof perhaps your only child, and after having satisfied his propensities, leaves the poor innocent to seek her bread by wretched prostitution? compare it to the profligate seducer, though only punishable in his pocket, who enters your house as your friend and confidant, and under that specious cover seduces from your arms and affections the wife of your bosom, who had been the joy of your younger, and who you had looked forward to he the solace of your declining years, and leaving the children upon whom you doat worse than motherless. As against the mercantile interests of the country, the name of an individual, or firm, utterly unknown, or not in existence, could never be circulated by a person unknown to others, to an extent to affect the well-being of the smallest trading interests - next view it as it affects the peace of the country, and here, from the feelings I have before to day witnessed, and the expressions I have heard, I am certain the humane Judge, before whom I appear, will agree with me that it is comparatively slight; compare it with the ruthless highwayman, who, on the pain of your life, robs you of all your person carries, or, perhaps to secure his own escape, leaves his bleeding victim a wretched spectacle of his barbarity; compare it, I say, with the case of the burglar, who, in the dark and silent watches of the night, breaks open your fancied castle of security, and, perhaps binding the trembling inmates hand and foot, confines them to a dark dungeon, there(but for the interposing hand of Providence,) to starve or contract disease, which increases, as life is protracted, or, if resistance is offered, with deadly weapons maims for life, or sends<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150064"/>his hapless victims to the judgment seat of his Creator; compare the charge against me with those, my case is a fly-bite in guilt - if, when proved to its fullest extent, what is it? a person, who almost with his own concurrence, for there certainly does appear a great want of discretion, if not blameable negligence, in a person taking from an entire stranger, at first view, an order for money, (it is very different to a Bank note,) of the quality of which order he knows nothing - I say, taking it in its fullest extent, the peace of society is not broken in upon, the peace of mind of the person taking it is uninjured, his bodily health, powers, and existence are not endangered, and he loses, What does he lose? (far too much, certainly,) but only what any citizen could replace in a week, or what many tradesmen could replace by his profits in a day, if not in a few hours; I have stated I had no guilty knowledge of the offence being a forgery, and nine out of ten persons in the common walks of life would take the same view. I have compared it with other crimes, some of which are only punishable by remuneration from the purse, or confinement in a debtor's gaol, and some with life, all of which, I think, you will agree with me are greater crimes; if I have been prolix, or intruded upon your valuable time, let the situation in which I am placed plead my apology - consider my feelings - consider the anxiety for my near and dear relations - consider that your verdict (but for the interposition of Sovereign mercy,) will place me in the hands of the public executioner. I implore you to weigh well my case - to consider mercy as one of the attributes of Heaven, and to allow the consideration of the feelings of humanity to turn the balance in my favour; and, with the fullest conviction of the humanity of my Judge, I place my future life at your disposal.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you walking on the footpath? A. Yes; it is level in the carriage-road - the church is a little distance from the spot; some white tomb-stones project close to the road, about two hundred yards from where this happened - I found my husband lying in the road.</p>

            . I am a fisherman, and live at Twickenham. I was coming from Teddington church towards Twickenham, and saw a chaise-cart and horse; when it came by me, the horse, I think, took fright at the white tomb stones - I cannot say the prisoner was the driver; he came by me, and hit the horse over the head or neck, by the side of the church, after he had passed the church: I only saw him strike the horse once - he was then two hundred and fifty yards, or more from where the accident happened; he was about twenty yards behind me when I first saw him, and just level with me when he hit the horse - he had got hold of the reins as light as he could hold them.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was then he struck the horse? A. Yes; the horse was going as hard as it could, and he was stopping it as much as he could; I walked on and heard a woman scream out - there were two women there; I ran to the place as fast as I could -

             the horse back before I got up, and came to where the body lay: I lifted the man up, and said he was dead - he said,"Is he by G-d?" I then took him further, put him under the pales, and then none of us could see the prisoner and the cart - it was dark; there were pales on each side, and high trees and wood before us; we could not see his face: I said, "D-n you, you have killed a man" - he then said he was sorry for it, or something, I could not exactly hear what; he asked Turner if he would go up to the village for a doctor to come and take him away - Turner said he could not, for he wanted to get home; the prisoner then asked me - I refused, but gave no reason; I might say he would kill me as well as the man, but they bothered me so before the Grand Jury, I did not know what I said: I do not know whether I said why I would not go - he turned his horse round, and said if we would not go with him, he must be off; I cannot exactly tell what he said - I believe he said he must go, or something, but I really forget his words; it was that he should go and would not stay - that he would be d-d, or something; he would go and seek redress.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150065"/>Q.Who was to seek redress? A. He did not say; I would tell you what it was, if I could think of it - it was if we would not go, he was off, or something; he had asked us to get into the cart, and go with him for a doctor - we refused: I told him he would kill me, or something of that kind - he then went off; I forget what he said - he said we might seek redress, and then we might kiss his *** and be d - d; he went away towards Twickenham, and I went towards Teddington, for a doctor; I have not spoken to the prisoner since - I saw him on the steps of this Court, but no where else; I have not conversed with anybody about this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it a clear or a dark night? A. Quite dark: I never saw the prisoner before - there is an awkward turning by Teddington church, and there are white tomb-stones close to the road; this is not the first horse I have seen startled by them - there are some poles project on the opposite side; he had passed them - he struck the horse to right it back into the road; it was before apparently going out of the road: he did not strike till the horse shyed, and he was pulling it in as hard as he could up to the time I heard the woman scream - the accident happened in a darker part of the road; he could not have seen the man in the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe at what place the man was going before the horse shyed? A. Just at a trot, not very fast.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did it appear to you that he was driving furiously, or endeavouring to recover his horse? A. I think it was to recover it - he was not driving furiously; he was on his right side: the body lay on the left hand, very near the footpath - his feet were about a yard from the path, and his head in the road; the road is about seven feet wide; he was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the prisoner used these abusive terms, you had used abusive language to him? A. I did; it was in answer to our observations; he appeared irritated at what we said; he had asked us both to go for a doctor.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were near the church when he struck the horse? A. Yes; I could see before he started that he was pulling in his horse, and he kept on that way as far as I could see, which was not all the way; the man's head was crushed.</p>

            . I was walking by the deceased, and saw a cart coming; he was crossing the road - the cart came up, and the horse knocked him down; it was galloping very fast: there is a bend in the road; the driver stopped the horse immediately, and turned it back again; I told him he had done murder, and not to ride over the man again: he said the man was not dead yet; two men came up: one of them lifted him up out of the road against the pales; the man in the cart asked them to go with him for assistance - the man said he would not trust himself with him, (he did not say why) he would go himself; he then turned round his cart, and said, "You may seek for recompense, and be d - d, and catch me if you can;" I was much frightened, and did not hear the men say any thing to him before that; the deceased's wife asked his name, but none of us could tell; he was gone then: no questions were put to him about his name - he said nothing about it: I live at Kingston, and went home with my children, who were with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course the people there saw you with your children? A. Yes; I had one in my arms, and one by my side: I took care of the man while they went to look for help; my husband works at the wire business; I sell matches about, but do not beg: when the cart turned back, it appeared to be going very near the spot where the man lay; I told him not to run over him again - it was in the clearest part of the road; there are no trees there, but little pales - they are not high: it was not so late as half-past five o'clock, for I asked the time afterwards; I had a drab cloak on that night, and here it is - I wore it here; I had not heard it mentioned that a person there had a drab cloak on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any other cloak? No- I have no knowledge of the prisoner; I did not hear the other witnesses examined.</p>

            . I am a malster, and live at Teddington. I came up about two minutes after this accident happened; I cannot swear the prisoner is the man who was in the cart: it had gone by me at a great rate before the accident, just on this side Teddington church, galloping as fast as it could - I did not see the driver flog the horse- I did not see him till after he had passed the tombstones; I heard a woman halloo out - they said "For God's sake, Sir, come along as fast as you can;" when I got up, I saw the poor man lying in the road; King came up - we lifted him up, and sat him on the path with his back against the pales; then the prisoner, if it was him, said "Let us proceed to get some assistance - one of you go along with me;" King said "I will see you d - d first - I will not go with you; you will serve me the same," or something: when he found neither of us would go, he turned his horse and said, "Do your best and worst - catch me if you can:" I heard no more ill language; I left the poor man in care of the women, and went away, for I was hurt at seeing him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear King use any bad language to the man? A. What I have said: it was just getting dusk: it appeared to me that the horse had taken fright, and started - there is a sharpish turning by the church-yard, and some white tomb-stones come almost flush on the road, at the corner, and are likely to alarm a shy horse on a dark night; the man seemed to be holding the reins tight: there are several trees on each side, which make it darker.</p>

(or words to that effect) I am trepanned:" Reynolds picked up what he dropped - it was a half-crown, and he had in his other hand a bit of rag stained with some kind of colouring; I secured him, and examined his hands and fingers - his left-hand thumb and fingers in particular had a kind of yellow cast on: I asked him how old he was - he said fifty-one or fifty-two- I said "I think you are old enough to know you are doing wrong;" I turned and said, "What are you doing here," (pointing to the table) - he said it was poverty that brought him to it; I took him to the Police-office - I searched his other pocket at the office before I left him, and found a bad shilling in his coat-pocket, and a farthing to which some colour had been applied: I have them both here; I left Reynolds in possession of the room, and on my returning there, I found this pipkin and some sand paper - there was some colouring in the pipkin; I also found a file, and two cups with some wash in them, (which I have since emptied into bottles,) and a paper of cream of tarter - the paper was open on the table; the colouring in the pipkin was in a dry powdered state - some of the sand-paper was quite clean, and some rubbed, with a brassy appearance on it; I took a piece of old iron hoop from the fire-place, and one end of it was red hot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He said he had been trepanned - did he give you the name of the person? A. He did not, certainly - I know to whom he referred; I never knew any harm of that man: he is not in the service of the Mint; he is in the coach way: he was employed by Mr. Powell on this occasion; I had seen him three or four days before, and saw him that day before we went to the prisoner's room: I do not know that he had the key of the prisoner's room in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual, to your knowledge, for some persons connected with the Mint to keep men in their pay to make inquiries, and give information on these subjects? A. No, I do not; I never participated in any thing of the kind: I gave the man 1s.; the prisoner was asked by whom he was trepanned, and said he did not know where the man lived, or his name: I knew his name; I am principally employed in prosecuting persons of this description; I knew the prisoner lived there before - for what I know, this may be the first occurrence of the sort that ever happened to him.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You gave the man 1s.? A. Yes, to get a drop of beer; he came down to give this information, on which I acted, and which information I found correct.</p>

            . I am an inspector of base coin. This half-crown appears to be in a state of process for re-colouring; I have looked at the different materials produced; the pipkin contains some part of nitrate of silver, which I have tried, and it colours copper money: all these things are such as are generally used for this process; two or three of the shillings are cast, and do not require it; the others are copper and brass.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am assistant-solicitor to the Mint. The person who gave this information, came to me; all informations are given to me in the office, and, when necessary, the officers are employed - we do not suffer officers to receive informations, or to act without our first making inquiry; the man came to me of his own accord - we do not employ them to go about inquiring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You, of course, are fully aware of the person to whom the officer alludes? A. Yes - I never saw him before he gave me information of this particular man; he first came to me, as far back as the beginning of November - I saw him, perhaps, half a dozen times before the prisoner was apprehended; he did not give me information about the prisoner at each of those times; I believe his name was introduced every time, though other subjects might be introduced - his first information did not refer to the prisoner alone; the prisoner was apprehended in consequence of what passed between this man and the officer at that particular time; I was not on the spot at the time of the apprehension, but was there immediately after - we are generally near the spot, in order to go and see what is found; I had seen the informant that morning, about two hours before- he received nothing from me before the apprehension; I have since given him 5l.; and, in explanation, I must say that he had never applied to me for a single sixpence, and had been losing a great deal of time for upwards of a month; he was out of work, and I thought it not too much, he having lost upwards of five weeks - I shall charge the 5l. in my account; I have general authority to pay monies.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Have you general authority to employ persons giving informations respecting base coin? A. Yes - we take every means in our power to ascertain whether the reports are true, and from the general knowledge we have, we can almost always tell whether the person is deceiving us or not; we do not rely on the single person giving information.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any thing in the information of that individual which would lead you to know or believe whether the prisoner might or not be entrapped? A. There certainly was - I knew his comnexions; we take all the means we conceive legitimate, to inquire into the truth of the information, and in this case I took all the pains I could to satisfy myself that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150067"/>was directing his information correctly; I had other information.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has Mr. Powell any apprehension that the 5l. will be disallowed in his account? A.None whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I will state the truth, as far as I can. On the day before Christmas, this individual called me out of the shop where I have worked six or seven years, to go and drink with him, saying it was Christmas time; I went with him to several places, and drank both liquor and porter, till I got intoxicated, and towards evening we parted; in the morning he came to my lodgings, before breakfast, and brought these very identical things- I had not even a bad shilling, sixpence, half-crown, or anything; I had not 1d. - even the halfpence the officer took from my pocket belonged to him; he brought in these things, and put down 9d., saying it would purchase some stuff, and wanted me to go out for it - he went out, after preparing these things himself, for colouring - he scowered them, and then said he was going to meet a person to get some money; he went out and returned in about twenty minutes, with some money, then tried the stuff, and said it was not sufficiently strong, it required cream of tartar, which he went and bought himself, went through the process with it, and asked me to assist him; in about twenty minutes more, he said the stuff was not good enough, he would go and get some more silver - he took the latch-key of my door, saying he would get it, and return in about ten minutes, in the course of which time the officers came - when he brought in the cream of tartar, he wanted to take the key from outside the door and put it inside, which I never did, for I always kept it outside, and I made him return it to the outside. As I now stand here, I plead your clemency before God; I am fifty-six years of age, and from my childhood have obtained an honest livelihood by hard work, and my character was never impeached - I hope you will take all this into your serious consideration, and spare my life.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in West-street, near one o'clock on the morning of the 27th of December; the prosecutor called Watch! and said he had been knocked down and robbed - there was a mob round him; I had not seen him knocked down - he stated what he had lost; I asked him if he could identify any of the men - he said he could not; there was a mob gathered - I told them to disperse, and called another watchman to clear them away; we were obliged to take three to the watch-house - the prosecutor went with us, and not finding the property on them, he stated what sort of persons he suspected, and I went to look for the fourth, from his description; and about an hour after I saw the prisoner coming down Great Saffron-hill, which leads into West-street, with a flannel jacket on; he had a hat on - I took him, and asked what hat he had on, knowing it to be a different one to what he generally wears; I knew him before - he said it was his own hat; I told him I did not believe it, and he must go with me to the watch-house - I took him there; I took the hat off his head going along, and found a collar in it - I saw the prosecutor at the watch-house, and asked him to describe his hat; he said, if he saw it, he should know it, and that there was a collar in it; he did not say that before I told him I had found it - he had not mentioned it in my hearing; he did not mention the collar, until I showed it him- I did not ask if he had lost any thing else; the prosecutor said the collar belonged to his wife - the prisoner said nothing to that, but as we came along, be told me if I would let him go he would make it all right, and he attempted to tear the lining out of the hat, but I would not let him.</p>

            . I live at Hillingdon, and keep the house. On Monday, the 1st of December, about six o'clock in the morning, I left my house, and returned on Tuesday evening, between four and five o'clock; I left a maidservant in the house, and two men servants sleep in the yard; my wife and children were at another house. On returning on Tuesday afternoon I missed some property; the damage done to the things left behind was more than the value of what was taken: I should think my whole loss, from damage and all, is 200l. or more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner Shaw's husband? A. Yes, he lived at Drayton, I believe, with her; he has absconded, I understand: I was looking after him.</p>

            . I live at Useley, near Hillingdon, and am a brickmaker. I heard of the robbery at Mr. Milton's house; on the day before I heard of it I saw the prisoner Burnham - I was at work at the brick-kiln, and was stamping to keep my feet warm; Burnham came along with another man, taller than himself - I did not know either of them before: I said, "Good morning, Puttey - I wish I had had a little of what you have had too much of;" they both appeared intoxicated - the tall man said to the prisoner, with a wicked oath, "If we had known it we would have had all the furniture;" Burnham said, "Would you? Would you?" that was all I heard him say; the tall man lay down about twenty yards from the kilu - Burnham went about one hundred yards below him, and stood at the bridge; Burnham had two large bundles, and the tall man one - two of the bundles were coloured, and one white; this was a little before eight o'clock in the morning - it was quite light; they went away: Mr. Milton's house is about a mile from where I saw them. I know the prisoner Shaw- I met her that day, close to my own home, which is about three hundred yards from the kiln; she had nothing with her: it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after I saw the men - she had a shawl and a bonnet on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BURNHAM. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. No; I took particular notice of you, because you leaned against me, and the other man I could not see so well, as his shirt-collar came so high over his face, and his hat came over his face.</p>

            . I am constable of Hillingdon. I went to Mr. Milton's house on Wednesday, the 3d of December, and found the glass broken in: the back-parlour window shutters were cut with a centre-bit; I went down to the cellar door, and found that broken open - a great many of the locks of the drawers and cupboards up stairs were forced; the laths of the wine-bin in the cellar were broken down, a great deal of wine spilt about, and bottles broken- I did not know Shaw before: I went to her house about nine o'clock that evening, and searched her pockets; I found a little purse, with four duplicates in it - she was in bed when I knocked at the door; her husband was not there - she said he was gone down into the country; I found this pair of shoes under her bed: I found one port wine-bottle, a dark-lantern, this hammer, with a crow-bar at the end of it, this little saw, and a little whistle - I found nothing more; I took one of the duplicates to Butcher's, at Brentford, and found two coats: I observed some pattenmarks on the gravel-walk under the window which was broken; the window is about three feet from the ground: there is a back door to the house, near the window - there is no out-house or privy between the back door and where the patten-marks were on the gravel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether there are any female residents in the house? A. There is one female servant; I have not compared any pattens belonging to Shaw with the marks - I found nothing else to indicate that a woman had been there; I found no pattens in Shaw's house: search has been made for her husband, but we have not been able to find him - she did not say the lantern and things belonged to her husband; I did not ask her.</p>

About eight o'clock on the Tuesday morning, in consequence of something the man-servant told me, I went back to the house at Hillingdon, and observed that the house had been broken open; I had seen it shut up before I left, and saw the back-parlour window secure - I observed some patten-marks on the gravel-walk, which I had never seen before in my life; there is no out-house or building that a female might put pattens on to go to - I myself have no pattens: I missed every thing out of the drawers; they were very much broken indeed, and all the things turned out in my bed-room; the cellar was locked up on the Monday, and the key put into my bed-room drawer - I found the beer-cellar door standing wide open; I missed a large cheese and a great deal of wine, some table and bed linen out of the drawers, and from different places in the house, shirts, coats, and a variety of other things.</p>

I did not know the prisoner till he came to me on the 14th of January, between one and two o'clock, to order four Spanish wood bedsteads for a West India order; I keep an open shop - there was nobody but myself in the shop; he asked me the price of four which were in the shop - they came to 24l. 10s.; he said they were to be very carefully packed and delivered at the West India Docks, to Captain Wilson - the packing was to be 12s. more; he said he would write out an invoice on the day I took them to the Docks - he said Captain Wilson was very busily engaged, and if I did not see him, I need not fear having my money, for the Captain would be on 'Change or Cornhill, and I was to meet him the same day, at four o'clock, at the Jerusalem Coffee-house- I went and met him coming out of the coffee-house; he said Captain Wilson was very busily engaged in the Committee-room at Lloyd's; he took me over there - he had desired me to bring the difference of a 30l. note with me, which I did: when he got me into the passage at Lloyd's, he said on the stairs, "Have you got the bill?" I said Yes- he said, "Then give it to me, as the Captain is busily engaged in the Committee-room, you cannot see him;" I gave him the bill - he said, "You wait here, and I will go and see the Captain - I will be back in a minute or two;" he came back in about ten minutes, and said, "Have you got the change for a 30l. note? I said, "I don't think I have, but the bankers are all open, and I know a banker's where I can get it if you will give me the note;" he said that would not do, I could go home and get it: I put my hand into my pocket and gave him 4l. 16s. - he said that would do, and he would call in the morning for the 2s.: he had a quantity of papers in his hands, and was writing with a pencil; he took the change and took no notice about the 30l. note, but turned round on his heels, and was walking away; I tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Where is the 30l. note?" - he said, "God bless me. I will fetch it in a minute, I was going for it;" I began to suspect then, and told him so - he said he could be trusted with 500l.; he was going away and I said, "Mind you are not gone long;" he said, "I cannot be long," I at last said, "I won't let you go, I will have my money back;" he did not wish to give it me back - I collared him, and said he should not go, I would go to Captain Wilson with him; he said they would not allow me in there - he never took me to Captain Wilson; he struggled a good deal, but I kept hold of him. I have heard nothing more about the bedsteads; the money consisted of two sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns - I insisted upon having it from him, or I would take him be- the Lord Mayor; he said, "Oh, nonsense," but at last I said I must have my money back, and then there could be no harm in letting him go - he gave me my money, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; there were plenty of people passing - I took the handkerchief up, opened it twice, and carried it open in my hand ten or fifteen yards, when he came and seized me - he asked what I had got; I told him a handkerchief; I said "I picked it up, and if it is your's, tell me the colour" - plenty of people must have seen me pick it up; I did not say a person gave it to me.</p>

On Friday, the 9th of January, I met the prisoner, with a saddle and mud-boots on his head, about five o'clock in the afternoon, in Duck-lane, Westminster; I asked him where he got them; he said from a gentleman's horse in Regent-street - he wanted to leave it at Mrs. Palmer's, but she would not let him, and he took it away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You were on very bad terms with these men? A. No; I had not had a quarrel with Harber on the Saturday - he had, at various times, demanded money of me; I usually carried a brace of pistols with me, as I went up the green lanes - one Saturday night, five or six weeks before, the men were all drunk, and were very uproarious; Harber insisted upon having money I was certain he had not earned - he brought a mob of labourers, and swore he would not leave without money; I had a pistol, and I took it from under the cushion, and said, "If any man attempts to break the peace, it will be at his peril;" Harber, and about a dozen others, were in the room at the time, but that was all settled, and, I think, a week afterwards, he came to me and affected to be sorry for it; I did not consider myself in safety among them - I was not only in danger of my life, but my work was neglected; I said, "I think you are a good workman - I think the only apology that can be made, is, that you were drunk; I shall take no further notice of it, if you will go on with your work," and he went on; he left me on Saturday, the 13th of December - on the Friday afternoon, I said,"Harber, you will let me know at what price you will take the next adjoining house," and he said he would; I said, "I would rather let you do the whole house at a price, than at measuring value," and the next day I brought another plasterer on the ground; Harber took offence, and told my foreman he would work no longer, as another plasterer was brought on the ground - he received what money was appropriated for him, on the Saturday, and left; I saw no more of him till the Tuesday, when he and Lee came and insisted upon taking away some articles - I said I insisted upon nothing being removed; I happened to be in one of the buildings, and I saw Lee taking something - I gave him notice that I would have him taken as a common felon; he came again, and gave me some abusive language - Harber has no claim on me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Whose materials were the houses built with? A. Mine; I paid him so much per yard - the plaster of Paris was taken from the casting-room.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were building these houses, and found all the materials? A. Yes - the prisoners had nothing to do with the materials, but to use them; I never authorized them to carry any to their own houses.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Laing, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150074"/>make plaster; the prisoners worked on the premises; I saw Skinner there - I saw Harber and Lee in the casting-room; there was a little green box, with about three pecks of plaster of Paris in it, which the prisoners carried away - they went across the common, towards their house; they live together, down Hill-street - this was about five weeks ago to-morrow</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this? A. On Thursday, about eight o'clock in the evening; some of us worked quite late that night - my brother Robert was with me, no one else; I asked Harber where he was going to take it - he said down to the cottages; I watched him, but he did not take it to the cottages - Mr. Laing's houses are in the road, but he went past the cottages - I followed him to the first of the cottages; I do not know that he could see that I was following him; it was eight o'clock in the evening - I did not see him go to his own house; I saw the box again in the casting-room - that was three or four days before he left the prosecutor's employ; I did not tell anybody of this, till he had left Mr. Laing - I heard him say he would have nothing more to do with Mr. Laing; when Mr. Laing asked me, I told him - he asked me whether I had seen the prisoner take any plaster away; he said he would pay me for the day's work that I had lost - he did not say, "I will give you a shilling or two;" I have not told anybody that Mr. Laing promised to give me some money; he did not say any thing about a prison to me - it was a week, all but one day, after I saw it, before I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Laing directly or indirectly offer you any thing to tell him? A. No; I did not tell this before the prisoners were taken, because I thought they would hit me.</p>
               <p>MR. LAING. The value of a bushel of plaster of Paris is about 7s.; I never offered any bribe to Mead to tell me any thing about this, but I said I would pay him his day's work if he lost any time in my employ - he has been working two years on my premises, and has been regularly paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Harber under contract to work for nobody but you? A. That was the impression, but there was no contract.</p>
               <p>HARBER'S Defence. I never took any thing but to use in his employ; we did work at several different places on the premises.</p>

            . I am a surveyor, and was employed by Mr. Laing during the time Harber worked there; it was part of an understanding that Harber was to work for no one but Mr. Laing - there is an agreement to that effect; I wrote it out myself, at Mr. Laing's desire, in Mr. Laing's own agreement-book; Harber was to do the plaster work - I am not aware that it was immediately necessary for him to work at home; he brought originals of particular patterns from his own house, and if I had given him directions to put up a particular enrichment, it might have been necessary for him to have taken plaster to produce it: all the enrichments, with the exception of four, were furnished by him; Mr. Laing agreed to furnish all the materials, and it might have been necessary to take some home - as Mr. Laing's agent I should not have objected to it. During October and November there was work done off the premises, and I gave Harber orders to take materials for a particular job; I was not on the premises in December - I left about the 24th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever give Harber orders when he was taking it to his own house, to say he was taking it to the cottages? A. No.</p>

            . I live in Islington-terrace, and am a plasterer. I have known Harber eight or ten years - I have worked several times with him; when we want to do cast-work we generally take plaster home, and do it at home; I allow my men to do it - it is the general understanding of the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How came you to add this? A. Because I understand he is taken up for stealing a bushel of plaster.</p>

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. But if the person who has the charge of the plaster knows it, is that enough? A. Yes- my labourers often give it to the men.</p>

            . I have known Harber seven years; I have suffered plasterers to take plaster home, or to do it in building - it is the custom when men do not find the materials, to have it home, and sometimes they come to the shed and ask for plaster; they do not ask the master for it - it is necessary, in order to expedite business, that a person should do casting at home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is done openly, and the master knows of it? A. Not at all times; when the permission is once granted for a man to do cast-work at home. he comes and has it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A master plasterer: if I am working at a building, and want my men to do work at home, they are allowed to take it home, if they come to the shed for it - this applies only in cases where the men are doing work, labour; suppose I do work for a person who finds his own materials, then it is sometimes taken home.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live in Cromer-street. I have known Harber nearly seven years. If a master finds materials, and employs plasterers, it is very general for them to take a little home - if a man does the labour only, he is entrusted to take these things at times, when he thinks he wants them, and it would take half his time to go backwards and forwards to ask the master.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday. the 13th of December, on another charge; I searched Mr. Watson's apartment - there was scarcely any thing there; no sheets on the bed, and the drawers empty.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON re-examined. Q. Up to what period did the prisoner continue in the lodging? A. From the time I took them till he was apprehended; the officer took the key of my apartment from him: this property ought to have been there - I believe I have been there but twice since I had the lodgings; I think they were taken in May, but cannot tell when - I never had any other apartments; I have paid two or three quarters' rent, and there is one to pay.</p>

On the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking up and down the shop - the prisoner came in, and went about two thirds down the shop; she asked to see some Irish cloth- she had a white apron on; I saw her stoop down, and tuck it under the string - I shewed her some Irish cloth: she said she hoped it would be good, and bought seven yards of it, at 2s. 6d. per yard; she then requested me to shew her some inferior, and while I was shewing her that, a person was detected in stealing something - the prisoner said what a shocking thing it was that people did not know better; I saw a piece of calico at that time by the prisoner's side: she then requested me to shew her some muslin - I went for that, and when I returned the calico was gone; I saw something under her shawl, and told Mr. Graham - I continued to serve her, and took 2l. 4s. 7d. of her - I tied up the parcel, gave her change, and she went out; I followed, and told her she had something under her shawl, or in her apron, which she had no right to: I took her into the shop, opened her apron, and found these eleven yards of calico.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Mr. Graham's partner? A. He has none; this is one of our bills, but we have no such bills now - I believe we gave this to the prisoner; the parcel she had, occupied a considerable bulk - I tied it up; this calico was not in the bundle - I removed her from that part of the shop to another: I do not know that I made a mistake in making out this bill - my memory does not serve me for it: when she came back, she gave me the parcel of things she had bought, and desired me to send it home; I sent it immediately - she told me to send it to Trinity-lane, and to tell her husband what had taken place, as she had no one else to send.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you acquainted with him? A.About two years - I knew him all that time by the name of Lloyd; I never inquired for him by the name of Heath - I was at home with my step-father; the prisoner was introduced to me at home - I am sure of that; it was not at a dance - that was afterwards: I wrote what Mr. Lloyd told me and signed it - this was in Devonshire-street, six or seven months after we had been married, to the best of my recollection; I do not recollect when I dated the paper - I believe he had it dated backward; I wrote the date - I got about 80l.; that was laid out in the purchase of a milk-walk, which I carried on while he was at the attorney's office; the money did not all come into my hands, he took the gold and I was to keep the silver - I continued the milk-walk about three months; I took it in October - I signed the paper after that; he did allow me 15s. a week - he did not say if I would leave off drinking and improper company he would continue to allow it, but if not he would only allow me 8s.: I never kept improper company - I do not know of any gentleman who left tobacco on the chimney-piece; my uncle came to see me - I never visited his mother, Mrs. Heath, before I was married.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was introduced to the prosecutrix in September, 1824, at an assembly, in Ship-yard, Temple-bar; in consequence of unpleasant domestic occurrences, I occasionally spent my evening from home, and not wishing my friends to know I frequented so low a place, I took the name of Lloyd there; the prosecutrix did not know any thing relating to me till several months afterwards, though she resided in Devonshire-street, and I within half a mile of it - I mention this to shew the impossibility of my living there, and her not knowing how I was situated previous to Christmas, 1825; I told her my residence, name and every circumstance; I know it took place previous to Christmas, 1825, because her residence was then turned into a milk-shop, and told her while the front was being taken down; she knew this, though she comes to day and swears she knows nothing of it - it is for nothing but to extort money from me.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as Heath - he shewed me this paper on the 17th of September, 1826, the day but one after it bears date (read).</p>
               <p>DEAR LLOYD. - You may rest satisfied I will take no advantage of your having a first wife living, if we are married.</p>

               <p>Q. You remember this paper being shewn you? A. Yes, and I took a note of it in a memorandum-book - he desired me to note it particularly; he asked me to look at that letter, and remember that I had seen it - I did not make any mark on it; I have not my memorandum-book here; he did not dictate any memorandum - he desired I should remember it in case any thing should happen; I did not say the paper will speak for itself - here is the date on it; I read it, but did not ask why it was shewn me - I believe I told him it was felony to have a second wife; I do not know what he said.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were desired to notice the date of it? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you at Mr. Health's mother's in 1826? A. Yes, all the year - I saw Margaret Evans there in May that year - there was a child there very ill, and who is since dead; she asked if that was Mr. Heath's, and expressed great sorrow at its illness.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was in my service - he came on the 27th of April, 1828; he had left me before Christmas-day - I had a female servant, and it turned out that she was his wife; I gave him permission on Christmas-day to dine with my servants - in the course of that day two officers came to my house; I know this wafer-stamp, padlock, Morocco ring-case, and rake to be mine - I believe the poker and tongs are mine; I never gave the prisoner authority to take any of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had lived in your service? A. Yes, and his wife continued up to Christmas-day; I discharged him on the 9th of September - I did not miss these articles till I saw them at three o'clock in the morning of the next day, in the officer's possession - some of them might have been stolen between the 9th of September and Christmas-day, but some of them I saw after the 1st of December; the prisoner came to the next house, and was admitted by a man who I keep as a gardener.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you discharged him, did you know he was married to the female-servant? A. No- I had seen this wafer-stamp on the 1st of December; he was well acquainted with the house; I had left him there for two months in charge with his wife: this cravat is mine - it has my name on it in full.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of visiting at your house? A. I forbade him the house till I discovered he was married, and then I told his wife he might come; he came the first time on the 14th of December, and then the second time on the 25th.</p>

On the 16th of December Carter offered me the sow for sale - it was black and white, with a black stripe over her shoulder, and a piece out of her ear; I think it was between one and two o'clock: Carter said a man had been distrained upon for rent, and he had separated the sow from her pigs - I said I would have nothing to do with it; he said I should have her at any price I chose in a medium way - he did not say where she came from.</p>

               <p>"I am your prisoner, it is me that has done it, take me to the watch-house" - he said,</p>
               <p>"There is the pistol, pick it up;' I picked it up, having hold of him at the same time - it laid about three or four yards from where he stood; a watchman came to my assistance - the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but it appeared to me that he was quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How near were you to the two persons when the pistol was discharged? A. I think seven or eight yards from them - I had both the persons distinctly in my view at the time I saw the pistol discharged - I saw the flash, but did not see in whose hand it was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, for ought you know. the woman might have discharged it herself? A. That I cannot say - they were both walking together: whether she had hold of his arm I cannot say - I did not notice whether the man was reeling or not; it appeared to me that he was perfectly sensible when I spoke to him, and when he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he spoke to you, was it as a steady and collected man; or was it in an agitated, frantic state? A. He stood perfectly straight when I took him by the collar- he did not appear the least agitated or disturbed, not at that time - I saw them for about a minute before the pistol was fired, or not quite so long. I said on the former trial I heard the man speaking, but could not hear what he said; he seemed to be in a rage.</p>
               <p>Q. After your gave your evidence the girl's deposition was read? A. Yes; she said he was very rude - that he spoke to her and seemed in anger.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long was it that you had an opportunity of seeing them, previous to the pistol being fired? A. About a minute; I do not recollect seeing anybody near them when the pistol was fired.</p>

            . I am constable of the night of Mary-le-bone. On the night of the 17th of December the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, charged with shooting a woman in Crawford-street; I asked what he had to say; he said that was best known to himself; I went to see him about ten minutes after that - he said nothing then; I went a second time in about a quarter of an hour, and he said he had done the deed, and inquired how his Mary was - he said she had been his ruin; he was not sober, nor was he to say drunk; he had been drinking - I received a card from him, with his address on it; I took it from him in searching him, before he was locked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he deliver you the card? A. No, I took it from him; when he came to the watch-house he looked very wild - he did not laugh when he came there that I recollect; he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to the watch-house did he present the appearance of a man in an agitated, disturbed state of mind, or one who had committed such an act, and was making a bravado of it? A. No; he appeared wild - he looked like a man that was wild, and who had committed a great act - that disturbed appearance continued while he was in my view, and when I went to him in the lock-up place he appeared the same; nothing but his card and a knife was found on him; when he was brought in, I asked what he had to say for himself; he stood upright - he did not ramble about as a drunken man would - his wild appearance made me suspect he had been drinking; I attributed his wild appearance to liquor, and the act together.</p>

On Wednesday evening last I met him at ten minutes after six o'clock, at the corner of Woodstock-street and Oxford-street, at a public-house; he was there first - I staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, while he drank a glass of gin and water - I then went with him down Orchard-street, to Salisbury-mews; he wished me good night, and said he should go and have a pint of ale, and asked me to go with him, which I did; I went to the Bee Hive, in Crawford-street - I staid there with him till a quarter-past nine o'clock - we were in a back parlour there; he had two pints of ale and a pipe: when I left the Bee Hive I went with him to Gloucester-place, he was going to bid me good night there; he was in liquor, and I thought I would see him to Crawford-street - I did not know where he lived: we went up Baker-street, by the New-road, and back again to Gloucester-place; I stood talking with him in Gloucester-place about a quarter of an hour - it was then almost ten o'clock: we then went round into Thornton-place, and there he would have a pot of ale, at No. 4, Thornton-place - as we were coming out the watchman went"Past ten," we then went back into Crawford-street - we were talking together; I was telling him not to go into a public-house, but to go home - he said he would: he told me he lived towards the City - I told him I would go as far as Baker-street and Crawford-street; I asked him if he knew where he was - he said No, but he said he was going down Regent-street; I think he had been drinking when I first met him- when we were last in Crawford-street he could hardly walk straight; he was very wild in his behaviour: I asked him to write to me - he said be would. I was pursuading him to go home; he said he would see me back, and find his way himself - I went as far as the corner of Spring-street; I had hold of his right arm: I was outside, nearest the curb-stone, when I was shot; I said,</p>

               <p>"and I ran over to a baker's-shop - I did not see the pistol, or the person who shot me; Mr. Bushell, the surgeon, came to me at the baker's-shop, and brought me here - I did not see any other person near me when I was shot, except a watchman. When I first saw him at the play-house, he asked me if my name was Davis.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Many persons before myself have stood in the awful situation in which I am now placed, but, perhaps, no one in the same perplexing circumstances; for although I have the life of a fellow creature to answer for, I solemnly declare that I never had the least intention of injuring any other person than myself. I had been for some time in a very distressing and unsettled state of mind, arising out of some pecuniary disappointments and family disputes, and these matters had so unsettled my understanding, and overcome my reason, that I looked forward to an act of suicide as the only resource left me; this I had meditated for some time, and have more than once expressed my intention indirectly to some parts of my family, and this long before my unfortunate meeting with the deceased, against whom I had no sort of hostility - I never had the least dispute or difference with her, and could have no possible, or even imaginary, motive for seeking to do her the least injury, and much less to deprive her of life, in so shocking a manner. I came to town with an intention of using the pistol against myself, and endeavoured to borrow from intoxication the resolution necessary for effecting my purpose. Of the fatal transaction I have no recollection whatever: my memory sunk under the influence of the excess of liquor I had drunk, and I do not remember any thing of the occurrence; but I am certain that I could not have meant to destroy the deceased - I must have intended to have carried my original intention against myself into effect, and not to have destroyed an innocent and unoffending person. The deceased herself, in her deposition, bears me out in the statement, that no dispute or angry words had ever occurred between as- all had been in perfect good humour up to, and even at the very moment, when the pistol was so fatally discharged; and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150085"/>may hope, perhaps, not to be considered so lost to every thing human, as, without any sort of provocation, to have committed so dreadful an offence. Tired of life as I have been, and awfully situated as I now am, I resign myself into your hands, with the most implicit reliance on your justice and humanity - only troubling you further, with assuring you of the deep and endless regret which I must ever feel, while any sense remains to me, at having been, though quite unconsciously, the means of terminating the existence of the unhappy victim of my lamentable frenzy.</p>

            . I am a journey man tailor, and live in Upper Rosamond-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner upwards of two years; he was a very steady young man, industrious, and well behaved; his conduct has not undergone any change till within these last two or three months: he has since that seemed very curious in his talk and manner to what he has been before - his mind has appeared affected for within a month of this transaction; from the conduct he has evinced for the last two or three months, I think his mind is subject to occasional fits of derangement; I dined with him on the day this accident happened - he was very curious in his manner, and made a dreadful noise; he did not appear to have the command of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about suicide? A. He was talking once about a man who shot himself going into Regent's-park; the newspapers called him a gentleman - he said he wondered, if he shot himself, whether they would call him a gentleman; he left me about five minutes past five o'clock - we had had two pints of ale, and a glass of gin and water between us; I cannot say whether he had taken any thing before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing particular to you that afternoon? A. Yes: he forced me to take dinner with him at last; he said I had better dine with him - I refused at first; he pressed me, and said it might be the last I might eat with him - I asked why? but he gave me no answer; I did dine with him at the Mitre tavern, St. Martin's-lane, and just before dinner he made a groaning noise with his mouth; I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better not make that noise;" he said, "Oh, nousense!" I felt ashamed of him, as there were people in the room, and took very little notice of him; when he left me at five o'clock, he said he was going to his brother's, and would meet me at a quarter before nine o'clock that evening again, at the same house - I went there, but he did not come; from his conduct that day, and from what I had seen of him before, my opinion is he was not in his right mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you conceive him incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong? A. I think he was not in a state to be trusted by himself; I said, "Shall I go with you?" be said No: I pressed him to let me go, but he would not.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. He pressed you to dine with him, you mean he invited you? Q. Yes; I suppose he paid for the dinner, but I did not see him pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do every thing as far as you saw, like a rational man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you work? A. At Mr.Burchart's, Clifford-street, Bond-street; the prisoner lived at Greenwich, but came backwards and forwards, and I have gone down there on a Sunday; I never thought of calling in a medical man to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think he could distinguish between right and wrong? A. That was on this Wednesday that I noticed it so particularly.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the most particular thing you noticed, his pressing you to dinner - did you think that an act of derangement? A. No, but the way he went on talking; he said if he could not get his bread one way, he could another - he could get it at brush-making, or could write with his right hand or left.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Before you observed this alteration, was he a man of mild humane conduct? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Mitre public-house, and have known the prisoner seven or eight months - he belongs to a society of tailors, which is held at my house; I noticed nothing particular in his conduct when I first became acquainted with him, but on the Monday that he came up from Greenwich, he had left his mother's, and came up to take his certificate from the house - he was talking to several people in the parlour, and on the Tuesday he was talking to a gentleman in the parlour, about a gentleman shooting himself in a hackney-coach; they had called him a gentlemen in the papers - he said to one of the tailors,"Do you think if I was to shoot myself, they would style me a gentleman?"</p>
               <p>Q. Was this observation made in a wild agitated manner, or calm? A. Why I think he had drunk a glass or two of ale: I thought he was in a deranged state of mind on the Wednesday - he came in between twelve and one o'clock I think; he came into the bar, as he was allowed to do, and took some bread and cheese, and had three or four glasses of ale - he went into the parlour to see the rest of the gentlemen, and had a glass of gin there; he and Pearson dined together about half-past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of his conduct did you consider him deranged? A. He had two pints of ale, and a glass of gin and water before dinner; he came into the bar again about five o'clock, and asked me for a bundle - he untied it, took out a pair of shoes and said, "I am going to give these to my brother, but suppose I shall get up thanks for them;" I said, "You are talking strange to-day, what is the matter with you?" he said he was lost - he should not be lost neither, for he had three or four trades to his hand; my wife said he was tipsy - I said No he was not; I asked what trade he was before - he said he was a clerk, a tailor, a brushmaker, and a packing case maker - that he had travelled to Old Ford, and if he travelled as he had done, he could get his living.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From this you judge he was insane? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was this said in a calm manner? A. He was walking backwards and forwards in the bar, and appeared to be strange.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he pay for his dinner? A. No - I thought nothing of that; he never ran a score with me, but made it a rule to come to the bar and pay me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother: I have lately discovered a difference in his conduct and habits on Friday, the 12th of December, he called on me, and appeared very wild; that was the first time I had seen him for six months - he then appeared much agitated, and told me I was not to be surprised to hear of his death, for he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150086"/>certainly should make away with himself; I do not recollect his saying any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this appear like a calm and collected man, or as if he did not know what he was about? A. He had been walking about the room in an agitated state, and saying nothing, then turned round, and said, "Richard, you must not be surprised to hear of my death, for I certainly think I shall put an end to myself?"</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his intellects about him then? A.He had; I did not think him insane.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Belton-street, Longacre, and am a costermonger. In December last, I sold a donkey and cart to Aaron, by his mother's desire; the prisoner was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the mother desire you to sell it? A. About a month, or five weeks before that, she met me in Crown-street; the boy said, "That's the donkey and cart;" she said to me "Is this the donkey and cart you want to sell?" I said Yes; she asked what I wanted for it - I said, 3l.: she said Pooh, she would give no 3l. - I said, then she need not alarm herself about it, I could keep them, and she could keep her money; she went away about fifty yards - the boy then came back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Say you will take 2l. 10s. for it, and mother says she will have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150088"/>it:" I said, "No, your mother shall not have it for less than 2l. 12s.;" he said he would give me the 2s. out of his own pocket, and I could give him a receipt for 50s.: that he would come for it at night, and he accordingly came at night, and said his mother and aunt wanted to see it in Piccadilly- I sent my servant for some Duke's groom to look at it, to see if it was worth the money: they brought it back, and said it would be bought.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take 2l. 7s. for it? A. Why I was distressed; I did not sent to say he should have it for that; when he bought it, he brought it back to my stables two nights, and after that took it to Hopkins-street; he was to pay me 1s. 6d. a week for keeping it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you give this account before the Magistrate? A. Yes, part of it; the Magistrate would not hear the whole; I did not know the prisoner before, and am no friend of his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to represent that you wanted to tell the Magistrate all this, and he would not hear it? A. Yes; he said he did not want to hear it all - that I must find bail.</p>

            . I was before the Magistrate; the witness said the prosecutrix had been to him about purchasing the donkey and cart previously; he did not state about the 2l. 12s.: the Magistrate said he had heard enough - he might convince the Jury about her going to him.</p>
               <p>MRS. DUNDERDALE. I met him promiscuously coming down Crown-street, but I never spoke to him: I did not ask if it was the donkey and cart he wanted to sell, or what he wanted for them, or make him any offer; I said nothing whatever to him: I was fifty yards from him when my boy was talking to him: on my solemn oath I had no conversation with him.</p>

            .

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS, Q.Was he to keep it for you? A. It was to stand in his stable - he said he would keep it two or three days for me; I do not recollect that I was to pay him: for the keep, but he said the day after that I was to pay him: a boy who worked for him got me a stable in Howard-street, which I was to pay half a crown a week for: I was to give Anderson 1s. 6d. for the stable alone - I did not take it away one night before I bought it: his boy asked me to say I was going to shew it to my aunt, because he wanted to shew it to another boy, and I did so.</p>

On the day previous to the robbery, Sullivan was in my company all day; I can prove I never saw the boy - when he says he met me, I was going to the Dispensary, when he came up and asked me to pawn the clothes; I asked whose they were: he said he was sent to pawn them; I went in, and gave him all the money - he insisted on my having some drink: I went and had some rum, and then did not know what I was about - he made me go to the play: I said I had no money, and he lent me three half-crowns; I persuaded him all I could to go home, but could not, as he said he was going to buy a donkey in the morning; and being afraid he would be robbed, I remained with him all night, and in the morning went with him to buy the donkey.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you keep the house after this? A. Only two days, and as soon as I left I sent the servant home to Ireland - I am quite sure the prisoner is the man; the week before last Mr. Hoskins, the Magistrate sent for me - I found the prisoner in charge; I now live in the country - it was a gold watch, and worth 5l.; it was a present - it cost more than 5l.; I have had it, I believe, seven years.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; I believe the house is in the parish of St. James, Clerknwell. On Friday, the 26th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our house; he knocked at the door, and said he wanted apartments - I went up and shewed him the first-floor; I was up stairs with him a few minutes - he came down with me, and said he supposed I should like a reference; I said I would take nobody without: he wrote his direction down - I have it here; this is it: he wrote it in my presence, "Mr. Martin, No. 4, Chadwell-street:" he asked when I could call for his character - I said, "This evening or to-morrow;" he asked if I could not come then with him, and as he was a stranger, and recollecting I had a French gold repeater on my mantel-piece, I asked him to step up into the second-floor, where my husband was, and where there was a fire, if he would wait there he would be more comfortable - I begged of him to follow me up stairs, saying there was no fire in the parlour; we were in the parlour when he wrote the direction - he wrote it on the table in the middle of the room: as I left the parlour I said, "If you please to follow me," he was then out of my sight - I had got to the foot of the stairs, and when I got to the first-floor he said, "Must I follow you?" I said Yes, and when he got up stairs he said, "I am thinking it is putting you a great deal out of your way, and if you will call on Sunday the landlady and I shall be at home; I agreed to do so - he took leave of my husband; I followed him to the street-door, and opened the door for him myself; at the door he told me he had forgotten one of his gloves, which he had left up stairs - I went into the parlour, thinking he might have left it there, and not thinking of my repeater I did not miss it at the moment; I came out of the parlour, not finding the glove - he then said, "Never mind;" I said, "Oh, Yes, I will go up stairs," and went up to the first-floor, but did not find his glove; I came down, and he was off - the milkman stood at the door: I went into the parlour, and missed my French gold repeater, which I am sure was there when he gave me his direction; there was a gold key to it, and a black string - it was worth between 9l. and 10l.; it was not our own - my husband is a watchmaker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was your proposal to go up and look for the glove? A. Yes; I did not go into the parlour to look for it at his request - I went in, thinking it might be there, and was then going up stairs; he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind" - if I had not gone up he could not have gone into the parlour again; he was in the house a quarter of an hour: he spoke very good French to my husband - I was in the room all the time; I saw the watch in the parlour when he was giving me the direction - we had had it about three weeks; if it had been English it would have been worth more - it has not been found.</p>
               <p>AMI AUGUSTE GANEVAL. The lowest value of the watch is 10l. - I speak as a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it old or now? A. It was not new, I suppose five or six years old - it was French work, and a single case.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would it cost when new? A. Fifteen pounds; the lowest value of it is 10l. - I suppose the maker would have a trifling profit at 15l.</p>

            . I am a milkman. I went up to the prosecutor's door to serve him with milk on the 26th of December; I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's door and run away; Mrs. Ganeval did not come to the door till he got out of sight. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150090"/>sure of the man? A. No, but I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>MRS. GANEVAL. This is the milkman I spoke to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, I certainly went to take lodgings at the prosecutor's house, and asked the person if it would be convenient to come for my character at that time; she said it was not exactly convenient, but if I wished it she would go, and would I walk up stairs while she got ready- I went up, and afterwards thought it would be troubling her, and said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will give you my address, and you can call" - in fact, the apartments were too dear, but I did not know how to make an excuse, after the trouble I had given her; as I came out I missed my gloveshe said she would go up stairs; I said, "Never mind, it is an old kid glove."</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. GANEVAL. Q. Where did I stand when you went up stairs? A. At the door-he had time to go and take the watch then; when I went up stairs he stood at the door-he could have gone to the mantel-piece and taken the watch before he followed me up stairs.</p>

            . On Wednesday evening, the 17th of December, this coat hung on the parlour door, between the parlour and shop - the shop was shut up about four o'clock; I had been into the yard, and as I came back, the prisoner stood in the shop, offering frying-pans for sale; I declined buying them; he sidled out of the shop - I missed the coat, looked round the door - post, and saw him on the pavement with it; I pulled part of it from him - he tustled with me for it; I called Stop thief ! my boy came out - a person came, and pushed him into the shop, he was secured - it was my husband's coat; he said he had done nothing.</p>

A.It was on a spring-lock; he must have pushed with violence to get in; I did not tell the Magistrate it was ajar: I saw the coat on you before you left the shop - it is a tailor's shop; I deal in brokering myself; he said, "Lord have mercy on me; what could I have done? and Oh, dear, what could the matter be? and "Oh, dear, don't hurt me;" I do not think he said he did it through distress - he talked foolish.</p>

On the 16th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in the shop; the prisoner came in to beg - he took a piece of sheeting-cloth, and went away with it; I immediately followed him to the corner of Aldermanbury Postern - I called Stop thief! and he was stopped before I lost sight of him; I saw the cloth fall off his shoulder directly I called Stop thief! it was delivered over to the officer - he said he had done nothing, and what did I detain him for.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Are you certain it was in the shop? A. It was six feet within the shop - just against the inner door in the lobby.</p>

On the 17th of November the prisoner came in, and said he was very thirsty, and wished me to fetch him a pint of porter, which I did; I was gone about five minutes - these things were in a box down stairs; he went away about ten minutes after I brought him the porter - it was about twelve o'clock in the day; I did not miss the things till next day - there were other things in the box; nobody but the prisoner had been in the house - my friend came home about an hour afterwards; I remained there myself till I missed the things - the house was secure at night - I found it so next morning; I saw the things when he was in custody two months after - there was nobody in the house to take them but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did you meet the prisoner in the street at your first acquaintance, and he go home with you? A. No; he promised me marriage, but I discovered after he was taken up that he has a wife - I understood so before he was taken; I cannot say I was ever particularly fond of him - I gave him several things to send down into the country ready for our marriage; these are not those articles, and what I did give him was for our own use, not to run away with - I never slept with him in my life; I once lived servant in Noble-street, Foster-lane he was not allowed to come in there; he visited me frequently at Mrs. Powell's - I did not give him these things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You gave him some other things for your common use, expecting to become his wife? A. Yes; these were taken without my knowledge.</p>

On the 15th of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock at night, I was coming down Ludgate-hill, and saw the prisoner standing against Mr. Plumley's shopwindow - I did not know his person before; I am quite sure he is the person - he turned his head round and looked about him - I was on the same side of the way, about two doors off near to Fleet-street; there was nobody near him - all in a moment I heard glass crash; he directly sprang from the window, and ran across the road to the Albion office, down Bridge-street, and I after him - he went through the coach-stand, and somebody on the other side of the way stopped him; an alarm had been given by several persons hallooing out Stop him! he kept running, and I lost sight of him for about two minutes; two young men brought him up towards the market - I knew him again, and am certain of his person; I laid hold of his left side, and took him to St. Bride's watch-house - I left him there, and went on duty; I did not see him searched - I went to Mr. Plumley's shop, but did not see the property found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the man? A. I am; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SINFIELD. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Plumley - he has no partner; I have lived with him and his father nearly forty years. I was in the shop when the window was broken - I heard a crash, looked round, and saw a man's hand in the window; I ran out, and before I could get out the party was gone - on looking over the window we missed a cushion with diamond pins and brooches worth between 30l. and 40l.; two of the pins have been found since - Mr. Plumley picked up one, and I believe a witness another; the house is in the parish of St. Bride.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not Mr. Plumley in partnership with Mr. William Davis? A. Not in the business on Ludgate-hill, I believe; but am not certain - Mr. Davis does not assist in the business; he never lived nor lodged in the house - it is entirely occupied by Mr. Plumley.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIMMAN. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Fleet-street. I was crossing Bridge-street about a quarter to eight o'clock on the 15th of January - an alarm was raised, and I saw the prisoner running down Bridge-street very swiftly - he was the person pursued; several people behind him were calling Stop thief! I pursued him into Crescent-place; and finding there was no thoroughfare there, he was returning, when I put my hand on his arm and secured him - I am certain he is the same person I saw pursued, and running from the cry - he made no resistance; I asked him what he had been about; he answered, "Why, I have only broken a window; let me go" - I am certain he said that; other persons came up, and he said "Take me quietly, don't make a noise" - I went to the watch-house, but did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SHORT. I am an engraver, and live in Bride-lane. I was crossing Bridge-street, at a quarter to eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner running, and people calling Stop thief! he turned up Crescent-place - I followed, and he was taken; I saw one pin picked up, about the centre of the crescent, which is no thoroughfare - two diamond pins were found there; I saw one picked up, and saw one after it was picked up - Mr. Plumley claimed them.</p>
               <p>HENRY WAKE. I live in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street: the prisoner was brought to the watch-house to me - I am the night-officer; I found nothing on him - I went out with a lantern; Mr. Plumley, and the watch-housekeeper went down Bridge-street, into Crescent-place - and halfway up Crescent-place, I picked up a diamond pin, and a few yards from me, Mr. Plumley picked up another, and claimed them both.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FREDERICK BOOTH. I am an inspector of St. Bride's. I was in the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; I found none of the property on him - I went with the night-officer to Crescent-place, and saw one of the pins picked up by Mr. Plumley.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live on Ludgate-hill, in the parish of St. Bride's. I was not in the shop at the time this happened, but heard of it almost immediately; I stopped at the window to take care of the property - I afterwards went to the watch-house, and then to Crescent-place, and, as near the spot as possible he was stopped at, I picked up two diamond pins - Wake, the officer, has the other; they are two of the pins which were on the cushion in my window - the value of those two is about 5l.; the value of all on the cushion is near 40l. - I have no partner in the business on Ludgate-hill; I have a partner in a wholesale jewellery concern, but none in the shop: it is my sole property - there were eleven pins and two brooches.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ in June last; he left in July, without notice - it was his duty to solicit orders and to receive money, which he was to hand over to me immediately on his return; I never received from him these three sums, from Mr. Woodward - I received this letter from him; I have seen him write, and believe it to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOODWARD. The prisoner called on me for 2l. 3s. 6d.; on Mr. Poole's account, which I paid at the time I received the goods from him; I only recollect one date, which was June 13, when I paid him 2l. 12s. 2d. - I also paid him 1l. 13s., but I cannot tell the day; I am certain I paid them all to him</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150093"/>but 26s. a week to support a wife and six children, and that having lost 10l. of the prosecutor's money, he had appropriated these sums for it, intending to make it up as early as possible.(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>SIR, - In consequence of my mind being in the state it has been, by my having received the three sums of Mr. Woodward, which are, 2l. 3s. 6d., 1l. 13s., and 2l. 12s., and Mr. Bird 7s. 6d., in consequence of not being able to make Mr. Woodward's money up, has distressed my mind to the utmost, but I will pay you, if I work day and night; you will prove, on Monday, this is all I have received, when you call on the customers.</p>
               <p>August, 1828.</p>
               <p>MR. POOLE. He has always told me he had only two children, and only one of them is his own; I never heard of the loss of 16l,, till at Marlborough-street, the other day - he never told me he had had this loss; I have no recollection of his paying me 18l. the day before he left, but I will not swear he did not - he was in my service seven or eight months; I had a good character with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When did he leave your employ? A.Two or three days before the 16th of December; on that day I saw him and Lee on my premises, from nine o'clock till twelve in the forenoon - there were a number of men on my premises: I had some plaster of Paris ornaments in the casting-room, one of which was locked up for safety; the prisoners went in at the window - I had heard that they had said they insisted upon having some things from the premises: that was on the morning of the 16th; they did not say certain models- they said certain articles manufactured from wood; they then went off the premises, and took some articles - I threatened that if they came back I would give them in charge.</p>
               <p>- SKINNER. On the 16th of December I saw the prisoners take some ornaments from the casting-room -Harber told me not to say any thing about it; it was in open day, and all the men were about.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LAING. Q. What did they allude to in the things they threatened to take away? A. Some rules and laths which they had to do their work, not ornaments; they said certain trestels belonged to them - I said, "Whatever belongs to you you shall have hereafter, but I am not aware that they do, as I have been charged in my surveyor's account for many things made by my materials;" there was no allusion to any ornaments.</p>

I have done nothing;" I said, "You are one of them" - he said, "I have done nothing;" when I first saw them they were about three times the length of this Court from the prosecutor's: they went up Caroline-place, and to the top of the Alpha-road.</p>

            , JUN. I know this gander - it is my father's. The prisoner lives about five hundred yards from us; she came to me, and said she intended to make a full confession of all that had transpired, and that her son, who was committed for stealing rabbits, was not the person who stole this gander, but another son, nine years of age; I said it was very odd that such a boy should be able to get out the geese, when one weighed 22lbs.; she said her boy came to her on the evening of the 15th of November, and said a man had thrown two ducks over a fence, from and alley - she gave him a bag, and he returned with one goose - that she never saw but one, and the reason she did not tell us, but took it to sell, was that her eldest son had told her Mr. Green was a very severe man, and he would hang her if she took it back, and that she sold it for 6s. in Leadenhall-market; this was several weeks after the ganders were missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was several weeks after it was lost? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>EBENEZAR HOWARD. I am a poultry-salesman of Leadenhall-market. On the 17th of November I saw a woman there, with a goose to sell; I cannot swear it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a poultry-salesman of Leadenhall-market. On the 17th of November Mr. Howard took me to his shop, and said a woman had a goose, which he thought would suit me - I went, and saw a woman very much like the prisoner, with an old red cloak on; I told her to bring the goose to my place - she asked 8s. for it; I said it would not suit me - I said I would give 6s.: she went away, came back, and took 6s. - she asked for a bit of paper, that she might satisfy her employer that she sold it for no more - this is the goose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it a goose or a gander? A. I have never been so learned as to distinguish, but judging from the size, I should call it a gander; I have not bred geese.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL NATHAN. I bought a gander of Mr. Edmunds - I sent it home to my house; Mr. Green's servant, and some other persons came and said they had lost one - I returned it to them; I should not like to swear this is it.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner told the Magistrate that there were ten respectable people in the tap-room, where the harness laid for two hours, exposed, and that the landlord, landlady, and their neice saw it; he was remanded, to give him time to send for them - I said, "If you will give me their names I will go for them:" he said he would send for them himself: the next day he said he had been locked up, and could not send to them; I had a summons to get the publican - he said that the same two men had been there with a lot of things in a bag - his wife told them that the prisoner was taken, and they went away - that he himself never saw the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold the harness, but I was never near the prosecutor's; I was at home in bed at the time - I have not been out of my own bed at night since last Easter Monday.</p>
               <p>MARY JONES. I am a widow, and live in Turnmill-street; I go out to work. I have known the prisoner three or four years - he lived in the next room to me; I was in the habit of making his fire and going to clean for him. -On the 9th and 10th of December he was in bed at nine o'clock in the morning, and as far as I can recollect, on the 8th the same; I remarked that he was later in bed than ever I knew him - the 8th was Monday; I was going out to wash at ten o'clock - he was not up at nine.</p>
               <p>HENRY SHELDRAKE. This is the prisoner's wife - she has been to me three times, for a bag and some other things - she told me she was his wife, and was sent by his authority for the things; I said I would have a note from the Magistrate before I would give them up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you told all the story? A.No, not all: I did recommend him to a friend up stairs - he went up, and stopped about ten minutes; I was in my room that ten minutes, but did not miss my shawl from the sofa - my friend has absconded; she did not come to my door: I do not know that she is a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you go to a public-house and see him there? A. Yes; I went to the watchman, and asked if he could go in and take a felon out - he said, No, but he would take him when he came out; I went in, and the landlord insulted me grossly - he said he never saw me.</p>

            . I live at Kingsbury. On Christmas night the prisoner was in my service: the officer came, and apprehended her husband that night; I went with him to the room where the prisoner and another female servant slept - the prisoner's box was searched, and the articles here produced found in it; I know these articles to be my husband's - it is our custom to have bells hung to the shutters; I do not hang them - on Christmas-night the man was taken, and I had all the servants' boxes searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you missed these things? A. No. not till the box was searched; the prisoner's husband had lived in the house before - we did not know at that time that they were married; he had been discharged on the 9th of September, and had been forbidden the house; but when my husband heard they were married he gave him leave to come, and he came once or twice; the box was not locked - her husband may have gone into the room and she not have known it; he may have visited the house unknown to me.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At the time her husband was in your house, did he sleep there? A. No; he had no business in the bed-room of any of the female servants.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know how this box came to be searched? A. I believe she was asked if she had any objection to have it searched - that was in consequence of her husband being taken; I think I had seen this buckle about the end of September.</p>

On the 12th of January, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, and saw a woman's arm snatch something off my door-post; I saw her rush in, and take it; I did not know what it was; I called to my boy who was reading in the shop: he went and brought the prisoner back with the pelisse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How near to your shop was this pelisse? A. On a shelf inside my shop, about three feet from the door, which was open.</p>
               <p>THOMAS NORRIS. I was in the shop, and reading - my master called to me; I went out, and caught the prisoner two or three doors from the shop with this pelisse - I brought her back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was she searched? A. No; she had the pelisse on her arm under her shawl: it was about three feet from the door.</p>

               <p>CHRISTIAN PODZUS. I was at the watch-house, and took charge of the prisoner - she denied having taken it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I went to the oil shop for a candle, and just as I got to the door the lad came and stopped me with the pelisse in his hand: he said, "Where is that coat you have stolen?" I said "What coat?" he said "Here it is;" I went back with him, and his master gave me in charge - I had not been near the place.</p>

            . In consequence of information, I went to Proud's lodging, in Augusta-court, Laurence-street, Chelsea, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning of the 10th December: he had been apprehended the day before - I was informed in the house that was his room, and I found some pieces of wood in a box, which his wife unlocked - I believe they are called beadings or mouldings; in the kitchen in which Cooper lived, I found some mahogany; in a cellar under the stairs I found a large quantity of wood chopped up for fire-wood - I found these three pieces in a closet in the parlour; Cooper was not at home, but I left word for him to come to Mr. Cubitt's - he came, I left word for him to come to Mr. Cuasked him about the property - he said he had the mahogany from a lodger of his, who owed him money; I think he mentioned the name, but I forget it - he said he had had it several months; I think he said nine months; he said he did not know how these pieces got in the closet, but there was a piece of oak cill there which he had from the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Why did not you bring the cill here? A.Because we had a great deal to bring; we have not ascertained that it was not Mr. Cubitt's - I think Cooper came in about four hours after I left word; it is a single round house - there is but one kitchen.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Cubitt's, the builders - Proud was in their service as a labourer, and Cooper was in their service till within three weeks or a month; I swear to these two pieces of mahogany, as belonging to Messrs. Cubitt's, and these two pieces of ash I can swear to; Proud said he never stole a bit of wood before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What are you? A. A clerk - I have nothing to do with manufacturing any wood; we did not miss any, but supposed wood to be stolen at different times - I can match these pieces of mahogany with some on the premises; I am certain that these pieces formed part of another plank cut from the same log as this plank - the whole log was in Mr. Cubitt's possession, and has not been cut four months.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAPSON. I am in the employ of Messrs. Cubitt's - I make barrows. I know these pieces of ash they were in my possession; these form the leg of a navigator's barrow - these were one solid body at one time; this piece I have brought was taken out here - they match exactly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PROUD. I know of nothing but the pieces of moulding, and the bits of ash - I took them to make hammer handles; they would not lend me their hammers. Witness. He never had leave to do that to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When had you seen them on the premises? A.Never, till they were found at the prisoner's- I never saw them at my master's.</p>
               <p>JOHN TIPPETT. I am a joiner, in the employ of Messrs. Cubitt's. I have some moulding planes, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150098"/>which I believe these pieces of moulding were formed - they fit exactly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DENTRY. I am a sawyer to Messrs. Cubitt's. I sawed up this mahogany from a log on the 20th of August; these small pieces belonged to the same log as this plank does, I have no doubt.</p>

On the 20th of December, this waistcoat was stolen from a back-yard; I had seen it three quarters of an hour before it was taken - on Friday, the day before the loss, the prisoners came and asked me if I could tell them where they could lay down on a little clean straw; I told them to go to the ostler's, who I thought would give them a lodging - this is the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by J. ALLEY. Q.Where was the waistcoat? A.On a line; my son William is eighteen years of age - I did not see them take it; on the Saturday, they came and stood talking to the same young man they had before; he gave me information - I live next door to the Bell public-house, at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>JOHN EMERSON. I took up the prisoners, near the Wellington public-house, about two miles from the prosecutor's; I found the waistcoat in Hickey's pocket - he said next morning that he took it, but he wished he had had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did not Hickey say he would rather pay for it than go to Newgate? A. Not in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did not you give me 1s. besides the 1d.? A. No, I had no 1s.</p>

I have no spite against them; they are very quarrelsome - they are a set of tinkers.</p>

I went out to get the price of my sister's lodging; I got 1s. 2 1/2d., and was going home, this boy came and said, "Give me my money:" I said, "What money do you mean?" we passed four watchmen before he gave me in charge - there was another woman on the other side of the way; he said at first he that did give me the shilling - the watchman knows it.</p>

               <p>JAMES BIRCHALL. I am an officer and took the prisoner- he said he had hard work to get the handkerchief out; that he saw them eating some dinner in the cookshop, and he thought he would take the handkerchief to get some.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He says he saw me following him, and I was looking into a cookshop; I saw his handkerchief hanging partly out of his pocket and it was pinned with this pin - I took hold of it to make him ashamed of himself for having it pinned; I saw the people eating and making mouths one at another, and I thought I would have some. <rs id="t18290115-227-verdict1223" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>SAMUEL BUBB. I am errand-boy to Mr. Barnett. I was standing facing his window, to mind some baskets; I saw three lads round the window - the prisoner pulled out his hand, and had something in it; I ran after him, and a gentleman caught him just past the window - nothing was found on him; he threw it down, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What were you doing? A.Minding some baskets - I had never seen him before, he had a hat on; I did not notice whether it was a hat or a cap; I looked at the other boys as well - the whole business took a minute or two; I did not loose sight of him - no one told me to say that it was not day-light; it was not a black cap he had on - it was a hat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Do you believe now, that he is the man? A. Yes, I know he is the man.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ALLEN. I was going up the road and saw the ribbon lay; a woman took it up and was putting it under her cloak; I said to Mr. Barnett "Does this belong to you?" and the woman passed the ribbon from her hand to mine to give to the prosecutor; I turned round, and she was gone; I did not see the prisoner - they were running after him.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEA. I am an officer. I heard Stop thief! called, and was sent for to take the prisoner, who was then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What they have said is false, you may depend upon it; I was walking down Baker's-row, and was taken by two men who are not here.</p>

               <p>JOB BRANCH. I am a gardener, and live at Maida-hill, Paddington. On the 12th of January I was in Lisson-grove, and met the two prisoners in company - they crossed the New-road and went down Stigo-lane; they then turned into Upper York-street, and went about forty yards to the left - there was a gig at the door of No.39; they crossed, looked into it, and went on towards Seymour-place- they appeared to speak to each other; Lindsey went up to the gig on the driving side, and took out a drab great coat - he turned the corner of Windham-place, and Green followed him; he threw the coat on his back, and they went on through several streets to George-street, Portman-square, Langham-place, Regent-street, and then turned into Oxford-street - as they went along they continued to look at the coat and to admire it; I met several patrols in Oxford-street - I spoke to them; Cost ran, and got ahead of them - they then cut across the road; I stopped them and said,</p>
               <p>"You must not go any further" -Cost then came up and said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you get that coat?" Lindsey said,</p>

               <p>"I bought it; I can tell you where, but I shall not" - the coat belonged to a visitor, who is gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A florist; my garden is at Maida-vale-I went to the house the next morning; the proprietor said it was a gentleman who called, and he knew nothing of him - the coat was taken between five and six o'clock in the evening; they were taken about half-past six - I never prosecuted a person before in my life; the prisoners did nothing to me - I have no prejudice against them.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty - Branch told me some persons had stolen a coat; I asked where it was, and he said they had got it on - I crossed the road, and they crossed; I returned, and took them into custody - I asked Lindsey where he got it; he said he had bought it - I took them to the office, and went in search of the owner; I found the house, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search them? A. My brother officer did; there were 13s. and a watch found on them.</p>
               <p>LINDSEY'S Defence. I was coming down the square, and met an elderly man dressed like a countryman who asked for relief; he had this coat, which he said he could not pawn and would sell it to me for 5s. - I put it on; it fitted me, and I gave him 5s. for it; I met this young man, and told him I had bought a coat - he was looking at it when these men came and took me.</p>
               <p>GREEN'S Defence. I met this prisoner; he said he bought the coat - we were walking home.</p>

            . I am in the coal trade, and live in North-bank, Lisson-grove. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and found two or three other neighbours, the prisoner and the prosecutor in dispute about a watch; the prisoner denied having it - the prosecutor spoke very positive as to her person, and wished to have her searched - she refused, but said she would go any where and he searched by a female - on the Thursday following, I found the watch in my garden, which is three or four doors off the spot.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Was the altercation on this side of your garden? A. I should presume she had passed my garden - I found the prosecutor, and went to him; I was not quite satisfied with his description of it, and I took it to the office.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS HARVEY re-examined. I believe the prisoner ran by Mr. Maddox's door; I am sure she took my watch- she said she was in distress, and that she lived in Park-street, Oxford-road; I was going to give her a few halfpence out of charity; if I were going to die, she is the woman who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard some one cry out Stop thief! there were two females at a gate, and they asked what was the matter; I said I did not know - the prosecutor took hold of me, and began to pull me about; I said I would not be searched by him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MAYERS. I am a constable; I live at Queen's-elms. I was in my shop at twenty minutes after eight o'clock on the 12th of January, and saw the prisoner with two large bundles - I followed him twenty yards, and then stopped him; I said, "What have you got there?" he said, "What is that to you?" I said, "I wish to know;" he said he brought them from his father in the creek - I took them off his shoulder; he twisted round, and ran away - I followed some distance, but I had my slippers on, and could not run very fast; in three-quarters of an hour he and his mother came, and wanted to have the property; I said No - I took him to the Magistrate, who ordered him to be confined; the victuals would not keep - I described it to the prosecutor.</p>

The prisoner brought this fork on the 2d of January, and asked 1s. 3d. for it; I asked her where she got it - she said a woman who went out charing every day, in Half Moon-street, gave it to her - and then she said a servant in Cecil-street gave it to her; I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MORGAN. I am the officer. I took the prisoner - she said a person in Cecil-street gave the fork to her, to get some tea and sugar; I said I would go to the place, and then she said she would take me to where she found it in the area.</p>

               <p>"That man used to lie in bed till ten or eleven o'clock:" we went, and found him with a pipe in his mouth, drinking some purl; he called him out, and said "This man has lost his money, you must know what has become of it:" he said he had not got it - the landlord said, "I shall not be contented - I shall send for an officer," and told me to stand by him; the prisoner kept walking from me - I followed him; he walked faster, and I laid hold of the flap of his coat; my landlord's wife then came up - the prisoner turned, and took my hold from his flap, and then he bolted; she followed him, crying "A thief, stop him!" and I followed him; he was stopped, and brought back - he handed the money over to the landlady- there was a sovereign, two half-crowns, and some small money, making 1l. 10s. 6 1/2d.; he is a labourer, and used to work up at York-house.</p>
