               <p>Q. Is the shop a part of the dwelling-house - A. Yes, it is. There is but one door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a noise was it - A. It was a noise like the ratling of shots against the window. Upon my hearing the noise I went out to the shop door, and I caught hold of this boy. I asked him what he was doing; I don't know that he made any answer. He did not go. A man came up and assisted me in taking him into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of articles were there in that shop - A. Hosiery, and clothes of different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you took him into the shop, did you examine the shop to see how it was entered - A. Yes; I put my hand in the hole, and observed the glass broke. The stockings were in a glass case. The hole was big enough to take out the stockings. We found the boy outside of the shop; I found no other boy there. The prisoner was standing close to the hole outside of the shop; we took him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him before you took him into the house - A. No, not till we took him into the house, and then we found one pair of stockings upon him; they had the shop mark; they are my husband's property. The prisoner was taken to the office the next morning; I was present at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this; was there day light enough to distinguish any human face without the assistance of candles - A. I cannot say; there might.</p>

Johnson returned to the mother again, and searched her, and found a quantity of bad coin; how much I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know when you parted with the shilling that you received of your sister - A. I parted with it the same evening to Johnson, the officer. I marked it before I parted with it.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the woman at the bar - A. I do; I have known her about a week before she was taken in custody. On the 15th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner, her daughter, and another woman, in St. Giles's; I followed them up Tottenham-court-road, and proceeded into Duke-street, Grosvener-square; I observed in my journey something in their hands. I saw them do a thing that I can describe before they came to Mr. Bird's house. I saw them take some money out of a paper and teare the paper, and chuck it in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you sufficiently discover that it was money - A. I saw it was something white; I was not near enough to discover it was money.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did that pass that you supposed to be money - A. From the prisoner. I saw them all go into Mr. Bird's house; I followed them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Miss Holman - A. I desired her to deal with them if they were so disposed. When I went in I heard the prisoner ask for something to drink, and saw her tender a shilling for the gin; Mr. Bird refused the shilling; the prisoner said, sir, it cannot be a bad one, take it to the light and look.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the gin came to - A. No.</p>




               <p>Mr. Bird. The glass of gin and a glass of mixed spirits came to sixpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I told Mr. Bird when he came into the light in the tap-room to keep the shilling, and I would go out and bring the prisoners into the taproom and search them. I brought the prisoners into the tap-room and searched them. In the first place I produce the shilling I received of Mr. Bird; he marked it, and I marked it; this is the shilling. I proceeded to search the prisoner at the bar, but hearing something fall from the girl I left the mother and picked the parcel up, which laid close by the girl's feet; the paper parcel contained four bad shillings. These are the four bad shillings; they have been in my custody ever since. At the time the parcel fell from the girl the prisoner was as far from the girl as I am from Mr. Shelton. I then proceeded on to search the mother; in the prisoner's pocket among some halfpence I found fifteen bad shillings, and two bad sixpences, two shillings good, one shilling and ten pennyworth of halfpence, and two good sixpences. I then went to search the girl; she requested to warm her hands; upon my going to the table I found a shilling close by.</p>
               <p>Q. to Miss Holman. Is that the shilling that you gave to your brother - A. I cannot say; I gave but one shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bird. That is the shilling that I received of my sister; I marked it, and the officer marked it.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. I am one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. I now put into your hand the shilling uttered by the prisoner to Miss Holman - A. It is a counterfeit; it is quite fresh finished.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Shew the fifteen counterfeit shillings to Mr. Nicoll.</p>
               <p>(Johnson handed them to Mr. Nicoll.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicoll. The fifteen shillings and the two sixpences are all counterfeits; they are of the same manufactory, and these that dropped from the girl are counterfeits, and of the same sort.</p>

I was; she was convicted of uttering counterfeit money, she was ordered to be confined in the house of correction one year, and to find sureties for her good behaviour, and she then was informed by the chairman that if she was guilty of a like offence she would be liable to a capital conviction.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the girl at the bar - A. Yes, I have no doubt of her person; she came to our shop on the 15th of March, she asked for a threepenny loaf; I gave it her. She gave me in payment a shilling; I gave her nine-pence, deducting threepence for the loaf; she went away.

Upon her coming out, I went in; I asked the boy; he produced a shilling; I saw it was a counterfeit shilling. I marked it. I told the boy to mark it; he did so. I followed the girl. She joined the mother in Oxford-street. She gave her mother the three-penny loaf; the mother put the loaf in her apron along with other articles that they had purchased.

There were four shillings. It was as if it came out of a paper. These are the four shillings; I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Ashley - A Yes, I have seen him write frequently. At the time I paid the bill of exchange I supposed it to be his hand-writing, but since I have altered my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at it now, suppose the bill had remained in your desk and you had not heard that it was a fraud - A. Why then it is possible that I might have paid it.</p>

             SIR,</p>
               <p>"Excuse the liberty a wretched being thus takes in presuming to address you. I dare not address any one else. I suppose you have heard that I am discharged from prison. I am afraid that it is of no use, as I am sure I shall be pursued. Do, for God's sake, inform me what will be likely to be my fate, if you know. Excuse me by sending her; let her see Mrs. Ashley; she is not to blame; it is me. Remember me jointly to all my friends, and believe me you will oblige your troubled friend,</p>
               <p>"W. H. BOTTERILL.</p>
               <p>"Would to God I had never known writing. If you think it best I will throw myself upon the mercy of Mr. Ashley and the bankers."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley, Q. to Phabe Evans. It was a great many days after the bill was written that you received that letter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t18140420-4-person102">Knapp, Q.</persName>
             to Mr. Voss. Do you know on what day you received that letter - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you give it to Collingbourne - A. I believe on the 29th of January, the same day I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Collingbourne. On what day did you receive that letter - A. On the 21st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Collingbourne, you are an officer of Union-hall - A. I am. I apprehended the prisoner twice. The first apprehension was on the 19th of January. I apprehended him in Baron's-buildings, at Mrs. Sinclair's. Mr. Ashley was present; he told him he was apprehended for this bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything about this bill of exchange - A. He did, on the second examination. I took him to Union-hall the next day, and then he was discharged. I afterwards apprehended him on the 28th or 29th, at Woolwich. When I apprehended him, he said I had him. I saw him pass; I ran after him; he put out his hand to me; he said, Collingbourne, you have me; it is the happiest moment I have in my life. He then told me that he had it in his mind to come to me, and had actually come to the corner of the street where I live. He began to tell me. I cautioned him that what he said to me I should be obliged to tell upon oath. He told me the way he get the check was visiting Mr. Ashley; he was in the room alone; the check book laid in the room; that he had taken several checks from the book; he went to a coffee-house in the City, and filled several of them up before he filled up one to please him, and he believed the one presented was the worst executed.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Ashley. Take that in your hand, and tell me whether you believe that to be, or do you know it is not - A. Most assuredly not; the letters are not made like mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, very well; he has been at my house occasionally. I have known the prisoner a twelvemonth; he being an acquaintance of my brother's. I once gave him a check for a trifling sum of money. When I paid him this check I left my room and my check book on the table, by the side of my writing desk, and I left him in it. I was going in the country that night, and during the time I was in the country this bill was forged.</p>

On the 2nd of April, the prisoner came to our shop about one o'clock in the day; one of them asked for some remnants of ribbon. I shewed them several drawers of remnants of ribbons, and then took several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200008"/>remnants out of the drawers. Bower paid for them eight shillings and seven pence halfpenny. When she paid for them, she asked to see more. I shewed them another drawer, and out of that drawer Bower bought one more remnant. I then missed a piece out of the last drawer. I asked them for the ribbon which they had in their hands just now. They asked me what ribbon, and what colour. I told them I could not tell the colour, but it was the ribbon they had in their hands just then. Ruby then was going out of the door; I called out to her to have her stopped; a customer in the shop brought her in; she came in, and stood by one of the pillars. Bower made off in the confusion. Ruby was taken by force from the pillar, and taken into the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When Ruby stood by the pillar had she any thing in her hand - A. I saw something, but I cannot tell what it was. I saw her put her hands down by the side of her when she was by the pillar. She was taken into the accompting-house, and a constable was sent for. The constable searched her; nothing was found on her. Bower was not apprehended until the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect these women coming into the shop - A. I did not see Bower that day; she was gone when I came in. I saw Ruby take hold of the pillar after she was brought back. She was endeavouring to conceal something between her and the pillar. After she was moved by force from the pillar, the umbrella was discovered, containing the ribbons. I took the umbrella into the accompting-house. The umbrella was propped up between her and the pillar. I had not seen the umbrella before. I laid hold of the umbrella, and the weight of the ribbons opened the umbrella. I then discovered eleven rolls of ribbons. The prisoner was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>ABIGAIL HALL. I was in the shop at the time the first witness charged the prisoners with having the ribbon. I saw Ruby walk out of the shop; I caught hold of her before the door closed. She endeavoured to get from me; with assistance I brought her back into the shop. At that time an umbrella came against my hand, and at the time that she was against the pillar I saw an umbrella in her hand. I saw her endeavouring to hide the umbrella; then I recollected her hurting my finger with t. I took the umbrella first from the pillar, and gave it to Miss Pittman. I saw it opened, and the ribbons in it.</p>
               <p>Ruby's Defence. On Saturday I came from my father and mother; I met a young woman I slightly knew; she asked me to take a walk with her to buy some ribbons. I went with her to Mr. Flint's shop. I was coming out of the shop; I was stopped by two gentlewomen; they took me into the accompting-house, and brought an umbrella into the accompting-house. The other prisoner I never saw with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>Bower's Defence. My little boy is blind. I went to Mr. Ware's, in Bridge-street. I never was out of my house all the day afterwards. On the next day I was taken in custody. I was at home all day on the Saturday with my baby.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any proper remains of day-light - A. That I cannot say. When Pickett brought the prisoner in, he produced a china cup to me, and asked me if it was mine. He said he saw the prisoner take the cup out of the window. I looked at the window, and missed the cup. I then took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing the matter with the window - A. It had been cracked, and had been puttied for some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the hole that was broken in large enough to admit a hand to take out your china ware - A. Yes; the cup stood almost to the pane of glass that was broken; the saucer belonging to the cup might touch the pane, it was so near the window as that. I had observed the cup in the window in the afternoon. The pane of glass was whole, out the puttied part. Between five and six o'clock I took the things in; there was nothing missing then; the glass was whole then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to look for the cup, that was the first time that you missed it, was it - A. Yes. I did not know any thing was broken until then.</p>

            . I live in the City-road. On the evening of the 7th of March, I was in Pitfield-street between eight and nine o'clock; I was opposite of Mrs. Brittle's; I observed a suspicious character whistling. I looked round; I observed the prisoner at Mrs. Brittle's shop window; the person that whistled before, whistled again. The prisoner went to the window; I observed him draw his hand from the window, and put his hand into his pocket. He left the window. I followed him, and collared him; I asked him what he had been doing at the window. He denied doing any thing but looking in at the window. I desired him to come into the house with me. I kept my hand round his wrist, with the cup in his own hand. When I got him into Mrs. Brittle's, I took the cup from him and asked her if she knew the cup; she said, yes. I gave it her. I observed the window had been cracked; a piece had been forced out at the bottom of the pane of glass.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200009"/>We took the prisoner to the watchhouse.

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in custody when he came out of the shop; I stopped him, and asked him whether he had got any thing about him that did not belong to him. On my rubbing him down I found that he had something about him; I took him into the shop and searched him, and found four pounds of soap in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that soap - A. I can swear to the soap; it is a particular make.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the soap; I went home to my wife; she was not at home. I left it in the warehouse where my coat and hat was; when I went out the warehouseman informed Mr. Pearson of it. When I was brought back I told them I bought it on purpose to send to Ilford where my child was at nurse.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London. I saw the prisoner about half past eight, on Tuesday morning, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200010"/>going up Golden-lane I met the prisoner with this basket, which I afterwards saw contained candles. I suspected him. I saw him go into a shop kept by one Donney. Matthews peeped throw the window. Donney took them off the counter, and put them underneath. I went into the shop, told Donney he must put that basket on the counter again. He seemed very much agitated. He said to the prisoner, take it away; I will not have it here. I begged he would not take it away. I said, you must let me know something about it. I told him he must give me an account where he got them. He said he was carrying them for Bunney. I then told him I must find out Bunney before I let him go. He gave me a direction for Bunney. I then said, that was not the first lot of candles that he brought there that morning; he said, it was; there was another lot then at home. I left the prisoner in the custody of Matthews, and I went to the prisoner's house; he keeps a small chandler's shop. I brought away two hundred pounds weight of sugar, tobacco, and Spanish liquorice. I put the prisoner into the counter. He was taken before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not he say he had the basket from Bunney - A. I am positive he said he had the candles from Bunney. Bunney came before the magistrate, and owned the basket. The prisoner said he was carrying the basket for Bunney, and he said he had another basket of candles at home.</p>
               <p>REDBURN CLARK. Q. Do you know these to be your candles - A. I do, by the make of them, and this shed is mine in Catherine-wheel-yard. From information, I went there, and found the shed broken open. I know the candles by the shape, the bottom, and by the threads. They are about seven weeks old. There were ten threads in the candles.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He keeps a chandler's shop in Golden-lane. That is a mile and a quarter from my premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The property is my own. I had them of Mr. Howard in Whitecross-street, a gentleman with whom I do a deal of business.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler. The prisoner is a chandler, and dealer in candles. On the 19th of March, the prisoner had thirty-six dozen pounds of candles of me; on the 16th of February he had thirty-six pounds. They were all sorts of candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell him any that had ten threads in them - A. Yes; they sell for five farthings. I sold him three dozen and six pounds on the 19th of March, and within a month before that I sold him twelve dozen pounds. Some of them were candles of that kind. I have known the prisoner upwards of a twelvemonth. I am a tallow chandler in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there was seventy pounds weight of ten threads bought of you. Do you know Mr. Bunney - A. There is no tallow chandler of the name of Bunney.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is ten threads to my candles. The same evening the prisoner was committed I sent to Mr. Howard for half a pound of ten threads; there was only eight threads to them. I know these candles to be mine by the colour and shape. I have not the least doubt they are my candles; they all correspond with the cotton I have to them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you tell a woman that the flap of your coat got between your legs and threw you down - A. I fell running after him; my great coat got between my legs, but I did not tell a woman that. I fell first when the prisoner struck me.</p>
               <p>MR. JENNINGS. I am an officer. I was sitting by the fire side; I heard a voice going by my house, saying, stop thief. I immediately ran to the door; I saw three men running, laughing; the prisoner took one way and they the other. I followed the prisoner about thirty yards; he let his breeches down; he let his breeches down as though he was doing something for himself. I asked the prisoner what he did there; he said he was doing a job for himself. A little girl ran out of the house with me; I told her to go into Leadenhall-street, and see whether there had been anything done or not. She returned with Alexander in about ten minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was not the prosecutor drunk - A. He had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw no person in company with the prisoner when he knocked me down, not did I see any man join him.</p>

I pursued him up Chancery-lane; he immediately delivered the silk handkerchiefs to Hinde. When I took hold of Hinde he let the handkerchiefs fall in the dirt in Chancery-lane, and ran behind a shop door; he was brought in afterwards.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM RUSH. On the 29th of March I was at work at Mr. Plush's, a plumber's shop. On my hearing some one run into the passage, I went out; there is a projection in the passage. I saw the prisoner White behind there; he inquired whether such a man as Smith lodged there; I told him there was no such man lodged there. Directly he saw Mr. Thomas's shopman had passed he ran the other way up Chancery-lane; I followed him into Carey-street. I enquired why he left the other lad behind; he said, he had been with nobody, he was never in the passage; he was never in Chancery-lane.</p>

When I had hold of him he gave it to the prisoner at the bar; I let go of the person that I had hold of, and followed the prisoner. I seized him by the collar and demanded my handkerchief; he said, if it was mine I should have it. He took it from his pocket and said he had just picked it up in the street. I took him into a shop and sent for a constable. That is all that passed.</p>

I did not observe the box the night before, when I went to bed; I left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200013"/>the box locked. The next morning the lock was broken open, and the side of box was broken in; I had all my own clothes in the said box, and twenty-three pounds in bank notes.

She told me that she could not come for the whole afternoon, she was going out for needle work, she would come part of the afternoon.

She told me she was going for needle work; I did not hear her go out.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of February, in the Strand, about half past ten o'clock at night; I took her to St. Ann's watchhouse; she then told me that she lived at No. 5, Union-street, Chandois-street. I went there on the same evening, and there I found several little articles. I left her in the watchhouse. I was with Mrs. Saunders when I met her in the Strand. The prisoner went by the name of Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Saunders. What name did the prisoner go by in your house - A. Evans.</p>
               <p>Jeffries. A person of the name of Brown keeps the house in Union-street; a great many females lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shewed you the house in Union-street - A. A girl of the name of Silvester; it was a garret, a bed room. There I found this tin case, a Prayer book, and a looking-glass; it is not mentioned in the indictment. The next day at the watchhouse she confessed that she had pawned the articles. She went with me on the Saturday morning to Mr. Alder's in Berwick-street; she said, she had pawned them, and they were there; she had destroyed the duplicates. At Mr. Alder's I found these four gowns, three petticoats, and a shawl. The prisoner said the two shifts were the articles that she had pledged at Mr. Latham's.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at these things the officer has produced, what may be the value of these things - A. I think three pounds. I have examined them; they are my own. As to the bank notes, she told me she had spent them.</p>

I returned about ten o'clock; I found my door broken open.

I asked him what his name was; he told me his name was Gray. I then told him I apprehended him on a charge of breaking open Mrs. Pegram's house, and stealing pictures, a boiler, and other things. He said he knew nothing about it. I then asked him whether he had not pledged a picture in that neighbourhood. We were then in Brick-lane, close to the pawnbroker's house.

            . On Sunday morning, about eleven o'clock, he applied to me about this cart, saying, a friend of his had a horse and cart to dispose of. I asked him if he knew the horse and cart; he said, yes. He appointed to bring the horse and cart on Monday, at eleven o'clock, for me to look at it. Both the prisoners came with the horse and cart as near that time as possible. I never saw Judah before, nor did I know his name until he signed the receipt for the sale. I walked the horse about; it was lame. I said I did not want such a horse as that; it was a cripple. Judah drove the horse. He asked fourteen pounds for it; I offered nine pounds; we at last agreed for ten pounds. I paid him part of the money on the same day, and on the second day two pounds eight shillings, and the third day one pound nine shillings, and three shillings was stopped by agreement. I bought it outright I asked Davis how long Judah had it; he said, about eight or nine months. Judah said the same, and he kept it to let out.</p>

            . On Monday I was at the bargain of this horse and cart between Clifford and the prisoners; the account that he is given is correct. Judah and Davis sold the horse and cart. Davis said, Judah had the horse and cart nine months. Judah said the same. I was by when it was paid for. It was paid for as the other witness has stated.</p>
               <p>Judah's Defence. My employer, Mr. Olden, sent me to Mr. Althan's to borrow a horse and cart on the Monday to go to Deptford; I went down to Deptford; I got very much in liquor, and after I got in liquor I do not know what occurred.</p>
               <p>Davis's Defence. I had been to Bermondsey; I met Judah in a cart; he was intoxicated; he asked me to take a ride with him. I went with him, and when we came to the Marsh-gate, Clifford asked me how I did. We stopped at the Spanish Patriots public-house, and had something to drink. We had several pots of hot. I went to the hair-dressers to be shaved, and when I came back I saw Judah with some notes in his hand. He told Judah he would give him any money for the horse and cart for a friend of his He told Hodgkins to take a ride in the cart to his father's. It was then a little after twelve o'clock; about half after two o'clock Judah called for his horse and cart; he did not get it.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in possession of a gelding lately - A. Yes, it was a brown gelding. I worked him on the 9th; at night I put him in the stable. I was feeding it at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the stable - A. In New-street-square, near Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras. When I fed the horse I left it in the stable; I locked the stable door, and took the key away in my pocket. The next morning, about five o'clock, I went to feed the horse again, I found the horse missing. I took all the pains I could to find it. I looked every where I could think of. On the Friday evening following, I saw a man in Smithfield; he told me he had bought a horse. He took me to the place where I found the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the person - A. Mr. Special; he is a horse boiler, at the Ducking Pond, where I found my horse. I am sure it is my own horse I found there; it runs a great deal at the nose, and it is blood tailed. I have had the horse four months. I gave four pounds ten shillings for the horse; I think it is worth that now. Mr. Special told me if the horse was mine I might take it away. I have it now in my possession.</p>

I asked him his business; he said he had a glandered horse to sell; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from Mr. Lee, of Batking. He said he wanted fifty shillings for it; two guineas I gave him for the horse at the Red Lion public-house, Whitechapel, in the tap-room. I was at Smithfield market on Friday evening.

               <p>THURSTON ASHLEY. I am foreman to Mr. Guillemard. The prisoner is in the employ of Mr. Guillemard. In our business we provide copper change to pay the work people.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of March, had you any reason to suppose that any of your copper money was taken away - A. Yes. I kept watch, and the two Armstrongs were stationed in the house. We had agreed upon a signal; upon my seeing any person take the copper I was to cry out Rodney. On the 18th of March, I concealed myself, and at eight o'clock in the evening I heard a footstep towards where the copper was placed. I saw a child go to where the copper was. It was dark. I could only see the size of the person, not the features. I had no light until the officers came. I saw her take eight five-shilling papers of halfpence. She wrapped the shawl round her hand, put the papers of halfpence into the shawl, and put it up to her person. She took the papers of halfpence from underneath the counter, and put them into the shawl; she walked four or five feet, as if to go out of the room; I immediately got up from the place where I was concealed, and called out Rodney, to the officers; the officers came; the officer searched the shawl; they found six papers of halfpence in her shawl, and one paper was taken from her person.</p>

I then took from her in his presence, these six papers, which I had marked that night, and he had marked them in the day time. Six papers fell from her, and one on the floor. Upon our alarm, coming up stairs, she might have dropped it, as she trembled. I did not see her her drop them. These are the halfpence.</p>

I know the prisoner; he offered me a watch to sell in a cook's shop, in the street where I live; he came in the cook's shop, he asked me to buy an old watch; I looked at the watch; I bid him ten shillings for it. He came to my house the next day, and in my room he again offered me the watch; I looked at the watch; I told him I could not buy it, it was not good. My box was open, he could then see my pearls and watches. I told him I had got good watches; he went away. I did not see any thing. On Saturday night, the 5th of March, I was at the Synagogne.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your things - A. On that 5th of March. A week after I had seen the prisoner at my house, from the information of Rachel

               <p>WOOLF SOLOMONS. From the information of Mrs. Davis, on the 26th of March, in the evening, we found the prisoner in his room on Tower-hill; he was at supper, with a great coat on his chair by his side. I asked him who the coat belonged to; he made no answer. I took up the coat, and out of the pocket I pulled out these four bunches of pearls. The prosecutor was with us; he identified the property. The prisoner said he found them.</p>

            . I accompanied Woolf Solomons and the prosecutor. I told the prisoner I wanted him. I looked on the ground; I took up that coat. I said to the prisoner, is this your coat; he made no answer. I put my hand into the pocket, and pulled out four bunches of pearls. Pincas said he lost four bunches, four large single beads, and some loose ones. The pearls found on the prisoner perfectly correspond with the account of the prosecutor. These are them. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the other property. I conveyed him to the Compter. It was by Mrs. Davis's directions I went to this place.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he lodged in my house. On the 5th of March, he came home with a lanthorn in his hand, between eight and nine at night; he asked me to lend him a piece of candle, which I did. He went out with it; he returned home in less than half an hour, with a bundle with him; he appeared all in a tremble and a perspiration. On the next day at breakfast, the prisoner said there had been a robbery at Mr. Moses's, he was glad of it; he was a bad man. When the prisoner came home with the bundle he went out again, and left the bundle behind him. He returned, and took the property away at eleven o'clock at night, the same night. I then said, halloo, what are you doing; I have lost my husband through a lodger, and I will not lose my liberty through lodgers. I gave information to the officers.</p>

            . I am guard to the Sheffield coach. On the 9th of March, as I was going across the yard I saw Clark in the coach examining the seats inside of the coach; he came out of the coach and shut the door. He got on the fore-wheel of the coach and opened the boot-lid where he put the luggage in; he turned a few of the parcels over that were at the top, and took out a small parcel, put it under his arm, and went into a bye shed in the yard with it; he turned out of the shed and stood by the side of the coach. I went to him, and said, Clark, I wish you would bring back the parcel that you took out of my boot; he said, he had not taken any parcel. I told him I was certain he had: I saw him take it out of the boot myself; he went into the stable. I went to the shed to look for the parcel; there was an empty chaise with one of the windows open, I found the parcel there, underneath the seat. I gave Mr.

             the parcel. At that time the prisoner was gone away. I am certain I saw him take the parcel out, and put it under his left arm, and walk to the shed with it. The next day Mr. Robinson met me; he opened the parcel in my presence, in the coach office; the parcel contained a ten-pound bank note, a five-pound bank note, and two five-guinea notes.</p>

After some time the boy came to me; I went to the window The prisoner had a large book that he was reading in his left hand open, and with his other hand he drawed out two books from the window, and put them in his pocket; he staid about five minutes, and then went away; I followed him, brought him back, and took the books out of his pocket. He asked me to let him go; I said, I should not. I had been served so so often within this month; I should send him to the Compter. These are my two books that I took out of his pocket, and this is a book which belongs to a bookseller in Chiswell-street.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 20th of February, I was going down Upper Thames-street, about a quarter before eight at night. I stopped a man with a small bag of radish seed; the next day before the Lord Mayor the man said he found it; that man was not the prisoner. On my going round to the different seedsmen, I found the property belonged to Messrs. Field and Child, in Thames-street. I told them I thought it was one of their porters that was robbing them. I asked them to let me question them. The prisoner was called into the accompting-house; I questioned him; he ran out of the shop; I followed him, and caught him. I got a hackney coach, and put him in; I secured his hands in the coach, and when I got him to the Compter he escaped from me again; I catched him again at the bottom of St. Swithin's-lane, in Cannon-street. He then said, if he had me in his own country he would smash my b - y head. He is an Irishman. He gave me his wrong address where he lived; the foreman knew where he lived. We went and searched his premises, and there we found twenty-two sacks, a great deal of seeds, and small bags; I took them to Messrs. Field and Child. I produce the property.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to Field and Child. I took a Hackney-coach to convey these seeds, bags, and sacks, to Messrs. Field and Child's the next morning; I examined them. I found them to be the property of Field and Child. I cannot swear to the new bags; the sacks, I can; the different seeds I have compared with some samples that we have got; the samples tally one with the other, both the beans and radish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to these lodgings when the sacks were found - A. I did, and I found the wife of the prisoner in the room; I understood he was living with her at the time. She said, she expected him home at nine o'clock. He was then in custody. I have no doubt the seeds are the property of Messrs. Field and Child.</p>

I felt another tug at my pocket, and on my turning round I found the two prisoners in possession of the officer, Brown.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I was on duty on Easter Monday in Newgate-street, about two o'clock, the children were going into church; I observed the two prisoners following the prosecutor; I watched their motions, and got close to them. I saw the prisoner Wiatt take the book from the prosecutor's pocket, and put into the hands of Frazer. I immediately collared both of them. Frazer threw the book in among the children. I let go Frazer to pick the book up; some gentleman laid hold of him as I turned round to pick the book up. I took them both into a shop and searched them both; on Frazer I found another pocket-book. This is the pocket-book that belongs to Mr. Holland.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my own pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Wiatt said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Frazer's Defence. I am now fifty odd years of age. I have been the father of twenty-two children, eleven of which are alive now. I had been to my employers, Mr. Smith, of Postern-row, Tower-hill, with some pens that I had finished. He gave me twelve hundred more to go on with until he sent the porter with more. I had my boy with the quills in my hand when Brown, the officer, seized me. Before that, I felt something hit against my hand; I did not see it; it fell to the ground. When the officer picked it up, it appeared to be a pocket-book. As to the prisoner, Wiatt, I do not know him; I never saw him before.</p>

On the 15th of March, the man was brought in by the officers, with some meat, veal, beef, and mutton, both dressed and undressed, a bottle of cream, and three large cakes that were not cut or broken, and a bason. Upon my hearing the bell of the door ring, I went to the door. The woman was talking to the other prisoner. I took hold of the man by the collar at the door. The man threw himself off the steps; he got away. The woman said, sir, it was hard that she could not speak to her friend; he was a shoemaker; he had brought her a pair of shoes. It was no such thing; she had brought up the shoes from the kitchen herself, with a bag of meat and bread. Then the constable brought in the man prisoner with the bag. I had not the least doubt what was in the bag was my property.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 15th of March, I was watching the prosecutor's house in company with Baruard Gleed I observed Mr. Echalaz's door open; I saw the cook. The woman prisoner gave a bundle to the man prisoner; at that time I did not know what the bundle contained. I heard Mr. Echalaz speak something; the cook said, sir, surely I may give him my slippers. The man immediately ran away. I pursued the man prisoner; he threw what he had in his hand over some railing into Clapton Common. I took him. He had a green bag, which Gleed took. I took him back to Mr. Echalaz's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took him, did you go and take up the bag - A. I did; I picked up that which he had throwed away; it contained mutton, beef, and veal; it was wrapped up in this handkerchief, and tied up; and this bottle of milk. The bottle was not broken. It was a wine quart bottle, with cream in it. I went back to the prosecutor's house. I asked the man how he came by that property; he said it was given him by the cook. The cook said nothing to it; he said it in her presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It was a common wine bottle I suppose - A. Yes; they are all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the meat here - A. No, it would not keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that this poor man is a shoemaker in that neighbourhood - A. He is, I believe.</p>

            . I am coachman to Sir Joseph. On the morning of the 3d of February, about half past seven o'clock, I went to the coach-house; it was getting light then, I found the coach-house door about an inch and a half open; I went in; I missed four glasses from the chariot, and three from the coach, and two box coats were gone. One of the box coats was the coat I wore; it is the property of Sir Joseph. It is a blue coat, with a white button.</p>
               <p>JAMES FRANKLIN. I have been in the habit of driving a hackney coach; I was brought up a farrier. On a Wednesday night in February, I do not know the day of the month, I and the two prisoners went to Sir Joseph's coach-house, in Dean-street, Soho-square. The prisoner, Butcher, unlocked Sir Joseph's coach-house door, at about half past eleven. Butcher unlocked the coach-house door with a pick-lock key. Jelks was present at the time. Butcher and Jelks went into Sir Joseph's coach-house; they locked themselves in, and left me out to watch. I did not see any more of them for an hour. I waited at the door all the time. When I saw them again, Jelks came out with seven coach-glasses, and Butcher came out with two box coats. Butcher put on one coat; and I the other. Jelks carried the glasses to Butcher's lodging. Jelks walked on first; Butcher and I followed him. We left all the property that night at Butcher's lodging, and then Jelks and me went and slept together. We returned to Butcher's lodging the next day. Butcher and Jelks went out together; where they went to I do not know. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200020"/>left me there, and returned in about half an hour, and then Butcher and me went out in search of a man of the name of Joseph. We got intelligence at a public-house in Oxford-street, what time he would be there. We went home to Butcher's lodging again; Butcher sent me to fetch Joseph. I went to a public-house in Oxford-street; I do not know the sign of it; I saw Joseph at the public-house; he misunderstood me where to come to; he did not come at the time appointed to the house. Butcher himself went and fetched him. Butcher sold the two blue box coats to Joseph for two pounds six shillings. I was present at the sale. I never knew Joseph before. It was me that proposed the intention of stealing at Sir

            's house. I looked at my box the very same morning, the 4th of April; it contained a black superfine coat; I paid four guineas for the coat: a shirt two pair of pantaloons, I value them at eighteen shillings; there were four handkerchiefs, I value them at eight shillings; two pair of worsted stockings, four shillings. This hat was there, but it was left; and there was a pocket-book, it contained papers of no use, but two duplicates, one of a watch, the other a quadrant. I had pawned them. I saw the pocket book containing these duplicates the very same morning. I am sure of that. I unlocked my box that day, and took a handkerchief out of the box in the morning, about seven o'clock; then I locked it; I took my key with me on board a ship. I returned to my lodging about half past six o'clock in the evening; I then found my box lid forced open. The lock was forced off the lid. It was fast below, but forced from the lid. I missed all my things in the box except a hat, a pair of pantaloons, and some papers. I believe I have not mentioned two shirts. I missed all the other articles except a hat and a pair of pantaloons. I left my lodging that morning about seven o'clock; I left the prisoner in the room in bed on that morning. A quarter before five the prisoner called me, and told me to rise, or else I should be too late; it had already struck seven o'clock, he said. I went out before him, and left him in bed. When I returned the prisoner was not in the room. This was on the 21st. I did not see him afterwards until the 4th of April. I met him in the street. He did not return to his lodging from the 21st of March to the 4th of April. On the 4th of April, when I met him in the street, I asked him to step into the house with me; he rather objected; he said he did not know me. I took hold of him, and went into a house with him, and left him in custody of the gentleman that keeps the house, and I brought Hall, the officer, and gave him in custody, Mr. Hall searched the prisoner in my presence. I saw found on the prisoner my two duplicates. I have never seen anything of my coat and waistcoat.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of April, Plaen came to me; I went to where the prisoner was. I took the prisoner into another room and searched him. In his trowsers pocket I found these two duplicates; he said they were his own. I shewed them to Plaen; he said they were his, he had lost them out of his box. The prisoner, after Plaen said they were his, said that he had picked them up in the room after Plaen had gone out that morning. I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked them up in the room. There were other people in the room besides myself.</p>

He did not return to my lodging any more. He owed me for the last night's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200021"/>lodging and two pints of beer.

               <p>Q. to Mr. Furness. You told me just now, that the prisoner went out a quarter after seven o'clock - A. Yes; he did not pay for his nights lodging, and two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in the morning when the prisoner went out, that there was any other man in the room - A. Only them two; Plaen and the prisoner slept there. I saw the prisoner going along Montague-street, Whitechapel. No stranger came to my house that morning at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Plaen. Look at the duplicates produced by the officer, and tell the jury whether they are yours - A. They are mine; they have my name written by the pawnbroker; I am quite clear they are mine.</p>

            . I belong to the General Post office. I am a letter carrier in the General Post office. I was on duty of the 22nd of November last, in the General Post office. It is my duty to carry the letters after they are sorted at the Inland office into the letter carriers office, and to put them on their respective divisions; according as they are sorted I put them there in their proper divisions. This I performed on the 22nd of November.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CRICKETT. I am inspector of the letter carriers in the General Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. Into how many divisions are the paid letters sorted - A. Into twelve, in the first instance; that takes place in the Inland office. A letter directed to Gough-square would be in the sixth division; after it is sorted it would be carried by Parsons into the letter carriers office, to the sixth division; and in the letter carriers office, letters of the sixth division are subdivided into nine walks.</p>
               <p>Q. Into which of these divisions would a letter for the Temple fall - A. Into the Temple-walk; that is one of the walks of the sixth division.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same walk as Gough-square would be - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation did the prisoner hold in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200022"/>office - A. He was a letter carrier for the Temple-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have any business with a letter directed to Gough-square - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the letter carriers assist in sorting letters - A. They do; they assemble round the table, and each sorts for his walk.</p>
               <p>

            When the letters are brought into the office, all persons belonging to No. 6 assemble round the table No. 6, and each take letters for his walk - A. It was the duty of two letter carriers to re-sort the letters for the sixth division.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do all the letter carriers sort the letters - A. No; it is the duty of two letter carriers to re-sort the letters for the nine walks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roe. The prisoner was not one of these men - A. No, he was not. But as it would suit him, he would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. It occasionally happens that letters are missorted, does it not - A. It does, daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter came into the prisoner's hands not in his walk, what would his duty be - A. It would have been his duty to hand it over to the proper letter carrier of that walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Ought not he to have done so before he quitted the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what place is it the usual course of letter carriers to arrange the letters for their own delivery, at what house do they place the letters for their own delivery - A. That is done in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if a wrong letter came into his hands he must have found it out - A. It is possible he might have taken it in error; he might not have seen it; it is the usual practice to arrange them in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of Wood, the prisoner, being there that morning - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that. (The book handed to witness.) - A. This the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. This is an order from the Post-master by which servants in the Post office are directed to sign each note they receive, with the name of the person of whom they receive it, and their own name when they pay it away; the prisoner's name is signed to it - A. It is. It is read over to every servant when they first enter into the office; this was read to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When any person pays money into the Post office is it attended to - A. It is. The receiver general would not receive a note without it is so endorsed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have mentioned that there are sorters and letter carriers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have other officers what you call charge takers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The peculiar office of the prisoner that which he was employed and paid was that of a letter carrier - A. Yes.</p>

Mr. Wheatley made payments for us in Town; it was not an order from him or expected by him; it contained the bank notes already stated in the former case. I sealed the letter, and directed it to Mr. Wheatley, No. 7, Gough-square London; I delivered it to my brother, and told him to deliver it our servant. I dated the letter the 21st of November.

            . I am an inspector, of letter carriers in the General Post office. The letters are sorted into twelve divisions; the separation takes place in the Inland office. Letters which belongs to the sixth division after they are sorted in the Inland office they are carried into the letter carriers office. The letters of No. 6 are re-sorted into nine walks, or divisions; each carriers duty to sort the letters. The prisoner is not a sorter, but he occasionally would sort. The arrangement of each letter is made by two letter carriers. A letter carrier may take out a letter that does not belong to his walk by mistake. There is an order by the Post-master to endorse the names on notes of the person from whom they receive the note, and to put their own name upon the note when they pay it, and this is signed by the prisoner; a bill not so endorsed would not be received by the receiver general of the Post office. There are nine walks in No. 6. The prisoner has been employed in the Post office twenty-five or twenty-six years; his character up to this period has been correct and honest.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Barnard, Dimsdale and Company, bankers. On the 23rd of November last, I paid a Newbury note, No. 721 l, twenty pound, in a fifteen pound and a five pound bank note. I took the description of the notes I paid it with. The fifteen pound note was No. 8291, dated the 27th of October. We never put the year without it is several years back; the five-pound note was 8688. I have not the date of the five. I have no recollection to whom I paid them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. The fifteen pound note may be the date of another year - A. It is not likely, because it was received at the bank the night before.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNES. I belong to the Newbury Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether you had more than one note of No. 7211 in circulation - A. Only one of each in circulation. I am able to speak positively as to that fact. That note is still in circulation.</p>
               <p>PETER FERGUSON. I am a baker; I live in Whitcomb-street. Some time in December last, the prisoner borrowed ten pound of me; he said he wished to have it twos or fives, because the Post office ordered all the notes to be marked. On the 16th of December he paid me this note, a fifteen pound bank note. There is my hand-writing on this fifteen pound note. I put down 16th of the 12th month, and the two first letters of my name, P F; and it is marked

             was driving the team he turned out for them, and when he came in he came in slowly; he came near the corpse; he never touched the corpse, nor any person attending the funeral. I then saw two men strike him. I cannot say whether the prisoner was either of the men that struck him, I was so alarmed at the time; I cannot say where they struck him. The cart was going on a goodish foot pace. There were two horses to the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of their striking him - A. When the first man struck him he turned round, and then the other man struck him, he fell. I was in the cart, sitting on a chest; I looked over, and saw the wheel go over him all the way up. It went on his foot first, and all the way up his back, over his right shoulder. He laid sideways on the ground. He went sideways from the wheel, and the wheel went over his body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to these men when they struck him - A. Not a word; if he had done anything to them I must have seen it.</p>

            He had no use of his right arm or his right leg's he walked limping. He did not complain of being unwell before this happened; he appeared, except his lameness, to be as well as he usually was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his breast when he was taken up - A. He complained of his shoulder and his leg; he could not bear us to touch his shoulder but what he would cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cart go over his breast - A. I cannot say it went over his shoulder. It is a heavy cart, almost a new wheel. He was walking along by the side of his horses; they struck him as he was walking along by the side, about the middle of the two horses. He was between the two horses. He was in such a situation that if he tell it was likely the cart would go over him.</p>

            ; I was within half a dozen yards of where this accident took place. I saw the funeral; out of curiosity I went up; I saw a post chaise first. I rather think the post chaise ran up against some of them; it drove off very fast; the people attending the funeral was very much enraged. The cart was six or eight yards behind the post chaise. The man that drove the cart was by the side of the horses. I saw he did not touch any of them; I am sure of that; I think the post chaise did. I am certain that neither he his horses, or cart, ever touched them. The deceased had no time to say anything, it was done so quick. When the cart passed, a man at the funeral came and struck him; after that, another man came from the funeral and struck him; he then fell. The cart was going on at the time, and when he fell the cart went over him, but what part of him I cannot tell, I was so alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the persons that struck him - A. I did not notice the first that struck him. The man that struck him the last blow returned to the funeral; I kept my eye upon him; I never lost sight of him; on that account I never saw the man that was run over afterwards. I pointed out the man that last struck the deceased to Mr. Stroud; he went after the man, and took him. The prisoner is the man that Mr. Stroud took, and I am sure the prisoner is the man that struck the deceased.</p>

I saw two men run from the funeral to the carman that was killed. I came down stairs as fast as I could; The poor man then laid in the road. The cart had been over him then. I went to assist the carter; he said, do not touch me, my ribs are broken. The witness then came, and made a complaint; she pointed out the prisoner as the person that struck him; I went, and took him in custody.</p>

            . I am a pupil in the London hospital. On Tuesday the 22nd of November, in the evening, I was informed that he had been knocked down, and that a cart had run over the body. I minutely examined the body, and questioned the man as to all his sensations; all that he complained of was a stiffness in his shoulder, and a pain in his ancle. I bled him profusely. I gave him some medicines. He went on perfectly well until Saturday morning. On Saturday morning he laboured under very great difficulty of breathing. There were other symptoms of inflammation of his lungs, and pain in his side. That was on the Saturday. I used proper remedies for the inflammation of the lungs. The complaint continued Saturday, and Sunday, and the Monday following the complaint gained ground. Sir

             saw him on the Monday following; he desired he might lose four ounces of blood, which I accordingly drew from him, and about four o'clock the man died, and on Tuesday we opened the body. The right globe of the lungs was very much inflamed, as likewise the membrane that covered the right cavity of the chest was very much inflamed also.</p>
               <p>Q. What would occasion this appearance - A. The application of cold and obstructed perspiration.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not external violence occasion it - A. I do not think it did in this instance. There was no external appearance on the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen in your experience that there has been such internal appearance without external marks of violence - A. There may have been such a thing, but not in my knowledge. It is my opinion, that these appearances of inflammation did not arise from external violence. The suppuration on the right cavity of his chest indicated it was not by any violence so recently done. There was an appearance of an old disease in the left globe of the lungs. In my opinion, this internal appearance was the cause of his death. There was no external marks that caused that appearance, or his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bruises on his breast - A. The injury was on the left side, and the inflammation of the lungs on the right. The injury was on the left shoulder, and the inflammation on the right. The injury could not have gone on so rapid if it had been occasioned on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the fan have occasioned it - A. I do not think the fall could have occasioned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the pressure of the wheel upon this shoulder have occasioned such appearances as you saw in the cavity of the chest, or in any manner occasioned his death - A. I think not.</p>

On the 16th of February, in the evening, I was sitting in the accompting-house; I saw Dodman standing at the top of the stairs leading into the cellar; he looked very hard at me, which made me suspect all was not right. I then asked Dodman where Ward, the other prisoner, was. They are servants in the employ of Messrs. Nicholson. He said he was down in the cellar. I immediately went down into the cellar. Ward seemed very much agitated in seeing me come down; he made trifling excuses, and moved from one part of the cellar to the other to try to avoid me. I followed him close up. He then came up stairs into the distill-house; I followed him up. He went to the further part the still-house; I kept following him; he then made a sharp turn, when I heard something like spirits jolt in a bladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Dodman all this time - A. He was standing where I first saw him; he had not gone into the cellar then. I took hold of Ward by the collar, and asked him what he had got. He took the bladder out of rectified spirits out of his breeches, and gave it into my hand. I then called

             out of the accompting-house; I told him to take hold of Dodman, as I had no doubt of his being a party concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dodman within sight of you while you laid hold of Ward - A. Yes, he was. He laid hold of Dodman, and said he had no doubt they were both concerned. I then enquired in the house whether Mr. Nicholson was within. Mr. Nicholson came down. When Mr. Nicholson came, he took hold of Ward. and I took hold of Dodman, and then Robert Wilson went for an officer. Dodman then wanted to go to the necessary; I said he should not move. He then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and 
               <persName id="t18140420-42-person434">drew</persName>
             a knife. I immediately seized hold of his arm, and called to Mr. Nicholson that he had drawn a knife. He let go Ward, and came to my assistance. When he found Mr. Nicholson was coming he threw the knife from him. In the scuffle. Mr. Nicholson threw him on his back; he got up again, and threw himself down upon his belly, and attempted to burst the bladder, and with one hand he pulled it out of his breeches and threw it from him. We tied his hands. He then pretended to faint, and laid on his back until the officer came. I told the officer he was farthing. I took up the bladder which he had thrown away before the officer came. The officer said he would soon bring him about; he gave him a tap on the head. The officer then handcuffed them, and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bladders - A. I took it to the office and examined it; the officer, examined it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200026"/>with me. One bladder contained better than a gallon and a half of strong rectified spirits; that was Ward's bladder; the bladders leaked, so we emptied them out into strong bottles. The other bladder contained about a pint and a gallon of strong rum. The prisoners were committed to prison. The spirits are here; the rectified spirits are of the value of twenty shillings, and the rum twenty-two shillings; that is what it cost me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. What part of the premises did this take place - A. In the distill-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is some distance from where Mr. Nicholson dwells - A. It is connected with the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dodman did not offer any personal violence to any body with the knife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think he took the knife out of his pocket with intention of stabbing the bladder - A. I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say what he meaned to do with the knife - A. He did not. The entrance to the distill-house in underneath the dwelling-house; it is covered in, and all one premises; we pay regular taxes for the distill-house as well as the house. We can go from the house into the distill-house without going into the street or into the yard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. Nicholson's; I received the two prisoners there. When I came, Dodman's hands were tied; I untied them, and handcuffed them together. I told Dodman he must go with me; he said, he would not. These two bladders were produced to me; one containing rum, the other a strong spirit. Mr. Nicholson produced them to me at the time they were nearly full of spirits; I kept them until the next day. I found the bladders leaked; I put the spirits into these stone bottles; I have had it ever since. I tasted it; one was rum, and the other was a strong spirit. I searched Dodman's premises; in his bed room I found four bottles of spirits, and this bladder, and a quantity of sugar; they were locked up in a chest. The bottles contained strong spirits like that in the bladder. I asked him how he came to do it; he replied, we are two rogues together.</p>

            . I was at the Shepherd and Dog with Mr. Story. When he went home he left me his watch. The two prisoners were both in the home; they saw Mr. Story give the watch into my hand. I came out to the top of the steps; the prisoners both followed me out. Mears whispered, she has got a watch in her hand; I heard him distinctly say, she has got a watch in her hand. I had the ribbon twisted round my finger, and the watch in my hand. I had my hand shut upon the watch; I don't think it could be seen. I believe this was about half past nine at night. After that was whispered, Mears came up and said, I had a turnip in my hand; I asked what was that to him what I had in my hand. Bettsworth asked me what o'clock it was; I answered, I did not think the watch went. He laid hold of my hand, opened it, and took the watch away from me; this was done in an instant. I made no resistance. When he had taken the watch from me, he ran away as fast as he could; I bursted out crying, and told Mears I had lost the watch; he was close by when Bettsworth opened my hand, and took the watch away from me. When I told Mears that I had lost the watch, he told me not to cry and fret, he would endeavour to find him for me. He took me down Rosemary-lane, up into Whitechapel. I told him if he could give me any information who or what he was I would not mind giving him ten shillings to have the watch restored. He kneeled down in the street, and said, God might strike him blind if he had seen the man before; he seemed to endeavour to find him out by taking me up and down the streets, but he could see nothing of him. I went to the watchhouse afterwards, and gave a description of the two men. The officer of the night went and took the two prisoners in bed together.</p>

             at the watchhouse; she gave information of the robbery. She gave a description of the two persons that had robbed her. We went to their lodgings; they were both in bed together. We found out their lodging by the enquiry that we made Hutchins and Kalep were with me. We searched the prisoners; in their lodgings we found only a little silver. They both strongly denied any knowledge of the watch. Mears declared he knew nothing of it; he was present when Bettsworth ran away with it; he did not know where the watch was. Bettsworth heard it; he said he knew nothing of it. Mears said, he would be his part towards making it up, and begged Bettsworth to tell where it was.</p>

I had a bundle in one hand, and my other hand was banging down. The other man laid hold of my arm; the man that I pushed against, he shoved me with his hand against the wall. The prisoner snatched my watch from my fob, and ran away, at the time I was so pushed, while the other man was holding me.</p>
               <p>Q. So that one held you while the other took the watch out of your pocket - A. Yes. The prisoner then run away; I followed him, and cried stop thief. He ran into Spitalfields-market; I lost sight of him. While I was standing still I heard some one say come on my lad, he is taken. I went up to him; he was in Crispin-street. It was the same man who had taken the watch out of my pocket; he was standing with his back against some iron railing. He asked me if he was the man; I said yes, I would swear to it. He then gave me my watch, and begged for God's sake to let him go; he said he had a wife and a large family; I said he should not go. He was taken to the watchhouse by Mr. Rackam, and Mr. Townsend let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Townsend - A. A butcher. He let him go before Mr. Rackam took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say if I let you have the watch you would be satisfied - A. No, I do not remember saying so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Yes, you did, and then Mr. Townsend let me go.</p>
               <p>MR. RACKAM. I live in Wood-street, No. 11. I heard the cry of stop thief; I came out. Upon that I saw the prisoner in custody of a person I did not know; the prisoner was supplicating mercy of the gentleman that held him. The gentleman let him go, and seeing him at liberty I took hold of him, and advised the prosecutor to follow me to the watch-house; he did so. I delivered the prisoner to the officer at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 20th of February last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in West-street, Spitalfields-market, I heard the cry of stop thief; the last voice I heard was a lad in a faint voice crying, he had lost his watch. I came out, and saw a man come in the market, and as he cleared the corner he set off running, and kept walking; it struck me he might be the party; they were giving the alarm. I hailed him; he gave me no answer; commenced running. I followed him, overtook him, and detained him two minutes. I said, gentlemen, I will thank you if you will go into the market and find out who gave the alarm; some persons went into the market, and brought the prosecutor to me. I asked him if he had any knowledge of the man I had in custody; he said that was the man that stole his watch. Upon so doing, the man said if you will forgive me I will give you the watch again. Accordingly I saw the motion of the two hands, but not the watch; as if the watch passed from one to the other, but the watch I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man - A. Not to my knowledge. It was a dark night. I consider the man I detained to be a more powerful man than he appears to be.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rackam. Is that the man you saw supplicating for mercy, and which you conducted to the watchhouse - A. It is; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The watch produced by Hart is the watch that was taken from me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been very ill since I have been confined; I hope you will shew mercy to me.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 20th of February, about eight o'clock, I was in Newgate-street; I was going further into the City. When I was in Newgate-street, I am quite certain I had my pocket-book in my coat pocket. My pocket-book contained several letters, and about twenty-one pound in notes; a ten pound bank of England note, a five pound note, and six ones. There might be more ones, six I am sure of. I felt some person at my coat pocket. I was quite sober. Upon my feeling some person at my coat pocket I turned round to see who it was. The person that I saw had something tied round his waist; it afterwards proved to be a blue apron. At the time I saw the person he was just turning from me; I saw no other person near me. I did not recollect at that moment that I had a pocket-book in my pocket; I felt for my pocket handkerchief, it was in my pocket; afterwards it came into my mind, I found my pocket-book was gone. I set off after the person; I overtook him about an hundred yards. I did not see him until I came up to him. I seized the prisoner by the coat, and desired him to deliver me my pocket book. He solemnly declared he had not got it. I asked him if he was willing to be searched; he said he was perfectly willing. He was then searched by a person who was with me; nothing was found. I had lost sight of the prisoner. About an hundred yards off my pocket-book was found; it was picked up about a yard off the prisoner; a person picked it up and brought it to Mr. Bellchambers. The person that brought the pocket-book said he picked it up about a yard off the prisoner. I am certain it was my pocket-book; it had my letters in it, and the notes, a ten pound bank note, a five pound bank note, and either six, or more, one pound notes. The pocketbook contained all my letters and notes. I lost nothing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Can you positively say the prisoner had an apron on when you overtook him - A. I can positively say he had an apron on then. I cannot say he had that blue apron. When I first saw him he had something round him.</p>

            . I am a wine merchant. I live in Southampton-row, Bloomsbury-square. I was with Mr. Uthwart when he lost his pocket-book in Newgate-street. We were walking to see his sister, who lives in Dowgate-hill. It was soon after seven o'clock, Mr. Uthwart said he had lost his pocket-book. I said, my God, have you indeed, step after me. He clapped his eye upon the prisoner; he said, that is the man. From the prisoner's confusion at the moment I began to think he was the man. We had turned back about an hundred yards, and before we came to Snow-hill, Mr. Uthwart laid hold of him; he charged him with taking his pocket-book. The prisoner said he had not. Some person called out, search him. He had a jacket, with a blue apron on. I felt about him; he opened his jacket and apron. I immediately stooped to the ground, imagining he might have dropped it; and some person said, here is the book, sir. I was close by the prisoner at the time, and the person could not be more than a yard from the prisoner. I then gave the pocket-book to Mr. Uthwart. He went into a spirit shop in Newgate-street to see if the contents were right. The contents were all claimed by Mr. Uthwart. I think the bank notes in it were twenty-four pounds. It was reckoned; it was near thereabouts. Mr. Uthwart said it was all right. The prisoner went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy, or pardon, something of that kind.

            . I am a journeyman carpenter; I live in Noble-street, Falcon-square. I saw the prisoner when Mr. Uthwart had hold of him; not before; he had already hold of him. When I came up I picked up the book about a yard from the prisoner; who dropped it I cannot tell. I sung out, who belongs to this book? Mr. Uthwart said, me.

               <p>WILLIAM MUST. I am shopman to Mr. Romanis. On the 2nd of April, about five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop; she was alone; she asked to look at a pair of black worsted stockings. I shewed her some. I went to another part of the counter to wait upon another person. We were very busy at the time. I was desired by a customer to watch her;

             told me to watch her. I watched her; I saw her take two parcels of stockings off the counter; she put them in her pockethole. I accused her of stealing the parcels; she said, for God's sake do not take away my life. She dropped the stockings on the floor; I picked them up under her, and then informed my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stockings were there in the two parcels that she took - A. Ten pair in one, woollen, and thirteen pair of cotton in the other; the woollen ones were worth three shillings and sixpence a pair; the thirteen pair of cotton are worth more than three pounds.</p>

            . I am a revenue officer. I was in Mr. Romanis's shop on the 2nd of April; I saw the prisoner come in; she placed herself by the stockings on the counter. The first thing I saw her move was a parcel of stockings close to her, by the edge of the counter; I kept my eye upon her. In the course of time the parcel was gone; I could not see how they went. I saw one parcel picked up by her feet. When the second parcel went I told the lad to mind her. I pointed to the lad to pick up a parcel of stockings at the prisoner's feet; he picked them up. She paid for the article she was purchasing. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200029"/>prisoner then turned towards me; I then saw a parcel of stockings between her knees. I said ma'am, you have gone far enough with this; she stooped on oneside, and the stockings dropped. She said, she had nothing. Mr. Romanis then was called down; the account was given to him of the transaction. I asked Mr. Romanis if he wanted a constable; he said, no. The prisoner left the shop, and left the change of a three-shilling piece behind her. After she was gone I said it was very ridiculous to let such a character as her go upon the public. One of the men jumped over the counter, and went after her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I took charge of this woman. I saw her go into the shop. I knew her person. I watched her on the opposite side of the way. I saw her come out again; she seemed as if she was very ill. She turned on the corner to the right, by Mr. Romanis's. I went after her; she was standing up against the step of a door. I asked her what she had got under her arm; it was one pair of black stockings, and different remnants of ribbon. Nothing else was found. When she was laid hold of, Mr. Romanis and this gentleman said she had taken these stockings.</p>
               <p>Must. These are the stockings I saw the prisoner put in her pocket-hole.</p>
               <p>Vaughan. About an hour before this period I saw the prisoner in Holborn; she went into Mr. Townsend's shop; I saw her come out; I watched her to Fleet-market, where there is a person sits and sells ribbons. I saw her drop some ribbon on the stall, and some money passed from her daughter. I watched her from there to Mr. Romanis's shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the stockings off Mr. Romanis's counter. I asked the boy to shew me a pair of black stockings; he shewed me them. I paid for them. When I went into the shop there were several papers of stockings laying on the ground. I am innocent of taking the stockings.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 2nd of March, I was passing through Gracechurch-street with Miller, an officer. I met the prisoner in company with two other men; the prisoner had a knot, and appeared like a porter; I suspected him immediately. I crossed the road, and followed him on the opposite side of the way, and Miller with me. I kept my eye upon him three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go near the Catherine Wheel inn - A. No; we lost sight of him by a quantity of carriages; they were going towards Bishopsgate-street. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards, in passing down Bishopsgate-street, by the church, I met the prisoner with this tub of butter on his knot. He was alone then.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Catherine Wheel inn from Bishopsgate church - A. About one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards, on the same side as Houndsditch, below Houndsditch. I looked at the prisoner, and let him pass a bit. He was going towards the bridge. When I had let him pass I looked round, I saw one of the other men coming after him who had been with him before. The moment he saw me he made across the road, and went down Houndsditch. I immediately pursued the prisoner, and asked him what he had got there; he said he believed it was a tub of butter he was going with to Tower-street; he said a man hired him to carry it at the corner of Sun-street. I took him to the Compter. I found out who the tub of butter belonged to. This is the tub.</p>
               <p>- MILLER. I know nothing further than what Sheppard has stated; his account is correct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Strange. That tub is one of the twenty-four that I ordered to be taken to the Catherine Wheel inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a porter. I was unfortunately led into this. I was returning from Leadenhall-market; I crossed to Sun-street, a man called to me, he asked me to take this to Tower-street; the man said he would follow me. When I came to Cammomile-street the officer came up to me; the man was behind me. If he had any suspicion it was stolen, why not take the man that ran away. I am perfectly innocent.</p>

A person tapped me on the shoulder, and told me that I was robbed. I immediately applied to my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone. I did not perceive it go from me. The officer shewed me the handkerchief, and asked me if it was mine. I am quite sure it was mine. It was a silk handkerchief, worth two or three shillings. An officer had hold of the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner trying to pick his pocket there;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200030"/>he did not succeed in picking his pocket; then the prosecutor passed me. The prisoner followed him until just before he came to the Bull inn, Whitechapel; there I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket. The prisoner had a companion with him; I took them both. The person that was with him did not feel in the prosecutor's pocket. He was committed. The bill has been thrown out. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief; I seized him immediately; he threw the handkerchief down the instant I seized him. I picked up the handkerchief and shewed it to the prosecutor; he claimed it. This is the handkerchief. Smith, the officer, was with me.</p>

I had been spending the evening, and did not return home until between the hours of one and two on the 19th of March. When I returned, I was let in by a servant maid; I observed to her, that I smelled a sulpherous smell, I would be satisfied from whence it arose before I went to bed. I searched about. I went into the accompting-house; it was stronger there than in the other part; still I could not perceive any fire. I then went into a back warehouse; the first thing that attracted my attention was a private door bursted open inwards, it had been forced inwards, and a table that stood before it had been misplaced, and a can of oil throwed down. It immediately occurred to me that some one had entered the house that way, and as I had got no weapon I thought it necessary to get one. I immediately went to the dining-room, and took the poker. I came down stairs with the candle in one hand and the poker in the other, and went towards the door that was open. Anybody that gets down the area, if they push the door a person can come in my house; they must drop nine feet. While we were in the back warehouse, the servant screamed out, there is a man. She ran and opened the street door. I then perceived a man; that man afterwards turned out to be the prisoner. I then perceived the prisoner secreted under a bench; that bench is used by my workmen occasionally. He came out, and the moment he came out he sprang at my collar to seize me, as I suppose. I struck him upon the side of the head, knocked him down, and as he was getting up I repeated my blow upon the back part of the head; he then closed with me, and in that act the candle went out of my hand. We were in darkness. Nobody came to my assistance. I kept hold of him, and conceiving he might do me an injury I was anxious to get him towards the front door for assistance. At the front door the servant maid was calling out, murder! thieves! This was about fifteen yards from the front door. We were in the passage then. I had to get him through the door of the passage. I was obliged to release him from the grasp of one hand; the door of the passage opened inwards; I was obliged to loose one hand to get the door open. At that moment, by a sudden spring, he got out of my hands; he broke from me; I pursued him, crying, stop thief. He got out of the front door, but as I lost sight of him within a few paces I was fearful of misleading the hue and cry; I therefore still continued, and cried stop thief, as loud as I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Before he broke from you had you any opportunity of observing him so as to speak to his features - A. Not at that moment. At the time he broke from me he ran into the street; I could see no one about the house but the girl screaming at the door, murder and thieves. When I returned, the patrol of the adjoining parish came up; I requested him to come in, and he and I examined the house to see whether there was any more persons in; there was no other person; there was a pair of boots and a hat belonging to no one in my house. The person that escaped from me had no hat on, that I am sure of; I rather think he had no boots or shoes on. While we were searching the house, the watchman of the adjoining parish came to inform me the man was secured in the watchhouse. The watchman's name is Flemming. I went there, and saw the prisoner without a hat, and without any boots or shoes on his feet, and the boots that we carried he owned, as well as the hat. I believe I asked him first whether he meaned to murder me; he said, no, God forbid. I then asked him how he came to do such an act; he said necessity had driven him to it. It was not till after the examination at the magistrate that I found that the lock of my desk had been forced; and this instrument which I produce I found in the passage. The instrument had cut away part of the wood work; the impression on the bolt exactly corresponds with the instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say how he got in - A. He declined answering that. The prisoner's head was very bloody; I conceived that arose from the blows I had given him. That is all I know.</p>

I was occasionally in the shop. Whether the other servant was in there I cannot say with certainty; he had no business there particularly.</p>

I had two fifty-pound bank notes in my dwelling-house, they were in my bedroom, in this old pocket-book, and the pocket-book in this little box, and the little box was in this cannister, and the cannister was in the cupboard locked. I occupy the whole house; I rent it myself; I have got the lease of it; my house is in the parish of St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the notes - A. About a fortnight before I discharged the prisoner, that was on the 16th of March. The prisoner was my servant about two months; I discharged her on the 16th of March. About a fortnight before that, I took eight pounds out of the cupboard; I saw the two fifty pound notes in the pocket-book.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss them - A. On the 5th of April. When I found that I had lost two fifty-pound notes, I sent a friend to the bankers to find out the numbers; I had suspicion of the prisoner. I had the prisoner taken up the very day that I missed the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to know that she knew where you put the notes - A Yes. When I took the eight one-pound notes out of the cupboard she was present at the time, at the cupboard; she was present when I asked my wife for the money. I said, I was short of money to go to market. She heard me ask my wife for money, and heard where the money was. My wife asked my son to go up stairs and unlock the cupboard, and let me have some money. The cupboard door I never could unlock or lock it; my wife and son could; my wife always kept the key. My son went up, and I went with him; he unlocked the cupboard; I took eight pounds out; she did not see that. I put the money in again myself; the two fifty-pound notes were in the pocket-book at that time, I put them in myself, and a two-pound note with them. She left the two-pound note behind, and took the two fifty-pound notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was - A. Yes; his name was Reorden. She said, she wanted for Reorden, a coat, waistcoat, breeches, shirt, hat, stockings, handkerchief, drawers, and shoes; the shoes I had none to give him; I gave him eight shillings to buy them. She told me that she had a fifty-pound note to change; I considered about the size of the note. I asked her where she got the note; she told me she got it as prize money from her brother on board the Corvas. I told her I was not in the habit of taking these large notes without going to the Bank to know whether they were right or not.

I said, I am glad it is stopped, my mistress shall have it again. I came down Rosemary-lane; I met Reorden; I told him I found a note. I said, what is it; he said, let us go in here, and change it. He whispered something to the gentleman. He told me to say I had some prize money. The gentleman went to the Bank, and got the note changed. Reorden said I had better not have the change for fear it should be found about me. The clothes I had of the gentleman were old clothes, not worth the money he charged.</p>

On the 15th of April, I was returning home, about twelve o'clock at night, I went into Mr. Rogers's, the Swan and Hoop public-house, on the Pavement, Moorfields; I think it was before I went into Mr. Rogers's. I went into the tap-room to a box, there were four men sitting drinking there out of a pot of porter; the prisoner was one; there were three other men besides him sat in the same box; one of the other men was dressed in a short jacket, another in a long coat, he appeared like a coachman; there was a person in a straight coat, similar to my own, he was of a sandy complexion. I staid there about an hour and a half, or more perhaps. While I was drinking a glass of rum and water, which I called for, the coachman asked me to drink with him; I refused. The prisoner made an observation, that he had no right to ask me to drink when he had not paid himself for what he had drank. The prisoner addressed himself to me, and called me a tailor, and a great many other names that I do not recollect; he was rude to me. After I had drank up my sixpennyworth of rum and water, the coachman proposed to have a shillingsworth; which we had in. After that I declined having more; I said, it was time to go home. The prisoner and the man in the short jacket went out together; in about three minutes the coachman and I went out together. I turned to the left hand to go home; the coachman to the right. When I came out of the door I went up the Pavement, along Finsbury-place to Finsbury-square, and when I came opposite of Dr. Jones's, I was going across over the road, I was attacked by three men.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the three men - A. Yes, I amsure of it. Immediately they came upon me I turned round; before I got quite round I received a blow in my mouth, which knocked me down; that blow was with the fist. After I was down the third man took my property from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your property - A. In my left hand breeches pocket; that was five one-pound bank notes, and nineteen shillings in silver; I put it in my pocket the very same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shortly before the time you were robbed - A. Yes, I counted my money in the morning, and I took it out at Mr. Rogers's. I took six notes out, gave Mr. Rogers one to change; I put the other five notes back. I am sure I had five one-pound notes and nineteen shillings in silver; that was in my pocket at the time I was knocked down. I got up; and called watch, and the watchman took the prisoner; he met him as he was coming to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it soon after you called out watch - A. Yes. The watchman took him into custody. He shewed me the man; I immediately recollected him to be the man with whom I had been drinking in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other persons that knocked you down - A. The other two were the men that had been in the box with me; the coachman who came out with me was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get your money again I take it - A. No. I have no sort of doubt the prisoner is the man. The watchman is here that took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200034"/>Q. Vasey, where had you been drinking before you came to his house - A. At Mr. Vaughan's, in Coleman-street. I drank two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You were near two hours in this public-house A. Yes. At Mr. Rogers's I had sixpennyworth of rum and water, and the coachman and I had a shillingsworth of rum and water between us.</p>

            . I am an officer. I live at No. 10, Lanthorn-court. I am a ward officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Mr. Rogers's that evening - A. Yes, about ten minutes before two; I saw Vasey there; he sat in the box as he has described. There was only three there when I went in; the prisoner, the man in the short jacket, and coachman; the other had gone out when I went in. I was drinking a glass of porter at Mr. Rogers's. After I drank my porter I sat down two or three minutes; the prisoner and the man in a short jacket went out; they left the coachman and Vasey; they might go out three or four minutes after them. I went out before Vasey and the coachman. When I went out I saw the prisoner and the man in the short jacket standing against the Globe, on the pavement, at the corner of Fore-street. I had suspicion of the man in the short jacket; I thought I might have seen him before on the Pavement. I went over the way to facing of Fore-street; I waited there about two or three minutes; Mr. Vasey and the man, supposed to be a coachman, came out. When they came out, Vasey went towards his home; the coachman went the other way; he passed by these men standing against the Globe; in half a minute he returned back to them again. Vasey had gone on by himself; the other three were about a minute or two talking together; they went from there across Moorfields, and came out again facing of Short-street. I was going up the pavement. I saw the three men facing of Short-street; one of them went down Little Moorfields, and the other two went up the Pavement. I went up to the top of the Pavement; it was out of the ward of Coleman-street. I did not trouble myself any further. As I was coming down again afterwards, in about a quarter of an hour, I heard the call of watch; I ran up to where I heard the cry proceed from, to Finsbury-square. When I went up I saw the watchman had the prisoner in custody. I am sure he is the same person that I had seen before in Mr. Rogers's public-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a watchman. On the morning of the 15th I heard a man call watch a little before half past two; I directly came out of my box, and ran towards the sound, into Finsbury-square. I met the prisoner running towards me; I seized him, and then I sprang my rattle for assistance. The prisoner was in a flurry. The patrol and Mr. Vasey came up; Vasey bid me hold up the lanthorn to his face; I did; he said, that is the man that knocked me down. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything the matter with the prisoner's little finger - A. The skin was knocked off the little finger on his right hand, as if fresh done, and bleeding. The prisoner is the man I took in custody, and the man the prosecutor charged with knocking him down.</p>

            . I keep the Swan and Hoop public-house. On the morning of the 15th, I remember the prisoner and Vasey being at my house, and also the witness Girton. I have heard the account the other witness has given, it is correct; they went out as has been stated. Vasey appeared to be the worse for liquor. He had one sixpennyworth of rum and water in my house, and part of a shillings-worth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know which of the two houses the Irish linen was taken to - A. Our stock of Irish linen was taken to the two houses, but this piece of Irish liner that was lost was taken to Mr. Harris's; the pieces of linen were marked from number 1 to 20, and the cost price was marked on them; besides the cost price, is O and W, which is the mark that we use for half-a-crown; the O for two shillings, and W for sixpence; the name of the manufacturer was on the outside, as it is to all linens, generally on the outside of the piece of cloth. After the linens were removed to Mr. Harris's, I picked them up in the parlour myself. I have every reason to believe the bulk of these linens were removed to Mr. Harris's. They were marked off, but not removed away, consequently they were the more easy to be got at. The whole box had been marked that day. They were taken that night, on the alarm of fire, to Mr. Harris's, and brought back in the morning, before our shop was open. It was the same morning they were brought away about half past seven. My young men brought them back. I did not superintend the bringing them back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the prisoners - A. The woman prisoner lived servant to Mr. Harris. I know her person. She was in the room when the goods were piled up.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200035"/>Q. How long was it before you suspected any of your linens were gone - A. I never did suspect when they were brought; I never counted them again. They were counted when delivered, but not counted when brought back. I found it out on the 7th of March. I had information. I accompanied Mr. Harris and a constable, now in court, and Mr. Ingram, to a house in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road, where

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know his person - A. Quite well. On the 14th of April, between seven and eight, he came into my master's shop; he asked for two ounces of Spanish juice; he paid me for it; he then asked me for a quarter of a pound of soap. When I was cutting the soap he took the tea and ran into the street. The tea was in a bag, ready to be sent off; six pounds; forty-three shillings was the value of it; that is what it cost my master. I have the liberty of looking at the bills. The tea was sold for forty-five shillings. After the prisoner took the tea, he ran sharp out of the shop; I followed him, crying, stop thief. He throwed the tea down. I kept running after him. He crossed the street; I took him before he reached over the street; by running, I trod on his heel; we both fell down together. I secured him, and took him back to the shop, and gave him into custody. A gentleman took the tea into the shop. When I got up I saw him with the tea; and when the gentleman brought the tea into the shop I could tell it was the same tea, by the fold of the tea. There was a bill of the tea in it. I put the tea up myself. I gave the parcel of tea to Thomas Hudson, the constable.</p>

I went there between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday night. The family dined out on the Sunday. The prisoner was house-maid; I was cook. She took my things up in the garret after I came. The blue cloth mantle I wore when I came to the place, I took up stairs, and put by the bedside, on a chair. When my things was taken away that was taken away with the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a velvet spencer - A. Yes, and two white dimity petticoats, one new shift made and one unmade, and a cotton gown. I had all those things in the garret. On the Sunday after the family were gone out,

             sent me out to get some porter. I staid about two minutes, and when I came back I went into the kitchen to dinner. The prisoner appeared as if she heard something up stairs; she went up stairs. Presently she called out, cook. I answered, what is the matter. She answered, there is a man gone out with a bundle. I asked her to open the door, to follow the man. She shut the door again, and insisted upon me going up stairs to see what was lost. I went up the stairs, and the first thing I saw was the coverlid of our bed was on the two pair landing, and my things were in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all your things in the coverlid - A. All that were left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there the blue cloth mantle, the spencer, and the things that have been mentioned - A. No, they were gone. Some of the other things were in the coverlid; the petticoats, cotton gown, the new shift made up, were gone; the shift not made was in the coverlid. I suspected the prisoner, and got a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day when the things were taken away - A. On Sunday the 3d of April, I applied for a search warrant on Monday the 4th of April. On Wednesday morning, the constable came with the search warrant and searched the prisoner's box; he got the key of the box from the prisoner, and in the prisoner's box was found my silk handkerchief folded up in her own petticoat; nothing else of mine was in her box; on a shelf by the bedside was found a shift marked in my own name, and under the bed I found the remainder of the articles that I lost; my master then desired I would leave the house, I being a stranger in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that anything happened to this coach-house - A. On the night of the 9th of February the coach-house was broken open, and a box coat taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. What connection has the coach-house with the dwelling-house - A. It is attached to the dwelling-house; there is a door way from the coach-house to the stable, and another door way from the stable to the dwelling-house; it is part of the dwelling-house. At seven o'clock in the night I was in the coach-house; when I came out I left nobody there; I locked the door; I brought the key away with me. I was alarmed at half past eleven at night by

            , a coachman. I had the key with me then; I got up, and went to the coach-house immediately. I found the coach-house door thrown wide open; the stable door lock had been picked apparently. We go through the stable door into the coach-house; that was the door I had locked the same night before I went into the coach-house to see what was the matter. I observed my box coat was gone. I had worn the box coat about two months. It was my master's property. I have seen the coat since in Mr. Foy's possession.</p>

            . Q. Do you know Butcher, the prisoner - A. Yes; I was in the habit of dealing with him. I cannot tell what day it was when he came to me, it was between twelve and one o'clock; he told me to go to his wife, he had left a great coat with her for me to buy; I was to give two-pounds for it; he had one box coat to dispose off. I saw his wife; I gave her two pounds for it. I brought the coat away with me. I parted with it to Mr. Foy. I was in custody. I told my children to take it to Mr. Foy. I come here to day from the house of correction.</p>

            . I am an extra weigher at the Custom House. On the 26th of February, I was in Water-lane; that is a street leading from the Custom House; I saw the prisoner coming down the lane; he had this ticket on him. I searched him; in his left hand waistcoat pocket I took the silver forks which I produce; they are partly melted; and in his right hand waistcoat pocket I took these silver bowls of spoons; in his hat I found these melted pieces of silver. I asked him where he picked them up; he said, off the ruins. He said he was going to Mr. Piper for a wheelbarrow; it was his duty to have given them to an officer. There is thirty-two ounces in all.</p>

               <p>Q. You also had a servant of the name of Sheffield - A. I had. Some time ago I had altered my shop front, and taken the door off. I placed the door in a cellar in the neighbourhood with other property. That door was taken from the cellar without my knowledge and consent. In consequence of information from Sheffield, I employed two officers to go to the house of Paul, a carpenter, on Saffron-hill. The officers brought back to me the same door that I had lost. The door is worth three pounds. I have no partner.</p>

            . I am in the employment of the prosecutor. In consequence of something that occurred, I communicated to the prosecutor the taking of this door; it was taken on the 7th of March from the cellar in Greyfriars, in the occupation of Mr. Patrick. We all three took the door from the cellar; Pember sold it to Paul, a timber merchant, on Saffron-hill. Pember sold the door to Paul for nine shillings; Burke and I watched him to see him take the door to Paul's. The money was to be shared between us. We went to the coffee-house the corner of Fleet-market, and had coffee for breakfast with part of the money Pember got of Paul for the door.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PAUL. I am a carpenter; I live on Saffron-hill. In the month of March, Pember, Burke, and Sheffield brought a door to me; I gave them nine shillings for it; that was the full value of it to me.</p>

We took the iron bars and a large brass York lanthorn, to Butler, in Chick-lane, Smithfield. The lanthorn was sound before we took it. Pember kicked the glass all out of it. It was plate. The lanthorn was worth six or seven pounds. Pember and Burke both carried the iron and the brass. I went with them, and saw them carry it; the brass lanthorn and the old iron was carried at twice. We received of Butler for the iron twenty shillings, and eight shillings and sixpence for the brass.</p>

I observed the prisoners coming from the interior of the shop; from their manner and appearance I suspected them, I seized hold of Watlin, and took from her the piece of Irish-linen in question; she had it folded up in her apron. I perceived the apron projected out, that excited my suspicion. She said, she did not bring it out of my shop, but had picked it up at the threshold of my door. I took it from her, and held Watlin; Barnard was a little before. I turned Watlin in the shop. I said, if one of the young men would take her, I would go after the other. I pursued<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200038"/>Barnard into a passage just by, and brought her back; she walked quick. When I stopped Watlin, Barnard was standing in Horse-shoe-court, as if at a loss where to go. When I took hold of Barnard she threw a piece of gingham from herself; it is not our property. The value of the piece I took from Watlin is more than two pounds ten-shillings.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Vipond and Remington. I saw both the prisoners come into our shop as companions, they asked to see some pieces of calico; I shewed them some. Watlin bought two yards, and paid me. I served them at the back part of the shop; there were entire pieces of linen laying on the counter where I served them. There were three shopmen in the shop besides me; they are not here. I did not miss any thing until after Mr. Remington had stopped Watlin; I then discovered a piece of linen was missing from the back part of the shop.</p>

            , cheesemonger, in Whitechapel; that is very near the Red Lion. On Thursday, the 10th of March, between one and two o'clock, I saw this cart standing near the Red Lion-yard; I saw the prisoner put his hand in the front of the cart, and take a brown paper parcel out; he ran away, across Whitechapel, and up Essex-street; I lost sight of him there. I saw him about two hours afterwards in the custody of Miller and Freeman, officers. I am certain the prisoner is the man that took the parcel out of the cart.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREEMAN. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of March; I took him at the back of Levy's house in Wentworth-street. Miller was at the front; I went to the back of the house. It is a common receiving house, kept by one Levy. I saw him coming out of the back of Levy's house. I took two of them; the prisoner was one of them. I then took him to the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any appearance of a shop to this house - A. It is a kind of a chandler's shop. There I found my brother officer prevented from going up stairs. I saw the paper that apparently contained the parcel, burning; the paper was burning in a back room on the ground floor. I told the prisoner I took him for stealing a parcel out of a cart in Red Lion-street; he said, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. Yes, I know his person well. The parcel has never been found.</p>

            . I am a brother officer to the last witness. I went into Levy's house at the front door, and in a little room there was a great deal of brown paper in flames; I got some of it out, and was in the act of trampling it under my feet to put the flames out. A young man that was in the house ran up stairs, his name is Levy; I believe he is a relation to the man that keeps the house. He ran up stairs, and I after him to the top of the first landing; there they have got a door that shuts to; he barred the door against me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the parcel the paper contained - A. I do not know. At the top of the house they have got a pigeon-trap. They might have throwed it into another yard. I went down for the poker to break the door open. He let me in after some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Keep a good look out after this Mr. Levy - A. Yes; he does a great deal of mischief.</p>

The wash-house is part of the dwelling-house; it is under the same roof; it communicates to the rest of the house; that door was secured by two bolts and a bell. I fastened these bolts myself; I see every night that they are fastened; there are no key to the door.</p>

No; I was the last person up, and between three and four, the servant saw a light in the wash-house; she informed me that she saw a light in the wash-house. I arose, and went and fetched a constable. I did not see the prisoner: I saw a light. The constable came as fast as he could. The constable and my son took the prisoner; he was taken when I came back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him in the yard - A.

               <p>Q. Could you see how any person get into the house - A. Yes, by boring holes over the door large<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200040"/>enough to admit a hand to pull the bolt back. The officer has got the things found in the yard; I shall know them when I see them.</p>

He took them outside of the wash-house; he was going to wring them out, to tie them up in a bundle. The constable came before my mistress, and took the prisoner in the yard.</p>

I moved them from the side of the wash-house door; I left the things in the care of Mrs. Lee. I left the things on the top of the wash-house lid; I ordered them not to be touched until I returned. I found them in the same state as I left them when I returned, and then I delivered them to Cooper, the officer. I returned in less than an hour afterwards.</p>

            . I am a Queen-square officer. I was applied to by the last witness to receive the things. On Friday the 8th, at two o'clock in the morning, I went with the last witness to the place where the robbery was done; there I found the things in a wet state at the washhouse door; some of it had been wrung, and some not. We brought them away. I examined the premises where the robbery had been done. On looking at the washhouse door there appeared to be seven or eight cuts with a centre bit, which had all been broken into one just over the top bolt, and there was one round one just over the bottom bolt, so that any person might put their finger in and pull the bolt back. I took the things away, and went to the watchhouse at Knightsbridge, where the prisoner was confined. I searched the prisoner; here is a silk handkerchief and a white apron I found upon him. I had information where he lived. I searched his lodgings the next morning; I there found tools of various sorts, such as chisels, centre bits, tools used by house-breakers. These are the articles that belong to the prosecutrix. I am sure they are the things I found in her premises.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. I understood you at first to say there was only one outer door to the house; we find now there is a door to the washhouse at the back of the house, and an outer door at the front of the house - A. Yes. The front door was fast when I came down stairs; I fastened it the over night. There is a lock to that door, a bolt, and a bar. These articles produced by Cooper are my property. They are marked, Hatchett's hotel. They were in my copper for the purpose of washing; they were in a wet state when taken away; they were washed the same night; they were safe in the copper when I went to bed. I fastened the washhouse door with two bolts and a latch. The constable left the linen some time in the the washhouse; they had not been meddled with at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing his defence.</p>

I found the staple that held the padlock was drawn. I have seen the coat since, and have sworn to it.</p>

On the 1st of December, the housekeeper and I went out together, and left no one in the house about three o'clock in the day. I fastened all the shutters and locked the doors. I am sure all the street doors were fastened when I went out. We returned home about half past eight in the evening. I took the key out of my pocket, and went out to unlock the area gate; I found it shut, but unlocked. I went down the area steps to get into the house; the door was bolted inside; at last I got in at the stair window. I then found the closet in the pantry broken open, where I keep my plate; there were five plated candlesticks gone, and one silver table-spoon. I went up stairs into the drawing-room; there were two new hats lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they - A. Mr. Jackson's. In the wardrobe, a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of small-clothes were gone. In the next room to the bedroom, a new pair of stockings and a new pair of boots were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the owner of all these things - A. Me and my master what I lost in the pantry; the five candlesticks are master's; the table-spoon and two pair of boots are mine; the tea-caddy and sugar-tongs were mine. My things are worth more than forty shillings, and master's property I am sure is worth more than forty shillings. Master paid for his boots three pounds; they are very stout.</p>

I found none of the articles in this indictment. I afterwards went to the lodging of John Beckett Clements by the order of the magistrate; he lived at 24, North-street, Mary-le-bone. I first apprehended Clark. Clark told me he had these boots of a man of the name of Joseph, who is here as a witness. The next day after I took Clark I apprehended Joseph. Joseph said to the magistrate, if the magistrate would permit him he would disclose the man that did the robbery. Johnson took Joseph to shew us the person that he bought the boots of. We did not take Joseph into the house; we left him outside while we went in to search that place. We searched his lodgings; in a drawer of the prisoners we found forty-two picklock keys, a dark lanthorn, some phosphorus, wax tapers, and an iron crow, in North-street, Mary-le-bone; that is

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On Thursday the 17th of March, I went to No. 41, Horn-alley, Little Greenwich, Aldersgate-street. I went there about the middle of the day; I found the prisoner there. I knew it was her house from the information I received; I went there, accompanied by Mr. Fish, one of the inspectors of the Bank of England. I searched the room below stairs, and two rooms up stairs. After I had searched the three rooms and the prisoner, I searched over the stair-case between the uprights, between the lath and plaister; there I found a parcel in a brown paper. The prisoner was with me at that time. That parcel contained bank notes. I said to the prisoner, what is this; she denied knowing anything of it whatever. She said she had lodgers in her house, and probably they might have put it there; and she had had different workmen in the house. I then took her below stairs to Mr. Fish, and shewed him the notes. Mr. Fish said they were forged notes in her presence. She denied knowing anything of them, and mentioned respecting her lodgers, and that she had a workman to fix up a grate. Mr. Fish enquired of her when her lodgers went away; she said they went away in the middle of November. The parcel was quite clean, and had not the appearance of having been there a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you find these things - A. In the staircase, in a hole in the lath and plaister, between the uprights. These are the notes I found in the parcel; ten one-pound notes, and five two-pound notes.</p>

The signatures to the one's and the two's are the same hand-writing; the three stated in the indictment are dated 15th of December, 1813.</p>

On the night of the 5th of that month, I was doing duty at Dungeness; I had a party of my own men in my own cutter, the Carter; and also a party of men from the Lively cutter; about ten o'clock at night, I saw a lugger; she was standing towards shore, and she run aground. I boarded her immediately; she was a shore. I boarded her with my own men and the men belonging to the Lively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your boarding her, what became of her crew - A. They immediately left the lugger, and went on shore. The name of the lugger was the Diana; her cargo consisted of six hundred and sixty-five casks of brandy, one hundred and eighteen of rum; (by casks, I mean half anchors, four gallons) twenty-three of vinegar, four of wine, a case of wine, one basket of wine, one hundred and nineteen bags of tobacco, forty-three bags of ditto, twelve bags of pepper, and two chests of tea. I sent to the barracks, and got some of the Lancashire militia. After I got them and was giving the Serjeant orders, the smuglers fired upon me; upon that the Serjeant gave orders for the soldiers to fire; that cleared the beach immediately. I remained with my vessel all night.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any one of the persons that came down doing any thing particular to yourself - A. No, I cannot remember who it was. I was wounded in my thumb; I suppose it to be by a cutlass. There was a firing. This musket was presented to me; I twisted it away from the man, and hove it to the other side of the lugger. This musket was presented to me by somebody; the musket touched me; I threw it in the lugger.</p>

The thing I went for I spilled; I was therefore obliged to go back again. I heard a pane of glass break as I went along Hatton Wall; I saw the prisoner put his hand in the window and part of his arm, and I saw him pull part of his arm and his hand out of the window. I passed him, and went over and told the watchman. The watchman went and took the prisoner. The prisoner is the same person I am sure.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On my going up Wellbeck-street I saw the prisoner tying up something at a door. It was rather before eight o'clock. I do not know what it was. That was in Wellbeck-street. Housham's house is in William-street. He put the bundle on his shoulder. I followed him to Wigmore-street; I there stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, bread. I there said, where did you buy the bread; he said, down Wigmore-street. That is a contrary way to where he came from. I took him in custody, and took him to the watchhouse. He dropped one half quartern brick out of the bundle as I was taking him to the watchhouse; the rest I took with him into the watchhouse. At the watchhouse there were four half quarterns, and a quartern loaf besides. There were six loaves in the whole. I produce two of them.</p>

I was at home at the time this happened; it was about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening; the day light was entirely gone. I was sitting in the back parlour in company with my wife, (the outer door always stands open) I heard a great noise in the passage; I took the candle to ascertain what was the matter. When I came into the passage I saw the prisoner in the passage; he was taken in custody by an opposite neighbour; Mr. Watkins had hold of him. Mr. Watkins said he had information that a man had entered my house, and he suspected he was robbing me. The prisoner was struggling with Mr. Watkins to get away from him. We sent for a constable; the prisoner was secured and searched; nothing was found on him, but in the part of the passage where I found the prisoner struggling with Mr. Watkins there were a quantity of wearing apparel laying close to the prisoner, together with a quart pot. That apparel had been kept in a trunk in the kitchen. The man's apparel was mine, the gowns my wife's.</p>

On the 19th of March, a little after three in the afternoon, I was in the accompting-house; I saw the prisoner and another man lurking about the window. I had suspicion they were going to steal something. I concealed myself behind the iron chest in the accompting-house. The prisoner came into the shop; he muttered something; he looked about him, and up and down the street; he also looked up stairs; he took the firkin of butter on his shoulder, and walked towards the door, but hearing me coming he put it down. He said he thought it was an empty tub but finding it was a fall one he put it down again. I collared him, and sent for a constable. The prisoner begged I would forgive him. This is the tub that contained the butter. There was sixty pounds weight of butter; it is worth more than three pounds.</p>

On the day before mentioned, about half past seven, the two prisoners came into the shop; Fautley asked to look at some ribbons. Bowers and Fautley were close together. I took out a box with a great many ribbons in it, and put it before them. Fautley took her bonnet off, and laid it on the ribbon box, and measured her bonnet to see what quantity it would take to him it. She objected to the assortment, and wished to see more. I turned round to take out another box, and on turning to them again I saw Fautley take her hand from the box, and put something into her pocket. I suspected she had taken something. She then asked me to shew her some white ribbon; I turned from her to take out the white ribbon box, and when I turned again I saw the same as before. She took her hand from the box, and put something in her pocket. she bought a yard and a half of ribbon, and left the shop. I went after her and stopped her about half a dozen yards from the shop. I told her I suspected she had taken some ribbons. I brought her back and searched her, and found no ribbon upon her. I found one piece of ribbon in the shop, and Mr. Mason brought in a piece of ribbon; he said his wife picked it up in the area, just by where I stopped the prisoners. Bowers begged my pardon, and wished Fautley to do so; Fautley refused.</p>

            . The prisoner had a large basket on his shoulders, and when he came out of the shed he went along by the side of the hedge; I thought he observed me; I had suspicion of him. I went round to the gate with intent to meet him; he saw me; he stopped. I got over the gate. I asked him what business he had in that shed; he told me he had not been in the shed. I then said, I saw you come out of the shed. I asked him what he had in his basket; he said, he did not know; the basket did not belong to him. I took the basket into a public-house, and examined it; the basket contained turkeys and fowls; they had all been recently killed. At Hatton Gardon office the prisoner said he found them on Harrow-hill-common. They proved to be the property of Mr. Buck.</p>

               <p>JAMES WELLS. I am a gardener to Mr. William Buck, he lives at Hendon. On Wednesday night, the 13th, I saw the fowls all safe then. On Thursday morning, I went to the shed, and missed the turkeys and fowls; I have seen them since at Hatton Garden office; I am sure they were Mr. Buck's property.</p>

He said, he had the check about half an hour before of Mr. Frazer, junior, in the Six Clerks office; I told the prisoner I thought it impossible; I must detain him until I found Mr. Frazer. I found Mr. Frazer, junior, in about an hour afterwards, and brought him to the prisoner. Mr. Frazer told the boy he knew very well he did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And added, you had better tell all about it, did not he - A. Yes; he asked him to tell the truth.</p>

He cannot write so good a hand as that. The lad was a good boy with me. That very morning Mr. Frazer gave him a draft in go and get ten pounds for him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 14th of February, I received information that some boots had been offered for sale at a public-house, Union-street, St. James's. I went with the first witness and asked the landlord if same boots had not been offered for sale there. I then went to a place where a man had offered a pair of boots; it turned out to be the prosecutors. That man is not here. I found they were a pair that were lost. I came back to the public-house; the landlord told me of the prisoner, Clark. I came back to the public-house; and took the the prisoner, Clark, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that - A. On the 14th of February, at ten o'clock at night. I challenged him about the boots; he said he sold them to this man, coachman to Lady Jersey. I told him he had other pairs of boots at home; he acknowledged he had, and told me to whom he had sold them. I searched his person; on him I found three watches. I took him to the watchhouse. I went and searched his lodging; there I found a fourth watch. One of the four watches has been owned; it was stolen from a coachman. I found also thirteen bad three-shilling tokens, and two padlock keys. I asked him of whom he had received the boots; he told me he had bought the boots of the witness Joseph. The next day I took Joseph into custody; in his bag I found two pair of boots. He is admitted an evidence. He then charged the two prisoners, Clements. I went with him and an officer of the name of Johnson to the house of

The prisoner came to my house and asked for a lodging for himself and another young man that was afraid of being imprest. I told him I could accommodate him. He sat down and had tea with me. The prisoner said he had brought home some handsome shawls with him. I said I had a handsome shawl my husband brought me home; he asked to look at it; I shewed it him. He said it was a handsome shawl, and seemed to like it. I put it in the cupboard. At night the prisoner went to bed he told me to get up early in the morning; he should want breakfast early. When I got up I went into the room; I saw the prisoner was not in bed; he was gone. I missed my pelisse and shawl. The prisoner must have gone out at the window. I have never seen my pelisse nor shawl again.</p>

I returned a little after eight. I am positive I left the house very secure. When I returned I found a great many people about the door of my neighbours. I asked what was the matter; they told me my house was broken open. I went into the shop. I am in the grocery and oil trade. I found nothing gone from my shop.

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of March, I saw the two prisoners in Green's-court; Poulteney-street, suspecting their intention, I followed them down Princes-street to Orange-street; they went once or twice round Orange-street, and into the courts, and looked up to see if there was any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200052"/>lights in the houses; they went from there until they came to Whitcomb-street, to the prosecutrix's house, there they walked about some time; at last Bannister got close to the door, leaving Huggins on the opposite side of the way; when the prisoner Bannister knocked loud at the door, and crossed to the other side of the way to the other prisoner. Then they both crossed over, and Bannister then knocked at the door again; they walked about a few minutes Finding nobody answered the door, the prisoner Bannister tried the latch with something, as if he was trying to open the door; Huggins went up to him. They both got close together, apparently to me, as if they were opening the door with something in their hands; it being night, I could not tell what they had got in their hand. They left the door sharp, and went on the other side of the way; stopped there about half a moment looking about these. They both crossed over to the door again; the prisoner Bannister then entered in at the doorway, into the passage, followed by the prisoner Huggins. They got the door open; Bannister got in, and was followed by Huggins. After they had been there about half a minute, I went up to the door; I found it a jar. I looked through the keyhole, and perceived a light in the passage; seeing that, I crossed to the opposite side of way, and stood upon a high step nearly opposite, two minutes; when I saw the prisoner Huggins come to the window of the one pair; I could see Bannister by the light of the back-room one pair of stairs. Huggins shut the windows to; Bannister was behind on the right of the room, with a candle in his hand. I asked several people to assist me; nobody would. I went to a public-house about fifty yards up in the street, I called out a witness which I have got here to assist me going and detecting them in the house; that witness's name is Chapman. Before I came out of the public-house, the prisoner Huggins ran sharp across the way, and Bannister went down the same side of the way, towards Cockspur-street; I saw them go one one way, and the other the other. After they came out of the house, I lost sight of Huggins about three minutes. I kept my eye sharp upon Bannister in Cockspur-street; I watched him until I came to Spring-gardens; Bannister crossed the way, and went on the side the King's-mews is; then the two prisoners joined together again. Then I suspected they were going back. The young man with me, had a red coat on; I desired him to keep at a distance; I thought they would perceive him. I followed them up Whitcomb-street; they went into the house again the second time; when they went in the house the second time, my witness was not near me. I pulled the door, and shut them inside of the house; they were inside of the shop then with a light. I alarmed Mr. Shephard; he sent his servant out to me. I stopped about five minutes at the door; by my shutting the door it alarmed them inside, and instead of them coming out of the passage door, they unlocked the shop door, and Huggins came out; I catched hold of him, and with that, the other was peeping down by the side of the shop coming out; I catched Bannister in the shop, he was creeping out upon the ground. I then took them into Mr. Shephard's passage, and searched them. On Bannister I found a latch key, which will open the door as if it was made for it, and a small key, and a knife; on Huggins I found a knife, another latch key, and two small keys. I then took them to the watchhouse, and went back to secure the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property upon them - A. Not there. I returned to the watchhouse; I searched them again. I could not search them so well in the passage, there were so many ladies there. At the watchhouse I found on Huggins five three-shilling bank tokens and two shillings wrapped up in the corner of his shirt tail, and a watch in his fob, with three gold seals and a gold watch-chain. On Bannister I found a dollar, a three-shilling token, and two sixpences, and some halfpence. I then went to Huggins's lodgings; he is a dealer in marine stores. I found four picklock keys tied up in this flannel; I went from there to his stable; he keeps a horse and cart; he is a dealer in fowls and fighting dogs. In the hay-rack I found seven skeleton keys. In Mrs. Hodgkins's shop I found this chisel, it was laying down against their feet; it appears to be the chisel that broke open the trunk. I compared it with the trunk where they got the money out; there is a mark on the trunk that corresponds with this chisel. Directly I put to the door; they put the light out. The dollar and money described is the same money, although she cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Walford. You knew these men perfectly well - A. Of course; I had seen their faces that evening. I set off first at dark from my house to watch them; I disguised myself. I went so on purpose to take them. It was about seven o'clock when they first entered the house; the second time it was just eight o'clock when they came out of the house; I remember the clock striking as I was going along with them to the watchhouse.</p>

I went and concealed them at my mother's house that night, and the same night I and Freeman slept together at Butcher's house. On the next day I got the glasses away from my mother's; we were going to sell them at some acquaintance of Freeman's in Golden-lane, and then when we were going up Chick-lane two officers detected us, and took us in custody with them. We had three examinations.</p>

I told him he must give me a better account than that, or else I should take him before the magistrate. I then took him to a public-house, and searched them. I found nothing upon Freeman; on

On Saturday the 16th of this month, Mr. Johnson sent me out, and when I returned the prisoner was in the house; my fellow servant had shewed him into the room and left him there by himself. The prisoner told me I wanted a servant to go to Scotland, he understood. I said I did, for a lady, the wages was twenty-two pounds and livery. I said, perhaps, if the servant suited the lady she would give guineas. I afterwards shewed the prisoner out. At night, when I was going to bed, I took my watch out of the stand, my chain and seals were gone. I have never seen my chain and seals since. The next morning I went to shave myself, and old razor that I had of Mr. Johnson was gone also. The razor has been found in the prisoner's possession. I missed the razor the next morning. I did not lose my watch; it was standing in a case; the chain and seals were twisted off.</p>

            . I live in Virginia-row, Bethnal-green. On the 27th of February, I was going up Shoreditch, I met the prisoner and another girl; they asked me to go home with them. I went with them as far as the Angel; when we came there I had no money in my pocket; they could not agree with me. The other girl that was with the prisoner went with me to my lodging. I took one of them to my lodging; the other followed her; and when I went to get a pot of beer I was robbed of two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no two pound ten shillings in the indictment - A. Here is the gown I found on her back; it is my wife's gown. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the 7th of March; I saw the gown laying on her bed; she took me out of doors. I staid on the stairs about an hour. I went into her room again; the gown was taken off the bed, and she swore to me that she had only a black gown. On the next Sunday night I found my wife's gown on the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the prisoner home with you - A. No, her partner. The prisoner could not take the gown; her partner took it. It is my wife's gown; she is alive.</p>

            . I live in Bethnal-green. I had the key of Mr. Gogney's house, which was to let, to shew the house to the people that came look after it. On the 14th of March, about three in the afternoon, the prisoners both came together; they desired to look at the house. I took the key, and shewed them the house, and while they were looking at the apartment they were discoursing together. The woman called the man William; I supposed him to be her husband by the manner of them. The woman asked the rent; I told her fourteen guineas. She asked where the landlord lived; I told her; they thanked me, and both went away. About half past six in the evening the woman returned, told me she had been to the landlord, and had taken the house; she said she should move in on to-morrow. She had the key and went away. In about ten minutes after, as I was sitting in my own room, I heard a noise in the house; it was as if some person was sweeping the chimney-piece. Thirteen or fourteen days elapsed; nobody came into the house. I got into the house at the window. In the front parlour I found two sashes taken out; in the back parlour a half sash was taken out, and the locks were taken off the two parlour doors and the first floor doors. I immediately went to the rent gatherer to know if any person had taken the house; he told me, no. On my return home I met the woman prisoner in Brick-lane; I said to her, where is the key of that house you took of me; she said, what house. I said, upon the Green. I told her if she did not produce the key of the house, and produce the things, I would charge an officer with her. She said, do not, for God's sake, charge an officer with me; come with me to my mother's; I will give you the key. I went with her, and then at her mother's she said the key was lost. She never gave me the key at all. She said the young man that was with her was only an acquaintance, a very honest young man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take any lodging at your house - A. Yes, about four months ago she took a two pair of stairs room weekly of me; she was to pay three shillings and sixpence a week; she paid me regular for six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come to you as a single woman - A. The prisoner first came about the room; she said there was another woman, and they would pay the rent between them. The room was furnished when she took it. There was sheets and blankets as part of the furniture, a pail, and a flat iron. The other woman left the room first, and when the prisoner left the room there was a fortnight's rent going on. After she had left the room I went into the room; I missed a sheet, a blanket, a pail, and a flat iron. In about a month afterwards I saw the prisoner; I asked her what she had done with the things that she had taken out of my room. She said she had not taken them; it was the other woman that had taken them. I told her she was the person that took the room, and I should look to her for them. The prisoner was a civil good sort of a woman. The other woman that was with her abused me very much, or else I should not have done what I have.</p>

I said, no. He had a mug in his hand. I asked him if he was going to get some beer; he said, yes. Then John Deal gave me some information. I called the prisoner back, and told him that I was sorry to be obliged to search him. I searched him. I found in his pantaloons seven pieces of copper; they weigh better than four pounds altogether. I told him I was exceeding sorry that he that I placed so much confidence in, had got my property upon him. He then said, I had ruined him; I replied, if he went on in that way he would soon ruin me. I sent for an officer; he took charge of him.</p>

After he had scoured it, I saw him come out of the scouring-room with the other pieces of copper in his hand, but not seeing the pieces of copper that he put in at the window, I suspected he had secreted them. I then informed Mr. Sheen what I had seen. I went to the spot where he had put the pieces of copper in at the window; I found they were removed. I informed my master. I still continued to watch him.

            . I am servant to the prosecuters. On the 7th of February, I weighed five tubs of butter, they were to be sent to Mr. Cropley, of Whitechapel. I weighed them about one o'clock, just before I went to dinner; I returned about two o'clock. I missed two of the tubs of butter. There were no empty casks in the yard. I can tell the weight of each tub, and its contents. The tubs of butter were in our back yards; the gates are open. There is no thoroughfare through the yard; it only opens into our premises.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I work in Mr. Cuff's yard. On the 7th of February, between one and two o'clock in the day. I saw the prisoner come out of the yard with a firkin on his back; in about ten minutes he returned again, he took another firkin of butter; he went into the street with that. I had no suspicion of him; I thought he was a carrier. I was working in the yard. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear there was any suspicion of these tubs - A. About two o'clock. I saw the prisoner again the next day about the same time, and in about a week afterwards I saw the prisoner at Lambeth-street office; I was then sure he was the man that I had seen with the two tubs of butter. At first I thought the prisoner was a carrier. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I have been since informed the prisoner is a carpenter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

The prisoner left the three others, he came towards the prosecutor's door, he put his right hand in, and took off the lard; I immediately stopped him with the lard in his possession. I asked him how he came by it; he said, he found it. The lard is very clean, it was a muddy night. This is the lard.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a chaise and harness - A. I did. On the 7th of February the prisoner came to my shop and hired a chaise and harness of me for two or three days; it was to be taken over to Mr. Fonteine's premises, opposite of mine; accordingly I took it, and delivered it myself. A few days afterwards I saw the prisoner at Mr. Fonteine's livery-stables. He asked me if I would part with the chaise, and what did I ask for it. I said, forty-five guineas for the chaise. He then stated that he had a chaise at Lamb's Conduit-street, and if I would go and see that chaise to allow him what I could for it, and meet him at a coffee-house near the Exchange, he would talk to me. I was to meet him at half past two that day. I went to the coffee-house at half past two; I waited an hour or more. I saw nothing of the prisoner. Ten days or a fortnight elapsed before I saw the prisoner again, and then I met him at the place where his broken chaise was. I went there to enquire after him; it was at a mews near Lamb's Conduit-street. While I was talking to the stable-keeper the prisoner came in with a one horse chaise, not my chaise. Having heard that he had a grey horse to dispose of, to get a sight of my chaise if I could, I told him I wanted a grey horse for a customer of mine. We both went together to a stable yard, he in his chaise and I in mine. He drove first; I followed him to go and look at the grey horse. He told me it was at the Lemon Tree yard, in the Haymarket; the stable-keeper's name is Spry. I went to the Lemon Tree yard; he there shewed me the grey horse. I then asked him where my chaise was. He said he had an accident with it coming down Bond-street; it was at the coach-maker's to be repaired; he had it new painted and new lined, and made it look very smart. He said it would be home in the morning. On the next morning I took Armstrong, the officer, with me to the Lemon Tree yard, and there I saw my own chaise. I said to the stable keeper, here is my own Tiloury. In about two hours and a half the prisoner came into the yard on horseback; he said he was ready to give me up my chaise, or to pay me for it. I told him it was then out of my power to bargain with him, he must go before the magistrate. He said he had laid out eight pound on the chaise. I have got my chaise again, and the harness.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner in Wentworth-street. I stopped him about twenty minutes after three in the morning, on the 24th of February, 1813. I believe to the best<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200058"/>of my recollection I saw him write with a bag. I asked him what he had in the bag; he said, goods. I said, I insist upon seeing what goods you have got He then tried in fling it at my feet. He ran away, and left the bag and the property behind him. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I took the property the next day to Messrs. Compton's; it weighed forty-eight pounds. They claimed it, It was eleven months before I saw this man in custody at Worship-street office; I recollected him then.</p>

The poultry were all safe on the evening of the 24th. I heard that there was a man detained at Edgware with Poultry. I went there and saw the twenty-six fowls; I knew three of them to be mine by the plumage. I swore to three of them before the magistrate, and Mason was in custody charged with stealing them. The property was found upon him.</p>
               <p>- WOTTON. I am a farmer; I live at Edgware. On the 25th of January I was at work by the road side about the middle of the day; the prisoner Mason came down the Edgware-road; his wife and daughter were with him, and a sack across his donkey. I asked him if he had anything to sell; he said, no I then asked him what was in the sack; he said nothing but a bit of hay for the jack ass. I told him I thought he had got fowls; he said it was no odds to me if he had. I took him, his wife, and daughter before the magistrate. There were twenty-six fowls in the sack; they were dead. The magistrate asked him where he bought them. He at first said he should not tell him; afterwards, he said he bought them of a higher below St. Alban's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the other prisoner - A. No. The magistrate said if he would swear that he bought them of him he would give him his liberty; he swore then.</p>

            . I am the patrol of Hatton Garden. I took the prisoner a little after one o'clock on the 25th of March last. I was at the top of Hatton Garden; I heard a comical noise; it seemed to me to be towards Leather-lane, up Hatton Wall. I looked up Hatton Wall; I saw but one man coming along, that was the prisoner. I saw him have a bundle under his right arm. I asked him where he was going with the bundle. He told me I might see if I had a mind to go with him. I asked him what he had got in his bundle; he said, a parcel of old shoes. I said, it is an unseasonable hour to carry a bundle at this time, where are you going with it. I understood him to say Saffron Hill. I said to him, are you going to Clerkenwell; he said, yes. I took him to the watchhouse, and when I got him to Hatton Garden<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200059"/>he threw the bundle from under his arm, kicked it, and said, take it. I still kept hold of him; I said I will take it, and you too. I called a watchman; I told him to take the bundle to the watchhouse; he did, and I took the prisoner to the watchhouse. The watchhouse is in Little Saffron-hill. When we got into Saffron-hill he threw some shoes out of his bosom; he said, take them, you'll get more by them than you will by me. I told the watchman to pick them up. I told the prisoner I meaned to take them and him to the watchhouse. The watchman took them up. I kept hold of the prisoner all the time. The watchman brought the shoes to the watchhouse, and I took the prisoner.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BFNNING. I am the watchman that gave the alarm to Mr. Palmer. I am the watchman of Baldwyn's-gardens. About one o'clock, as I was going round, I saw Mr. Palmer's shutter was broken, the grove of the shutter was cut; these holes were bored in the shutter. This is part of the shutter. They put their arm through, and took what they could out, I suppose. I found the shutter broken; this piece of wood is part of the shutter. When I went to the door, I found the knocker of the door tied to the scraper with a rope; I ent the rope, and called Mr. Palmer down stairs, and let him know of it, and two officers were at the door; they enquired what was the matter. I told them the shop had been robbed; they said, they had got the man and the property. They came to the house, saw Mr. Palmer, and took him to see the property.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to Messrs. Chappel, in Long Acre. On the 9th of April. I had put out some trunks to dry; about seven o'clock in the evening, I was taking them in; I was informed a man ran down Charles-street with one of my trunks. I saw the man with the trunk; I hallooed out stop thief. The man with the trunk ran into Drury-lane; they told me a gentleman had stopped him in Drury-lane; I came up to the prisoner; a gentleman had got hold of him by the collar; he had thrown the trunk down in Broker's-alley.</p>

            . I was coming down Broker's-alley; I heard the people cry out stop thief. I saw the prisoner coming up Broker's-alley; I heard somebody halloo out stop thief, the man with the trunk. I caught the prisoner, and held him until the prosecutor came up. The prisoner wished me to let him go; he said, distress drove him to do it.</p>

             I am an officer. I apprehended Smith; in his stable I found some of the things that is here; here is the axletree; the iron stand I found in the stable. The wood-part of the cart we found in Compton-court, it is the side of the cart; it is broken up. When I apprehended the prisoner Smith, he told me he knew nothing of the cart; afterwards he told me the axletree was in his stable, he bought it of a man of name of Gunston. I have been after Gunston; I could not find him.</p>
               <p>MR. HEWES. I live in Whitcomb-street. A man of the name of Thomas, asked me to give him leave to break up a pair of wheels; I gave him leave. Two men came with the wheels in a cart; the prisoner was one that brought them. They had not been there five minutes before Barret came by, he said, are these wheels for sale; I said, no; they belong to this man. He had just began to break them up. Thomas gave a pound for the wheels to the prisoner Smith. Gunstone was present.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at these things; is that your axletree - A. Yes, I am sure of it, and these iron stands belonged to the cart when the cart was taken away from me, and I am sure these are my wheels.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between six and seven o'clock the day I was taken, I met James Gunston with these wheels, an axletree, and a piece of iron, in his hand; he asked me if I would buy the wheels; I told him the wheels were fit for nothing, and as I knew Thomas bought wheels, I bought the wheels and axletree; he had the iron in his hand; I did not buy the iron.</p>

On looking over the stable, I found these four irons, and looking at the cart again, I knew the cart by the tail-board; the cart then was painted a lead colour; when I lost it it was a green. The cart had been altered so as to disguise it. I am perfectly satisfied it is my cart. I found this in the stable; this belongs to the cart to place the traces to; these two irons are fastened inside of the cart to screw two lamps into; these I found in the stable; I knew them to be my property before I knew the cart.</p>

I went with the search warrant to the Royal Oak, the corner of Circus-street, in the New-road, Marybone; the prisoner was then living there. In the prisoner's box or drawer, I found my tortoiseshell snuff-box. The prisoner was with me at the time I found it. I had not missed the box until I found it. I am sure I had it during the time she was in my service. I gave twenty-five shillings for the box. It was inlaid with gold.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BENNET. I am an officer. I executed the warrant. I found the snuff-box in a drawer with the prisoner's clothes; she said, she was very sorry she had done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In a lumber room in Mr. Brown's house, I picked up this snuff-box; I thought it of no value, and intended to get it mended. The prosecutor came with an officer, and searched my box; he said, he had lost some silver spoons. In my drawers he found this old snuff-box. The prosecutor has declared, if he could, he would transport me; I am at a loss to know, why he should be so severe for so trivial an article. I pray I may be restored to my distressed parents, who are in great distress of mind for my unfortunate situation.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 11th of March, about three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming down Davey-street, Berkley-square; he had something weighty in his apron; he is a dustman. I suspected he had stolen property in his apron. I stopped him, and asked him what he had got; he said, only a little bit of lead that he had found in the dust, at No. 25, Dover-street. I asked him if they had given him the lead; he said, no. I told him I would go with him to the house; he took me to Mr. Adam's house, 26, Albemarle-street; he took me down the area, and endeavoured to throw the lead down the privy. It is thirty-two pounds of lead.</p>

               <p>JOHN HERDSFIELD. I am one of the city officers. On Saturday, at the end of last sessions, I was going up St. John-street. I saw this lad and another about the same size standing at the prosecutors door about four o'clock in the afternoon. It was quite daylight. The other lad took the cheese, and chucked it into the prisoner's apron: The other lad ran across the road. I thought it my duty to make after the property. The prisoner ran into a back yard and threw the cheese down a privy, and bolted himself in. I saw him throw the cheese down the privy. I was close to his heels. I opened the door, got the cheese, and took him to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The other boy gave me the cheese; I did not know he stole it.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you find it out - A. In about five minutes after. When I came to my lodging I put my hand into my pocket to look for my money; it was gone. I put the candle down, and went out. I was all night looking after her. I saw her in Drury-lane the next morning. I am sure she is the woman. I had been with no other woman. This is the woman that laid hold of me. When I found her in Drury-lane I tapped her on the shoulder; I said, I have been looking for you all night; she said, you b - r, I never saw you.</p>
               <p>WILSON. I am an officer. On the morning of the 24th, I took the prisoner in custody; she was very much in liquor. I took her to St. Giles's watchhouse. I told her to turn out what she had got in her pocket; she pulled out some shillings and halfpence. I put my hand in her pocket, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200065"/>out this comb. I asked her how she came by the comb; she told me that a woman gave her the comb for her boy, who was in the Philanthrople society.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who picked your pocket - A. No. The officer had my handkerchief. I saw it again.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARLISLE. I am an officer. On the 20th of April I was in Piccadilly. I followed the prisoner. I saw the prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, but he got nothing. He passed from one gentleman to another; he put his hand into their pocket and got nothing; then he came to this young man's pocket, and after he pulled his handkerchief out I tapped him on his shoulder; I said, what are you a. I took hold of him by the collar; he dropped the handkerchief. Johnson, an officer, saw him as well as me take it out of the prosecutor's pocket. I said to the prisoner, you shall not pick any more pockets here, I shall take you in custody. Johnson saw the prosecutor, and brought him out of the mob. I had hold of the prisoner with my left hand, and picked up the handkerchief with my right.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. On the 20th of April I was in Piccadilly on duty; a great mob was assembled there, occassioned by the King of France coming into town. I saw a great many of those characters in the crowd, said among those characters was the prisoner. I watched the prisoner, and at last the prisoner went to the prosecutor. I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take out this handkerchiefs I touched the prosecutor on his shoulder, and told him he had lost his handkerchief. I turned round, and saw Carlisle had got hold of the prisoner. I searched the prisoner; I found two more silk handkerchiefs on him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not in Piccadilly before they pulled me in to it.</p>

My seals and key were safe on my ribbon; I saw them at four o'clock. They were cut from my ribbon. About a quarter before six, I perceived my seals and key were gone. I was told they were gone. I looked, and saw they were gone. They were gold seals, worth about three pounds. I do not recollect seeing the prisoner about me.</p>

            . I was in Albemarle-street, at this time; I saw the prisoner and another person with him. I saw the prisoner standing by the railing opposite of the hotel. When first I saw the prisoner it was at the corner of Albemarle-street; he and his companion were whispering together. I suspected them, and kept my eye upon them. I saw him go up to Mr. Wilson. Previous to their going up I saw Mr. Wilson's seals hung to his ribbon. They stood about Mr. Wilson's person about three minutes, then they went away. I tapped Mr. Wilson on his shoulder, and asked him if he had lost anything; he clapped his hand to his ribbon, and missed his seals and key. In about half a minute, the next witness, Mr. Wright, hallooed out stop thief. The prisoner ran under a coach; he was taken by one of the witnesses. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

             WRIGHT. I am a wholesale draper; I live in King-street, Cheapside. I was in Albemarle-street the day this matter happened, a little before six o'clock; I saw the prisoner and the lad he was in company with, standing very near where I was. They were whispering together. I was almost opposite of the hotel. I looked at them very hard; I saw the prisoner have hold of Mr. Wilson's seals when they were hanging to his watch; immediately a person came up, and said to Mr. Wilson, have you lost anything. Mr. Wilson looked down to his seals and missed them; I said, that man has got them, pointing to the prisoner. I called out, stop thief. I I was close behind him when he started; he ran between two coaches; he was stopped. I am sorry to say he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. I am a lieutenant in the Navy. I heard them sing out stop thief. I saw the prisoner run between two coaches under the horses heads. I stopped him. He had this knife in his hand, which he was attempting to shut. He threw something away back handed, down Mr. Murray's, the book-seller's steps. Mr. Stevens picked it up while I had hold of him. While I had hold of the prisoner I had several blows from different people round me; they were endeavouring to rescue him. They called me a rascal, and said he was not the man. I send out for a constable; one came, and he was secured; I took the knife out of his hand, and the handkerchief out of his breeches.</p>
               <p>RICHARD STEVENS. I live in Bell yard. I picked up these seals just through the railings of that door where I was standing. They were just within the railing; I picked them up there; These are the seals and the key there is some of the watch are attached.</p>

            . My husband's name is Saville Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose these articles - A. Last Saturday week I was in my bed room when these things were taken from my person.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed where was your money and notes - A. In my pocket-book. The pocket-book was in my pocket, and my pocket between two beds, at the bottom of the bed. I had forty-five pounds in my pocket when I went to bed. I missed it in the morning as soon as I came down stairs. I missed a ten pound and a two pound note. I missed a dollar first, that gave me suspicion, and caused me to look if I had lost any notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had any three-shilling tokens - A. That I cannot say, nor did I know that the prisoner had the snuff box until the officer brought it from her. The prisoner was the only female servant in the house. I saw the prisoner searched on Sunday morning; I saw my notes taken out of her bosom, a ten pound and a two pound note, a dollar, and three three-shilling tokens. I lost a little silver, what sort of coin I do not know.</p>

               <p>SAVILLE LEWIS. I live at the Queen's Head, St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>

            Do you know that your wife had this ten pound and a two pound note - A. Yes, we counted it before we went to bed. I had written on the ten pound note the name of Clements, the name of the person of where I took it. I saw the name of Clements on the ten pound note when it was taken out of the prisoner's bosom.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BRANT. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner about seven o'clock in the morning. I asked the prisoner where the property was. She ran down into the kitchen, and took up this snuff box. Mrs. Lewis said, that is my husband's snuff box. This handkerchief was in her bosom; it contained a ten pound note and a two pound note, and a dollar. Mr. Lewis said on the ten pound note was the name of Clements. This is the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my writing on the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into Mr. Lewis's house first as a lodger; the servant went away; Mrs. Lewis asked me to do the work. On Saturday Mrs. Lewis gave me two or three glasses of gin; she had one glass of gin and I another. I went up stairs with her; she sent me down for a glass of brandy for her; I got it for her. When I went up she had the pocket-book in her hand; she turned sick; she was very much intoxicated; this silver dropped on the floor, and the notes like wise. I picked them up, and put them in my pocket. Mrs. Lewis said if I would give them her she would say no more about it. I am a poor distressed woman. My husband has been a soldier in the Guards seventeen years.</p>

She went round the corner into one of the private boxes; there she doubled it into four. When I stopped her she was outside of the shop, putting it into a bundle. I took the cloak from her.

               <p>SAMUEL GUNNEL. I live in Cowley-street, Westminster. I lost my handkerchief on Monday the 21st of February, between twelve and one o'clock in the day. I knew I had my handkerchief in my outside coat pocket. I knew nothing of it being taken until the officer tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I had lost my handkerchief. On applying my hand to my pocket I found my handkerchief was gone. The handkerchief the officer produced to me was my handkerchief. I was in the Strand, going in a direction towards Temple-bar.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WESTCOAT. I am an officer. On the 21st of February, I first saw Brown, Evans, and Taylor, in company together; they were near Temple-bar. I followed them behind coaches, watching them. I do not recollect seeing Lloyd at all. I watched them as far as the New church in the Strand. They went on to just behind Somerset House; they made a stop there. Mr. Gunnel was passing by with a lady in a direction to the City; they then immediately followed Mr. Gunnel. They turned after Mr. Gunnel. Evans put his hand into Mr. Gunnel's pocket. Mr. Gunnel was walking on. He pulled his hand out of his pocket, and brought nothing out. He took his hand away, and went off. They walked after Mr. Gunnel again. Evans took the handkerchief out of Mr. Gunnel's pocket, and put it under Taylor's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that this was done where was Lloyd - A. I did not see Lloyd to my recollection at all. Brown was apprehended between three and four in the afternoon. I apprehended Brown myself in Russel-street, Covent Garden. I charged him with stealing Mr. Gunnel's handkerchief. He denied it, and said he had not been in the Strand at all at the time. I apprehended Evans and Taylor; Brown ran away. I do not recollect seeing Lloyd. I was for keeping out of Brown's sight; I thought he would recollect me.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. On the 21st of February; I was going up Fleet-street. Just before I got to Temple-bar I observed Taylor and the other three prisoners; they were going into the Strand. At the time I saw them first, Taylor had his hand in a gentleman's pocket; he pulled the gentleman's white handkerchief partly out. The other three prisoners could see what he was doing. Taylor did not pull the handkerchief quite out. The gentleman got from him. I followed them until they stopped just by the New church in the Strand. I was in an hurry to go to the office to deliver a note to Mr. Stafford. When I got to the office I told Westcoat there were four pickpockets in the Strand. After I delivered my message to Mr. Stafford. I went into the Strand; I saw Westcoat pulling Evans and Taylor into a public-house I observed Brown run up Castle-street and I saw Lloyd going towards St. Clement's church.</p>
               <p>Westcoat. I searched Evans and Taylor; I found nothing upon Evans; upon Taylor I found these two handkerchiefs; one under his arm and one in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gunnel. Has the officer shewn you the handkerchief - A. Yes; I am certain it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know that she had that child - A. No; she hired herself to me as a single woman; she came to me on the 14th of February. At a late hour in the night on the 23rd of March, I had occasion to go into a room that nobody had any business to go into but me and the prisoner. On turning up the bed I found two papers of halfpence. They were my papers of halfpence, I can swear. They had both been opened. I had put five shillings in each paper, part of them had been taken out. I then went to my own bed room to see whether the money was right which was for the brewer, which had been sixteen pounds; there was exactly eleven pounds taken away, and five pounds left. I had no other woman servant in the house.</p>

            How lately before had you counted that money in the bed-room - A. Nine days before and no person had been up stairs that day but me and my husband. I sent for an officer, and than I questioned the prisoner. The officer searched her and found a key upon her that would open my bed-room door. The prisoner said that was the key that she got into my bed-room with and all that she took was three shillings and ten-pence halfpenny.</p>

He brought in a basket when he came to sleep; he slept at my house that evening: In the morning, about half after six, he went out; my wife went up stairs immediately, and from information I pursued the prisoner, and caught him in Rosemary-lane by the collar; I told him he had robbed me.

            . I am a carpenter. I was going by the building in Goswell-street, on the 10th of March, some time after two o'clock; I saw a man come out of the ground with two boards on his shoulder I asked him whether Mr. Brown had sent him for these boards; he said, yes, it is all right. I was doubtful whether it was so. I followed him half way down Sutton-street; I then saw the prisoner standing at the bottom of the street, with these two other scaffolding boards. I passed the man I first saw, and went to the prisoner; I asked him who his master was he pointed to the man I first saw come out of the building; he said; he was his master, the employed him to watch them. When the first man saw me with the prisoner, he threw the boards down and ran. The prisoner wished to go after him; I did not think proper. I took him to my yard with the boards, and gave him in charge of a constable. He said he fetched these two boards by the under of the other man, who employed him I asked him who is master was, he declared he did know who he was, nor where he lived. This is one of that boarding to the prosecutor a home is upon it. The other board is in the yard.</p>

I opened the bag; it contained these remnants of cotton, my own property, I had left them in the kitchen. I can swear positively to the cotton.</p>

I told Ramsay he was doing very wrong; he said he knew it. I took them before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Robson. Had you a barge with coals at Shadwell - A. I had. My lighterman took a barge the day before to load her; the name of the barge was Ruth, 1248.</p>

I saw the prisoner Thompson put his finger in a hole in the square of glass, which either him or some other person had previously made in the glass. I was watching him at the time he put his fingers in and drawed these two earrings out. They are cornelian stones, gold mounted. They cost Mr. Sowerby seven shillings. I am quite sure I saw him pull them out. He went to Hartaker, who was sitting two doors off, and put them into his apron. I went and took them both out of his apron, and brought them into Mr. Sowerby's shop. I fetched a constable; they were searched, and a knife was found on each of them. These are the earrings; they are Mr. Sowerby's property.</p>

I was shutting up my shop; the prisoner and the woman came in again; they said they wanted some more herrings. They opened the lattice partition that is put up to keep people's hands out of the window. There was some soap behind the lattice partition; they seemed to be choosing herrings; I watched them. I saw the prisoner actually take a cake of soap. I saw him pass it by the lattice partition, and gave it to another man behind the door post. I instantly ran from behind the counter, and seized the prisoner, and in my scuffling with him he scuffled towards the door. The woman assisted in pushing me towards the door. We got on the pavement. I called the watch. He sprang from me. I lost my hat. In about four or five minutes he was stopped. I was informed that they had found the prisoner, and there was a cake of soap found.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any candles - A. I did; I found them upon the prisoner. The prisoner was seen in my other shop. I have two shops adjoining together, No. 9 and 10; they communicate together so as to make one shop. I was in conversation with Mr. Edwards concerning the sale of cotton. My apprentice, George Hopkinson, informed me that I had been robbed of some candles while he brought me some cotton; he added, he is gone to the next public-house. I went to the next public-house; I saw the prisoner coming out of the door; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got in his apron; he said, nothing. I looked in his apron; he had got two papers of candles, of three pounds each. He said they were given to him; and as he was going towards the office he requested my interference to send him on board a man of war. I said, if you are innocent, why go on board a man of war.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Homan. Master sent me up stairs for some cotton. While I was in the next shop, (I went into No. 10), I thought I heard somebody in No. 9; I went into the shop; the prisoner asked me if we sold white wax; I told him, no. I saw the prisoner near a basket of candles; immediately he went out I went to the basket and missed these two three-pounds weight of candles. Master stopped him at the next public-house. I am positive he is the man that was in the shop. The candles are my master's manufactory. My writing is on the papers.</p>

            . I am a farmer. I keep pigs in Bedford-street, Liquorpond-street, The prisoner brought me this pig for sale, on the 28th of February, about a quarter past six o'clock; he asked me four pound ten shillings for the pig I told him if he would call at eleven o'clock, I would pay him. I took it in my yard at that price, and before ten o'clock, the woman came, and owned the pig. I shewed her the pig after she had described it; she said it was her hog. She stopped with me until the prisoner came; I then sent for an officer, and the prisoner was taken to the office. I delivered the pig to the prosecutrix. As soon as I let the pig out, she ran after the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at Mr. Caton's. Mrs. Condin said it was her pig; the pig turned out to be an acquaintance. As soon as it was let out of the sty, it ran after her. The prisoner told me he bought it on this side of Mile End turnpike, of a man of the name of Lloyd, that sold cats meat and dogs meat. I took him before the magistrate; he was committed for re-examination. He never brought any one forward. The magistrate gave him an opportunity of finding this Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gave four pounds for the pig to a man in the street; he said, he worked at Blackwall. I sold it to Mr. Caton for four pounds ten shillings. I never was in confinement before.</p>

               <p>NATHANIEL ODELL. My property was stolen from the house, No. 33, St. John-street. I was the last time in the house about a fortnight ago; the house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there, the last time in the day - A. It was on a Sunday morning. About a fortnight after I had left there, the house had been entered into; a small box containing my wife's clothes, which had been left up stairs, was brought below, and all the contents taken away but one pair of stockings, and some things of mine were taken out of another box. I afterwards saw some property at the magistrate's, which I knew to be mine.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY HARRISON. I am one of the officers of the City. Tuesday morning, April 12th, me and Brockwell were coming from the Mansion House; we met the prisoner in Grub-street, about a quarter after six in the morning; he had a large bundle on his head; there was another man with him; the other man had nothing at all. I said to the prisoner, Dick, what have you got here. I knew him well. He made some excuse, threw the bundle down; he ran up Butler's-alley, and I after him. Brockwell stopped with the bundle. As the prisoner ran, he threw this iron crow away. I catched him. Brockwell took the bundle to my house. I do not live far from there. On searching the prisoner, I found nine picklock-keys, a bottle of phosphorus, matches, and two gold rings, I found in his breeches pocket. I took the prisoner to the Compter. I advertised the things; Mr. Belton and Odell claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Odell. Look at that bundle; do you find any tablecloths there - A. Yes; they are marked. I am sure they are my husband's property. All the articles in the bundle are our own property, except the window-curtains; they are Mr. Belton's, I am sorry to say, there is not one third of the property I lost.</p>

            . The prisoner was in the habit of making articles for our shop. On the 22nd of April, about half past seven o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop; I was behind the counter. He came up to the counter, and asked me if I wanted any bell-rings; I said, no. I wanted a gross of chest-squares. He then told me, he wanted half a dozen of bell-crank-roses; he paid me sixpence halfpenny for them, and put them in his pocket. I then came from behind the counter. I spoke to a person behind him. I then saw him going out of the shop, and perceived he had a bag in his right hand. I asked him if he had got any bell-springs in his bag; he said, no; he had got steps.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200073"/>I requested him to shew me what steps were; he drawed towards the shop door, and close to the shop door he threw them out of the bag, and ran out of the shop with the empty bag. I caught up the parcels immediately, and found them to be trunk locks, the property of myself and partners. I pursued him, and lost sight of him. I got an officer, and took him in Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane, where he lived; the officer and me had not been there a quarter of an hour when he came home. The officer took him in custody. I gave charge of him for stealing these twelve locks and keys; they are my property and my partners.</p>

I missed a set of shelves that had been there; I came down, and told the prisoner's daughter that I had put the shelves there because there was no closet, and that he must return them, or pay for them. There was no family in the house but themselves. On Sunday, the 27th, the woman called, and told me that Reach had been up, and taken the bed, and several articles. I went to the room, and found the door had been broken open. On the 7th of March, I saw the bed, pillow, and blanket, which I can swear to.</p>

            . I live in Bread-street, Cheapside. I lost these things on the 11th of April I believe; it was on the night of the illumination. I was conducting an elderly lady in the crowd on the first night of the illumination; I was holding my hands against the wall to keep the crowd from her. In that situation I felt the prisoner pull my chain; my chain broke at the top ring; my chain, seals, and ring, were gone. I turned round, and seized the first man on my right hand, and charged him with stealing them; he said, he had not, and that I might search him; I just put my hand to his pocket. The crowd pressed me so, and I was behind the lady, I gave it up as lost. I could not say he was the man. My seals were described in an advertisement in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man that you laid hold of - A. No; he is about the size. I cannot swear to him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 16th of April. On searching him, I found five duplicates in the lining of his hat. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and got a description of the property, and advertised it. One duplicate is a metal watch, and two gold seals besides these. Since I have been here, a man has applied about the metal watch.</p>

On my going up stairs I observed to my servant maid that there was a strong smell of sulpher; that I would be satisfied as to the cause. As I went towards the accompting-house, the smell was stronger still. I could perceive no fire. I then went through a passage into the back warehouse or shop. The first thing that struck my attention was a private door being opened, and a table removed that generally stood against it, and a can of oil thrown down. I immediately suspected some one had entered the house. Being without a weapon I went to the dining-room and procured a poker, and returned to the spot. Underneath a bench I observed a man secreted, or secreting himself. I told him to come out, which he did; but the moment he came out he sprang at my collar; I parried him off, and struck him on the side of the head with the poker. I knocked him down, but observing him to be upon the alert, (I had not injured him sufficiently so as to prevent him injuring me), therefore as he was rising I struck him another blow upon the back of his head, but not so hard as to prevent him closing with me, and in that act the candle went out or fell from my hand. I was anxious to get him towards the front door. My servant had gone to that door, and had called for assistance. I dragged him towards it, but in going through the passage I had to open a door; at that moment he sprang out of my hand and ran into the street; I pursued him, and called watch, but I could scarce perceive him twenty paces from me; and being fearful of misguiding the hue and cry, I stood still, and called watch. After some time, the patrol came up, and he and I searched the premises together to see if we could find any one else. We could find no one else, but we found a pair of boots and a hat. While we were making this search, the watchman of St. Sepulchre's parish came to tell me that he had taken the prisoner, and he was in the watchhouse. I went there; the prisoner was there with his head bleeding very much, and he owned the hat and the boots immediately. I asked him if he meant to murder me; he said, God forbid. I asked him what drove him to commit the act; he said, necessity. I think he said he was driven to it by distress. It was not until after, in the day time, that I found the lock of my desk had been forced, and this instrument I found. I found the wood work had been cut away from the lock; the bolt is perforated with this instrument; it is the blade of a plough that a bookbinder uses. That instrument was found in the passage.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 19th of March last, I stopped the prisoner in Skinner-street, about two o'clock in the morning. He was without hat and shoes; his head was all over blood. I took him to the watchhouse, and I took Mr. Ayres to see the prisoner.</p>

Coming along Fleet-market I laid me down and slept, and when I awoke I was alarmed with the cry of stop thief. I lost my hat and boots. I was so alarmed when I got to the watchhouse I did not know what I said to questions they asked me.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, I live in Snows-fields, in the Borough. On Easter Sunday, I was in <placeName id="t18140420-174-crimeloc961">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

On my going away, the prisoner followed me, and offered me four oranges for sixpence; afterwards five, six, seven, eight. They were fine oranges. I was taken with the eight. I gave him a shilling to pay for them; he refused it; I gave him another; he did not like that; I gave him a third; he liked the third very well. He said he had no sixpence; he gave me the three shillings back, and said he saw I had some three-shilling pieces in my hand; he could give me a shilling and an eighteen-penny piece. I had a blackbird in one hand, and a bag in the other. I was obliged to hold my hand out to him and let him take them. He took a three-shilling piece out of my hand; he did not like that; I held out my hand and let him take another; he did not like that. He gave me two bad ones in the room of my two good ones. He took another, which he said was good. On his searching for an eighteen-penny piece, he said he had shillings but no eighteen-penny piece. He said if I gave him a three shilling piece he could give me a dollar, which would make it right to make it up six shillings with the oranges. On searching for the dollar he said he had no one, he must take the oranges and give me the money. He gave me two three-shilling pieces, took the oranges, and told me to go about my business. I then went away. The three-shilling pieces I had given him were good ones; I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200075"/>they were all good. I went on my journey to my friends, at Tottenham. I was with my father. I was going to send my sister for some beer, I discovered that all my money was bad, in looking at the three-shilling pieces. What I had were of the old coin; what he had given me were of the new. I then put them in my pocket. I stopped with my friends until the evening, and then I went home. I went down to Bermondsey watchhouse. On the following Sunday morning, Mr. Myers and I went to Cornhill; I there saw the prisoner standing at a door with oranges. I laid hold of the prisoner, and
