On 1st Nov., about half-past six o'clock, the prisoner came in, said, "Good evening," took up eight lengths of cloth, and ran outâ€”I am lame, and before I could get up he was half way out of the shopâ€”I called, "Stop thief!" but could not find a policemanâ€”a parcel of boys surrounded meâ€”I afterwards recognized him at the Mansion-houseâ€”I know him by his cap and dress, and also by his featuresâ€”this is like the cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”I was discharged in consequence, as it was thought I had a hand in it, but have been taken back.</p>

On Sunday night, 12th Nov., about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was passing the Cat, and saw Carter strike Taylor a blow which knocked him downâ€”he came against me, and then fellâ€”I heard Carter say, "I have been waiting for you," and I heard Hurren say to Carter, <hi rend="italic">"Hook it, "</hi> and they both went away togetherâ€”they walked for a few yards, increasing gradually to a run.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Enterprize, in June-street, Chelsea. On Saturday evening, 4th Nov., the prisoner came to my master's about seven in the eveningâ€”he told me he had taken a board into the back-garden, and asked me to take care of it till Mondayâ€”he said it was a job he had got, and it came to fourpenceâ€”his partner Rose came in about five minutes to twelve that night, gave me some directions, and on Monday morning I delivered it up to the prisoner and his partnerâ€”Mr. Arthur's brother and nephew were with themâ€”Rose is a sawyer in Mr. Arthur's employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 47, High Holborn, and am a picture-dealerâ€”it is my dwelling-houseâ€”I have a gallery at the back of my shop up one pair of stairsâ€”I keep some of my pictures in that galleryâ€”I have also a small back room up another flight of stairs, in which I keep other picturesâ€”I was not at all aware that I had been robbed of any pictures till the 16th Oct.â€”I kept pictures in that room and gallery which were not immediately wanted, and I had not been up there for nine or ten weeks before I discovered my lossâ€”Cook had been in my service for about four months, I had a good character with her, and believed her to be honestâ€”I trusted her with the key of a door which led from the shop to that galleryâ€”she had that key before we were up in the morningâ€”on 16th Oct. I missed pictures from the gallery, and the room, and on the 17th Oct., I was in St. Mary-Axe, and saw a pic<lb/>ture of a huntsman blowing a trumpet, in Rowland's shop windowâ€”I knew it was mineâ€”I went in, made inquiries, and waited till Rowland came inâ€”I said, "I have been robbed to a considerable extent, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will act straightforward, and provided you tell me the truth, and will give me every facility to find the person you bought them of, and will not let any person know of the robbery, that I may find my property, you shall not be a loser"â€”I further said, "My motive in making this proposition is, that I may apprehend the thief, and if I discover more of my property elsewhere I may claim it," but he mentioned the robbery directly to other people, he broke the promise directlyâ€”he said he had purchased the pictures of a person who gave the name of Falk, who was introduced to him by a Jew that he knew very well, and from whom he had often purchased picturesâ€”I wrote down an address which he gave meâ€”I found two more of my pictures in his windowâ€”I then asked permission to look round his shopâ€”I found as many more pictures as made up fifteen or sixteenâ€”these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”here is one, which is a cattle picture by Listerâ€”he is a well-known artist, whopaints inferior pictures at moderate pricesâ€”I had seen Rowland on the subject of this picture at my placeâ€”he offered me a sovereign for it, and said he would give me a sovereign a piece for as many as I had of that artistâ€”that was at my own place five or six months agoâ€”after my conversation with Rowland</p>

               <p>I told him I should put it into the hands of the police. and I told him to let the pictures remain where they were till I came back with the officerâ€”I went awaysâ€”I left four on five of the pictures in the frames in which they had been taken from my house and where I returned in two hours, or two hours and a haft, with the policeman. I said to Rowland, "Where are the pictures that I saw here this morning, they have been removed out of the shop, the frams are here, but the pictures are gone?â€”he asked me to repeat the promise I had made in the morning, in presence of the policemanâ€”I did soâ€”he then said, "Now I will produce the pictures"â€”he went to the hack premises, and produced the fifteen or sixteen pictures that I had seen in the morningâ€”three or four smaller pictures had been taken out of their framesâ€”"The Huntsman" was notâ€”the policeman told him the pictures must be restored to their framesâ€”he did not restore the person of whom he had purchased the picturesâ€”he said of a young man about five feet eight or tune inches high, with a light complexion, and a moustacheâ€”he said he had given the name of Falk, that he was related to Mr. Falk of Oxford-streetâ€”he was then cautioned to keep the pictures, and I and the officer leftâ€”before I left I found about half a dozen more pictures, as many as made up twenty-twoâ€”on Monday morning, 23rd Oct. Maiers was taken into custody, and on the same day I gave Cook into custodyâ€”on the day after Rowland had been given into custody, I found at his place three other picturesâ€”that would make twenty-fiveâ€”I found no others that I could swear toâ€”just as I had found the other three pictures, Rowland came homeâ€”he had been admitted to bailâ€”he produced the duplicates of nine paintings which had been stolen from meâ€”I saw them at the pawnbroker's, at the police-court, and they are now hereâ€”in answer to a question, he said he had no duplicatesâ€”he then said, "I recollect I have some"â€”he produced the duplicates, and said, "I bought them of a man, but I had forgotten the cir<lb/>cumstance"â€”I had told him that Maiers was in custodyâ€”the duplicates I found in his possession produced the pictures I had lostâ€”I have lost altoge<lb/>ther 110, or 120, worth 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.â€”they had nearly emptied the room, and the gallery beside.</p>

On 31st Oct., about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another person in White Lion-street, Pentonville, at the door of a marine-store shopâ€”he was speaking to the other person, who went away, and the prisoner went into the shopâ€”I went away, came back in about two minutes, and met him coming out of the shop with these two pick<lb/>axes, without handles, under his armâ€”he said he had been working at a sewer, at Holloway, and gave a false name and address.</p>

Gregsonâ€”there is "O" on them in white paint, which has been tried to be rubbed outâ€”they have a peculiar eyeâ€”we had seventy-two, and missed threeâ€”they were ordered specially; I never saw such anywhere else.</p>

I will take that"â€”Brown said, "That is your property, is it not, Mr. Jones?"â€”Jones looked up and saw me; he knew meâ€”he had seen me before, and he said, "No," I think, I will not be positiveâ€”I took Brown and the lead to the stationâ€”I came back to Jones's shop and said to him, "Well, what about this lead?"â€”he said, "Well, I had not it"â€”I said, "I shall take you into custody for receiving the lead, knowing it was stolen"â€”he said, "It was never in my shop"â€”I said, "No, but on your premises, and in your possession"â€”he said, "You never saw me pay for the lead"â€”I said, "No, I did not"â€”I found a half-crown and a shilling on Brownâ€”I asked him where he got that fromâ€”he said he had earned if at a penny or twopence a timeâ€”I said I thought it was money he had received for the leadâ€”he said, "No," and he had never taken anything to Jones's shop beforeâ€”at the Police-court Jones told me he had a good mind to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>â€”he said, "I would have come back again on Monday morning; I thought you would come for me; you need not say I received the lead; I should not mind giving you a pound or two;" and then his wife said, in his presence, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

In July last the prisoner came with a person who he represented to be a merchantâ€”the prisoner was a strangerâ€”he said a party in Manchester, who was well known to us, had told him that we had certain goods which he wanted for some partyâ€”we showed him someâ€”he said he was a commission-agent, and he was buying for other partiesâ€”he first asked for gingham, and requested us to let him have a sampleâ€”he came next day, and brought back the sample, and began to bargain about the priceâ€”I told him we should only sell for cashâ€”he said he was buying for cash, and for other peopleâ€”he came very frequently to the warehouse after that, and amongst other samples, he obtained three samples of velvetsâ€”in the course of the times that he came, I repeatedly asked him to return the sam<lb/>ples of velvetsâ€”he made excusesâ€”at one time he said he forgot themâ€”he had brought in the first sample he had, and other samples, but not the velvetsâ€”he had them about 19th Aug.â€”the other goods had been looked out that he wanted to have; we had put them aside, we said we wanted the thing settled one way or the otherâ€”he said a bill was coming due on 18th Aug.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270109"/>
               <p>and after that he promised to payâ€”after 18th Aug. he said he could not find room in a vessel where the goods were to be shipped, and asked us to wait a few days longerâ€”I gave him this list of the articles and prices, to show the party for whom he bought the goodsâ€”he had asked for it for that purposeâ€”that was the only reason I gave it himâ€”I never intended to give him any creditâ€”I told him so from the beginningâ€”it refers, amongst other things, to the goods of which I had furnished him samples, and to the velvets amongst the restâ€”he came again on 31st Aug., and asked for an invoice, or list of all the goods he had bargained for, to show to the party the amount of money that he was to be prepared with the next dayâ€”I furnished him with the invoice, amounting to 553<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.â€”next day he called againâ€”he was conversing with me in the warehouse, and a gentleman came in from the countryâ€”he asked me, in the prisoner's presence, loud enough for him to hear, whether I knew himâ€”I said we only knew that he said he came from a party we knew in Manchesterâ€”the gentleman went on to say that he was a swindler, and several persons in Manchester had lost goods by himâ€”the prisoner passed by us and went out, I did not think he would run away all at once, but he slipped away, and said he would come in againâ€”I did not see him again till he was in custody, about six weeks afterwardsâ€”I have seen my velvet samples produced by the pawnbrokers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Thomas Brassey, a contractor employed on the railroad near Feltham. I missed property of his at various times, from the 4th to the 9th Nov.â€”on the 9th I was passing the line near Feltham, and saw two men sawing a piece of timber, which I saw was Mr. Brassey'sâ€”I asked what they were sawingâ€”the prisoner came up, put his shoulder under a piece which they had been sawing, and carried it awayâ€”I; saw the initials had been cut out of itâ€”this is the piece which I prevented the men from sawingâ€”I went to Mr. Biggs, took him to the saw-pit, and then went for the policemanâ€”no sale of such materials as this had taken place by order of Mr. Brassey, to my knowledgeâ€”no one had any authority to take them away.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in the Borough-market and in Rochester-street. The prisoners were in my service and my father's for many yearsâ€”John Green was the foreman of my place at Rochester-street, and David had to take a cart round to the butchers to bring in fat which was to be meltedâ€”on the morning of the 14th Nov. I made arrang<lb/>ements as if I were going out of tovvn, and placed myself in a loft which com<lb/>manded a view of my premisesâ€”I saw Joseph hold a sack open and a man named Puibrook filled itâ€”it was then taken in the yard, but before it was taken they asked David Green if he was readyâ€”(he was at that time harness<lb/>ing his horse to go out)â€”Puibrook then carried out the sack towards the cartâ€”I did not sec him put it in, but I saw the cart come out with the sack in it, and David Green was driving itâ€”I came down and stopped itâ€”David</p>
