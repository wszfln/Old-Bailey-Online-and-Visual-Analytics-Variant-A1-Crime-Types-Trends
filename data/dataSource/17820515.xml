I went up stairs into the garret, which is the two pair of stairs; there I saw a bed tied up in a sheet, and I saw another parcel of the same size; I saw a blue jacket, which alarmed me, supposing that there was a sailor in the room; I ran down, and called for assistance;

               <p>On Sunday morning, the 21st of April, while I was at breakfast, at about half after ten o'clock, Mrs. Weston came out, and cried out fire! thieves! I went out directly; I found Mr. Elmes at the bottom of the stairs, with his adze in his hand; there was a butcher there besides; they were afraid to go up stairs; I went up; Mr. Elmes and the butcher went up with me, and Mrs. Weston followed us; I had a knife in my hand. I found the garret-door shut; the staple of the lock was out, and lay on the floor; the bolt of the lock was shot. I found the bed and the bed-clothes all upon the ground. There was a sailor's blue jacket in the room. Mr. Elwes went up towards the chimney with his hatchet; we looked up the chimney, but could not see any light through it; Mrs. Elmes took his axe, and beat it against the woman's tail; he thought it had been a parcel of rags; he said there was nothing there: I put my hand up the chimney, and took her by the thigh. I said it was no man, I was fire, for it had not breeches on. She was, I believe, about three foot up the chimney; she was nearly as black as a coal. She burst out a crying: she said her husband was a soldier; that she had pawned his shirts, and was determined to rob somebody's house to get them out of pawn, or else she should be killed by him: she said a man had told her to rob that house.</p>
               <p>Did she say who the blue jacket belonged to? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she say how she got in? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises of favour? - No.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the bed that belonged to Peal? - I have been in the brokering business; I would not give above 5 l. for the whole; that bed is worth about 50 s. The prisoner's shoes were off; we looked about the room and found them, and she put them on.</p>

I did not see any body as I went up; I heard somebody coming up stairs; I thought it was my husband; the bed stood up in the corner; I stood up close to the chimney, upon the bed, but I was not up the chimney.</p>

On the 23d of April, I had Mr. Wiseman's trunk behind my coach; I set out from London about six o'clock; when I came to the Adam-and-Eve, I missed the trunk; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner running towards London, with the trunk in his arms; he was about the distance of the length of this court from my coach; I jumped off the box, and ran after him, and cried, Stop thief! stop thief! upon which he threw down the trunk; some people ran out of the Adam-and-Eve like men, and ran smartly after him; I secured the trunk, and they brought the prisoner back to me.</p>
               <p>(The trunk, with its contents, as stated in the indictment, were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

We had a pint of wine at the Hotel; when we had drank a glass of wine apiece, she said she had a friend below, and asked if it would be agreeable to me to let her come up; I said, With all my heart. We were joking together, till at last I was to be engaged with the woman that came up. When I came to be engaged with the other woman, the prisoner said my watch would hurt the other woman; she took the watch out of my pocket, with my consent, and put it behind the sofa till I got up; when I came to get up from the sofa, my watch was gone.</p>

               <p>Do you usually carry so much as five guineas about you? - It was all I had got; I carried it about me, at that time, because I was at a lodging.</p>
               <p>It was dark; had you any light but from the dark lantern? - The room was quite light from the lantern; I could distinguish his face so as to swear to him.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - About ten minutes. There was nobody in the house but me; the person I lodge with goes out a washing; she was not come home.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see him next? - Two men were taken up upon suspicion; I went before the justice to see them; they were not the people; then the constable desired me to go into a public-house, and see if there was any body I knew; I went in, and picked the prisoner out from among a dozen; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear that the prisoner is the man that received the money, and was present when the man took it from you? - I will. The light of the lantern reflected on the face of the prisoner; I could not see the face of the other man, when he cut my pocket off.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A cook in gentlemen's families. I have kept a house in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>You said, as soon as you opened the door they rushed in. Was that the outer door? - Yes; there are two rooms on the floor.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning, my wife told me she thought there were thieves in the house, as she had heard a noise; I jumped out of bed; I heard a noise at the door in the street; I threw up the sash, and asked who was there: the watchman said, he believed the servant had robbed the house; I put on some clothes, and went down with a light; when I came down into the passage, I found the prisoner there, and three or four watchmen with her; she had got a bundle with her; upon examining it, I found it contained several of the things mentioned in the indictment. When the constable came, he said she must be searched; she said, if we would not search her. She would deliver up what she had got; then she pulled out a French-plate half pint mug, and then a guinea; she said, Here is your guinea; and she pulled out two or three caps, and some other little things; but the greater part of the things were in the parcel. She said a person who recommended her as a servant to my wife, advised her to steal what she could the first opportunity, and make her escape. She lived with me a month within two days.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 16th of April, at a little after three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner with a large bundle in Mansfield-street, Goodman's-fields.</p>

I stopped her, and asked her where she was going, and what she had got in her bundle: she said her master had come home in liquor, and had had some words, and her mistress had discharged her; that she was going into the country, and her mistress had put some bread and cheese into the handkerchief to keep her on the road. There was some bread and cheese in a handkerchief by itself. She told me her master lived in the Minories; I asked if her mistress was up; she said she was: I told her she must go with me to her mistress. As we were going up Swan-court, I saw Mr. Parker's door a-jar; the watchman shoved it open: I took the prisoner into the passage; she wanted to leave the bundle with me, and to be off; I told her she must see her mistress: we called Mr. Parker up; the officer of the night was sent for, and charged with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>How came you to have so much money in your pocket? - I took it with me to buy some clothes, but it was too dark when I had done work.</p>

               <p>Was not you very much frightened? - I was very little frightened; God kept me. When they left me, I went home, and went to bed, and in the morning I went to the Rotation-office, and gave information of the robbery. On the 18th of March, I was sent for to the Rotation-office; I saw the prisoner there in a room, in company with two other prisoners. As I passed them, the prisoner said to me, You sulky negro, what do you look at? upon which I fixed upon the prisoner; I knew him to be the man, though I said nothing till I went into the office. I am sure he is the person that took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What description did you give of the prisoner when you laid the information? - That he was a red-faced man, and I should know him again, if I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was that all the description you gave of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination, he said the prisoner was dressed either in blue or brown, he could not tell which; that he had no conversation with any person at the Rotation-office about the prisoner; and that he expressed no doubt whatever as to his identity.)</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. King, a butcher, in Bluecross-street. I saw the prisoner about a quarter before five o'clock, on the sixth of March; I particularly recollect the day, because I hurt my arm on the preceding day, the fifth of March: I met him in Warwick-lane; we went into a public-house, and had two pots of beer, and staid about two hours together. I then said I could not stay any longer; I must go home to my master's: he went home with me to my master's, and then we went to the Feathers tavern, and had two or three pots of beer, and parted about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the justice, I asked the prosecutor what dress I was in at the time he supposed that I robbed him: he said, the same dress I had on then. I have a person to prove I bought the coat I had on, four days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner ask you what dress he was in when he robbed you? - I do not remember that he did.</p>

               <p>Did you say he was in the same dress then, that he robbed you in? - I can swear I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Lake. The prisoner asked Justice Sherwood, whether he would ask that question about the clothes, or he should ask it himself;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150015"/> the justice told him he might ask it himself, and he did ask it.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner called two other witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

The prisoner was in liquor at the time; otherwise I am persuaded he would have got the knife out of his pocket, before I could have secured his arm. I desired Mr. Proctor to take him to the Compter, and he was ordered for trial.</p>

             weigh it, and put it loose on a cover, before the men went home from work; I ordered the tea to be weighed again that evening, and was informed there was a pound deficient. Mr. Bennett said the men should be searched; I went, and called the prisoner; he did not come immediately. When I got to the counting-house, I enquired why he did not follow me; he was then standing just by the place where the tea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150016"/> was; I suspected he was shifting the tea, or hiding it: after calling him a second time, he said he was coming presently, and followed me; the porters were all searched, but the tea was not found upon any of them. After the men were gone home, Mr. Bennett, myself, and the other evidence, searched the warehouse, for the tea; and, just at the spot I saw the prisoner at, the tea was found lying upon the ground, in a linen bag, covered with foul paper; it was under a kind of block, upon which we tie up parcels occasionally. We found it to agree exactly in quantity and quality with the tea that was missing. Afterwards, the tea was put again in the place where we had found it. On the following morning, before the men came to work, I secreted myself in the warehouse, where I could see what passed; and I had ordered the other men to quit the warehouse upon the prisoner's coming in. I saw the prisoner go to the place, pull the paper away, and take the bag up with the tea in it; he hunted a few seconds eagerly among the papers before he could discover the bag: upon his finding it, he took it up, and ran up stairs; I overtook him before he reached the second story; I called out to him by name, upon which I saw him throw the bag of tea down; I charged him with the theft, and said, Now I have found you out: he said, No, I had not; for I had not found it upon him. He was taken before a magistrate, and committed.</p>

I weighed the tea, and carried it into the second story, and spread it on the cover; I weighed the tea again between two and three o'clock; there was not any missing then: when I weighed it in the evening, there was upwards of a pound wanting. In the morning, I was ordered by the last witness to take charge of the prisoner. The prisoner then said he came early in the morning to move it; but, if he had known their scheme, they should never have seen his face at the house again. I had before found the tea under the block; it was weighed, and answered in quantity as nigh as could be.</p>

On Tuesday, the 7th of May, between three and four o'clock, I went into the parlour; in a few minutes, I heard something in the passage; I went out, and found the prisoner in my house. I asked her what business she had there: she said she wanted to enquire for one Johnson, a journeyman cooper. I said I had a good mind to send for a constable to search her: she said, I might, she had nothing. I then turned her out. In about two minutes after, I had occasion to go into Mr. Gallopine's house, which is the next door; I saw the prisoner come out of the little room, with 11 lb. of sugar in her apron: she had taken it out of a closet in Mr. Gallopine's house, which is used for the purpose of keeping sugar in it: I cannot say whether the closet was locked. Upon comparing the sugar I found upon her, I found it was some of the same sort as that left in the closet. It was Mr. Gallopine's sugar.</p>

I went to go out, but sat down to eat some: I took it to be broken victuals, and was very thankful for it: these two gentlemen came up, and used me very ill; they took my apron from my side, and made my nose bleed.</p>

On the 17th of April, the prisoner came into my house; I had some suspicion of her; I clapped my hand to her, and felt the pint pot; I searched her, and found the pots mentioned in the indictment, with some others, upon her; I sent for Mr. Dawson; he said they were his pots.</p>

               <p>A young woman, who was a gathering in her pots, found these two pots among hers: she said they belonged to such a person, and asked me to take them; I put them into my pocket, and went to the gentleman's house.</p>

I lost six men's perukes on the 12th of April; there were two of them just made for two gentlemen, customers of mine; I missed them about four o'clock in the afternoon. I went down to Rag-fair. I went into an old wig shop, and enquired if they had any old tail wigs to sell, thinking they might produce them: they told me they had none. I went into a shop opposite, and asked them if they had any to sell: they said, No. Mrs. Brady, in that shop, beckoned to me, and asked me if I had lost any wigs: I said I had; could she give me any information of them? Yes, she said, she could, she knew one of her neighbours had bought some wigs; and, if I would describe them, she would send for them. She directly sent out her servant-girl,

               <p>Mrs. Brady described the man to me that sold them; they said, probably, if I went into a public-house just by, I might meet with him. I went into the public-house, and saw the prisoner sleeping; I went and fetched Mrs. Brady: she said that was the man. I got a soldier to help me take him up; but he was rescued out of my hands several times in Rosemary-lane.</p>

I asked him how he came by them: he said they were his property. He asked me 6 s. for them: I told him I did not like the appearance of it. He asked me if I would lend him 3 s. till he would bring proof they were his property: I lent him 3 s. I went over with the wigs to Mrs. Brady, and told her of it; and desired her, if any person came to ask for the wigs, to send them to me. He sat down in my house till I went to Mrs. Brady's.</p>

As I was carrying the clothes home, I stopped some time to look at a little horse; the prisoner came up, and said I had been loitering upon my business, and snatched the clothes out of my hand; I said he must return me the woollen bag. I apprehended he was the clerk of the gentleman to whom the clothes were to be delivered. He returned me the clothes and bag, and then I went on towards the gentleman's house; but, before I got there, he came up again to me, and snatched the clothes out of my hand, and was going away with them; I cried Stop thief! upon which the prisoner returned me the clothes, but made off down Thames-street, through an alley, to the Three Tuns, a public-house. I delivered the clothes at the gentleman's, and informed the servant what had happened; they pursued the prisoner to this public-house, where he was apprehended; he was carried before a magistrate, who committed him.</p>

               <p>Last Friday I had been at the Orange Coffee-house, and was returning home about half past twelve. I met the prisoner: she came up to me, and appeared very fond of me, and desired me to go with her. I went with her, and by compulsion went to <placeName id="t17820515-27-crimeloc133">No. 2. in Gloucester-court</placeName>

When we came there, they let us into the house; but she smelt so strong and disagreeable, I had nothing to do with her; she was enough to poison any body. My breeches-pocket was open. I put my hands in my coat-pocket, to take care of my pocket-book; (it was a very valuable pocketbook) but I did not button my pocket; it is a very shallow one: and I think I lost my money then; but I did not perceive her take the money. Afterwards she forced her way out, and there was a struggle between her and the maid of the house. In a few minutes afterwards, I perceived I was robbed. I had never seen the prisoner before; nor did I see her again till she was in prison, which was on the Monday following. We were five or six minutes together in the room.</p>

               <p>I am servant at No. 2. Gloucester-court. The prisoner had been once in our house before: she came in with a gentleman: They both went into the parlour. I stood in the passage seven or eight minutes. Then the woman opened the door, and called for some water. I went to get the water: she got to the door to go out. I went and said, Ma'am, you brought the gentleman in; take him out with you. She opened the door, and rushed out. He held up his finger, and put his hand in his pocket: he spoke; but I did not know what he said. He staid about ten minutes after the prisoner went away. Another young lady came in when he went out; she went into the parlour. He held up his finger, and talked something, and put his hand into his pocket.</p>

               <p>This money they swear to, is my own, I have saved up at a shilling a time. When I met this gentleman first, he was with a black woman with a white gown and white coat on. What he had, was entirely unbuttoned. I was at a distance, against the rails. I went down towards Pall-Mall; I stood upon the stone of a door in Gloucester-court. He asked if there was any house he could go into; I said there was a house there. I knocked at No. 3, and went in. He said, My dear, I have no money; I have been with a black woman; my money is all gone. He pulled out his pocket, and said, I have got a snuff box, and a watch, and a pin valued at so much, and a pocket-book at so much, which he could not part with. I said, if he had no money, I would not go with him. I said, As you have no money, I do not chuse to give my carcase up to you for nothing; and I hope you will give me liberty to get some water, for I am dry. He said yes; but he would keep my cloak till I came back. What he offered to me, was what is not fit: he is a man neither fit for God nor the devil; he is neither fit for a black woman, nor a white woman. What he expressed to me, put a shock upon my spirits, and frightened me. I went to open the door. The maid said, Take this man with you. I said, No; I do not chuse to have any more to do with him. I ran out at the door: I heard no more of the gentleman till I went out; and then the constable took me; and said, I had robbed him of so much. It must be meer wickedness, because, when he took me into the house, he said, he had not any, and because I would not condescend to his will, he charges me with this. I did not come into close quarters; I was at arm's length from him.</p>

Davis stood below to receive the hay and straw, and he carried away the trusses, one at a time. The prisoners said, what they did was by order of Mr. Bedell, who was the general superintendant of Mr. Price's affairs. Just as the last truss was carrying off, I saw Bedell go down the yard. He used to come to the yard after Davis was turned away from Mr. Price's. Davis had been turned off a few days before; and, not having a new carter, the porter took care of the cart horses till a new carter should be appointed. Bedell has absconded ever since.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 29th of April Davis gave me charge of Merry. Merry asked, For what am I taken? I said, for stealing hay and straw. He was carried before the Lord Mayor. He first denied the matter: he owned he knew of the affair; and upon second examination he owned he was concerned in the affair; and the hay and straw were carried to a public-house in Chick-lane.</p>

               <p>When I came into the shop, Mr. Price told me that I was to obey Bedell's orders, the same as if he had ordered it himself. Bedell had the general management of the oil business. While I was eating a bit of dinner, in Fox and Knot yard, Bedell called me out: he unlocked the door, and ordered me to throw out the hay and straw, which he said he borrowed. After the hay and straw was flung out, Bedell locked the door again; and he said, Go and help Davis carry it.</p>
               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was discharged from the care of Mr. Price's horses. I was loitering about the stable-yard; Bedell called me down, and desired I would go and carry a tru of hay, and he would give me something to drink. I was never present near the loft till the hay and straw was thrown down in the yard.</p>

               <p>What did browns mean? - Halfpence. I went to Mr. Stenson's, at No. 9, in Bull-and-Mouth street; I saw him, and asked him to let me have half a guinea's worth of brown ones, and half a guinea's worth of whites. He said, the whites were not quite ready, but they would be ready in an hour. He gave me half a guinea's worth of browns; he said he had not whites enough for his own customers, and I got none. I waited for the browns near an hour; then the prisoner gave them to me. I brought them home, and delivered them to my master; he counted them, and put them by.</p>

               <p>Davis came to me from the country; she was a destitute girl. I got her a place; she staid in that place about four months, and then came to me ill, and wanted me to get her into the hospital. I asked her, what was the matter? She said, she was ashamed to tell. I said, Betty, you have been playing the fool; she said, she had. I advised her to get into her own country. She came to me afterwards, and solicited my charity, to carry her into the country; she said she was not in place, and was better; and I gave her 15 s. in halfpence, to carry her into her own country.</p>

My bureau, which was a mahogany one, had a hole bored in it with a nail-piercer, under the flap, in order to wrench the hinges off; I found a nail-piercer in the prisoner's room, which answered to the hole, and the hollow part of the nail-piercer was full of mahogany. Upon the bureau there stood a table clock; in wrenching the bureau, the glass of the clock was broke all to pieces, and the glass falling among the work, had stopped the clock at twenty-five minutes before five. I got some people and an officer together, and asked the lodgers if they had seen any person at my door; they every one said they had not. The prisoner, and the woman who lived with him, were not at home at that time; I afterwards saw a light in the room; I went up stairs; the woman, whose name is M'Ginnis, was there. I asked her if she had seen any person at my door; she said, No: that she went out about two o'clock, and her husband (meaning the prisoner) with her; and that she had not been at home since, nor her husband. One of the lodgers said, he saw him go out between four and five o'clock, and saw the fox-dog with him; upon which I ordered M'Ginnis to be taken into custody, and then she confessed some of my property had been carried to the house of one Jones, in Fleet-lane. The prisoner came home that night, and we took him into custody. The next day we got a warrant, and searched Jones's house; we found there a part of my property, and the fox-dog I have mentioned was likewise found at Jones's.</p>
               <p>(The watches, and some other articles mentioned in the indictment, which were found at Jones's, were produced in court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor, on his cross-examination, said, the street door was usually left on the latch; and that there were not any promises nor threats made use of to induce M'Ginnis to make a discovery.)</p>

               <p>On Sunday night, I went with Mr. Bellis, up into the room, and saw M'Ginnis; we charged her with breaking open Mr. Bellis's door. She burst out a crying, and said, It was he that did it. I asked who was he? She said, Frank. I asked where he was; she said, at her sister's in Wood's-close. I went there with a constable, but did not find him. When we returned to Mr. Bellis's, the prisoner had been there, and was sent to the watch-house; I went to M'Ginnis again, and asked her what he had done with the things; she said, she heard him say he had taken them to one Jones's, in Fleet-lane. We took her to the watch-house that night, and the next morning we got three search-warrants, to search Jones's, and the sister's. As soon as we went into Jones's, Mr. Bellis saw a gown, which he said was his wife's. Then I went with the constable to Jones's father's, where we understood he slept, and there we found two watches, which we took to Mr. Bellis, and which he owned; he mentioned the name to one before it was opened. On the Tuesday, Mr. Bellis told me he had found a nail-piercer in the prisoner's room, full of mahogany; I compared it with the hole in the bureau, and it fitted it. I saw the clock; the glass was broke, and it had stopped at twenty-five minutes before five o'clock.</p>

I believe he had been out before that, for I heard the door go.</p>

            . I examined the bag, and took particular notice of it; it was a different bag to what we use for saltpetre, and had a particular darn upon it. I directed them to put it in the place where they found it, having no doubt but somebody would come for it: it was carried there; I afterwards saw it there. About eight o'clock, I was informed they had got a man with some saltpetre. I went, and saw it was the prisoner. I asked him how he came by it; he said he found it by a bundle of hemp, which was about 200 yards from where the bag was concealed. I went and examined the warehouse; the window was broke: there are bars to the window, that would not admit the whole bag to be taken out; the bags were lying against the bars, three of them were cut, and the saltpetre taken out.</p>
               <p>Whose property was it? - The King's. I am sure this is the bag I had first seen; we knew of four bags being lost; they weigh about a hundred and a quarter each bag; it was worth about 5 l. a hundred: this man had been employed, and knew the saltpetre was deposited in this place.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner on Sunday morning, the 28th of April, by the Brown Bear, in Bow-street, Covent-Garden, about five o'clock in the morning; he was attempting to go into the house, but the landlord pushed him out. He said to me, I know of another public-house; if you will go with me, you shall be well entertained, and have what liquor you chuse to drink. I went with him to a public-house, I cannot recollect where, but, to the best of my knowledge, it was the <placeName id="t17820515-42-crimeloc202">Feathers, Great Wild-street</placeName>

During the time we staid, he put his hand into my pocket, and took out three half crowns: I was almost asleep when he put his hand first into my pocket, but that awaked me; I missed my money, and called to him just as he was going out. I perceived his hand in my pocket; I am sure it was he, because there was nobody else in the tap-room. I called to him, that I wanted to speak to him, but he shut the door: I went and opened the door as nimbly as I could; by that time he was crossing the street. I called out that he had got my money; upon that he ran, I pursued him. It was then near seven o'clock. I followed him through several turnings for about five minutes, crying Stop thief. He was stopped by

I said I was but a poor man, I believed I could raise half a guinea; he said we must go before the justice to have a proper discharge.

I said, have you no water in the room? She said, No. We went to bed together; she got up, and went and knocked at another door in the same house, and went in and staid three or four minutes; then she came again into the room, and another girl with her; the other girl held the door, but did not come into the room; the prisoner said, Take this away; that was a cloak, or apron, or some such thing; the other woman went up stairs again, and the prisoner went out into the street. I asked her where she was going; she said she would come back, but she did not come back again. I got up, and examined my breeches, and missed one guinea, and my gold watch with three seals; I am sure I had them when I went to bed; I had put my breeches under the bolster.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive that she touched them before she went away? - No; I had not been asleep, but I was a little in liquor. I saw my watch at the Justice's the next day, and the prisoner, I am sure, is the person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Mr. Cordie's, a pawnbroker on Snowhill. On the 26th of last April, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and offered me this watch to pledge, and wanted five guineas upon it. I asked her if it was her own wearing watch: she said, No, it was her husband's. I looked at the seals, and saw one had W W, and a crest upon it. I asked her husband's name, she said it was Brown. I asked how it came to have a different cypher, she said her husband bought it second-hand; I asked her where she lodged, she directed me to a place. I went and enquired, and found she did not live there; upon which I stopped her and the watch, and took her to Bow-street, and she was committed, and we advertised the watch.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Whose house was this at? - I do not remember the name, somebody told me the name.</p>
               <p>Durant. I enquired in Church-street, and heard the person's name who kept the house, was - . I know nothing but what I was told; I went to the house, and asked if one Brown lodged there: they said, Yes; she was taken up for stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The gentleman left the watch with me till next day; he did not come. Being distressed, I was obliged to make away with it.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did you leave the watch with her to keep till next day, when you was to give her some money? - No; I gave her half a crown.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

We lost 106 lb. of bohea tea from their yard, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning of the eighth of this month; it was in a chest which lay on a truck. I saw it there that morning when I was in the warehouse; I heard the voice of a boy at the bottom of the yard, and I perceived my fellow-servant running out of doors. I followed them as fast as I could; I went into Bow Church-yard, and across Cheapside, into the entrance of a passage that leads into Honey-lane Market; there I perceived the prisoner with the chest on his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150031"/> shoulders; my fellow-servant being a few yards before me, came up with him first, and laid hold of the chest; the prisoner stood still when he laid hold of the chest, and let the chest go down: I laid hold of the prisoner's collar.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the chest being your masters? - Yes; on the night before, I saw the chest filled with the bohea tea, nailed up, and put in a mat in order to be sent on board a ship the next day: it was directed R. Rayner, Hull; it was going to Hull. I laid hold of the prisoner's collar, and said, Friend, you must come along with us; he did not say any thing to us.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 10th of April, I saw Clark, another porter of ours, reading a paper that was torn; I took it out of his hand, laid it on the counter, and, putting the pieces together, I read it myself. A few minutes after that, the prisoner came in; I read it over to him; and, after I had done so, the prisoner took it up, put it into the fire, and burnt it. I read the paper over twice; the prisoner's name was signed to it: I have seen the prisoner write, and believe the whole of that paper to be his hand-writing: the contents were in substance, as near as I can recollect, as follows:</p>
               <p>"SIR,</p>

               <p>The time he appointed him to call, is after they leave work. We had weighed three packages of opium, and let them down into a cellar; the weight was entered in a warehouse book; and on weighing them again, after this discovery by the letter, we found one package deficient 13 lb. none had been sold from that package. The saffron also had been weighed a few days before; and, upon weighing it again, we found a deficiency of 15 lb. the weight was reduced from 37 lb. to 22 lb. and no part had in that interval been sold. The resin of jalap was found, in the same way, deficient 4 lb. We found at one M'Millan's, a taylor, a large quantity of medicines. Mr. Webster asked the prisoner, what money he had in his box? He had only a few shillings in his pocket; he said, three guineas only in his box. Mr. Webster asked for the key; he was not willing to give it; at last he did give it: upon searching, we found a large quantity of clothes, and three guineas and a half, in the box; and in a bag, at the bottom of the box, we found 36 guineas. The prisoner was asked to account for his having so large a sum, after he had said he had only three guineas: he gave two different accounts; first he said it was left in his trust for a young man that was gone abroad; I said that could not be, for the man he mentioned was worth nothing: then he with-held his story, and said it was money he had with-held upon a settlement with his creditors.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I had a warrant to search the house of M'Millan, in Cartwright-street, No. 12, East-Smithfield. We went about a quarter after seven in the morning in search of drugs, opium, and bark, and some other things. When we came there, M'Millan was not up; we knocked at the door, and he came and opened it in his shirt. When we were in the house, we told him we had got a search-warrant, to search for stolen goods. He said he had no stolen goods that he knew of. He said he did not know that there were any drugs, or any thing else in his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any drugs, or stolen drugs? - I can't recollect he said there was no stolen drugs that he knew of. We told him we should find it if it was in the house, for we had a warrant to search. He then said there was a bag in the closet, pointing to the door. We went to the closet, and took the bag out. We asked him what there was in the bag. He said he did not know, but that

The Justice said, he could tell him what he had before, and where he sold it, in Lombard-street; then he said he had some once before. He was asked if he had not had some twice. He said he had had some twice. He said he knew Tinnent, and made cloaths for him.</p>

Morant and another officer went first, and knocked at the door. The prisoner came in his shirt, and opened it. I followed them into the house, and said, we were come to search for stolen drugs. He denied having any stolen goods in his house. Upon being told that his house would be searched thoroughly, that we knew there were stolen goods in the house, and he had better not expose himself to his neighbours, but tell where they were, he pointed to a closet, and said, there they were. The officers searched the house, but found nothing else. They took the prisoner with the goods, as produced in court, to the Public Office, in Bow-street. We attended between eleven and twelve o'clock. The prisoner was examined by Justice Wright. He said that Tinnent had thrown the goods into the house, and he did not know what they were. Mr. Wright telling him that he knew more of the matter than the prisoner thought he did, he confessed he received two parcels of goods; that one parcel he had sold for 36 guineas, and retained a small premium for himself. It was with difficulty Mr. Wright got out of him who he sold them to. He did not mention any persons names, but said it was a druggist between the Post-office and the Mansion-house. He said he delivered Tinnent 36 guineas for the first parcel, and kept a small sum for himself; the second parcel, which came, I think, to 13 l. 9 s. the prisoner said he had delivered 10 l. of it to

               <p>The first that I saw of the prisoner was after the goods were taken, and he was carried into Bow-street. I heard his examination. When he was first put to the bar, he pretended great ignorance, was exceedingly backward, and would say nothing; at last Mr. Wright said he knew the circumstances, and where the drugs were sold; upon which he said, I have done a very bad thing, but now I will tell the truth. He acknowledged that he had received two parcels of drugs of our porter, Tinnent, and sold them to a druggist, in Lombard-street; he sold the first parcel for 36 guineas, which he gave Tinnent, and that he kept only half-a crown for himself; and 36 guineas was the sum found in Tinnent's box: he said he sold the other parcel for 13 l. 9 s. that he gave Tinnent a 10 l. note, and kept the 3 l. 9 s. for himself. We had received three chests from Ostend, weighing near 1000 lb. we weighed two of the three chests; one wanted between 12 and 13 lb. of the weight. It is impossible to swear to the opium; it is lapped up in the way our opium generally is.</p>
               <p>Other people have their opium lapped up in the same way? - Very probably they have. We have the bills and receipts, with M'Millan's name to them.</p>

               <p>On the 15th of April, at night, while I was in the stable, the prisoner crept in through a hole that was stopped up with some litter, and set open the door, and then took down one saddle; I was lying down, waiting, expecting somebody to come; I saw him take one saddle down, and lay it at the door; then he took the other, and laid it upon it, and then put them both on the dunghill; then he went and looked up the yard, to see if there was any body; then he came and took the saddles, and was going off: I went immediately and stopped him with the saddles over his shoulder; he went down on his knees, and asked me to forgive him; I took him to a public-house, and gave a constable charge of him.</p>
               <p>Who did the saddles belong to? - Mr. Brice; they were valued at a guinea.</p>

               <p>I am a night-man. On the 9th of May, between four and five in the morning, as I was going along with my cart, in a lane that leads from Whitechapel to the New Road, I saw the prisoner, with the lead rolled up upon his shoulder. He had nothing over it.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the prosecutor's house? - About the 8th of a mile. Upon seeing me, he threw it over some pales into a rope-ground, and went on towards St. George's turnpike. I followed him, and stopped him opposite the house the lead was taken from. I desired him to come back and take the lead he had thrown over into the rope-ground. He said he knew nothing of it. I told him he was the man, and must go back with me. He was never out of my sight. He offered me a pint of purl to let him go. I said, I would not. I took him back, and found the lead that has been produced. My master said he would take care of him while I got the lead; but as soon as I let go of him, he threw down his bag and ran away, but I pursued him, and took him immediately.</p>

I took very little notice till I saw the deceased strike at King's legs, and set him down on his backside on the quarter-deck; it appeared to me to look serious; I took more notice; King got up, and they both took their jackets off.</p>

               <p>Did Weir return the blow before they stripped? - I can't be positive, whether before or afterwards; they stripped instantly, and sought; King fell down; he rose, and they made several closes; I cannot say how many; there were several bouts, and several falls.</p>
               <p>Which appeared to have the better in the fight? - I can't say which had the better; King fell three or four times, and Weir fell three or four times; the last fall, they went both down together; I don't know positively which was next the deck.</p>
               <p>Did they fall over any thing? - No; on the flat deck. Upon the last fall, I put my hands round Weir to take him up; he put his head back, and gave one single groan, and departed.</p>

            , one of the porters, called me a quarter before six o'clock; I gave him the keys, to open the warehouse; I came down in about five minutes after, and saw the prisoner going out of the back door with a bag of pepper; I instantly went to the door, and called to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150040"/> her, but she would neither look back, nor speak; I went and laid hold of her; then she said, James gave it me.</p>
               <p>Who was James? - One of the porters; the man I gave the keys to, to open the warehouse. After I had stopped her, I told her, You know James has no right to give you any thing out of the warehouse; and desired her to bring it in. She put it down under the sky-light; I looked at it, and saw it was black pepper. I bid James go and call Mr. Palling, and desire him to come down directly; he went on the stairs, but never called him. As I thought I must be on my oath about the pepper, I took it to the scales, to weigh it; 
               <persName id="t17820515-57-person523">

             came to me, under a pretence of seeing the weight of the pepper, and the prisoner ran out into the lane; I went after her, and took her again. By that time, Mr. Palling was come down, and I left the prisoner in the care of the footman, while I went to seek for a constable. There were 60 lb. weight of the pepper. We sent her to the Poultry Compter. When Mr. Mather came home, we sent for another constable, and took the porters up, and sent them there also; but, not having any positive fact against them, the Lord Mayor discharged them.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination, he said it was impossible for the woman to have filled the bag after he gave the porter the keys to open the warehouse.)</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Yates of Birmingham, as a clerk. I remember the defendant coming, in September, 1780, with a letter; it was about six in the evening: he enquired for Mr. Yates, who was not then in the way: he said, he wanted to see him in particular. Mr. Yates was sent for, and after a few minutes came. The defendant then delivered the letter to Mr. Yates himself. Mr. Yates took it into a room, and read it. When he returned again, the defendant requested an answer. Mr. Yates said he would give none; he had received similar letters before. Then the defendant pressed a second time for an answer. Mr. Yates then asked his name, which he declined telling; said it was of no signification; that he came to Birmingham, and had been desired to deliver that letter to him: he said Mr. Ford had particularly desired him to get an answer in writing. Mr. Yates said he would give no other answer than he had given before, which was none. He then went to the door with the defendant, and I followed them. I was as near to the defendant, when the conversation passed in the warehouse, as him now the door at which they went out, was not farther from me than the door of the Sessions-house is now. I passed them on the landing, and went down the stairs before them; but they were not more than three steps after me. When we came to the bottom of the stairs, the defendant turned to the right-hand, and I to the left: he appeared going away; but I saw no more of him, nor of my master. What I have related, was the whole of the conversation that passed between Mr. Yates and the defendant. I did not hear him speak any such words as Stanton swore he did, nor any words to that effect: if he had, I must have heard it, in the situation in which I was. I met Mr. Whitworth at the bottom of the stairs: I returned again to the warehouse in about five minutes. I never saw the defendant at my master's since. Timmings and Hamper were present at the time of this conversation.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross-examination, he said, That when the defendant came, he was writing at the desk: he said that the warehouse was not quite so long as the court; that when Mr. Yates came in, he (the witness) resumed his business at the desk; that the conversation was so loud, he could not help hearing it; and that he heard, he believed, every syllable that passed; that there was nothing said in the passage by either of them; that he did not recollect any thing passing between Mr. Whitworth and him about the letter; that Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates were reading the letter together when he came into the warehouse; that he listened, because the defendant mentioned the name of Ford; and that, knowing the dispute that subsisted between his master and Mr. Ford, he quitted his business to listen. At first, the witness said he did not recollect what he went down stairs for: afterwards he said he went about the business he was engaged in at the desk, which he could not do till he knew whether the things were finished they were at work upon; that he did not know which of the shops that work was carrying on in.</p>
               <p>- TIMMINGS sworn.</p>
               <p>I remember the defendant bringing a letter. I was not in the warehouse when he first came in. I came in before Mr. Yates came in. The defendant gave Mr. Yates the letter. Mr. Yates went into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150043"/> room, and read it. When Mr. Yates came back, he told the defendant, that he had received, before, two or three letters similar, and should give the same answer, which was none at all. The defendant desired he would give an answer in writing. Mr. Yates asked his name: the defendant said it was of no signification; and Mr. Yates said, a second time, he should give no answer. Then the defendant left the warehouse. I was about four yards from the place where they stood conversing together. I did not hear the words charged in the indictment: if they had passed, I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Were Richards and Stanton conversing about the letter when you came in? - I cannot tell. As soon as Mr. Yates said he would give no answer, the defendant Stanton went out; and Mr. Yates went out about two or three minutes after him, and followed him close: he was not a yard distance from him.</p>
               <p>You said Mr. Yates went out two or three minutes after the defendant, and that he was not a yard distance from him. How do you account for it, that the going of a yard could take up two or three minutes? - I was mistaken as to the time; he went out immediately after him, one directly after the other. Mr. Yates followed him out of my sight: I cannot tell where he went when he went out. What passed, or whether any thing passed, between Stanton and Mr. Yates, when they went out, I do not know. Mr. Yates was out about two or three minutes: then Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates came in together. Richards and the other clerk were employed at the desk. I did not continue long in the warehouse; I believe Richards went out before me. When I returned, Mr. Yates, Mr. Whitworth, Richards and Hamper, were in the warehouse. Mr. Whitworth had a letter in his hand. I do not remember taking notice of any words that passed then; I was about four or five yards off.</p>

               <p>I saw the defendant go out, and go off the landing down the steps. Mr. Whitworth returned with Mr. Yates. I was at the desk all the time. No such words passed as those mentioned in the indictment; if there had, I should have heard them. When Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates came back, the letter was read. Stanton's first address was to me. Richards went down, and staid while the letter was reading. The subject matter of the dispute between Mr. Yates and Mr. Ford was concerning some bills and cash which had been sent to London. It was supposed by Mr. Yates, that Mr. Ford had received them, and refused to acknowledge the receipt. There was the name

               <p>(Upon his cross-examination the witness said, that some time previous to this application to Mr. Yates, Mr. Ford had entertained a suspicion that some person or persons then in Newgate had stolen Mr. Yates's box with its contents.)</p>
