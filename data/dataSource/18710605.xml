                  </hi>. I am head barman to Mr. Rudkta, at the Groffins in the New Meat Market—I have been in his employment about three months—the Griffins stands at the corner of the market, facing Charter House Street, In what is called the "A" avenue—the entrances to the house are in the mar<lb/>ket—the entrance where the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> is delivered is through the market gatts—on 4th May, some gin was delivered from Messrs. Nichobon &amp; Co., at the Griffins—the gin drawn out from the cask which, stands in the van, into the gallon copper cans, which are very small at the neck—Fielding was the carman who came with the van—it was his duty to fill the cams, and he carried them from the cart as far as the door, and they were carried up stairs by another man, in the same employ—I had watch the delivery of the gin on the day in question—they commenced to take the him in about 3.15 on the afternoon of the 4th—I knew the prisoner by sight, as a beadle in the market—shortly before 4 o'clock he came to my master's place, and said How about the gates, young man may I close them?—I said "No, I think you had better leave them open till we get-the gin in which will not be long"—the gates are closed on that day at 4 o'clock, on other days they are closed at different times—he said "All right I" and went out—he came in agin shortly afterrwards and said "Young man, have you got a small bottle you can lend me?"—I said "No, we don't keep them in this house"—he said "Have you got a soda-water bottle you can land me?—I them lent him a lemonade bottle, with a flat bottom—I first gave it to him with<lb/>out a cork—he asked me to put a cork in, which I did—he put the bottle in his pocket, and went out—out—the bottle I lent him was like this one (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I believe this was the one—the one I lent him had "Culver house" on it the same as this—I waited in the bar a moment or two, and saw the man go out with the empty cans they fetched the gin in—I jumped over the bar, and went up a few star is, and looked out of a window which com<lb/>manded a view of the cart—I saw the distiller's man fill a can and bring it in the market gates—I could not see any more from that window, so I went to another window and looked out—I saw the man again with the can—he placed it on the ground, and turned his back towards it, to look out of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050006"/>
               <p>market, at his cart—I then saw the prisoner coma tip the avenue, where he turned down in the first place—he stood behind the can, and looked round each way, put his hand in his pocket, and took out the bottle, took out the cork, and placed the bottle in the can—I got down from the window, think<lb/>ing I would go and catch him in the act, but I afterwards got up to the window again, and saw him putting his hand in his pocket; whether he had the bottle in it or not I can't say—I then went to the manager, and gave him information—I went out to see if I could find the beadle Roberts—I went up to the gates to see whether he had gone out of the market—I met him in the market as I was going back—I said "Mr. Jones wishes to see you"—Mr. Jones is the managing man—he said "Mr. Jones, what does he want me for?"—Mr. Jones then came up, and I heard him ask the prisoner for the bottle of gin he had in his possession—the prisoner said "What gin?"—Mr. Jones said "Come back with me," and he went back—I can't say that he was given in charge at that time—he was afterwards taken to the office of Mr. Stevens, the superintendent of the market, and searched, but no gin was found upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say all this occupied about twenty minutes; from the time he came in and spoke about the gates to the time that he was searched—I am not in Mr. Rudkin's service now—I left last Wednes<lb/>day—I was only there three months—I never had any dispute with the prisoner—when the gin is in the copper vessels, and is taken into Mr. Rudkin's place, there is someone to mark them off with a chalk mark, and to see that they are full—if I saw that the cans were not full I should call attention to them—I did not see any of the cans not full on this day—I have not the slightest doubt that the bottle will go into the mouth of the can—the can is about 4 in. in diameter, and the bottle is about 2 in.—it will go in easily, I should imagine—I looked out of two windows—they both have ground glass; it is ornamental ground glass—you can see through very easily where there is a star—from the time I left the window till I met the prisoner in the market, and told him Mr. Jones wanted him, I should imagine was about five minutes—I only ran from the top of the house, and out to the market gates—I don't know whether Mr. Rudkin is here—on the occasion of the prisoner being searched no one gave him in charge—he did not ask to be given in charge—he said "Do you give me in charge for having the giu?"—that was when I stopped him—he was asked about the gin he had in his possession, and he said "What gin?" and I suppose some<lb/>thing more was said, and he said "Do you give me in charge?" like anyone saying it defiantly, daring him to do it—he was taken to Mr. Stephens' office—he insisted on being searched—I don't know whether there is anyone from Nicholson's here—I believe Fielding is here—I don't know that Field<lb/>ing took any part in the stealing; that is a thing I know nothing at all about—he was looking after his syphon, or anyone might have put a can under, and drawn off a pint of spirits in a moment—he never ought to have left the tap—he brought it from the cart, and another young man took it up stairs—I don't know a witness named Anglis at all, not by name—I was in Mr. Graves' service, in Church Street, Edgware Road, before I went to Mr. Rudkin's—I gave him notice the day before I left—he said he was going to make an alteration, and he has got a female now in my place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman and clerk to Mr. Charles Brumlue, a drug merchant, of 9, Mincing Lane—he has also a warehouse at 8, Billiter Street—on Monday afternoon, 17th April, I locked up the warehouse per<lb/>fectly safe—it was fastened with a patent padlock bar, and another lock besides, which locked the door—on the following morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I found the padlock had been taken away, and an old padlock substituted—I could not open it with my key—it was forced open, and I found that a box of saffron had been taken away—it contained about 2 cwt, and was worth more than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three inferior qualities, but that would be the value, striking an average—I found a crowbar standing against a bag of seed—here is a piece of paper which was afterwards found in the saffron—it was torn from a piece that was in the warehouse—it has</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). I received information of this robbery on 18th April—on Saturday, 22nd April, I received some informa<lb/>tion from Mr. Gabriel, in consequence of which I went to his premises in White Street, Moorfields—after I had been there a short time, Robinson came in—he produced two parcels to Mr. Gabriel, weighing 14lbs. he was showing it to Mr. Gabriel, when I said to him "Robinson, how do you account for the possession of this saffron?"—he said "Well, I will tell you the truth"—he then told me that he had received it from Hall that morn<lb/>ing—I said "Where?"—he said "At the public-house down the Bow Road"—I said "Do you know any other person in this matter?"—he said "These two parcels were handed to me by another person that was with Hall, and he rode as far as Whitechapel Church with me, by the tramway"—he said he did not know the man's name—I said "When are you to see that man again?"—he said "I have to meet him at a public-house facing King William's statue about 11 o'clock"—I asked him how he was dressed; he described him—I said "And when have you to see Hall again"—he said "After I have seen this man at this public-house; I had a sample given me of this saffron last Wednesday morning, and that is all I know of the matter"—I said "Very well, I will test your statement; consider yourself in custody, I shall take care you don't escape"—he walked before me to the White Bear public-house in King William Street—I there saw Adams,—I did not know him before; from what I saw I said to him "Did you give this man two parcels this morning?"—he appeared somewhat confused, and made no answer—I turned to Robinson and said "Is this the man that gave you these parcels?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I shall charge you with being concerned with Robinson and others, in stealing a large quantity of saffron, on 18th April, and also with receiving"—I then conveyed Robinson and Adams to the Tower Street Police Station—I did not nee that Adams went out from the public-house after he came in—Child and Downs were with me—I was looking after another person at the time—after lodging Adams at the station I directed Robinson to keep the other appointment with Hall—I went to Smith's public-house in Bishopsgate Street—Hughes came in, he had a conversation with Robinson, and then left—(Hughes was afterwards taken into custody, and has committed suicide)—shortly after, I saw Hall enter the public-house—I walked round to the same compartment that Hall and Robinson were in, and from some<lb/>thing Robinson said to Hall, Hall said to Robinson "I thought there would be some mess in this job"—I then spoke to Hall, and told him that I should charge him with being concerned with Robinson, Adams, and others, in the stealing and receiving of this saffron—he said "Adams knows nothing more about this than carrying the parcels for me, I will take all the responsibility myself"—he said "You have been a little too fast in this; if you had not been so fast, you might have recovered all the pro<lb/>perty"—I said "I can't help that"—I then conveyed him to the station and charged them—I think I ought to mention, perhaps, what caused him to make that remark; I had almost directly after the robbery given direc<lb/>tions to a constable named Obee to call upon Hall, and Hall said he should have communicated with us, or something to that effect, but that I was too fast in the matter—he did not say anything about Obee—he said "You. have been too fast in the matter: if you had not been too fast perhaps you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050018"/>
               <p>would have recovered the whole of the property"—after they were charged, Hall said he wished to make a statement—I took him apart, and he then said "The saffron was all taken to my house on the Tuesday morning (that was the morning of the robbery, the 18th), and you will find it there now, or rather it was there this morning when I left; if you don't find it there you must go to Hughes, he ought to know where it is"—he told me Hughes was to be found at 26, St. Peter Street, Hackney Road—I knew that—I afterwards went to Kenilworth House, Wellington Road, Bow, where Hall lived—there was a strong smell of saffron in the house, and I saw small traces of saffron about the passage and just outside the door—it was a wet morning, and the colour was running a little—I was accompanied by Childs and Downs—we searched the house thoroughly, and could not find the bulk of the saffron there—I then went to Adams' house, which is thirty or forty yards from Hall's—I there found three bags, containing about 150lbs. of saffron, in the kitchen—I saw Adams' daughter there, she showed me where it was—I had seen her in Hall's house a few minutes previously—I took the saffron to the station—I saw Adams, and told him that we had found three bags containing saffron at his house—he said "Well, it was not there this morning when I left"—I then saw Hall, and told him we had been to his house and found the saffron at Adams'—he said it was at his (Hall's) house that morning when he left—he said he had borrowed from Mr. Smith, the landlord of the public-house where I had seen him in Bishops<lb/>gate Street, 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had paid over to Hughes on account of this saffron.</p>

               <p>he went to Mr. Smith, and had deposited two life policies with him as security—I don't remember his telling me that on 18th April Hughes called at Mr. Boore's, and that he (Hall) saw him, and told him that Mr. Boore was absent—he told me that Hughes frequently called at Mr. Boore's—I don't remember his telling me that the cheque which he gave to Hughes was actually handed to Hughes in Mr. Boore's house, or that Hughes told him that one bag contained 42lbs. weight of saffron—he told me 28lbs., in addi<lb/>tion to what I have mentioned, had been sold by Hughes to a person named Goodrich—he said that Mr. Boore was to have received the whole of the saffron, but he (Hall) said "You can't have all, because 28lbs. has been sold by Hughes," not mentioning the name, I believe, and that Mr. Boore said "Very well, then the remainder you bring to my house, in 7lbs. and 14lbs., and I will have it all packed away in cases"—he said that in conse<lb/>quence of that he had given a sample from the 14lbs. to Robinson—I have no recollection of his telling me that he had mentioned to his master that the police were enquiring about 100lbs. weight of saffron stolen from Bil<lb/>liter Street—he said something about its being brought from the docks, but I understood that to have come from Hughes, that Hughes told Hall so; I would not be sure of it, but that is my impression—he has told me all through, that Mr. Boore had directed him to do all this—I knew that Obee had com<lb/>municated with him beforehand—I don't remember his telling me that he had mentioned that to Mr. Boore, and that Mr. Boore said "We need not be afraid about that, because it has come from the dock"—I would not say it was not so, but I did not understand it so; I understand that that came from Hughes—Hall said his master had told him he had given 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., per lb. for it—I also understood that from Hughes—Hall told me that Mr. Boore had promised to allow his wife 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and to pay counsel for his defence; he did not say he would do that if he would not give information of these matters—he said that Mr. Boore had paid his wife 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week, and had paid for a solicitor to defend him at the Mansion House, but that after he had made some statement at the Mansion House, all moneys had been stopped—when he said I had been too fast, I understood him to mean that if I had not been so fast, he might have given me information in reference to it—I have mentioned all these matters to the prosecution—I did not mention them to Mr. Evans, the solicitor, but it has been made known, the whole statement, to the Commissioner, and persons concerned—there was a lot of matter that I did not consider I ought to have exposed—I would rather not have said anything about it, because it referred to another person not before the Court—I mentioned all that I considered necessary—I have not mentioned to the solicitors all that I have told you, they have only just come into the matter, therefore, I have not had an opportunity of going into the—I case with them; I have had the management of this matter entirely myself have communicated to other persons connected with the prosecution the information that Hall gave to me.</p>

I live at 3, Greencoat Row, Westminster, and am fore-man at Mr. Downey's cab-yard, Buckingham Cottages—on Saturday night, about 12.30, I was coming from the yard, and as I got to the corner of Buckingham Cottages, three or four men rushed on to me—I was struck by home sort of weapon, which knocked two of my teeth out, and knocked me on my back—one of the men kneeled upon my throat, and the other took my money out of my right trowsers pocket, and they kicked me on both sides; I feel sore now—I could not say whether there were three or four men, they rushed from round the corner—the prisoner is the one that kneeled on my throat—I law him plainly when he got off—I saw his face from the lamp on the opposite corner—he went off towards the police-station, the others went the other way—I ran after the prisoner—I lost sight of him when he turned the corner of Rochester Row—I could not get along very well—I went across to the station, which was just across the road, and told a constable—he came out, and I pointed the prisoner out—he was then standing about, walking on the opposite side of the road—he had got on light trowsers, a brown coat, and a cap—I can swear he is the man that got off my throat.</p>

I examined the premises at Canon's Park, after they had been broken into—the burglary appeared to have been committed by some person climbing on to a stone ledge, about 20 ft. from the ground, by means of the lack part of a pair of steps, and then climbing to the top of the house, on to a stone balustrade—the stone ledge is about 2ft. wide, and a person could go round three sides of the house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050029"/>
               <p>upon that—the back part of the steps would enable him to get to the balustrade, which is 8ft. higher than the ledge—I found the attic window tied with a piece of bass—we suppose he got out at the bottom window—I afterwards went across the gardens, and searched in the boat-house, which is about 400 yards from the house—I found this writing-desk broken open, and the papers strewed about—I found this knife, which corresponds with the one produced by Roberts—I also found some sugar and bread, and some pieces of egg shell, and burnt pieces of wood, where someone had cooked the eggs—I found foot-prints on the garden beds, as if someone had walked with a naked foot, in the direction of the boat-house.</p>

I was with Sergeant Manton, and saw the prisoner in the Wandsworth Road, on 10th May, I told him I was an inspector of police, and wished to ask him some questions about a fire and a burglary at Mrs. Begg's—I asked him whether he had been formerly in Mrs. Begg's employ as gardener—he said "Yes"—I asked him where he slept on the Saturday and Sunday night, the 22nd and 23rd April—he said</p>

               <p>"I slept at my lodging"—I said "Your landlady says you did not sleep there on those nights"—he said "That is right, I did not sleep there, I admit, I slept at a friend's"—I said "Where does that friend live?"—he said he could not tell me, and he ultimately said that he did not sleep at any friend's at all, hut that he was roaming round Croydon, and slept under hay stacks—I asked him whether he went into any house—he said he went into a baker's, he believed somewhere at Croydon, and bought some bread—I said "Have you paid your landlady any money, or did you pay your landlady any money on your return?"—he said "Yes, I paid her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"—I asked him where he got the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from, as he had previously stated that he only had a few halfpence in his pocket when he went into the baker's shop in Croydon—he said "I borrowed part from my sister, and a part I obtained by selling some books and other things at a shop"—I asked him where the shop was, and also his sister's address, as I should have to make enquiries as to the correctness of it—he then said "I did not get the money that way; I can't tell you where I got it"—I said "The landlady said that you had told her you had walked from Colchester, and had borrowed some money of a friend"—he said "I did tell her so, but it was wrong"—I asked him where his dinner knife was; he said he had sold it—I asked him where; he said he could not tell—I said "Your explanation of where you were on those particular nights appears to me to be very unsatis<lb/>factory, and I shall take you for setting fire to the shed and committing a burglary at a cottage and mansion at Edgware"—he said "I can't help that"—as we were going to the station he appeared rather anxious to get his hand to his waistcoat pocket, and when we got to the station I still found him putting his fingers in—I walked up to him and said "What have you got in that pocket?"—he said "Oh, I have some keys" and he produced two keys—I said "I think you have something more there?"—he said "No, I have nothing more"—I put my fingers in, and ultimately pulled out this pen-knife—he said he had had it a long time—he was charged, but said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Detective Police—on the 19th or 20th August last, I saw the prisoner at a workshop on the estate in Bolton Gardens—it was on the Thursday or Friday after the body was found; that would be on the 19th or 20th—the murder was on Saturday, the 13th, and the body was found on Tuesday, the 16th—I asked the prisoner where he received his wages on the Saturday previous—he said "At No. 15, Bolton Gardens"—I said "What time did you arrive home?"—he said "About 2.10"—I asked him at what time he received his wages that day—he said "About 1 o'clock"—there were about ninety men that I had to see, who were at work on the estate—I was investigating the murder at that time—I knew where he lived; it was, I should think, about twenty-five minutes' or half-an-hour's walk, from 3, Gledhow Gardens—that was all that passed between us on that occasion—I was present at the inquest; it was held on the 18th, either Wednesday or Thursday—I think there was an adjournment—I was present on both occasions—the prisoner was not there on either occasion—I next saw him, to speak to him, about 11 o'clock on Sunday, 12th March last—he was, at that time, in custody—I had received a telegram, which caused me to go to the police-station at Kensington—he was in a cell there—I said to him "Do you know me?"—he said "Yes, you are Mr. Palmer"—I said "Have you been drinking?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you any pains in your head?"—he said "No"—I said "Are you aware of what you have been saying, and the serious consequences that may occur?"—he said "Yes"—I said "But no hammer was found"—he said "I left it there"—I said "Do you mean to say that it is true, what you have been stating?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I will fetch your father," which I did, and his father and brother had an interview with him—before that, I said to him, "What makes you make this serious accusation against yourself?"—he said "I could not stand it any longer; poor old Jack used to stand by the side of my bed at night, staring at me with those big eyes of his"—the interview with his father and brother took place in my presence—he adhered to the same statement—his elder brother spoke to him; his father was too much affected—I did not hear everything that passed between them, but I heard him make the remark that he could not help it, he had done it—I was present on another occasion when his father was with him, at the Hammersmith Police Court—I think that was at the second exam<lb/>ination; the 28th March—his father had an interview with him, and he then said that he could not help it, that he had done it—his father said "I cannot believe it"—on 4th April, at the last examination, I asked him if he was hungry—he said "Yes"—he had had nothing since 8 o'clock—I sent him in some food, which he thanked me for, and as I was leaving the cell, he said "Mr. Palmer, have you found the hammer?"—I said "No"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050033"/>
               <p>said "Well, I can't account for it; I always thought I left it in the room"—I may add that, on the day the body was found, Tuesday, the 16th, I searched the room, and was not able to find any hammer—I was not the first person there; it was some hours after the body was found; but I searched the house fully, and also the day following, but I found no hammer, or any instrument that would be likely to inflict the wounds—several persons had been there before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Some of the adjoining houses were searched, and the neighbourhood, and I was never able to find anything of the kind—the con<lb/>versation I have spoken of I now depose to in the witness-box, for the first time—I did not say a word about it at the Police Court—I did not take it down in writing—I gave evidence at the Police Court as to going to the prisoner, and looking at the house—when I saw him and questioned him on the Thursday or Friday after the body was found, he appeared cool and collected—I bad not the slightest reason, from his answers or his appearance, to suspect him—he answered every question I put to him, and answered it truthfully, as I found out, about the payment of the wages, and so on—I ascertained that he did get home about 2.30, because I made enquiries about every workman—he did not say that after he received his wages, and before he went home, he dined in Sloane Square—he did not say where he had his dinner—I have never heard him say anything about that—I examined and questioned not only him, but about ninety workmen, and followed up any clues—I ascertained what men had been discharged, and made every neces<lb/>sary enquiry—I found that two men had been discharged just previous to the murder, sixty or seventy at various times, but two shortly before—I endeavoured to follow up those clues, and I cleared up as to where they were on the day in question; there were other clues that I endeavoured to work out; there was one which I followed up for some time, and I found that he could not have committed the murder, he was too drunk to walk; that was not my only reason for foregoing my suspicion—the suspicion was, because he had called on the widow of the deceased a day or two after—I cleared that up, to my own satisfaction—there were other clues which I was following oat at the time, without any success—the doctor was examined at the inquest—the nature of the wounds was spoken of—I heard it suggested, by the doctor, that it must have been done with a hammer, such as a lather's or plasterer's hammer—the prisoner is a painter by trade—his father is a person of very great respectability; he is a sort of sub-contractor, he does the whole of the painting for Messrs. Spicer, on that estate, and was employ<lb/>ing his son under him—in the course of this inquiry I have had every reason to rely upon what the father has stated to me—I said to the prisoner, at Kensington, "Are these the clothes you had on in August last, the day of the murder?"—he said "No, you will find my clothes under my bed," describ<lb/>ing the coat and trowsers—I ultimately got a coat and trowsers from the house; they have been submitted to medical inspection, to the doctor who examined the deceased, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything upon them—I did not get his boots.</p>

I am landlord of the Drayton Tavern, Thistle Grove, Brompton—the deceased man, Samuel Lee, was a potman in my service—I was in the habit of supplying the workmen engaged on the estate, in which Gledhow Gardens is situate, with beer, during the week, and it was their practice to pay when they got their wages, on Satur<lb/>day—Lee had been in my service about three years—he kept a book—the last time I saw him alive was about 12.30 on Saturday morning, 13th August; he was then in front of the bar—I had just given him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver for change; it was mixed silver, half crowns and shillings; that was to enable him to give change to the workmen when he received his money to settle the weekly accounts for beer—I did not see his book—he went out with that money—he would have to receive, on my account, I daresay, about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the workmen, on that Saturday—he did not collect money for anyone else, but he himself used to supply dinners to the men, which he used to give credit for, so that he had debts due to himself to collect, as well as mine—after he went out, on that day, I did not see him again alive—his ordinary time for returning would be about 1.30—information was given to the police that had not returned—on the following Tuesday, the 16th, in consequence of what I heard, I went to No. 3, Gledhow Gardens; a man named White fetched me there—No. 3 is very nearly opposite my house—I went up stairs to the ground floor, and there saw the body of Lee—he was lying on his back, in the dining-room, the back room, and this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was by the side of him, close against his hand—I went round the other side of the room, and it appeared to me that there had been two parties standing opposite each other, by the mantelpiece—there were two footprints, and there was another footprint and a half, just the ball of the foot, without a heel, but there had been a good many cats running about the floor, so that they had disturbed them a good deal—the room was all covered with dust—a constable was sent for, and he examined them.</p>

               <p>when I got into the house I perceived a remarkably disagreeable smell—I went into the back room ground floor, and there found the dead body of Samuel Lee, known to me as "Potman Jack"—we did not know his proper name on the premises—the door of the room was partially closed—it stood about a foot open—before I went into the room I saw the hair of a man's head, as I supposed, through the partially open door—I opened the door, went in, and found the body—upon this I went back to No. 6, and fetched Benham, a fellow workman, and told him what I had found, and I then sent for Mr. Adkins, the landlord, and he brought the policeman Large with him, and another constable—we went into the room, and they examined the body—I have known the prisoner about four year—I had seen him for some length of time—he was working at No. 6—I saw him the week before, and the week before that—I am not positive whether he was working at No. 6 on that Saturday, but I saw him several days during that fortnight, working on the estate—he has been working on the estate all the four or five years I have known him—the out-door workmen were supplied with beer by Lee—I have known Lee lend money to several workmen—Saturday was his usual pay day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think the deceased man's weight would be nearly nine stone, or from that to ten stone—that, would be about his weight, I should think—I weigh twelve stone—he was short and stout, but not over and above stout—I lifted him, not by myself, with assistance—dead people always appear more heavy than living ones—I noticed dust down the front of his clothes, and on the front of his trowsers, as if he had first fallen on his face; that was the appearance—I could not tell from the appearance of the floor whether there had been a struggle, because where he was, it was all blood—there was a great deal of blood where the head and shoulders lay, in fact the blood had run nearly four feet from where the body was—there were a few <hi rend="italic">spatters</hi> of blood on the wall, as though it had spattered in three different places, on both sides and behind—his clothes were covered with blood all the way to the waist, all smothered in blood—there are five or six stone steps to go up from the road to the front door—is that distance elevated above the road—the back room looks out into a large garden at the back of all the houses, a large square—there is no road out there—I should think where the body lay would be 40ft. from the road, including the path—I looked in other places as well as in the house for the hammer—I made a minute search all about the place and in the gardens, every place we could think of at that time, and times after—I went in at the door just behind the landlord—two persons had been up to the fire-place; you could see the footmarks in the dust—one of those two appeared to have been the deceased, there is no doubt about that—there were the footmarks of two persons in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Fulham Road, West Brompton—on Tuesday, 16th August, I saw the body of the deceased, at No. 3, Gled<lb/>how Gardens, and on the 17th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—perhaps I had better read the notes that were taken down at the time the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> occurred—the original notes are partly in my handwriting, and partly in my son's—I saw the body on the 16th August—I was fetched by a police<lb/>man—on the 17th I received an order from the Coroner, to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I found that the deceased was about 5ft. 3 in. high, he was well nourished, and apparently healthy; he was lying in a dried pool of blood, apparently dead three or four days; the right arm was slightly abduced from the body, the left arm close to it, both arms ex<lb/>tended;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050037"/>
               <p>the eyes were widely open, the right pupil somewhat dilated; the face, head, and arms, more or less covered with blood; also the back of the clothes; no blood on the clothes in front; there are several spots of blood on the wall, about four feet from the body; the black trowsers are covered with dust similar to that on the floor; the shirt is rolled up above the elbows"—I mean that his arms were bare up to the elbows—"He was a stout, healthy-looking man. In the front of the head there was a large, round, depressed wound, as though made by some blunt instrument, in the median line of the head; that had impli<lb/>cated some of the bones of the nose; it was knocked in upon the brain; it was about one inch, or three-quarters, beaten in upon the brain; it mea<lb/>sured about one inch and three-quarters one way, and one inch and a quarter the other. Just above this fracture there was another on the frontal bone, running into the first, apparently made by a more cutting instrument, the bones being out through, rather than depressed; the length of this wound is five-eighths of an inch; still more to the right, near the coronal suture, is another fracture of the same character as the last, running into it; by these fractures a large portion of the frontal bone is detached from the rest of the skull. Over the left eye there is a triangular wound, exposing the periosteum, that is, the lining of the bone, but not implicating the bones. Immediately below the right eye is a large contused wound, not exposing any bone, but beneath it the mala, the cheek bone, and the jaw-bone, are fractured in several directions, and depressed into the antrum, that is beneath the nose, knocked in upon the brain. On the left side of the face, although there is no evidence of a blow, the nasal processes, that is, the nose, and the superior maxillary bone, are detached; that blow, I think, must have been given after the cessation of the circulation, there was no appearance of braise in it. On the right parietal region the perios<lb/>teum was denuded by an irregular wound, the bone was uninjured, that was, in popular language, on the right side of the head. On the back of the head, on the left side, is a large comminuted fracture, that is, the bones are all broken up into pieces beneath the skin, on the left side, behind, through which lacerated brain substance is protruding; that implicated the occi<lb/>pital bone, and the left parietal bone of that side; by this fracture a train<lb/>gular portion of bone on each side, about an inch and a half, is detached, and hangs by the scalp. In addition to this, a number of smaller portions are detached—that injury has apparently been inflicted by two blows, one of a rounded form, the other in front, of a cutting character. Immediately behind the right ear is an incised wound, 21/4 inches long, by which a flap of the scalp is removed from the temporal and occipital bones, and the periosteum exposed; this had apparently been inflicted from behind, as the flap was adherent to the front only; behind, on the occipital region, on the right side, there was a smaller contused scalp wound; there were no other apparent injuries")—When I first saw the body, he was lying on the back—on the front of his trowsers was the debris of mortar and stuff in the room; it was very thick; they were black trowsers—there was no blood on his clothes in front lower than about here (the chest); but he was lying on his back, in a pool of blood—he must have fallen on his face, otherwise he would have been turned over twice—I know what a plasterer's hammer is—I gave it as my opinion then that it was done by a plasterer's hammer, or something of that character; that is my present opinion—that has a blunt hammer on one side, and a cutting chisel on the other—I saw nothing of any hammer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can come to no other conclusion than that the large wound behind was the first that he received—I should think there were five wounds that would have caused instant death, and that one particu<lb/>larly—I think that must have been the first and mortal wound, from the state of his clothes—that wound was caused by two blows, one by a round substance, and one of a cutting character—that must have been a very heavy blow, indeed, given with immense violence, and must have been done with a heavy hammer—the skull is particularly thick there—that wound must have caused instant death—the man must have fallen forward, on his face; his clothes, and the whole of his black trowsers, being covered with dust in front—he could not have moved himself after that, he must have been turned over by some other force, and the other blows must have been inflicted afterwards, otherwise he must have been turned over twice; he was, I should say, rather a stout, powerful man, a broad man, about 5ft. 3 in. in heighth; I should say his weight was ten or eleven stone, or more than that—I am ten, and I should think he was two stone heavier than I am—he was a stout, fat, well-built man—if he was dead when he fell, it would take more power to turn him over than it would if he had been alive—we had a difficulty in moving him up to be examined—I gave evi<lb/>dence before the Coroner, and described the wounds—I read from this paper—the eyes were wide open, widely extended; he looked as though he were looking at you with his eyes very wide open—I have used the word <hi rend="italic">staring;</hi> we call it staring when the eyes are so very wide open—I used that ex<lb/>pression before—I also stated my impression that it must have been done with a hammer of the kind mentioned.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050039"/>
               <p>but it had been lying in that house for some considerable time—I last saw it lying in the fire-place, at No. 6—I expect that was about two months previous to the murder—it was an old plasterer's hammer, the cutting part was very much worn away, but the bottom part was only a little chipped; it was a hexagon-shaped hammer—it has been searched for—I followed the constable, and searched for it immediately the body was found—I was not able to find it, or trace it in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave it out to somebody to chip away the cement work, and to clean bricks—I don't recollect who that was—it is two years ago when it was first given out—I saw it after that, some months after<lb/>wards; I saw it continually—I last saw it lying in the fire-place—the work<lb/>men were finishing that house, No. 6, at the time of the murder—I was there during the last two months before the murder; I did not notice it then, I did not see it at all—the reason I noticed it two months previous was because I saw a man using it—I was in that house, three or four times a day between that two months and the time of the murder, and in that room in which I had seen the hammer—this matter has been a good deal discussed amongst the workmen, as to its being done with a hammer—it was my impression, when I saw the shape of the wound, that it was done with a plasterer's hammer—I believe it was frequently discussed amongst the men—I have not seen any of them imitate the way in which they thought it was done—I have heard them suggesting the way in which it was done—I have very little association with the men, beyond the work, and I do not hear what their discussions are.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There sare five Woolleys working on the estate, my elder brother, two sons, and a nephew—the prisoner went away from home about 9.30 on the Friday morning before he gave himself up, so his mother tells me; I was not at home at the time—he did not come home after that Friday—where he slept that night I have no knowledge, or on the Saturday—he was not angry with me before he went away, that I know of—I saw very little of him the last four weeks he was at home—I suppose he would be annoyed at my having discharged him—I knew of the body being found on the same evening; my son told me of it—he said something like this, "O father, they have found the body of poor old Jack in No. 3," but the exact words I could not tell you positively—I did not see any appear<lb/>ance of confusion about him at any time; nothing but what you would think natural—I was there when the Inspector came to see him—he appeared quite cool and collected, a great deal cooler than me—when he spoke about the body being found, he spoke in a feeling manner; he seemed to be quite feeling about it—I saw him about 2.10 on the Saturday—he had his tea with me between 6 and 7 o'clock, when I came home from the Abbey—I did not notice his clothes particularly—there was nothing upon his clothes to attract my attention; no blood, or dirt, or anything of that kind—there was nothing at all amiss with him that day, that I know of—the clothes that were afterwards given up to the Inspector were the clothes that he was wearing on that day—when I came back on the Saturday afternoon, I found him working in the garden—he worked there the whole afternoon, without coat or waistcoat on—he kept on the same trowsers—a person, named Jackson, was working there with him—besides the wages that I gave him, he was receiving money about that time from the Savings' Bank—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was, that very week that he went to the Crystal Palace; that was besides his wages—I paid him the day's wages for his holiday, and we were making overtime that week—as contractor, I had to overlook the house, No. 3, as well as the other houses—there had not been any work done in it for some months before the murder—I had not been in the house for some months—we left it under second colour, and I went over it to see that it was done all through—no tools were left lying about the house at that time, that I know of—this matter was a good deal discussed amongst the men; it was the common talk all day along—I have heard it discussed when my son has been present; I have discussed it with him myself—I have seen some of the men, when they have been discussing it in his presence, suggest the way in which it was done; some said it was done one way, and some another, imitating the way in which it was done; moat probably I have done so myself.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Whiteman, of Woodchester Street, Paddington—the prisoners lodged in our house; they occupied two parlours—on Wednesday morning, a fortnight ago to-day, I woke up with my baby, and heard the prisoners talking rather loudly—the day was then breaking; it was about 3.30, and I went to sleep again—I afterwards heard a noise like somebody running about the passage—I dressed myself quickly, and went down—the house was full of smoke, and the witness Smith was putting out the fire—I saw coals and wood about 2ft. from the hearth—I cannot say whether they were piled up, because the fire was out—there was no fender on the hearth—my husband had distrained on the prisoners on the Saturday before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 96, Woodchester Street, and am a potman—on the morning of 24th May, about 4.15, I heard cries of "Fire!" in the street, from a man who was passing—I ran down, and found Whiteman's door, No. 87, on the latch, not fastened, and as I ran in at the parlour-door where the fire was, the male prisoner stooped to throw a jug of water to put the fire out—I said "Have you set the place on fire? and I took the jug out of his hand, and well <hi rend="italic">slothed</hi> the two fires—the parlour is on the ground floor—there was no fire in the fire-place, but there was a fire, about 11/4ft. high, of flame, above 3ft. from the hearth, and another distinct fire 5ft. off, in the middle of the bed, which had been left for the children to sleep in—the children were not there, they were in the back room; the prisoners only were in the room when I went in, and both were fully dressed—they did not say a word, bat as I went in the male prisoner stooped, and made one <hi rend="italic">douse</hi> with the jug, and I took it out of his hand, and partly put it on the one fire, and partly put the water on to the bed—I said "Go and get some more water, and I will try and put it out"—I took the clothing off the bed, and soaked it well in water, and threw it into the bed—eventually I put it out, and the coal and wood I took out into the street—the coal was on the wood floor, 3ft. from the fire-place, and the wood was in the middle of the coal—the wood was burning, and the coal crackling, not quite alight—some rags were also burning, I should think it was a quilt—the middle of the bed was burning, and the top quilt, and the window-work was burning through the heat of the fire which I put out—there was about 5ft. between the fire on the floor and the bed, half a foot from that fire to the window—there were two distinct fires; the window sashes were connected with both, and the cupboard-door, which had caught, was connected with the one nearest to the hearth—neither of the prisoners said anything till the constable came, and then the female prisoner said that Mrs. Whiteman and I must have set it on fire while she was out—she also said that if it caught fire, she bought a penny candle on Tuesday eight, and put it in a bundle of wood, and put it on a bushel basket, and that was how it must have caught fire—that was at the same tune that she said that Mrs. Wightman and I must have set fire to it—the said that she stuck the candle in the bundle of wood, and put it in the basket, and went out at 10 o'clock, and me and Mrs. Whiteman must have set it on fire, and that was all she knew about it—there were two baskets in the room, and a new coat, which was being made—I have seen the floor since the fire was cleared away; there is a new flooring there now—they have had to have a new cupboard-door, but if the window-sashes are stopped, and painted over, I think they will do.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The jug which the man had would hold two gallons—when I went in he picked it up from the corner of the fire-place, 5 or 6 ft. from the first fire—it was not in his hand when I went in—I saw a bundle</p>

               <p>of wood in the room, but no candle—if there had been a candle it must have burnt down to the edge of the wood, but there were no signs of any grease—the basket might have been burnt—I saw fragments of a basket—the rags were not a woman's underclothing; there were towels among them—there was some underclothing; it is no interest to me to tell a lie—I saw a new pair of her boots burnt, but no children's boots—I saw no under-clothing burnt, or the remnants of it—the fire was 5ft. on the other side of the bed; it could not have set fire to the coverlet—the quilt could not have been set on fire by the heat, because the window and door were shut—the male prisoner did not take the coverlet off the bed when I went in—he seemed to have had his clothes on all night—the half-made coat was in a box, or part of a box, close to the door, untouched—I think if I had not gone in, the whole would have been set on fire, because no one would have known of it, and the inhabitants as well—it is no interest to me to come up here—I am a friend of Mr. Whiteman's, a very particular friend—I went into the next room to where the fire was—there were no possible means for them to sleep in that room unless they slept on the floor—the children came into the room where I was, in their night clothes.</p>

On the morning of 24th May I was called to 87, Woodchester Street, and saw the prisoners in the room where the fire was—I asked the male prisoner how he accounted for the fire—he said that he could not account for it at all—the woman said that she went out at 10 on the evening previous, and bought a penny candle and a bundle of wood, that she went out at 10 o'clock and returned at 11, and she supposed Smith and the landlady had set the room on fire during the time she was away—she afterwards said that she placed the bundle of wood at the top of a hamper, and stuck the candle in the bundle of wood, and she supposed the candle burnt down and set the wood on fire—the fires were out then, but the room was very hot—that was all she said—the floor was burnt in two places—one was about a foot from the corner of the cupboard, and the other the other side of the window—one place was where the bed had stood.</p>

                  </hi>. I was gate-man to Messrs. Heal &amp; Sons—I have known the prisoner three years, that is since I have been in the service—he was there before me—he was a packer first, and afterwards a store-keeper—he was acquainted with everything connected with all the rooms—he left the service on a Friday night, somewhere about 20th April—either the day he left, or the day previous, I was in the yard, which is partially covered, and is near the packing room—I asked him if he was about leaving—he said "Yes"—I told him I was sorry to hear it—he said "Well, that is nocon<lb/>sequence"—I said "Perhaps you have got something better to go to?"—he said that he did not know about that, he had got that to prove, or words to that effect—as I was about leaving, he went entirely from the subject, and said "I will have my revenge yet"—his eyes were directed to the factory at the time he spoke, and he said "I will make an alteration there"—he was looking in the direction of the packing room the whole time—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly describes the ground plan of the premises, as near as I can say—Alfred Mews is no thoroughfare, it is composed of stables and workshops—Francis Street is a very large thoroughfare.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the firm, and am the son of one of the partners—on the morning of 28th April, between 3.15 and 3.45, I was returning home from a ball, and was going to sleep on the premises—I saw the packing room in a blaze, and the room over it—the flames came through the roof—in the packing room there were goods, previous to delivery, waiting for packing, and straw, and mats, and canvas—after that the fire extended to the mattrass shop and store—this red border represents the part which was nearly entirely consumed—there are two iron folding gates, under an archway, 20ft. high, in Francis Street; the gates only reach to 7 or 8 ft. from the top—the fire did not extend to the gates—anyone could very easily get access to the gates by climbing up the gateway; they would then get access to the yard; the premises generally are round at the yard, the packing room included—the entrance to the packing room is straight opposite anybody going down the gateway—when past the gates, there is no obstacle to getting to the packing room; the door is generally locked, but a person knowing the premises could get in; there is a swing window only hung, and there is also a doorway on the first floor, 9 or 10ft. from the ground, the door of which is generally open, where it is customary for men to go up and down; in fact, it is more natural for the men to go in that way than the other—a person being in the packing room and wishing to return to Alfred Mews would go up the steps and across an iron bridge, through a second little alley, and across the store rooms to the doorway overlooking Alfred Mews; that doorway is 10 ft., and the bottom of the window 2 or 3 ft.—the prisoner has worked for us five years—I had per<lb/>sonally no complaint to make of him—he had notice to leave a week before he went, and he left on the Thursday proceeding the fire, which would be the 20th or 21st—I think he went on the night of the 20th; it was Thursday, if Thursday was the 20th—persons were sleeping on the premises, and I should have slept in the dwelling marked on the plan.</p>

Heal &amp; Son's, Tottenham Court Road, last Friday week, 28th April. I got over the gate, and went into the packing-room, and set fire to the place with matches"—I said "Are you telling me the truth?"—he said "I am, man to man; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I don't want anyone to suffer for what I have done myself; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and will suffer for it. I done it because I thought it would make work"—he said all that at once, all at the same time—I again asked him if it was true, what he had told me, and he said that it was—I asked him why he had made the statement to me, and the reason he had not made it before—he said "Because I could not keep it to myself any longer"—I said "Why did you do it?"—he said "Because the Devil tempted me"—I asked him what time it was—he said "About 3.30 in the morning," and he said "I worked for the firm six years"—I took him to Old Street Station, and then to George Street Station, where he made a statement to the Inspector—I did not notice what he said then, but I made</p>

               <p>a memorandum of his statement to me four or fire minutes after I took him, and therefore I am quite certain that that was the substance of what he said—he had been drinking, but he was not drunk—I am quite certain he understood what I said; he seemed to reason with me on the subject very well.</p>

You hare heard what the constable states to me: is that true?"—he said "Yes"—I asked his name—he said "George Broomfield," and that he had no certain home—I asked what he was; he said, a labourer, and he worked at Messrs. Heal's for five years, in Tottenham Court Road—I said "Do you still adhere to what you have said to the constable?"—he said "Yes"—I then asked him how he got into the premises—he said "I climbed over the gate in Francis Street, and went to the packing-room"—I asked him how he got from the premises afterwards—he said "I let myself down from the packing-room by a rope"—I said "I think you have been drinking"—he said "No, I have not"—I said "I am afraid you are labouring under some delusion"—he said "I am not"—I then repeated the first caution, and said "This is a very serious matter for any man to confess to"—he said "I know it is"—I then took the charge, and locked him up on his own confession of setting fire to Messrs. Heal's premises—when I first asked him his reason, he said that he did it to make work—I said "Oh, nonsense; Mr. Heal, no doubt, is insured to the full extent"—he then said "To prevent other people being accused"—he did not seem drunk at all; he seemed quite composed, and quite rational—I said that he had been drinking; that was from his general appearance, and his face appeared flushed.</p>

I found the first witness there. Miss Marsh told me something, and gave me a bad half-crown. In consequence of what the boy told me, I went with him to 9, Caledonian Street; I saw the prisoner there. The boy said 'That is the woman who gave me the half-crown, and sent me for the beer.' I said to her 'It is a bad one.' She said 'I did not know it.' I said 'Have you any more silver in your pocket? She said 'No.' I said 'Turn your pocket out, and let me see.' She turned her pocket out, and there was a half-crown, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers. She gave me the half-crown. I said 'I don't know whether it is a good one or a bad one; but it looks very well.' I sounded it on the floor, and I could not tell then whether it was good or bad. I said 'You must go into the Queen's Arms, along with me.' When we got there, I saw the last witness. I said 'This is all the money she has got; it is another half-crown; I think it is a good one, but I am not sure.' Miss Marsh said 'Oh, that's a bad one, too,' and she broke the second one, and said she should give the prisoner in custody. On the way to the station, the prisoner said 'For God's sake, policeman, don't you say you found the second piece; if you do, I know it will go hard with me. You keep that, and I will see you when I come out.' I produce both half-crowns; one I took from the prisoner at her house. Both are bad." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> "I could not tell it was bad; I am not much of a judge. Prisoner said she did not know it was bad. When I offered Miss Marsh the half-crown, prisoner said 'Perhaps you'll say that is bad.' Prisoner was searched at the station.")</p>

I am a cabman, living at 42, Cromer Street, Gray's Inn Road—Mother lived with his father and mother in the same house—on 18th May last, at 7 o'clock in the evening, I left home, and locked my room door quite safe, and my property secure—about 8.30 on the morning of the 19th I returned, when I found the door open, the bed clothes gone, the boxes cleaned out, the money and a new hat gone—these are my property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this was all in my room—I never gave either prisoners authority to deal with it—I never saw Johnson before.</p>

On 19th May, about 3.20, I was on duty near the Coal Yard, Drury Lane—I saw the prisoners there—John<lb/>son had a bundle under his arm—my suspicions caused me to follow them, but before I could overtake them, they passed by Short's Gardens—I heard a door slam—I lost sight of them—I spoke to 382, who went inside the house; I waited outside—he called out that the prisoners were getting over the wall—I sprung my rattle; assistance came—I went inside, following the prisoners, and found them in the yard—Johnson denied having a bundle, and said I was mistaken—we went down into the cellar of the house, and there found the bundle produced, under the stairs.</p>

               <p>were just going to get down—about 3.20 in the morning—I got over after them, and found them sitting in the water closet—I asked them what they were doing there, and Johnson said, having no money, he had gone there for a lodging—he denied having a bundle—we found the bundle in the cellar.</p>

Last Sunday week, in the room above your sitting-room, for one hour, might be been your son and the girl, kissing, hugging, &amp;c., and placing themselves in very strange postures, as they supposed unseen behind the blind, but close to the window, &amp;c. As I belong to a certain society, and write for the press, I shall feel it my duty to make this public, &amp;c. In the meantime, if you think well to satisfy me for my trouble, and look into the affair, so as it does not occur again, I think it will answer your purpose, and I shall take no further notice. Otherwise there will be an article on Hampstead Morals, &amp;c.

If you send me a cheque or post-office order for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all well; but it must be per return, as I leave here on Wednesday.")—On receiving that letter, I put myself in communication with the police, and, on 16th May, sent the registered letter to the post-office, Winchester, containing this post-office order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also received this letter, dated 15th May—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed W.

                  </hi>. I live at 53, Nothing Hill Square—on 16th May, about 10 o'clock at night, I received information, and went to 17, Blomfield Road, where I saw the dead body of a female child—the prisoner and her husband were in the room—the child was in a coffin—I took it out, and examined it externally—it was between four and five years old, and very much emaciated, and there were marks of bruises on the forehead and face:—I went to the police-station, and reported what I had seen—I returned on the 18th with a Coroner's warrant, and had the body stripped—I could then see every rib standing out, the skin being tightly stretched across it—the abdomen was shrunk and shrivelled, and there was little development of muscular tissue; the eyes were sunk in the head, and open, and the pupils dilated—I was accompanied by my son, who is a medical student, and by my assistant—there were three distinct bruises on the forehead, of comparatively recent date, close to the hair, and downwards; one in the centre, and one on either side; also a bruise on the temple, and another on the cheek bone; these presented the appearance of from three to four days standing, those on the temple and cheek were of about a week's standing; there were also three bruises on the right, and one on the left arm; one on the right hip, and one on the left knee—those on the legs and arms were of minor consideration; the three on the forehead were severe bruises, with much blood extravasated between the tissues—the stroke of a cane would produce the bruises on the arms, but not those on the head—I afterward opened the body, and found the intestines much contracted, and perfectly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187106050065"/>
               <p>empty, with the exception of a little mucous—there was not a particle of fat in any part of the body; the vital parts were perfectly healthy, with the exception of a slight adhesion of the right pleura—I saw nothing up to the neck to account for death—I then dissected the head—I looked most carefully where I had seen the bruises on the forehead, and saw immediately below them a large quantity of extravasated blood penetrating to the bone, and extending to the periosteum—the skull was not fractured—the mem<lb/>branes of the brain were much congested, that is, full of blood—the brain itself was healthy—I account for death from congestion of the membranes of the brain, caused by the blows on the forehead, and accelerated by the poor, ill-nourished condition of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The congestion of the brain must have taken place three or four days before death—I do not think the child could have taken solid food after its brain became congested—congestion is a gradual process, it would not take place at once—it might have begun on the Friday—the origin of it might have been a blow given on the Friday—a dote of calomel administered on the Friday would not account for the state of the stomach—the bowels were much contracted, and it would not have produced that; but a dose of medicine might have emptied the bowels—a dose of calomel administered would account for the emptiness of the stomach if no more food was given, but it would not account for the contracted state of the bowels—the injuries on the forehead would not be accounted for by a fall forward, if the child was standing on its feet, but they might be from falling from a chair, or a bed, or from any height; that would account for the three bruises on the forehead—those three were of a more recent data than the others—those on the arms were twelve or fourteen days old—a fortnight would include all the bruises—the largest bruise on the forehead was a very severe one, that with the other two caused the congestion and the death—the bone of the skull was not injured—the child was naturally of a low type as regards physique.</p>

I am a clerk in the Record department of the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the original proceedings of Augustus Whitlock, under the seal of the Court—these are different proceedings—it was taken out of liquidation, and he was proceeded against afterwards—on 28th February the petition for adjudication was presented by Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss, of High Street, Southwark—on 25th March, Whitlock was adjudicated bankrupt—on 15th April, Mr. Wilson was chosen trustee—on 20th April, an order was made for Mr. Wilson, as trustee, to prosecute—the bankrupt filed his accounts on 13th April—the debts unsecured are 999<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the assets are 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., composed of stock in trade, 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and back debts 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Id.</hi>—Messrs.<hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Wilson Bliss appear as creditors for 263<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Gower's Road, Dalston—I have been a traveller in the provision trade a great number of years—I have known the defendant four or five years—I knew him when he was a journeyman at Knightsbridge—he first started in business for himself, I should say about two years ago—I became a traveller to Messrs. Holden &amp; Parker, in February last year, and I called on the defendant, and got orders from him to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—sometimes he paid me, and sometimes he transmitted the money—I left Mr. Holden's at the end of November, or the beginning of December last year, and went in the employment of Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss—Messrs. Holden &amp; Parker, dissolved partnership at the end of the year, and I left then—after I joined Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss I called on the defendant, and asked him for orders—the terms were one month's credit, the usual terms—the first order was on 9th December, and that amounted to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 16th December there was an order for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 23rd December, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 30th December, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 6th January, 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 16th January, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 18th January, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 20th January, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 27th January, 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a</p>

Penson supplied him with goods—I went into Holden's service in February last year—I received a salary, no commission—I know that Mr. Holden is the prisoner's uncle—I did not introduce the prisoner to Mr. Holden as a customer—I should say that during the time I was in Mr. Holden's service the prisoner had goods amounting to about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I won't say 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have told you what I think it was—it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more or less, if you like—I began to travel for Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss at the beginning of December—I had a salary there—they had only just started in business when I joined them—they were making a new business—I can't say that I was an active traveller; I hope I was—I believe that three of the defendant's brothers have taken Mr. Holden's business since he has retired—that is not in the same district as Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss—one is in the Goewell Road, and the other is in Southwark—his brothers are in the wholesale way, as Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss are—when I was at Mr. Holden's I used to go to the defendant once a week for orders, and I told him afterwards that I should be glad to see him at Wilson &amp; Bike's warehouse—he said he would come down—that was almost immediately after I had left Mr. Helden's—I told the defendant I had gone into the employ of Wilson &amp; Bliss—Mr. Holden was still in business at that time; that is Holden &amp; Parker were—they continued till the end of 1870, and then Mr. Holden kept on on his own account till 2nd February—sometimes the defendant came down to Wilson &amp; Bliss's warehouse—I was desirous of getting all the orders I could for my master.</p>
