I am a painter, at 6, Portman's Place, Globe Road—about 7.50 on Monday morning, 15th December, I was passing through Monkwell Street—I heard the constable cry "Stop thief!" and saw Bruce and another man walking very sharply close together, they turned into Fell Street—they stooped down, and Bruce put down this iron bar, and the other man put down a key, I think it was this small key—I followed them—Bruce went into the Rose and French Horn public-house—I told the constable that one of the men had gone in there; the other man ran down London Wall—I then went back and picked up this key and bar, and took them to the constable; he told me to take them to the station-house, which I did—at that time Bruce was in the hands of another officer—I should think not more than two or three minutes elapsed between Bruce going into the public-house and his being in the hands of the officer; the public-house is about eighty yards from where I picked up the bar and key.</p>

I did not mention Bruce's name before the Magistrate as having put down the bar; I said "One of them"—the Magistrate asked me which, and I said "The <hi rend="italic">one</hi> nearest me," that was Bruce—I did not see the bar in his hand before he put it down—I was about 20 yards in front of them when I first saw them; they were close together, meeting me; Bruce was not exhausted, he had not far to run, in fact he was not running when I saw him, he was not running after the other man—I did not lose sight of him until ha entered the public-house; I did not go in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I first saw them they were approaching me; at that time Kinsey, the officer, was at the far end of Monkwell Street, coming after them—there was not another person in Monkwell Street; Kinsey turned into Monkwell Street as the men turned into Fell Street, they were walking till the bar was put down and then they ran.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Leary get under the bed—I do think that was right—we were in an up stairs room—I did not see Hennessey behind the screen at all—he was pouring out the beer just as the police came in—I did not notice any screen—he was sitting at the table, but whether he got up while the constables were in the room I do not know—I call myself an agricultural labourer—I work at Bexley Heath—I generally go into the country in the fruit season, at other times I do nothing, and get a little subsistence from the parish, and from the industry of my wife—a good many persons were looking at us playing at cards, but they are not here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I am 16 years old—in July last I went into the service of Messrs. Morgan, wholesale stationers, of Cannon Street—at that time I knew a lad named Johnson—he introduced me to Eggmore in November, and I went with him to Eggmore's several times—in consequence of a communication Johnson made to me, I went and saw Eggmore, who said to me "Where do you come from, and where do you get the paper"—I told him I worked at a wholesale stationer's, and got it from them, but I did not name them at that time—I had sent paper to Eggmore through Johnson—Eggmore asked me if I could get different sorts of paper, and I said yes—he knew that I stole it—I told him I took it—he told me if I could get the paper to bring it to him after dark, or he would send one of his boys with a barrow to fetch it—I said I would see about it—I then told Johnson, who was waiting for me outside—after that Johnson waited outside my master's warehouse, and I took out some paper to him, and he went away—I did not go with him—I afterwards went with him to Eggmore's with some paper—I was taking paper to Eggmore's about twice a week for six weeks—his place is a cellar in Bell Alley—it is a waste paper shop—I went into the cellar with paper, but not often—Johnson went down at other times—Eggmore never weighed the paper in my presence—I took him 20 reams in the six weeks, and Johnson and I received about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between us—the last time I took paper from my master's to Eggmore's, was Friday, 28th November—I then took away five reams—I believe it was marked "C. M."—it was done up in a wrapper—Johnson chucked it down into the cellar, Eggmore was not there at the time; but when he came I told him I had brought the paper, and he said, "All right, I can't pay you now; I will give you a few shillings in advance," and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to call for the rest to-morrow, and told me not to bring any more, as he was going to give up business—I went next day, and he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the five reams—a boy named French was employed there—he introduced me to Mr. King, who carries on business at London Wall, where I was taken in custody—that was after Eggmore's business had been closed—Eggmore had given me instructions that when I brought the paper I was to keep a good look out and chuck it down the cellar—I took waste paper and good paper together to Eggmore's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I commenced robbing my master about November last—sold no paper till I sold it to Eggmore—Johnson was outside when I had the first interview with Eggmore, but he had gone in before I did—that was not on the same day but about three days before—I had paper with me outside when Johnson went in—Eggmore knew that I came as a friend of Johnson's—Johnson had told Eggmore that I was his cousin, and that I was taking the paper from a printer's—I told Eggmore, in direct terms, that I stole the paper from Messrs. Morgan's, that I took it from the warehouse down stairs; he said that if I preferred he would send the boy with a barrow for the paper, and Johnson could take it to his aunt's house, and the barrow could be sent there, only I was to let him know if I had got the paper out of the shop—either Johnson or I were to call for the barrow—after that I</p>

               <p>told Johnson, and he said that if I got the paper he would take it to his aunt's—what they call "waste "was the the outsides, and the other was good paper—the paper was conveyed to Eggmore's the same as it was when it was in the warehouse, but the waste was brought in a bag—the good paper and the bad were sent separately, they were taken separately—I used to take the reams of paper as they were done up—the "outsides" were tied up, and there was nothing over them, they were in a bundle—I put them in a bag to take them to Eggmore's—Eggmore did not say any<lb/>thing about the price, but Johnson said that he would give 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per 1b, for the "outsides"—waste paper shops pay 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per lb, for old rubbish, according to what kind of waste paper it is—the waste paper I took would be about 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—when Johnson said he could get 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I asked him if he could not get 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said "No"—I am sure I was to be paid by the pound for the waste paper, but I never saw it weighed—T took whatever Eggmore gave me—November 20th was the last time I went to Eggmore's, he then told me not to bring any more paper as he was going to give up business—Johnson then said "I will get some of that note paper sold for you"—I said "Where?"—he said "At King's"—and he and French said that if I refused to bring more, they would split upon me—I only robbed my master of three bundles after Eggmore was out of business, it was put an end to only by my being arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took about sixteen reams of good paper to Eggmore's—the "outsides "were done up in bundles, not in reams—I have heard in the shop that they were worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per pound—Eggmore did not tell me what the paper weighed, but Johnson has said that it came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could tell from the money Eggmore gave me at what rate it was, and it was not 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb, sometimes.</p>

                  </hi>'. I have known Aldridge about twelve months—I went to him at Messrs. Morgan's—he asked me if I had any work, and if I should like to earn 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "Yes"—he said "I have some waste paper to sell"—I said "All right" and went out and waited outside Morgan's shop—he brought out a little parcel of note paper, about 12 or 13 lbs., and asked me to sell it—he did not mention Eggmore—he said. "There is a paper place in Leatherseller's Buildings, and very likely they will buy it there—that is in Bell Alley—I went there, and it was Eggmore's—I went in and told Eggmore that I got the paper from my mother, who was housekeeper at some offices—that was a lie—I gave him my address in Spitalfields—he bought the paper, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards saw Aldridge, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards went again, and got more paper—Aldridge gave it to me in London Wall—it was the same sort of note paper—I took it to Eggmore's, and he gave me, I think, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I don't know what month that was, but it was about six weeks ago—I do not know what month this is, but I think it is January—the year is</p>

               <p>1874—I don't know what last month was—I cannot read—Aldridge went with mo the second time, and waited outside—I went in, and said "I have brought some more paper"—Eggmore said "Is it from the same place?"—I said "Yes"—I went back with Aldridge to the prosecutor's, and he brought out some more paper in the afternoon—I went to Eggmore's with that; Aldridge went with me—we took it down in a parcel, not on a truck—it was the same sort of paper—I went in and told Eggmore I had brought some more paper, and he bought it for 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—both then and at other times. I gave Aldridge part of the money—I took more paper after that—I went to Eggmore's about seven or eight times, and I got about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., altogether—I went about once in every two or three days, but sometimes I had to go two or three times for the money, because Eggmore was not in—I did not go more than once in one day—I took about twenty reams of paper altogether—on Friday, 28th November, I took two reams of paper, and we both took it to Eggmore's—we started with a truck with twelve reams on it from Morgan's, and two reams were delivered at Eggmore's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been in the paper trade—I know what a ream of paper is, it is a ream when it is tied up—he declined to buy any paper of me until he asked me who I was and where it came from—it was upon that that I invented the story that my mother was a housekeeper, and gave the address, which he wrote down, and he bought the paper then, but there was no talk about the rate of payment—he bought it by the pound, and I always saw it weighed when I took it down, but I did not understand it—after ho weighed it, he handed me so much money for it—Aldridge and I very seldom went to Eggmore's together, not more than once—when I did not take it there he did—I know that, because I was with him, and waited outside Eggmore's door—the paper was quite as many times in a bag as in a truck—when he had parcels to take to other places, ho put it on the truck in a brown paper parcel, and at other times it was in a bag—I gave my mother's correct address—I live in Steward Street, Spitalfields—my mother did not get the paper as housekeeper—I told Eggmore that Aldridge was a printer's boy, that the printer had given up business, and that this was paper which was about the place after that—Aldridge told me that it was paper which was brought down from up stairs, which was of no use—it is not a fact that I introduced Aldridge to Eggmore, he told me to go there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He only told me to go to Bell Alley, and there I found Eggmore, whose name was over the door—Aldridge did not mention Egg<lb/>more's name, he only said "There is a paper place there, perhaps they will buy the paper."</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in Eggmore's employ—I remember Johnson six or seven times bringing some small waste paper there; it was outside sheets which had been scribbled over, it was tied round with string in bundles—after that Aldridge brought some, he brought twenty reams altogether, most of which was good paper—I saw my master buy some of it,</p>

On 12th December I took Eggmore, and charged him with receiving two reams of paper, knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did not know they were stolen"—on the way to the station I said "You have been buying a large quantity of this paper; Aldridge and King are in custody"—he said "Yes, I have bought some, and the chief part of it I have sold to King, of London Wall, and some to Mr. Emmerson, of Bishopsgate Street—he said he paid 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb, for it, and that the boy he bought it from said his mother had sent him—I went to Emmerson's and received a of paper, which was shown to Eggmore, who said "I know nothing about that paper; I never saw it before"—he said King used to give him 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb, for the same paper that he bought of the boys—I got all this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from King's, and two more reams; it was shown to Eggmore, and he said "King gave me 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for it"—this other paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I got from Emmerson's.</p>

I am a waste paper dealer and stationer, of London Wall—I have bought paper in reams of Eggmore, at various times during the last six or nine months—when Lawley came, I had three bundles of paper, which I had bought of Eggmore—Lawley had it—it was similar to this before me—it was outsides of new paper—I bought it as a mixture at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per lb., but not of Eggmore—this other I bought of Eggmore at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., per lb.</p>

I had been talking about first, and then I blotted the 10 with my fingers and put 8 on the top of the two figures—I am quite sure when I gave it to the prisoner it was a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since I gave it to him the "y "has been added, and the "0"—the prisoner left the ring with me and went away with the cheque—it was then about 3.40—I don't remember that I said anything to him about the bank or the time—I filled up the counterfoil—I had to go to the Borough afterwards, on business, and as I passed the bank I went in and made a statement to the cashier—I was in the act of going to the Borough when the prisoner came into the shop, and I stopped to serve him—when he left I went up and put my coat and hat on, and went to the bank—the prisoner was not at" the bank when I got there—he came in some few minutes afterwards—my father saw the cheque before I gave it to the prisoner—T handed it across the counter, and my father took it from me.</p>

'—he said "No, she is dead"—I then asked him the ages of the children—he said one was turned four and the other was turned two—I asked him his address—he said "19, Chopping's Court, Old Gravel Lane"—I sent a constable there to ascertain the facts—the prisoner was perfectly sober—I asked if he would take any refreshment, and he said "No, not at present."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wilson, a blacksmith, of 19, Chopping's Court—the prisoner had been living there from about a fort<lb/>night before Whitsuntide—he came first with one child, the boy, and the girl came afterwards, I can't say how long after—his wife was dead—he had been out of work some six or seven weeks prior to the death of the children—on Sunday, 23rd November, at a little after 12 o'clock, I had a con<lb/>versation with him—I had seen the children alive between 2 and 3 o'clock on the Saturday afternoon, the day before, in the front room first floor—on the Sunday, a little after 12 o'clock, the prisoner came down into my room on the ground floor, to go through; he did not say anything to me—I spoke to him and said "Now Parker, you must take those children and go to-morrow, for my husband is cross, he thinks I am doing too much"—he said "I will do so"—I said "I suppose you heard him last night"—he said "A little, ma'am"—(my husband and I had had a few words about keeping the children)—he said" I will do so;" and he went on to the threshold of the door—I said "You know you are not doing quite right"—he said "I will be back in five minutes"—he never returned—I went direct up into his room, directly he went from the door—I did not see where he went—I went up to take the children some food, it was all ready for them—I found the room door shut, which was very uncommon—I went in and found the children in bed, covered over, they had only their night gowns on—I turned the counterpane back—I called out "Oh, Mrs. Moore, the children don't move"—Mrs. Moore was down stairs, she came up, and I then looked at the children, I saw the little girl saturated with blood, I put the quilt down again and came out of the room, leaving them as I found them—I did not notice the pail, only the hand basin with blood in it—I went straight up into the room after having the conversation with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>—it was not arranged that I should find food for the children and he pay me for it—he had not work when he came to us; he got to work for Mr. Knight afterwards—he had no wife—I looked after the children when he was at work—I gave them food, but I had not anything for it, because he was not earning anything—I did not agree with him that I would provide for them; when he got to work I found food for them, and bought things, and he paid me for it on the Saturday, and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for looking after them, and cooking the food for him and them—when he came down stairs on the Sunday, I think it was about 12.15, I can't quite say the time—he had always been a kind father to the children while with me; he was always very kind, but most to the little boy, he was very fond of the little boy.</p>

I am the station-master at Swanbourne, Bucks—my wife is an aunt of the prisoner's—we have been married about forty years—about the year 1848 we were living at Woburn Sands—my wife was then very ill indeed, for a long time, and she was very low and desponding, and I was obliged to have her taken away from her family altogether—she was ill both in body and mind—she was attended as an out-patient at the Northampton Infirmary at the first outset, for some length of time—she was not attended by a medical man at home at that time, not till after she had left me; she was taken violently ill in 1848—it was about six months before we went to Woburn Sands that she was an out-patient at the North<lb/>ampton Infirmary; I was then living at the Weedon Station, near North<lb/>ampton—she was brought into a very low state of body by illness, and her mind was very much wandering as well—she was never violent—she was always very strange for a length of time, until I had her taken away from me, and after she was taken away I can't say what was the matter with her—I did not have a medical man to see her while she was with me—I am not aware that there is any medical man here who did see her—I consider that her illness at the first onset was rheumatic fever—she was very ill, and she was going on in very strange language, that the house was all on fire; and she got all my children out in the road one morning about four o'clock, and was praying with them; I could not do anything at all with her; I got some of my neighbours up, and got her into bed again, and got the clergy<lb/>man to come and see her; I did not have a doctor till the next day; it was Dr. Barker, I think, that attended to her, but she was taken away the next day by her sister, Mrs. Millard, to King's Langley—she was taken away on my own account; I wrote to her sister to say what a state she was in, and she came and took her back with her to King's Langley—Mr. Moore, the clergyman of the parish, was the gentleman that had her taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Drummond Street, Euston Square, and am aunt to the prisoner—I have a sister married to Mr. Hedges—whilst they were living at Woburn Sands, in 1848, I received a communication from Mr. Hedges, in consequence of which I went down there and saw my sister; I found her in a very melancholy state; she thought that every one was interfering with her, and finding fault with her, and she took her children out in the lane to kneel on the sands and pray to the moon—she was not at all violent—she could not eat, or drink, or sleep—I took her home with me to King's Langley—she would not mind what her husband said to her—she was about three weeks with me—I took her to Hemel Hemp-stead Infirmary, and she was there three days, and when I went to see her on the Sunday with my husband, the house surgeon said that I must take</p>

               <p>her to an asylum, she was not a fit person to be there—I took her back home, and kept her at my home three weeks, and she was very desponding and very unhappy—I did not know what to do with her, and my mother took her to her own home—my mother lived in Oxfordshire at that time—my sister was then about thirty years of age—I saw her last about twelve months last Christmas—she was then very strange, but not bad—she never was outrageous to do anything—she is now at home with her husband at Swanbourne Station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate—I have seen the prisoner daily since he has been confined in the gaol, since 1st December last—I have examined his head—there is a very distinct mark on the upper part of his head, in the shape of a horse-shoe, between four and five inches long, and an eighth of an inch wide, showing that there must have been a very violent external injury—there is no evidence of the bone having been injured—it was alleged to have taken place twenty-four years ago, I think—that injury would affect the brain at the time very decidedly, and that injury to the brain might or might not continue—if deafness followed upon that injury, the presumption would be that it was the result of it—I have had some experience in cases of insanity in this gaol for the last eighteen or nineteen years—lunatics very often reason logically, but the basis of their reasoning is very often quite false and delusive—the presence of skill and arrange<lb/>ment in an act does not necessarily imply that the act-is not an insane act in itself—when the brain is diseased, it may not show itself in permanent and continuous insanity, but in outbursts of mania from time to time; that is quite consistent—outbursts of mania may occur, although usually there is some indication of madness independently of and antece<lb/>dently to the acts of violence—insanity is so varied in its form that it would be difficult to give any particular indication of what may exist prior to an outbreak of acute mania—a melancholic disposition of mind is one which very often leads to acts of suicide as well as murder, and again persons may have certain delusions which prompt them to acts of violence—I think an unwillingness to avail oneself of the ordinary and natural means of pro<lb/>viding for one's daily livelihood, is an indication—a man not availing him<lb/>self of the ordinary means of living, when he has them at hand, that is a state of things that may accompany insanity—a man may be of a melan<lb/>cholic disposition and not be capable of doing anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that a combination of these four characteristics in an act, viz., that the act is committed without communi<lb/>cation with other persons, by the man himself; that it is committed without any apparent motive; that it is committed upon persons whom he loved beyond all others; and that, immediately after this act he delivers himself up, do you think that a combination of these four circumstances is an evident indication of an unsound state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly it is—I think the last act especially, the giving himself up in despair, and with an utter dis<lb/>regard to his own safety, is not consistent with sanity.</p>

               <p>was doing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is another matter—I believe there are many acts, the nature of which they know, but they cannot control; they are the victims of delusion—I will explain what I mean; if a man destroys those for whom he has shown kindness and affection, and does not seek to conceal the act, and then gives himself up, showing a perfect disregard of the consequences of the act as regards his own safety, I think those are indications of an unsound mind; the fact of his having no accomplices I attach very little importance to; I cannot imagine an insane man having any accomplices—I cannot enter into whether it shows that at the time he did the act he did not know what he was doing, or that what he was doing was wrong—I cannot speak of the state of a man's mind when I am not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I would not go so far as to say that if a man kills his wife and gives himself up he is insane, and if he runs away he is sane—his giving himself up is not necessarily a proof of insanity—there is nothing about the prisoner to show that he is unfit to plead this morning—he has not given me any reason while he has been in Newgate to indicate that he is of unsound mind—he has been somewhat depressed, more than men usually are—I have seen him every day since 1st December.</p>

My husband is a stoker on board ship—I live in St. George's-in-the-East, near the prisoner—I have known him for the last eight years—I had his little girl for three months altogether with me, one month before her mother's death, and two months afterwards—I saw the prisoner three times during the last fortnight, before this happened—I noticed that he did not speak at all free as he used to do to me—he spoke in a distant manner, as if he did not want to have much to say to me—the last time I saw him was on the Friday, as this happened on the Sunday, but not to speak to him—I watched him the length of my two windows, and I thought he was very despondent then—he seemed to walk in such a despondent way, with his arms hanging by his side—his appearance struck me as being very much different to what it had been in former years—I had been very intimate with him when his wife died, and until he got into work—I used to go backwards and forwards, and he used to come in to me, and the tears used to stand in his eyes when he came to see the child—I said "Why</p>

               <p>Being unable to do so, and fearing I should be arrested, I took a lodging in the name of Faulkner. I ordered only one jacket for my wife, which was found among her clothes, and I thought Messrs. Shoolbred would give me credit for that. The doctor ordered my wife change of air, but being in arrears for my lodgings I could not leave. I did not ask the prosecutors to send me this quantity of goods; and being placed in possession, of them at such a critical time, I was induced to pawn them to pay my rent and give my wife the change which she required. I only expected to get one jacket, and having them suddenly put into my possession tempted me to do this. I should have returned them if I had been allowed more time, but my being taken in custody prevented my getting the loan. Of course, it was not proper; but one does not act so calmly and conscientiously when placed in difficulties. My wife is seriously ill, and I have a young family depen<lb/>dant upon me. <rs id="t18740112-124-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>my face—I put my head back to save the blow, and some one caught me by the throat and put an arm round my neck—Gagan and a man who is not here came up—my watch and chain were stolen from me by Gibson—he put his hand down to his right side, between the man and Gagan—directly the watch was taken Gagan closed her arms round Gibson and said "Come away, George, come away," and turning to me, she said "You shan't fight with my husband"—I seized hold of Gibson and he threw me down—I called "Police!" when Blore turned round and struck me at the side of the face—the constable ran up—I had hold of Gibson—I had got up from the ground then—I still held him—I gave him into custody—he began black<lb/>guarding me, saying that I was swearing falsely, and he had not taken the watch, and I was told to go down to the station by the constable—I went—I had been there about a minute when Gibson was brought into the yard, Blore followed, and began blackguarding me in the passage—two policemen came out and I gave him into custody—he said that I was swearing false against Gibson—I had seen Gagan once before, and I have no doubt that she was there—I saw her ten days afterwards at the top of Drury Lane—I walked up alongside of her to be sure she was the woman—I looked her full in the face, and went away again—I followed her into Holborn, and the first policeman I came to I gave her into custody—he asked me what I charged her with, I said for being concerned in highway robbery in Holborn, with Thomas Gibson and Blore—she said "Oh, you have only got spite against me," and she turned round to somebody alongside of me, and she said "You know I was along with you up to 12 o'clock on last Saturday night"—I don't know her sister at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth, and am in the betting profession—on 30th November, at 12.10, I was in the Strand, speaking to a female friend, the prisoner came up and struck her with an umbrella—she screamed "Murder!"—I said "Jack, you have done that for nothing"—he said "I will do similar to you"—we had some words and fought one or two rounds—we used nothing but our fists then—we all three went then across Water<lb/>loo Bridge—we all got <hi rend="italic">snagging</hi> on the bridge—a policeman said "You had better go that way, and let them go this way"—they were soon out of my sight, and I was going home quietly, but when I got across the bridge the prisoner and four or five more sang out "Here he is! I am going to do him!"—he stabbed me in the chest, and was going to stab me again, but I moved my head and got it in the shoulder—I said "If you want to fight, fight fair; you have a knife"—he said "Yes, I will have your guts out"—I went to the toll-house and said "Let me sit down, I feel sick," but the toll-man ordered me out; when I got outside I staggered down on my side, as I felt sick, and I then felt the knife go into my side three times—I saw the prisoner there, and said "Jack, you are doing wrong"—he said "Are you going to pinch me?"—I said "No, I am not going to pinch you; I shall do something else when I am well"—I was taken to the hospital by strangers.</p>
