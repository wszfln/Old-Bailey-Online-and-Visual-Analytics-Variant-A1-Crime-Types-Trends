I saw my place quite secure on Wednesday night, the 26th of June; the shutters in the front shop were quite fastened - I occupy the house - the shop is part of the dwelling-house - I was disturbed that night between twelve and one o'clock by the bell ringing - I opened my window, and saw a number of people outside - I came down stairs, and found a man named Way - I found the prisoner in custody of the police - I looked at my window, and found three shutters down; two were partly down, and one not quite down, and one square of glass broken in, that would enable a person to take any thing out of the shop very readily - a brass cock was shown to me some time after; this is it; it was part of my stock, and was in the window that night, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it partnership property? A. Yes; the dwelling-house is my own, but that cock was the property of myself and my partner; there was a great number in the window; it is one I had for a particular purpose; I think it was made some years ago for a vat; it had been laying by a long time; it was in the window in my shop - we have a quantity of property in the window - I know it by the make, and having had it on hand a long while; it laid close to the glass in the window - the place was all quite safe the night before.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty, on the 26th of June, in Whitechapel-road, near Mr. Norbury's premises, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, walking down the road; I turned my head, and observed Mr. Norbury's shutters down - I stood still a second or two, looked towards the window, and observed the prisoner, accompanied by two women, standing at the window, where the shutters were - I heard a noise of glass breaking; the noise proceeded from the spot where the prisoner was standing - I walked across the road towards the prisoner, and observed him put his hand in the window, and take something out, and pass it to one of the women - I could not see what it was - I took him into custody - he made a dreadful resistance, I could scarcely hold him - I sprung my rattle, and got assistance - the women made their escape.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On which side of Whitechapel were you coming down? A. On the opposite side to Mr. Norbury's premises - it was about twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Norbury's house to the other side of the way - I did not say I saw you take the shutters down, nor break the window - I could not take the women and you too - they did not follow us to the station-house to my knowledge - two policemen came to my assistance after I sprung my rattle- I did not see either of the women, to be able to identify them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a man in a white flannel jacket state to you that I was very much in liquor, that I was not the man; and you said, if he did not go away, you would take him? A. No; I saw no man in a white flannel jacket at all; nobody told me he was not the man; I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. From the moment you first saw him till you took him, was he out of your sight? A. No.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Messrs. Norbury. On the night of the 26th of June, I fastened the window shutters up, and the shop quite secure - I came down stairs on hearing the alarm between twelve and one o'clock, and found two of the shutters on the pavement, and one near the pavement; they were outside shutters - one shutter was shifted behind another, and the glass broken in; that glass was quite whole when I shut the shutters - I then found the prisoner in custody and alarmed my master; I had been alarmed by the bell ringing - I know this cock belongs to my master; I had seen it a few days previous - I know it to be my master's property - I have two masters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you stop to shut the shop up after I was taken? A. Yes; nobody came near the warehouse except those who were standing round - the cock could not be taken out after I fastened the window, unless it was broken in again - there were people round, but nobody could take the cock out for I was standing against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you put your shutters up? A. My fellow apprentice went inside and unscrewed the bar for me - I did not leave the window till I put the shutters up - I did not see the cock lying near the window - the policeman found it - it was impossible for me to see it where I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was time for the policeman himself to take the cock out of the window.</p>
               <p>MR. NORBURY re-examined. I left my apprentice at the shutters - both my apprentices were up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was your other apprentice? A. Along with him in the passage; the other apprentice was in the passage and went in the shop to unscrew the bar, while the other was putting the shutters up outside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at the Magpie public-house and took more than I ought - I was returning home and was stopped by two females, by the prosecutor's house - they asked me where I was going - I stopped to talk with them; in the meantime the policeman came up and charged me with taking this thing - I ask whether your lordship thinks I could go and take down the shutters without any implements - the witness said at the office, there was more men standing there, who, no doubt, were my confederates, and if they had taken them, no doubt, they would have found implements on them - I had not been there five minutes.</p>

On the 31st of May, I left my house about seven o'clock in the evening, leaving nobody in it - I came out at the street-door, which I shut - it was fastened on a kind of latch, which was its usual fastening - there is a keyhole to the street door (seven o'clock was the last time that I went out) - I returned at one or half-past one o'clock at night, and found the street door on the latch, as I had left it - I went in at that door - I opened it with a key - there is another very strong door at the bottom of the stairs, which I had left double locked; I found that door broken and wide open, and the two patent locks on it broken to pieces - close to that door on a sideboard, in the passage, there was a crowbar, a dark lantern, and I think a clasp knife, it was a strange knife belonging to the thieves - I smelt a smell of phosphorus and heard people speaking up in the first floor - I then went out at the outer door into the street; I had no light with me when I saw these things, but the gas light is so close to my door I could pick up a pin in my passage - I went out into the street and saw but one person of any kind, that was a Mr. Cohen, I said to him there are housebreakers in my house, he refused to go into the house; I then asked him to stand on the step and watch the door, and I went in search of a policeman; I found one shortly after and returned with him; I think his name is Legg - I saw Mr. Cohen, who I had left at the door, struggling with a man, apparently endeavouring to detain him, he said the man had come out of my house; it turned out to be the prisoner - I can swear he is the man - he was taken into the house; by that time another policeman had joined us, and we all went together into the house, to search if anybody was concealed in it, but found nobody - I went up to the first floor and found a trunk broken open and all the contents on the floor, tied up apparently ready to be taken away; all the things mentioned in the indictment were collected; there was a great quantity of women's apparel, and things that were in a trunk locked up when I left the house; the trunk was broken open; there was some women's bed-gowns and a silk spencer - there are two things missing, which I have not seen since - there was a drawing of Paul Sanby, which cost thirty shillings, and in the passage I then saw a sword which had been drawn from the scabbard, and was put in the passage, apparently ready for use - I had left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170005"/>things secure in different places, when I went out - the sword and all, I missed altogether a woman's silk dress and a Dresden China dog; the silk dress was kept in the same trunk, and the dog stood on the chimney-piece, on the first or second floor, I do not recollect which; the sword was in the second floor room, but I found it in the passage - when we went down in the kitchen, we found another crow-bar and the kitchen cupboard was open, that cupboard had not been locked; it is where meat and bread are kept - there is a back door to the house, it was bolted inside; the things were all my property - I am not married - the female apparel was new and had not been worn, I think not, but they were my property, and had been paid for, worn or unworn - the sword and all were mine - three or four days before I found a broken picklock in the door, and they entered, no doubt, by a false key - the picklock was in the latch, I had occasion to move the latch and it dropped out of the street door, it was five or six days before this - I mentioned the fact to the police to look out; it had broken in the lock, and they had not got in - they got in, on this occasion, by a latch key - they could not get up stairs into the other part of the house, without breaking open the door, at the foot of the stairs - the things I found tied up were up stairs, and the door split to pieces with a crow-bar, and both the locks smashed - the sword was kept up stairs in a bye-corner in the scabbard.</p>

On the morning of the 1st of June, I went to Mr. Disney's house, a little after one o'clock - I saw the prisoner and another leave the house; I am sure I saw him leave the door of the house, and Cohen seized them both; one escaped from him, and the other was struggling with Cohen when I went up and took hold of him; the prisoner is that man - I afterwards went into the house and found the inside door broken, and saw a crow bar and dark lantern laying on the sideboard - I went up stairs on the first floor and saw another door broken; I went into the room and saw different articles of women's wearing apparel laying about on the floor - I saw a trunk also which was broken open - I did not see the sword - The prisoner said he was not the man, that he had come round the corner; I am certain he did not come round the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the witness went up, he and Cohen were speaking together; he had been speaking to him all the time - the evidence is quite different to the former trial - I made a defence before, and therefore must throw myself wholly on your mercy; but on the 6th of July, one Henry Nyman was tried for burglary, and found guilty, at the conclusion of the sessions, he and seven others were brought forward, and the judge told them that in consequence of a doubt of the bills being right the court gave the benefit to the prisoners - I trust you will give a similar benefit to me.</p>

            . I am a police-sergeant. I was in Rose-street, Brick-lane, about forty yards from this house, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 23rd of June, I heard a noise like something falling very heavy on the pavement, and immediately a smash of glass - I instantly ran into Brick-lane, and saw three men standing in front of the prosecutor's shop; the prisoner was one of them - One of them was in the act of pulling a piece of lawn out of the prosecutor's window - I cannot say whether that was the prisoner; they were all three close together - two shutters were down, and a square of glass broken out completely - the moment they caught sight of me, they each drew a piece of linen from under their coats, and threw it into the road; I am certain each of them had a piece - they ran off; I pursued them, calling Stop thief! up Brick-lane into Wellington-street, across Wood-street into King-square, and there they separated, and ran different ways - I pursued the prisoner across Goswell-road, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Gray, the policeman - I am sure I saw him throw away one piece of lawn - I came back with him to the prosecutor's house, and rang the bell, the prosecutor looked out of window; I told him he had been robbed, and asked him to examine what he had lost - he went with us to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your attention was called by the noise? A. Yes - I looked as attentively as I could; I could not tell which it was that put his hand in at the window, they were so close together - there were three pieces of lawn thrown away, and it appeared to me that each threw away one piece; but I will not swear it positively, in the hurry of the moment - I did not lose sight of the prisoner for an instant, I was within a few yards of him at first, and I kept up with him all the way; I did not lose sight of him when he turned the corner - I only saw three men running - I did not see a piece of lawn in the hands of a carman - I do not recollect seeing any woman whatever; I named to the magistrate something about a piece being found afterwards in the hands of a woman; that was the piece that was found in the hands of a waggoner; I did not see the waggoner - I picked up two pieces of lawn, another person picked up one - I found the fourth after the prisoner was committed, in possession of a person in Whitecross-street, a person who lives there, he is not here - this piece of lawn was delivered to me by a young woman at her father's house, it was not found till afterwards - I ran after the prisoner about three hundred yards - I did not see anybody on the spot, there was nobody in my sight all the way I pursued - I saw two pieces of lawn thrown away and three men run away - I found nothing on the prisoner when he was taken - I produce the two pieces I saw thrown away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say anything at the station-house? A. He said, he was running after the other two men.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 23rd of June, in Goswell-road, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning - I heard a cry of Stop thief, and saw the prisoner run across Goswell-road, about ten yards before me, and the sergeant running after him, crying, Stop thief; as soon as the sergeant saw me he gave a signal to pursue; I pursued him up Ashby-street to Northampton-square, and never lost sight of him - I caught hold of him and told him to go with me - he d - d the thief and said he was gone the other way; and said, that he (the prisoner) was out of breath, but he did not mind that, he would run at any time until his legs dropped from his body to stop a thief - I said that would not do for me, and I took him to the sergeant, and then to the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many men did you observe running? A. Only the sergeant and the prisoner - I saw nobody running before that - I did not see the lawn thrown away - the sergeant had two pieces as he ran.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH DAY. I live in Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 23rd of June, between twelve and one o'clock in the night, I was in Norton Falgate, returning from Shoreditch- I was walking along in the road, about a yard from the pavement, with my hands in my pocket, and saw the two prisoners standing on the pavement; I am sure they are the men - I do not know their names - one stepped off the pavement, and knocked my hat over my eyes, and the other put his foot out, and threw me down in the kennel; and as soon as I was down, one of them put his hand into my pocket, and took my money out - I felt his hand in my pocket; I had three shillings there, and some half-pence - they were in my right hand breeches pocket - I called the policeman, who came to me directly - they saw the policeman coming and one said to the other, "We must cut, for the policemen are coming;" he said, "Here is the policeman" - they started off - both ran away, and the policeman laid hold of one of them, and took him to the station-house - I went with him - I swear I saw sufficient of them both to know them again - I had had one glass of rum, and a pint of beer, about twelve o'clock at night - I had been working hard - I had nothing else; I was muddled, having been unwell; I had been under two doctor's hands - I had never seen the prisoners before to my knowledge - I swear they are the men.</p>
               <p>Murphy. Q. What time did you give charge of me? A. Between twelve and one o'clock - only one of them was at the station-house; that was Murphy - the policeman took the other in the morning.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 23rd of June, I was in Norton-falgate; it was Sunday morning, between twelve and one o'clock - I heard the cry of Police, and on looking on the other side of the way, I saw the prosecutor laying on his back on the curb; I ran across - somebody said, "Here is the police" - the men got up from him; one ran towards the City, and the others down the Alley - there were three or four of them ran down the Alley - I saw about six men about him; they all ran away- I followed down the Alley, and took Murphy in the entrance of a little Alley which comes into Norton-falgate - I had not lost sight of him, and am sure he was one of the party that was round him, but I did not see his features - I said, "You have robbed the man;" he declared he had not; I gave him into custody, while I went in pursuit of the others down the Alley, but I did not succeed in taking them; I then came up the Alley, and received him from the other policeman - I took him to the station-house - on searching him, I found 1s. 8 1/2d. on him- on taking him from the station-house to the watch-house, he declared his innocence, and said I had taken the wrong man; I said, "Nonsense, you are one of the party;" and he said it was not him who robbed him, that it was a play-fellow of his - I am quite sure he was one of the party who were round him - the prosecutor appeared very confused, and quite insensible; he appeared frightened, for when I saw him on the ground, one or two were kneeling on him; he appeared as if he had been drinking - when he got to the station-house, he was quite correct in his statement, that was about ten minutes afterwards; the account he gave me was quite consistent with what I saw.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was at the station-house when Murphy was brought there; he had been locked up but a very few minutes before he asked to see the inspector; I asked what he wanted, he said "It is very hard for me to be locked up for nothing;" I said,"If the man is correct, you are here for something;" he said, "It was not me that robbed him, it was a person named Boyle;" that he was standing by, but Boyle was the person that robbed him, and he thought as he stood at the corner, and saw the man robbed, it would be the better way for him to walk away - he gave me a direction where to find Boyle, and a description of him; and I went down on Sunday morning, about five o'clock, to look for Boyle; I found him in a public-house, near where Murphy had said I should find him - the description Murphy gave me of his person and residence was correct; he said he lived in Cock-alley, or Boar's-alley, on the first floor, and he mentioned the number; I found his account correct - I took Boyle, and put him in a separate cell from Murphy, and then called Murphy out, and said, "Is this the man you mean?" he said, "Yes, that is the man who robbed him, it is a hard case for me to be locked up for him" - Boyle made no answer, but went into his cell - I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Boyle. Was I obliged to confess to him when I was taken?</p>
               <p>HENRY BARKER re-examined. There were about six men about the prosecutor - I am certain Murphy was one of the party; they were all round him, two or three standing up and the rest kneeling on him and nobody interfering to prevent it - I cannot say whether the prisoner were kneeling on him; the persons who knelt on him had their backs to me.</p>
               <p>Murphy's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was going home and I saw the prosecutor brought from Shoreditch by the party of men, and knocked down and robbed. I was going down the court when they were hustling about him, and I was going home when I was taken by the policeman, who said, "You must know something about it" - the inspector ordered me to be locked up on a charge of highway robbery, and in a few hours I said, it was a very hard case, and the policeman asked me, what I wanted of the inspector; I told him, and he went to look for Boyle - a young man named Dunnegan sent word to me in prison that he could not come up to speak for me without injuring the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Boyle's Defence. I wish to know when the prosecutor gave me into custody?</p>

            . I never gave him in custody at all - the two prisoner were on the pavement when I first saw them; I could see them distinctly - I did not see the other man; I was down in the kennel - I only saw the two prisoners before that.</p>
               <p>Boyle. I had witnesses here last Sessions, but it is too much trouble for them to come up again, and I have nobody to look after them - at Worship-street I called on Atfield to give me a character which he did; he had stopped me opposite Hoxton church with a quantity of linen, and asked Where I was going to take it to, I said, to Mrs. Hill, and I told him where I had brought it from, and he took me, and found everything correct.</p>

He said so after he was taken - he was quite a stranger to me - he did not say he wanted to put the things in the stable to avoid an execution - I gave the key of the stable to Mrs. Coleman to give to the prisoner - she knew him, but I did not know that at the time - I did not see him at the stable from the time he made the agreement, which was Saturday, until I missed the things - he was not at all intimate with me, nor do I think he knew I had property there, nor had the means of knowing I was going out on Monday - I have mentioned all the things taken, they would make a pretty large parcel.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How large a parcel? A. A person might take them in their arms.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you deliver the key on the 25th? A. Yes; there was no hole in the partition when I went out.</p>

            , and live next door to the prosecutor. On the 25th of May I was present when the prosecutor gave the key to the prisoner - I knew the prisoner before by the name of Shaw; I never knew him by the name of Young - on Monday the 27th of May I saw the prisoner come from the stable door with another man, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; they came from the stable door - the prisoner had rather a large bundle wrapped up in a light-coloured handkerchief; he put it in front of him, when he came from the stable - and after he passed my door, he put it under his arm, so as not to attract notice - the other man walked away with him - I saw nobody else in the mews.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner was in difficulties and expected an execution? A. No; he said nothing of the kind - he did not mention the name of Young in my hearing - I was not acquainted with him, except that he took a stable of us; he did not pay for that; it was a year and a half ago - the two men were in my sight about five minutes I suppose - directly the stable door was shut they walked by me, as I was nursing my little girl at the door - I was standing inside my door, not outside; I was standing on the sill of the door - the mews is a thoroughfare - they might have gone out at the other end, without passing me - the strange man was nearer to me than the prisoner - the prisoner had the bundle under his arm, on the further side from me; it was in a light-coloured handkerchief - I can't tell the size of it, anybody might see it - I did not notice the other man, my attention was directed to Shaw - I think he was rather thinner than the prisoner; he had a hat on,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170009"/>not a cap, they were both dressed very gentlemanly - they had not great coats on - I saw them for about five minutes.</p>

            . I live at No. 19, Berner's-mews. I have a dye-house and premises there - on the 27th of May, between three and four o'clock I saw two men come out of the prosecutor's stable door - I am certain they came out of the stable; Shaw was one of them, and he had a bundle rolled up in a light-coloured handkerchief - I saw Shaw lock the door and put the key in his pocket - the two men both turned round and walked away together - I saw nobody else in the mews.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you did not suspect anything? A. I did not; I saw him for about a minute and a half; he was about the length of this court from me- I had never seen him before, and had no conversation with him - I am confident of him, I was confident before the magistrate the first time - I said, I believed it to be him, but would not swear to him - I am now positive of him - I said he was the man and swore to him, at the office - I don't know that I have ever stated that I was not certain he was the man; I was satisfied that he was the man - I went to the station house on the Wednesday following, and saw him in custody - I said he was the man, but I could not swear to Saunders and Jones, who were taken into custody with him - I identified Shaw directly at the station-house - to the best of my knowledge I did not say I believed him to be the man, but was not certain - I knew he was the man, and believe I always said so; I swore to him at the office, and at the station-house - I have always said I was highly satisfied he was the man - I will not swear I never said he was not the man.</p>

            . I am police-sergeant. I apprehended Shaw on the 29th of May, at six o'clock in the morning - I found nothing on him - two other men were with him, who I took at the same time - the prisoner said at the office that he wrote the note in a public-house, and that it was no address - I don't know where he lives- I went to Seymour-street, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to Seymour-street - after he had explained to you about the note? A. No; I went on the Monday night - I did not show him the note; it was before the magistrate that he mentioned about the note - he said, "It is no address, I wrote it in a public-house" - there is a public-house in Seymour-street; I was not at the station-house when Jones came there - I had no conversation with him about it - Davis, the other officer, was not bound over - I locked the prisoner up, and Davis fetched the prosecutor and witnesses, but I was not present when he saw the prisoner at any time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly beg to tresspass a few minutes upon your time, while I state the facts of the case for which I now have been tried. I am by trade a gold beater; not having sufficient business to employ the whole of my time, I took the stable in question of Mr. Houldsworth for the purpose of selling horses by commission, being supplied by a relation of mine with horses. The female witness for the prosecution (and the only one who swears to my coming out of the stables) must admit that some time back I hired the stable of her, and placed therein two horses. The witness also states, that between the hours of three and four o'clock on White-Monday, she saw two men come out of the stable. She identifies me, but not the bundle, (which must have been a very large one) - neither can she identify the other man. The other witness cannot swear to me; but thinks that the bundle carried was tied up in a white handkerchief. I have six or seven witnesses to prove where I was between the hours of three and four o'clock on Whit-Monday, whom I should like your Lordship to examine. I must beg to clear up another fact which may probably place my case in an unfavourable light, that is, the taking the stable in the name of Edward Young instead of my own. The reason was because there were law proceedings out against me for a debt of £30 and the expenses; and I knew that if the place was known to be occupied by me, judgment would have been entered up. I therefore trust, that the prejudice, if there was any, will be done away by the above explanation. I can assure you most solemnly that I am innocent of the charge laid against me; not a single vestige of the articles has been traced to me - indeed the worthy magistrate discharged me on the evidence produced before him, but by the suggestion of the magistrates clerk I was committed for trial. I am a married man with a family, and have been unsuccessful in business, but a felony I never committed in my life, which can be proved by witnesses as to my character up to the very time of my being taken on the present charge. I trust, under all the circumstances of the case, you will well weigh the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution. The fact of the female witness being the only one who identifies me; she might be led to swear so, owing to vindictive feelings; the rent of the stables which I took from her not having been paid. I have nothing further to add, but that I feel confident that I am standing before an impartial Judge, and a discerning Jury of my own countrymen; in whose hands the life of a fellow creature is safe; and that I shall be allowed the benefit of any discrepancy which might have occurred during my trial.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner rented a stable of us, No. 1, Torrington-mews, and had horses there - it is a year and three quarters ago - I think it is as long as that since he left them; I know nothing of him since, until I saw him at the prosecutor's stable - he put nothing into Houldsworth's stable, I am certain - it was nearly evening, on Saturday, when he got the key; the prosecutor took it from my hand, and put it into the prisoner's hand - I was at home all day on Sunday; I did not observe any body at the stable, nor did I observe him there on Monday, till I saw him passing my door.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How much did he owe you for the rent? A. Only 16s. or 17s., I have no spite against him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did Creber go into the room with you at first? A. He did; I observed none of these things in any part of the room, except the cupboards - they could not be seen by a person going in casually; they were concealed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoners? A. Yes; I have had them in custody before for the same offence, and I believe they lived together in the room - I have no reason to suppose them married; they go by different names; I have seen them going in and out there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you had ascertained the coin to be counterfeit, was that from Mr. Field's evidence? A. No; from my own knowledge - it is so soft a metal; it is different from silver or any other coin.</p>

I am inspector of coin to the mint - I have been in the habit of seeing counterfeit coin for many years - this is a plaister of Paris mould - having on one half of it, the observe side of a shilling impressed, and on the other, the reverse side - this mould would stamp the impression of a shilling in all respects, and it appears to have been used for that purpose; I have a shilling in my hand which I believe to have been cast in this mould, it corresponds in all respects with it - here is a piece of metal which is called a get, which appears to have been made in this mould, it fits the channel; all the shillings produced are counterfeit, several of them have not been cast in the mould - here are only two which I can be positive have been cast in this mould - the half-crowns are all counterfeit; they are all the same kind of metal - the metal can be easily fused in a tobacco pipe, and poured into the mould - a small band of hat might be used to confine the plaister.</p>

               <p>Chamberlaine's Defence. One thing I have to say, that is, the landlord is wrong to what he said the first time - he said at first he had seen me frequently there, but could not say that I lived there.</p>
               <p>HENRY HACKER re-examined. I said they lived there as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Chamberlaine. Very probably the things found there were left by characters who lived in the room before me, which I could bring witnesses to prove; I did not live with Ann Hill - I only came now and then to her - I happened to come on Friday, I was playing at skittles in Brick-lane, I got intoxicated, I went to her, and remained there till about eight o'clock at night, then went to a wine-house, and returned home about one o'clock in the morning; I went to her, and was there until I was taken - Fogg said, the door was fast, it was only on the latch - it was not fastened - the lock hung by one nail - the door was falling to pieces - the pannels were not thicker than half a crown.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOGG re-examined. The door was fast, I tried it, and burst it open - I don't think there was any lock to it - I think it was bolted - I did not look at it when I got in; I put my shoulder against it, and knocked it all to pieces - I saw that there was a latch to it, and that was fast; I will not swear there was a bolt.</p>
               <p>Hill's Defence. We had not lived together, not for eight months.</p>

I only rent one room in the house - on Whit-Sunday, the 26th of May, I had occasion to leave my room, and went into the country - I fastened my room door by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170013"/>locking it, and took the key with me; I am quite sure I locked it - I have lost a silk cloak, and dress, and other articles, all of which were in my drawers when I locked my door - I put them all away safe on Saturday night, and never left the room till I left for good - the key was left in my drawer; I left the room about eight o'clock on Sunday morning - the landlord lives in the parlour, and we all use one door and one staircase - I returned on the Friday evening following, and found the door locked, I opened it with the key, and discovered the band of one of my gowns lying on the floor, near the door - I then searched my drawers, and missed a silk cloak, a silk dress, three silk shawls, one Cashmere shawl, a crape handkerchief, four silk neck handkerchiefs, six silk pocket handkerchiefs, a silk skirt, a silk body, a silk dress, a body, a necklace, a gold pin, an amber seal, two snuff boxes, a lace frill, six silver tea spoons, one pair of boxes, silver sugar tongs, three gold rings, two gold brooches, two black brooches, two pair of black ear-rings, and a pocket-book, two sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and twelve shillings in silver - the prisoners lodged in the same house, on the same floor as me; the female prisoner knew I was going out of town - she was in my room on the Friday evening before I left town - the man lived in the same room with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. How long had you lived there? A. About three months - they came there on the Saturday following the Monday that I did, which was the 25th of March - they lived in the back room, and I in the front; I do not know whether they are married - I am single, and live by tailoring; nobody could go into the room without my permission - I saw all the things safe on Saturday night, for I examined my drawers, as I wanted some things to take with me - I took the key of the room with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you worked for tailors? A. About five years - I obtained these things when I was in servitude, but I became a cripple and left service - they were worth 20l. 8s.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JESSUP. I rent the house - the prosecutrix has lived with me about three months; the prisoners have had a furnished room in my house about seven weeks, on the same floor as the prosecutrix, but in a different room - I remember the prosecutrix leaving on Whit-Sunday, about eight o'clock in the morning - the prisoners were both at home at that time; the female prisoner told me that Mrs. Allen was gone into the country; and would not be home until Thursday afternoon - she said Mrs. Allen had told her so; I had no conversation with the male prisoner about it - they hired their room at 3s. 6d. a week - the week expired on the Sunday, when I had this conversation; they left my lodgings on the Wednesday following - Willis had come home very much intoxicated on the Sunday, and I told him he must leave; he came home intoxicated about three o'clock in the afternoon, and I said he must leave my house, as they quarrelled, and he ran away on the Wednesday afternoon without giving me any notice - I had told him he must leave the house if he went on with that sort of conduct, but I had given him no notice, and did not know of his going - he owed me no rent, except for the few days - the woman left the lodging with him - I live in the house and let the rooms out separately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a family man? A. I have a wife and one child; we all live and sleep there; the man hired the apartment of my wife - I was not present; she would not allow them to come in till I came home, and then I told them, they might come in - I always considered them to be man and wife.</p>

On Wednesday, the 5th of June, I received a communication respecting this robbery, and went to Newcastle-court, Strand, to a common brothel, and found the male prisoner up, and the woman in bed in the same room; I asked the man what his name was, he said, Hutton; after some further conversation he acknowledged his name to be Willis - I told him I was going to take him into custody, for robbing Mrs. Allen's apartment in Charles-street, and that I was going to search the room; he said nothing; I told the female prisoner that she must go with me - she heard what I said to the man; I proceeded to search the room, and brought away some things which I produce; here is a yard and a half of silk, some pearl beads, and part of a gold pin - I found them in a drawer, in a chest of drawers in the room - I showed them to Mrs. Allen next morning, and she claimed them; the male prisoner said they were his ownproperty, and he could prove it - the prosecutrix picked them out from a great many other things which I had, and identified them.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ALLEN. This silk is mine; I bought it of Harriet Jessup, the landlady, for a bonnet - I lost a piece of this colour and quality, and the same quantity; it laid along with my best gown in the drawer - I can swear to the colour, and a stain on it which I had noticed before I lost it: and here is a piece of the same silk which was left behind - I have not a doubt of it; and here is a part of a pearl necklace - I lost such things, and I had such a pin; it was in the drawer, and so was the necklace; they were altogether - the pin had a head to it, which has since been taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you mean to say, you lost such beads? you don't mean to swear to these particular beads? A. Yes; they are my beads - I identify them - I don't know every one of them, but I have had them often enough in my possession - they were strung when in my possession, but are not now; they are like mine - the pin I lost had a head to it - I made this stain on the silk accidentally with my finger - it is grease.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but this W. A. is the mark that you showed to me first? A. No, it is not the mark - I did not make that - I did not know it was there before you showed it to me - here is the mark I know it by; it is a stain - I saw that before I left town; I did it with my own fingers - it was there when I put it into my drawer, on the Friday before I went out - my hands were dirty at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was this piece cut off that? A. Yes, by Mrs. Jessup.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You don't mean to swear to the beads?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170014"/>A. I could venture to swear they were my necklace; I mean my necklace was composed of such kind of beads.</p>
               <p>HARRIET JESSUP re-examined. I received this silk from Mrs. Willis, with more, to make a dress of; I sold this piece to Mrs. Allen, and cut this small piece off it to make it a yard and a half - it is the same silk, and came off the same piece - this small piece remained in my custody till after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get the silk? A. I got it from Mrs. Willis for making her a dress, instead of money - she gave it me about a week or fortnight before I sold it to Mrs. Allen - I kept the small piece, and have had it ever since; these two pieces make all that Mrs. Willis sold me - I did not sell both to Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had Mrs. Willis any more of this silk in her possession, when she gave you this? A. Yes; about 20 yards - she told me she had pawned that - Mrs. Allen gave me 2s. 6d. for this silk; the two pieces now produced once formed one piece.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PRENDERGAST re-examined. After the last conviction took place, this silk was in my possession - the letters W. A. had been put on it since that to identify it.</p>

            's Defence. I had 28 yards of silk, and Mrs. Jessup had it to make a gown for the other prisoner, she cut this piece of it from what was left, to make it level, that I might take it to pawn, and now she says she cut it off that piece.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELIZABETH ALLEN. Q. How do you identify the part of the pin? A. It is such a pin as I had, but the head is now off, and I know it by the twist - I had had it in my possession between five and six years.</p>
               <p>HARRIET JESSUP re-examined. I had 40 yards of that silk from Mrs. Willis - I used about twenty yards, for she had a bonnet and other articles - after cutting it from the dress it remained in this shape; I did not cut this piece off what I returned to her - she brought me the yard and a half with this piece joined to it, afterwards, to pay me with it, for making a dress for her; and I cut off this piece to make it even, to sell to the prosecutrix - I cut it off the yard and a half, but not off the 20 yards.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You cut off sufficient for the dress, and there was about 20 yards left? A. Yes; this cut piece was on the end of the 20 yards, and I delivered it to the prisoner - she afterwards brought me down this yard and a half of silk, and this small piece joined to it, and I cut off the small piece before I sold it to the prosecutrix, and have had it ever since - on comparing this end with what I have, I can swear that is what I cut off - she had a dress, a bonnet, a bag, and other articles made; and she brought this down to make a bonnet for myself, instead of money; and she told me in the course of a week, that Mr. Willis had taken the rest to be pawned.</p>
               <p>John Willis. That would correspond with any silk of the colour - I know nothing at all of the robbery - the reason I left the house was because Mrs. Jessup told my fellow prisoner, she owed a man named Walker in the Commercial-road a grudge, and if she could get £3 in his debt, and run away, and give her part of the property, that she would say she was gone away, and and she did not know where too - she got in debt with the man, and we left - this piece of silk was never given at all to Mrs. Willis, nor to Mrs. Jessup; nor are the beads pearl, nor the pin gold; the beads are glass, and the pin metal - she swore at the other trial they were pearl - as to the house I had only lodged there a few days, and did not know what sort of a house it was.</p>
               <p>Sarah James's Defence. Mrs. Jessup cut this piece off the piece which she returned to me, after making the dress, to make it even, as I told her it was no use - I gave her no silk afterwards; she had 4s. 6d. from me, at different times, for making the dress.</p>

I am a policeman, when I was coming off duty, at six o'clock in the morning, Mr. Kew was in Tavistock-place; he called to me, and desired me to go and take the prisoner into custody for robbing him - I went, and took hold of him, but the moment he saw Kew he said, "I was forced to do it; for I should have been taken for debt if I had not done it" - Kew said "How could you rob me when I took you to learn your business, and allowed you 7s. a week?" - he said,"I was obliged to do it, to pay some debts" - Kew said,"If you can give me an account of what you have done with the money I will not prosecute you" - he said, "I owed the chandler's shop 4s." - Kew said, "Have you paid it?" - he said, "No" - Kew said, "What have you done with the money?" - he said, "I made it last me as long as I could" - I said, "Do you deny the charge?" - he said, "No."</p>

I said, Yes, and he gave it me, and I gave him the change - he took the change before he gave me the yellow boy - he asked me if I had got the change, and he took the change and candles - I am sure he is the same person - I gave master the same coin as the prisoner gave me.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I produce a certificate which I got from Mr. Clark - (read) - it is of the former conviction of the prisoner - the prisoner is the man - he was then tried by the name of Robert Baron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) This circumstance took place on Wednesday the 5th of June, at half-past nine o'clock at night - on the Saturday following I had occasion to go to the Hampstead-road, to purchase a sugar-bason for a tea-caddy; coming from there, I met a young man, who informed me a Mr. Newton of Sussex-street, almost opposite Mr. Thompson's, had called where he worked inquiring for me, with a man like an officer; I said, "What can they want of me, I will go after dinner and see;" accordingly I went on Saturday afternooon, and Mrs. Newton said Mr. Newton was not at home; I called again on Sunday morning, and again on Monday morning at nine o'clock, as requested; and an officer crossed from Mr. Thompson's, and said he wanted me; I asked him for what, he said I should see - we went over to Mr. Thompson's, and Mr. Thompon asked his boy if I was not the man; the boy said he thought I was - I was then taken to the station-house, and one or two persons went to the little boy's house, and said they had got the man, and the boy must go with them to the station-house; when the boy came they asked him if I was not the man, he said he thought I was - I was then sent to Clerkenwell-prison, where I had not been above four or five days, when a young man was brought in for a similar offence; that is the prisoner Ogden - and on the following Saturday I was taken again to Hatton-garden office, where the two notes were compared, and both hand-writings were alike, and nearly the same things sent for on the notes, and the papers torn one from the other that the two notes were wrote on; likewise the two coins both the same, and the phrase made use of to the two boys, are all convincing proofs this is the party I am accused for - my Lord and Gentlemen, does it occur to your mind, I should go and wait within five or six doors from Mr. Thompson's house for things to be brought out of his shop, from a man who knew my person perfectly well? or should I have gone three times to give myself up, had I been guilty of the deed? I have no doubt these boys thought I was the person, because I was taken up for it, for I am sure it is impossible for the boy to know, in the short period of time that the man must have been with the boy, who the man was, and at that time of night, unless he had known him previously - the prisoner Ogden says he found the note in Thornhaugh-street, it occurred to my mind then that he said so because he had been informed I lived in this street; and hearing I had been in trouble before, I have no doubt he thought it would be laid to me - now, Gentlemen, was it possible I could have wrote that note, and placed it in that street - I was in Clerkenwell-prison when he passed the note, providing he did as he says, find the note - how very well he was aware of going to purchase a counterfeit coin, and to get things under false pretences with it; the fact is, the prisoner Ogden, or some one he is acquainted with, has succeeded in getting the goods from Mr. Thompson's, and a few days after they send a note to another shop for similar articles, but gets pursued, and he is detected; and because I have unfortunately been in trouble before, the transgression is laid on my back, which I am entirely innocent of - I am in the habit of getting my living lately by making tea caddies and work tables for several respectable tradespeople, which the policeman knows to be true, as he has been to some of them - my Lord and Gentlemen, I solemnly declare, and call my God to witness, I never knew or saw the prisoner Ogden until he was brought into Clerkenwell-prison, where I was then laying for this charge; and I likewise declare, in the presence of my God, and all present, I never knew or had anything to do with the transaction whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at home that evening, finishing a tea-caddy for Mr. Graham in Holborn - is it not a shameful thing that a child like that should be allowed to swear a man's liberty away?</p>
               <p>Jury to MR. THOMPSON. Q. How long has the boy lived with you? A. Ever since the 3rd of June, he lives with me now and conducts himself well - when he saw the prisoner he said, he thought it was the man, and the other boy said, he was positive he was - Nicholson only lives eight doors from my house - it happened about nine o'clock - it was light enough to discern a person's countenance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am known personally to Mr. Thompson; is it likely I should go to a man who behaved generous to me? when I was in trouble before he got me off with a month's imprisonment.</p>

Edward Foster was in my employ between five and six years, he had left me about three weeks before this discovery; I had not missed any thing in particular up to the time he left me - these spoons were produced to me by Mr. Attenborough, they are mine I am quite sure; they cost me about 4l. 5s., I should not sell them for that - I went to Mr. Attenborough's, and found the prisoner there - I sent for the officer, and had him searched; the officer has a list of what was found on him, it is all my property - he said he had them of

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Foster been apprentice to you? A. No; he had been in my service five or six years, and when he gave me notice to quit, he told me he was going to set up in business - the prisoner might have heard so from him - I don't know but that Foster had purchased some articles in the trade - there is my own private mark on these spoons, but there is no mark by which any other person could know that they had not been sold or honestly come by - the prisoner said he had them from Foster, and we found a great quantity of property at Foster's house - he slept with Edward Foster, but I don't know whether he knew the property was not honestly come by.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Foster tell you he was going to take Attwood into business with him? A. No; he did not say that, he had other property in his pocket - I have lost between two and three hundred pounds worth of property - Foster came to me a poor lad, without a shoe, and I had advanced him to 25l. a year wages and board; he had just become useful to me.</p>

Yes, he told me so - I did not know of his purchasing any articles in the trade; I knew him as shopman to Mr. Banfield, and have spoken to him - I saw him at Mrs. Foster's, in January - I saw a variety of goods there, but no silver nor jewellery to my knowledge; I think I can safely swear that - I saw a writing desk there, but not open; I saw no plate there - I saw no invoices of any goods; he told me he had purchased some knives and forks.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any particular acquaintance with Foster? A. No, I knew him as living with Mr. Benfield - I never was at his house but twice; the first time I was there about half an hour, and the second time about an hour and a half; Foster told me he was going into partnership with a person named Attwood, who lived with Mr. Dudderidge, of Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>JAMES DUDDERIDGE. I am a woollen-draper. The prisoner was in my service, but had left me about three months before he was taken - I paid him 15l. a year; he never told me he was going into the jewellery business.</p>

             - on the 28th of June my father left London; he had given me some information and I spoke to Crawley - our usual time of dinner was three o'clock, but we were generally a little later - on the 29th of June, I altered the dinner hour to two o'clock, and about two o'clock I sent Warren to the Old Change, with 60 lbs. weight of tobacco - while he was gone I searched the shop, and under the counter I found in a box three parcels of tobacco containing about 2 lbs. each; two of them were tied up and the other merely rolled up and tucked in at the ends; that was not a proper place for it to be kept - it is customary in our trade to have an order from the Excise for the delivery of all goods above the weight of 1 lb.; these orders are brought to the counting-house, but no orders had been brought for the delivery of these parcels to my knowledge; on finding these parcels I called for Crawley and Brown, and showed them to them - Warren returned from the City in about an hour and ten minutes - on his return I left the shop with Mr. Brealey who had come in, and to whom I had shown the tobacco; we crossed the road and stood where we could see the shop - I then saw Rainsford, whom I had not known before, come near the shop, lingering about with a blue bag in his hand, with something in the bottom of it - he went into the shop after some time, and came out in two or three minutes with the bag much fuller than it had been before - we crossed over to him and I asked what he had in his bag; he said, some tobacco; I asked if he would allow me to see it, he said, certainly; we went back to our shop, and I took from the bag two of the parcels which had been in the box under the counter - Warren was behind the counter at the time - I then looked into the box, and there was only one of the parcels left in it; I asked Rainsford how he came by the tobacco which was in his bag, he said, it was his father's stock, who keeps a little tobacconist's, and he had brought it out to sell; he wrote this direction,"

            Rainsford, 16, Cumberland-row, King's-cross;" I noticed the manner of his writing; I asked him if he came out to sell the tobacco, how he came to bring it into our shop; he said, he came in to buy some snuff - he was asked what he gave for the snuff; both he and Warren answered together, Warren said he had given two-pence, and Rainsford said, he had given a penny - I asked Warren if he knew anything about the tobacco; he said, No, nothing at all - he had not turned his back upon Rainsford the whole time he had been in the shop - no man of the size of Rainsford could have reached over the counter, and helped himself to the tobacco in the box; there was no invoice with the tobacco under the counter, which is usually given to those who do not pay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Rainsford never said he got the tobacco out of the box? A. No, he said he had tobacco in his bag, and he gave his right direction where his father lives - I do not know whether he has any interest in his father's business; this box was not the place where tobacco is usually kept, and there was no invoice or permit with it - it was cut tobacco, which is kept in casks in the shop; I have no doubt it had been placed in the box by Warren; another person might have placed it there, but he must have given it over the counter - our lads in the shop go behind the counter, the same as Warren, but the lads had been out for an hour or two before I found the tobacco; I cannot say how long it had been in the box - Warren had been the only person there for some time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know the description of tobacco usually smuggled into this country? A. Not of my own knowledge, but I have heard it is of a rank description, but this is manufactured in our own factory.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know that - have you any particular mode of dressing it in your factory? No; I believe all manufactures do it in a similar way, but this was English manufacture.</p>
               <p>Warren. Q. Can you swear to that tobacco as your father's? A. Yes, I will swear to it by its corresponding with our other tobacco, and being tied up in our usual manner - here is the writing of one of our lads on one of these parcels, which was in the box and afterwards taken from Rainsford; this is exactly the same description and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170021"/>appearances as ours, and there are hardly any two manufacturers that I have seen but what there is a difference.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Warren had access to your father's tobacco, but he was not employed to purchase any? A. No; certainly not.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Rogers. I have seen Rainsford frequently come to the shop in my master's absence; he generally came from three to four o'clock while my master was at dinner - I made a communication to my master - on the 29th of June, I was called with Brown to see three parcels of tobacco which were in a box under the counter; one of them was marked F Shag, I suppose in one of the lads writing - when Warren returned home that day my master went out - I then saw Rainsford outside the shop; I went back into the snuff-room which is parted off from the warehouse - Brown cried out, "Here he is" - I then saw Rainsford in the shop on the customers side of the counter - I could not see the inside of the counter from where I was, but it appeared as if Rainsford was talking to some one - I then saw him go out, and Mr. Rogers and Mr. Brealy brought him back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been at home all the morning? A. Yes, and so had Brown - the cut tobacco is kept in casks; I had not placed any tobacco in the box - F Shag, means fine shag; it is all cut tobacco.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What description of tobacco was that in the parcel? A. One was fine shag, and the other was returns; it appeared to me the same as that which is manufactured on our premises.</p>
               <p>Warren. Q. Have you seen any other manufacture like Mr. Rogers'? A. Yes; they are nearly the same in my opinion - I did not see you place any tobacco in the box, nor take any out; I could not see what was done inside the counter.</p>

Yes; and from having observed the character of his hand-writing, I can form an opinion of the letter; and taking all things into consideration, and considering the agitation he must have been in, there is still a great similarity.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you had seen the letter any where else, should you have thought so? A. It depends on the time that elapsed after I had seen the direction.</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir - As I shall leave home this evening to convey my mother from the country to-morrow, it will be useless your coming down here to-morrow morning as originally proposed, as I shall be from home; but if you can make it convenient to call here to-morrow evening, after half-past eleven, the old man will have left, and we can then come to a settlement; or if more convenient will meet you on Monday or Tuesday, after half-past eleven in the evening, at any place you may appoint, with kind respects to Rakeman. Your well-wisher, RAINSFORD. To Mr. Warren, 94, John-street, Tottenham-court-road.</p>

               <p>GEORGE ROGERS re-examined. Q. Did you know Warren's residence? A. Yes; it was at No. 94, John-street, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Warren's Defence. The tobacco found in the box was my property; I had bought it of a smuggler; they say that it is impossible to smuggle tobacco of English manufacture; now the tobacco that is smuggled into London comes from Liverpool and Bristol, and is manufactured in England and taken out again to get the drawback allowed.</p>
               <p>Rainsford's Defence. For the first time in my life I am araigned at this bar on a serious charge of felony, which, if substantiated, must deprive me of that which is most sacred to every Englishman, the privilege of liberty; I trust, therefore, you will bear with me while I submit my defence to your calm deliberation: having in my connexion in business become acquainted with Warren, who stated that he had some smuggled tobacco, I was in the habit of leaving orders for some at his lodging, and on the evening previous to this, I left an order for a quantity to be ready the following day; I called for it, and having paid him the money for it, I came out and was stopped by Mr. Rogers, who asked what I had got, I said, tobacco; he asked if I had any objection to his inspecting it, I said, no; he then took me back to the shop and swore to it as his father's tobacco; I ask you whether I could have been so blind to my own interest as to go in broad day light into the shop, exposed to the view of Mr. Rogers and every one in his employ; would it not naturally have been inferred that I should have chosen the evening, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170022"/>taken the most cautious steps? but I knew I had nothing to fear, and therefore I hesitated not to go to the premises: now Mr. Rogers states that he can swear to the goods by the writing on one of the parcels, which he has failed to prove to be the hand writing of himself or of any person in his employ: I feel confident that from the well known character of British juries, it would be quite unnecessary for me to claim a fair and impartial verdict; not one particle of evidence has been adduced to criminate me - in which opinion if you coincide, you will give me the benefit of it - if not, it will be my painful lot to bow to your verdict; but in that case, I implore your lordship to pass the mildest sentence which will answer the ends of public justice.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never had his keys all the time I was in his house - what he is accusing me of is quite false, I have lived with him three times; it is not very likely now that I should rob him. Witness. I never knew any thing dishonest of her before.</p>

            , he is a milkman, and lives at No. 2. Balls-pond-road; I know the prisoner by my serving Mr. Lucas with milk - I remember she called on me one evening in May, and asked me to go with her to buy a pair of earrings, which I did, she came to me again on the 12th of May - she came into my bed room and put a small bundle on the table, and asked me if I was ready, (she had before asked me to go with her to take tea with her sister, and I said, I would if I could, it all depended on my business) - on that day she came and asked if I was ready, and said she had purchased two flannel waistcoats for her father, who was troubled with the rheumatism, and she took from under them a small bit of paper with a sovereign and a shilling in; she asked me to put it into my pocket, as she had neither pocket nor purse; we then went out and walked to Shoreditch church; she then engaged a coach to go to Parker-street, Drury-lane - on the day following she came to my house again at half past two o'clock, and said she wanted change for a £10 note for her mistress - she appeared to come in a hurry - I took the note out of her hand, and said, I did not think I could, but I would send to see; I sent my girl with the note to her master, and told her to ask him for change for it - she returned in about ten minutes, but I did not see the change in the possession of the prisoner - I saw some gold on the back parlour mantel-piece; she then asked me to go with her to have a tooth out - I said, I could not; she then asked me to let the girl go; I said, she might; and the prisoner went out with her - the girl afterwards came back and said she came for another half sovereign; I took the gold off the mantel-piece, there were nine sovereigns and a half - I gave it into the girl's hand to take to the prisoner, and said, I did not wish to have anybody's money in my place but my own - I did not see her give the prisoner the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think it rather extraordinary that she should leave the change behind her? A. No; I thought she left it while she went to have the tooth drawn - Mr. Lucas has since discontinued me as a milkwoman.</p>

            . I was, at the time in question, servant to Mrs. Gibson - I received the £10 note from my mistress, and took it to the barn to my master, he went and got change at Mrs. Wicks', at the King's-arms - I took it back, and gave nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns into the prisoner's hand - she took it into the back parlour and asked my mistress to mind it - my mistress said, "No, mind it yourself" - she then pointed to the floor, and said she would throw it down - I said, "No, Mary, put it on the mantel-piece" - she put it on the mantel-piece, and took half a sovereign away, and I went with her to Mr. Bailey's, on Kingsland-green, where she had a tooth taken out, and changed the half sovereign.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised at that? A. I cannot say I was - I then went with her to a comb-shop near the Bull, at Kingsland, where she bought some combs and other things, and she sent me back for another half sovereign as she had spent the first half sovereign, and had not money enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this excite your suspicion? A. No, sir; on the Sunday morning following Mr. Lucas asked my mistress if she had seen his servant girl, and said, she had taken two £10 notes from him, and my mistress told him I had got one changed.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 8). I was at the station-house when the charge was brought; I knew the prosecutrix - the prisoner said he knew nothing of it several times, but after hearing his charge at the office, he said she gave it him to hold - he had said at the station-house that some one must have put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the reason you told her not to be alarmed, for you would protect her? A. Because she came to me, and said some of your friends had been to her, and threatened her.</p>
               <p>JOHANNA SULLIVAN re-examined. Q. Had you two handkerchiefs? A. Yes; but this one was used as a shawl - the prisoner took it out, and when I went after him, he said he would knock me down - he had it tight in his hand for about five minutes, and when I asked him for it, he put it into his shirt - he did not go out till I asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How came your red handkerchief in my hat? A. I cannot say; I did not give him any thing to hold - I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I have already been tried and convicted on an indicted, but a witness named Flanagan, who was not present at the last trial (although subpoened), is here now to state the facts, that my prosecutrix and another woman were going to fight; that my prosecutrix asked me to take charge of her handkerchiefs, which I refused, and Flanagan saw my prosecutrix put the handkerchiefs into my pocket, or somewhere near my person, of which I was totally unconscious at the time (being in a state of intoxication). The prosecutrix and the woman fought, and were turned out of the public-house. They fought on in the street, and afterwards all of them went down Golden-lane together; the prosecutrix then, for the first time, thought of her handkerchiefs, and accused me with taking them, which I denied. She began to strike and scratch me, and gave me into custody. I was searched, but nothing was found on me and, strange to say, shortly after the handkerchief was observed hanging to my jacket. My prosecutrix was so drunk at the time, that she did not recollect any thing of the transaction; and, therefore, when she went to prefer the bill of indietment, she actually asked the policeman what she was to state. Mrs. Macque can prove that. The charge has been got up for the purposes of extortion, or why did the prosecutrix wish to make it "all right" for thirty shillings? When that was refused, she said she could make more of it at the sessions; that I should get a month or two, and she should get her expences. She also asked the witness Macque to give her a silk handkerchief and four shillings. Another witness can prove that the prosecutrix said, that if I employed counsel, she would not scruple to swear any thing, however false it might be, in order to insure a conviction.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw the prosecutrix take her own handkerchief, and put it into the prisoner's pocket? A. Yes; she wanted him to hold it while she fought the other woman - he refused it, and then she slipped it into his pocket, and said he was more capable of holding it than she was; it was a yellow handkerchief - I swear I saw this woman put her handkerchief either into his pocket, or some part of his coat; I did not see any flowers - they were turned out into the street, and fought three or four rounds in the street, and she fell into the kennel; I heard her ask the prisoner for her handkerchief, but I did not tell him to give it her, as I did not like to intermix with them - after she had asked him for the handkerchief she tore him, scratched his face, and threw dirt in his face; I knew the prisoner, I had worked with him about four years ago - it was an inside pocket that she put the handkerchief into - his jacket was not buttoned; she did not ask him for the handkerchief in the public-house - they had come out and fought for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before she asked for it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going on home, and she came and caught hold of the skirts of my coat, and then came in front of me, and tore me down the face; she then went back to the Cock, where Falshaw and the other were, and then she and the officer came to me, and took hold of the skirts of my coat; I consider this only done to make a case against a drunken man, or else the prosecutrix would not go to extort four shillings from a witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to SULLIVAN. Q. Did you not go to Mrs. Macque and say, that if she would give you four shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170025"/>and a handkerchief, you would not come against me? A. No; she met me in the street, and asked me to come to her house, which I did - and they took me to a cowkeeper's house, and said they would give me three shillings and another handkerchief if I would not appear against him - I said I would not take any money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you never went to them to offer to make it up? A. No.</p>

I only recollect being at the Leopard - I was a little bit tipsy; I might send out one of the prisoners with money for gin; I did give them some - I don't recollect who I sent, but I think it was Smith; that was after I got my money from the public house; we were then in the bottom room; I don't recollect anybody being there particularly, but Thomas and Smith - I don't think we had any dinner; I will not say that I might not hand my money to one of these girls to take care of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you undertake to say that you did not hand your money over to Thomas or Smith to take care of? A. No, I did not, else I should not have began to feel if all was right.</p>

I received information on the 20th of June, that Deaf Poll was wanted; I went to Ball-yard and met Smith coming to meet me; I told her I wanted her on suspicion of robbing the captain; she said, she understood she was wanted, but she knew nothing of the robbery - I found nothing on her.</p>

            . I live in Crawford-street. I deal with Mr. Morley - I ordered three pieces of cloth of him, and the next day the prisoner brought two pieces - there was an invoice of three pieces, and a piece of muslin; I made no observation at the time - he stopped his cart at the door, and I saw him take two pieces which he brought in and said, "From Mr. Morley's, Ma'am" - I told him to put it on the counter, and I did not find out till the next morning, that one was missing; the piece now produced resembles the piece which should have accompanied the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say to the prisoner,"It is all right?" A. He came to the door and said,"From Mr. Morley's, Ma'am" - I said, "Very well, that is right, put it down;" I was standing at the door when the cart stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not standing behind the counter? A. No, I was not; my sister and three daughters were - I told you to put them down.</p>

On the 30th of May the prisoner came in with another young man - he asked for a pair of shoes - I had been sitting on a chair in the shop, on which I left my silk handkerchief - when the prisoner came in he sat down on that chair, and I gave him some shoes; I did not observe him take the handkerchief, but I missed it as soon as he was gone - he had tried on several pairs, but went away with the other man without buying; I missed my handkerchief, and pursued the prisoner - I caught him, but not the other man - I took the prisoner to the station-house - I did not call for any assistance, till they were crossing Church-street - they then separated; the other man ran down Booth-street, and the prisoner went down Church-street - I took him and said, "You have taken my handkerchief;" before I came up with him, he hastened his pace and went as fast as he could - he was taken to the station-house, but nothing was found on him - he had not money to pay for the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not stop me in the street, and say I want you? A. Yes, I held you; you was forced to stop, and I took you to the station-house - nothing was found on you - I did not state last time that I saw the handkerchief in your hand, I said I saw you hand it over to the other man just before you parted in the street, I forgot to say that just now.</p>

I remember their coming in, I got the other a chair, he would not sit in that; the prisoner sat down in the chair where the handkerchief was - as soon as they were gone I missed the handkerchief - I heard the prisoner say when he was going before Mr. Twyford, that he would not stand about half-a-crown, but let him go, and we should have the handkerchief back - I am sure he said that; I will swear it - the prisoner said in the police office, that he would not tell against his companion.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Palmer's-green, in the parish of Edmonton; I have one partner - we lost three sheep in June from Lucas'-fields, near the tile-kilns; our flock consisted of fifty, I counted them on the morning of Wednesday, the 12th of June, they were then all right; I did not count them afterwards; but, on the Thursday, my shepherd told me three were lost - I told Foster of my loss; he got a warrant, and we went the same day to Queen-street, Tottenham-terrace - I then went to a shed occupied by the two prisoners - Tuck is a butcher, and the other is a labourer; I believe they are partners - you cannot see that it is a butcher's shop as you go along, there is no window comes in front, but by looking over the wall you can see meat in the shop if the door is open; we went into this shed, and found a haunch of mutton and a side of mutton, but I should not think it had been killed the night before - we found these two live sheep, which I can swear to be mine, they had been branded with a large H on the shoulder; they have attempted to cut it out, but there was enough left for me to trace out the remainder of the H; it can be traced now - they had also a mark of red ochre down the back and over the loins - I saw both the prisoners there - the officer showed them the warrant and said he came to search for sheep, did they know any thing of them? I think they both answered No - we then found these, and one of them said, when I claimed them,"Be careful how you swear to your property" - they did not give any account how they came by them - I have dealt in sheep all my life, these are half-bred sheep; I have no doubt they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the officer went, did he not say it was to look for some sheep that had been stolen? A. Yes; and one or both the prisoners said they knew nothing of them - I have never expressed a doubt about these sheep being mine; I have always been positive of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you did not think they were yours? A. When I first saw them, it was through a glass, and seeing they were marked in another way, I said, "I don't think they are mine;' but when we got the key and went into the shed, I put my hand on them and said,"These are mine" - it was between nine and ten o'clock on the 12th, that I had seen them safe; the ochre mark on them seemed to have been done a day or thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who took the furniture out of the house? A.

No, Sir, my son has been living in London till within the last three months; since then he has lived with me except when he has been at harvest work - my son may have been in a house with Tuck - I was at home when Tuck was taken before the magistrate, (Dr. Robinson;) I did not go; they did not ask for any one to go - I saw the two sheep taken from the house on the Thursday morning; and Mr. Starkey said he had lost three sheep that morning, and he had found two of them - I said,"Stop, don't be so sharp, these two sheep were there on Tuesday morning" - I am quite sure I told him that, and he said, "What!" - he spoke very sharp to me - there were several neighbours about, but the officers were not there, they were searching the premises - I am quite sure I saw the sheep on the Tuesday - I carry milk every day - I saw the sheep on the Wednesday about four o'clock in the afternoon, grazing on the same spot; I had not seen them on the Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Lucas-field in Tilefield-lane? A. No.</p>

On the morning of the 14th of June, I left my room, locked my door, and hung the key over it, which I did every day, for the landlady to go in to make the bed, and she puts it there again for me - I went out before ten and returned about half-past nine o'clock at night - I then missed a gold pin from my table drawer, worth about 7s. - I did not miss any thing else that evening, but early the next morning I found the things in my cupboard had been disturbed, where I had secreted my bunch of keys - my boxes were still locked as I had left them, but on opening them I missed the articles stated in the indictment and some other things - I sent for my landlady and the officer - I went with the officer to Lisson-grove, where I saw my own portrait in Mr. Farley's shop, also the picture of a lady, and the interior of Lincoln College - here are some articles which Mr. Baker, the pawnbroker, produced, and Mr. Solomon brought some articles; they had all been safe in my boxes on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What is the value of the portrait? A. I valued it at 3l. 10s. - I gave 3l. 17s. for it; it was done by Mr. Burke - I do not know what the canvas is worth; these articles are marked J. W.; I believe they are all marked; this shirt is not marked, but I believe it belongs to me - there may be other shirts like it; my initials are on these tongs and spoons; I have no mark on these shoes, but I purchased them and wore them; I can swear to them by the ribbon, and altogether; they were not made for me - there may be many yards of ribbon like this - any person might get the key of the room and go in - I cannot tell who went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. What value do you place on the picture of the Lady? A. Ten shillings on the two; no one would give me that for them perhaps - I am not now married; I have been - I lived in service at General Pilkington's, in the park; and before that at

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it exceeded 10l.? A. I should not like to swear it; I think the boots cost me about 8l. out of my own pocket; I can swear they cost me 7l. - the coats were worth 2l. or 3l., I am sure they are worth 2l. - I lost 1l. 10s. in money - I have since seen the boots, and know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state on a former occasion that you thought the prisoner wrong in his head? A. Yes, he appeared as if tipsy, he really was not right, he did things so contrary to what he was told; if he was told to clean a boot, he would put a right boot on a left tree - he had occasionally to clean my horse, and if I told him to clean his feet, or to rub him down, he did not know what to do, he was so stupid - I could not have kept him.</p>

             (police-constable P 90). On Tuesday, the 28th of May, I was on duty in Hampton-street, Walworth-road, about three miles from the prosecutor's - I saw the prisoner get out of a cab, with a large bundle - I watched him, he went down Church-passage; I went round the Walworth-road, and met him opposite the church; I asked what he had got, he said a sample of boots which he had brought from the country, and he had come from North-street, Bayswater; I said I would take him to the station-house - he then said he was going to take them to No. 122, Holborn - I examined the boots, and found the name of Pearce on them - it was then twenty minutes after three o'clock - I saw nothing to make me think he was wrong in his head - the bundle contained sixteen pairs of mens' boots, and one coat, and the other coat he had on his back - I delivered them to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. PEARCE. I received the articles, they were my property, and had been safe in my dwelling-house the night before.</p>
