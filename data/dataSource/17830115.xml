               <p>Court. Who were the two, was the prisoner one? - No, Milbourne the evidence, and Stunnell who has been executed, Milbourne struck me on the thigh, and he said what is this, give us it, on which I gave him my money; I gave him three guineas, and about eighteen-pence in silver, it was all the money I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner at the bar at that time? - At the horses head, holding the horses.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - It had been raining that day, but it was a very fine night.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it? - It was a very good light.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed? - The prisoner was dressed in a light coloured coat, he had a flapped hat on I think; he stood by the horses heads all the time.</p>
               <p>How long was this about? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>He never left the horses heads? - No.</p>
               <p>Four horses, or a pair? - Two.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - He said nothing while we were robbing; when I gave Milbourne my money, another coach came up, and they run to stop that coach; the prisoner kept with us all the time they were robbing that coach; we asked him whether we might go on, he said no you shall net.</p>
               <p>How was he armed? - He appeared to have a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Appeared to have? - It was like a cutlass.</p>
               <p>He had a drawn weapon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were on the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The box is pretty high, is it not? - No, not to the common stages.</p>
               <p>When you set upon the box, and he stood at the horses heads with a flapped hat on; could you see him? - I could, because he looked up at me all the time they were robbing the other coach.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubts as to his person? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How long after was it before he was taken? - About a month ago.</p>
               <p>That was four months after the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him till he was taken? - Never.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable about him that made such an impression on you, that you could remember a man you had never seen before, at the distance of four months? - He looked at me, I never took my eyes off him, I looked at him; and I mentioned to the coachman afterwards, says I, if that fellow is taken seven years afterwards, I should know him.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him afterwards? - At the publick office.</p>
               <p>Were there other people with him? - No.</p>
               <p>He was single? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you saw him at the publick office, did you hear what he was taken up for? - I heard he was taken up, one Merchant; the coachman told me he was taken up: I was sent for to the Justices.</p>
               <p>You did not know his name before? - No, I did not, only by Milbourne who had given information of him before, and I heard he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, at that distance of time, if you had not heard he was taken up on this charge, and had you seen him any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150004"/> where else, should you have known him? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt at all as to his person? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You declared immediately that you knew him? - Yes, the Justice bid me look round and see if I knew any man there, I looked round and pitched upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Why you said there was but one prisoner for you to look at? - There was several people standing with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I understood you never saw this man before? - Never.</p>
               <p>What was the situation of the man at the horses? - He was in the front of the horses holding the reins, rather of one side, he appeared only to hold the rein of the side I stood on.</p>
               <p>You was a little frightened I take it? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Not when the man struck you on the thigh? - I just looked at him.</p>
               <p>Because you said you did not take your eye off the prisoner? - I just looked at the man when he struck me; I turned my head not a second, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>You had no curiosity to see what become of the other two men? - No, I sat looking at the prisoner, and I saw the side glimpse of them.</p>
               <p>You did not observe the other two men? - There were two in the coach, one of them came and cut at me with a cutlass; that did not frighten me.</p>
               <p>Did not you look at him? - No.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am <rs id="t17830115-1-viclabel4" type="occupation">clerk to a merchant</rs>

               <p>Now this Milbourne was the person that gave information of this man, did he describe to you how he was dressed? - No, not at all; he was dressed in a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>A great coat? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>A flapped hat? - Yes, a kind of a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - A cocked hat flapped over the front; he stood at the distance of the head of the horses the whole time.</p>
               <p>Then you swear to the face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the only thing you can swear to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that you only saw from the eyes downward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is there remarkable in that man's face? - Because he is thin, rather thin and long visaged.</p>
               <p>You could not see but half his visage, then the only thing that you took notice of was the thinness of his face? - Only his thinness and paleness.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you give any reason why you should keep your eyes fixed the whole time on this man that stood at the horses heads, rather than to the people that were at the coach doors? - Because he kept his post, and I should have been more able to have sworn to him; the man that struck at me with the cutlass, went immediately to the back of the coach.</p>

               <p>Court. Give your own account of this robbery? - We met on a Tuesday some time in August, I cannot tell the day of the month, at a publick-house near Spital-field's, where we spent the afternoon in drinking, then we agreed to go all out together, this was the first time I had seen the prisoner since he had been at sea, we agreed, he coming anew to us again to go out something further than we usually did; so we went the back way to Hagger-stone, and we saw a coach coming along,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150005"/> and we said, why would not that do now; one said it would, and the other said it would not; but we agreed to stop it, and we run across the fields to the road; then we ran out, the prisoner and Caddie were together, there were five of us, myself went to the left hand door, Stunnell I believe to be at the right hand door, the prisoner and Caddie at the horses heads, I cannot particularly say which went to which, Gray was the fifth; I cannot say how he was employed, there was not room for us all to be employed about it; I took from one of the passengers, a whole handful of silver, I believe about thirty shillings, I opened the door myself, and stood with my foot upon the step, and my head and shoulders in the coach, there were two gentlemen in the coach, I was engaged with one, and Stunnel with the other, I did not take particular notice what he did.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might you be with the coach? - We were with the coach about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe who were on the box? - After I had robbed one of the Gentlemen on the inside, I shut the door, I saw a young man on the coach-box, I said halloo, what have you got, and I clapped my hand on his thigh, and he said you shall have it, and he gave me three or four guineas and a shilling or two.</p>
               <p>Did the young man appear to be much frightened? - No, he did not, he appeared very calm.</p>
               <p>Did you observe where Caddie and the prisoner was then? - He had left the prisoner during this time, as there was another coach came by; and we likewise robbed that; the prisoner stood all the while at the horses head, till the coach went on.</p>
               <p>How long might you be robbing the witness Delaport? - About two minutes, not more.</p>
               <p>Did he look attentively at you during that time? - I had a handkerchief over my face.</p>

               <p>The fate of most of your friends is, that they have been hanged? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where did they find you, I thought you was to go out of town? - I did go out of town, and came back again, I could not get work sufficient to maintain me.</p>
               <p>I thought so, how long have you been in town? - About two months.</p>

I left nobody in the house, I locked the door, and returning for a waistcoat that I wanted, I found I was robbed of coats and waistcoats, and the door was wide open; it appeared to have been opened by false keys or pick lock keys, it did not appear to be broke; I lost nine close coats one surtout coat, two waistcoats thirty one pair of sleeves; I do not keep a shop, I <rs id="t17830115-5-viclabel42" type="occupation">buy for dealers</rs>

               <p>Court. What was the value of the whole things? - Four pound I put my hand in my pocket, and I gave her half a guinea, in the course of five or six minutes I was very uneasy to see the goods, then she called in a man and gave him a key out of her pocket, and told him to go and fetch them, in a little time the man came back, and brought no goods; he said your daughter said I suppose you made my mother drunk and stole the key from her, and that you mean to hang us all; the prisoner and me then went for the goods ourselves, she desired me to come with her and she would produce them; she told me to stop at the sign of the King of Prussia, in Salt Petre Bank, and she would bring me the goods presently; I waited, and in a very little time I was very uneasy, I thought I had lost both the half guinea and the goods; but in a few minutes the goods were brought on a man's back tied up in a patchwork counterpane; the prisoner was with him, I then missed part of my property which were not there, there were two coats missing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150012"/> and all the sleeves; I asked the man where the remainder of the goods were; the prisoner said, if in case I gave her a little time to find the thieves, I should have all the goods and the thieves to: I went home with her to her house, and took another man with me; the prisoner was so much in liquor, I let her alone till the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. You went home and left her? - Yes, when I came next day she told me, if I was to come so often she never could produce either the thieves or the goods, for my coming so often kept them away, and would raise a suspicion; when I went afterwards, she said sessions was coming on; and as I had compounded felony with her, if she went to bloody Newgate, I should go with her. I went to Whitechapel court, and gave information, the man that was with her was very rude and stripped to fight; we took her to the justice, and she produced a couple of girls, which she said brought her the goods to sell; but as she could produce no witnesses, she was fully committed, the justice would not admit her as evidence against them.</p>

               <p>Court. Can you be sure of the person of the man, never having seen him before? - I swore to the man before he was searched, before the buckles my property were found upon him.</p>
               <p>In what way did he rob you? - I had been out a little while in the evening, and as I was returning home, just as I came by Mr. Turner's stable door, one man passed me and stopped, I then suspected my danger, seeing this man and another appear at the same time, there were three men in the whole; I was going to pass them, they offered to give me the wall; I saw the prisoner jog the other man with his elbow just as he was a-breast of me, and the other man jumped behind me, and this man before me, each of them put a knife to my neck, saying, you bugger if you speak a word, your head is off that minute; I told them, says I, gentlemen I will not; with that, this man asked me what money I had, I told him I had but one six-pence, and one crooked farthing, he asked me where it was, I went to put my hand into my pocket to take it out for him, and he pushed my hand away and took it himself; then he spoke another word that I really did not understand then, but I soon understood that it was to see if I had a watch; I told him, the 31st of July last I lost a watch, and I had never a one; he asked me what I had got here: I had a pair of buck skin breeches with leather strings; then he went down to my shoes, and says, what are these? I said they are a pair of plate, in my fright that I was in; says the prisoner that is what we want, I recovered myself from my fright, and says I, gentlemen they are only plated; nevertheless he took them out of my shoes; then he arose from my feet, and clapped his knife to my neck; the other man every now and then jogging his hand to appear to be in earnest: after that says the prisoner at the bar, now says he if you do not swear by the bible, that you will not speak a word about it for half an hour, I will cut your head off now; I said I would not; the other man said to him give him the six-pence, he said he would not: after the prisoner with

               <p>Court. Did you see the glasses in the watch-house? - No, not till they came to the Rotation office in Litchfield-street. (The glasses produced and deposed to.) The man was taken from the watch-house to the office in a coach, and the glasses too, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to the glasses! - Only that they fit the frames.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at them, and see whether you can take upon you to swear to them. - It is hard swearing to glass, but I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing before the justice? - He said, he had them of a man at the end of Welbeck-street to put them in frames for him, a man that was going into business.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these glasses of any uncommon size? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Are they the exact number that your master lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - He was taken up about five in the morning, in Charlotte-street, near Portland-street, that is not far off.</p>
               <p>Court. How many streets distance? - Just across Portland-place a little way.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Then all that you know of this matter is, that the sheep that you saw had the same mark that your sheep had? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Many other people may have the same mark as well as you? - Yes they may, but they have not, every farmer has his own mark.</p>
               <p>Then you could not have sworn to them to be your sheep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, merely by the sheep? - Yes, and by the countenance of the sheep, and the colour of them.</p>
               <p>That is another thing? - It is very clear that they were my sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I think you say of your own knowledge you did not know how many sheep you had? - It is impossible, if you doubt any thing ask my servant who did tell them.</p>

               <p>Was there any track of a cart in your grounds? - No, there was the track of a horse, the cart came just by the gate; it was some distance by the seem of it, where they landed the sheep.</p>

               <p>"Damn me says he, I will go into London and fetch a cart and horse, if you will go along with Oakley and take a walk and come back," said he would go to London and fetch a cart if we would go and steal some sheep, he left us, and just as we came up to the turnpike gate, we saw Phillimore and the butcher; the butcher was driving the cart, they took the horse to the watering trough at Padington, we went into the house and called for a quartern of gin, we drank it and Phillimore came in, and he had a glass of gin, he paid for it, we went out directly, the butcher drove the cart along the Harrow on the Hill road, Phillimore said, get up into the cart, and he drove it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150020"/> as far as the sign of the Plow, up the Harrow on the Hill road, and he turned the corner round the lane, away for Kilbourn, before we came to Kilbourn, he stopped and drove into a field on the opposite side of these sheep, and tied the horse to the hedge; we went into the field and brought the sheep into a corner, and caught six sheep and tied their legs, Phillimore went and fetched the cart, and Jennings and Oakley lifted them upon the rail, and I carried them to the cart, and Phillimore put them in the cart and drove away; I went into a Chandler's shop to get some small beer, the butcher and Oakley came running by and by God, the cart is stopped and Phillimore is taken; Oakley said, says he, I will go back and see what is become of him, they do know me; we went and staid at a public house, and in about half an hour Oakley came to us, and we agreed to meet at the Cock in Tottenham Court Road, on Sunday morning at seven o'clock, but we could hear no tidings of him; I went home till about ten at night, I was gone to bed, and there came three men and took me from my wife and three children; they told me that the other men were evidence against me, and would hang me.</p>


               <p>Prisoner Phillimore. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Phillimore brought two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to Oakley, I have not called on him to make any defence, there being no evidence against him, but that of Compton alone, who is the accomplice; there is no one circumstance proved by any witnesses except Compton, which connects Oakley at all with his business. The evidence of an accomplice alone, the wisdom and justice of the law will not permit to convict any man, an accomplice not being in contemplation of law, or of common sense, so deserving of credit, that for his sake the life of any person should be taken away; and therefore, though the law does not wholly reject such evidence, yet it takes a middle course, and will not suffer that to be the only evidence on which a man is to be convicted; but only to explain or connect circumstances which are left to the jury.</p>

Why, was it new? - Yes, quite new: about three o'clock on the day I lost it, Justice Walker sent to me to know whether I had lost a seat; the prisoner at the bar was taken, my foreman looked round the shop and missed this seat; I went to the Justice's at six in the evening, and saw it was my property.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it? - I know it by the cloth and the lace.</p>

               <p>What things did you find on her? - Nothing at all; the cloaths were all flung on the three pair of stairs, they were loose; the prisoner said she wanted one Mrs. Platt, and knew nothing of the things, nor had been in my room.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner in the lump room, where the fine sugar lays, twice, about seven in the evening, and there he put the lamp into a basket, and put it by the pully hole.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Are they not all Germans in your masters house, but the prisoner at the bar? - All but the prisoner, and one more.</p>
               <p>Had not you a quarrel with the prisoner as well as Sherman? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you explain the situation of the warehouses yourself? - They are two different buildings, under distinct roofs; the sugar house, where the goods are deposited, is a compleat building of itself; the lump room is up one pair of stairs, the mill warehouse, is a building that adjoins; underneath the mill warehouse, there is a cellar where the mens necessary is: there was a lump of fine sugar in the bag, weighing about 25 lb. it was our sugar: I questioned the prisoner about it, and he denied knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You would have done better after you had this hint, if you had waited to see whether the man carried this lump away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he go without his shoe? - I gave him an old slipper of mine, and he was to call again: at the end of the compter, where he stood to try on the breeches, there was a pile of goods, and some mourning, and other goods; about an hour and a half after he was gone, I went to take the suit of mourning home, and I found that the waistcoat and breeches had been drawn out: I said to my man, while this man has been amusing you to look for his shoe, he has stole this waistcoat and breeches; I sent him round to the pawnbrokers, and in the Minories; the same evening, we found the waistcoat and breeches were pawned by two men for 14 s. I gave the 14 s. and took them away as my property; I told the pawnbroker to send for me if the two men came again. On the 4th of this month, on Saturday in the evening, he sent me word the two men were in the shop that pawned the waistcoat and breeches, I went, and saw they were the same men that were in my shop when they were lost: I am sure of that now.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoners seem to have any knowledge of each other while they were in the shop? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they go out together? - No, Wells went out first.</p>
               <p>Did you charge them with it when you saw them at the pawnbrokers? - I charged the peace officer with them, and took them up, they did not say any thing: the waistcoat and breeches are in court; they have been in possession of the gentleman they were made for; he is not here, but I know they are the same, because they were all dirty, for the prisoner Foy shifted them into his pocket with his shoe.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; the waistcoat and breeches were brought to my shop by the two prisoners at the bar, on Saturday night the 21st of December, between five and six; the prisoners were together; Foy pawned them, the other was behind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wells. Do not be too sure Sir, mind you are upon your oath. - I think it was the other prisoner, but I am not quite sure; he stood behind and it was rather dark; I think it was him, he stood behind in the dark; the shade of one man, makes the other not so plain to be seen at candle light.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Should you know the things again if you saw them? - I took particular notice of the breeches when I delivered them, by a round spot of dirt; and the lining of the waistcoat is dirted, as having dropped, (looks at them,) here is a round spot; they are the same; I know the breeches more particularly than the waistcoat; I did not take such particular notice of the waistcoat: the same evening Mr. Ubley came and redeemed them: Foy said he had just bought them.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. You expected to be here as a witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And therefore put no mark on the things? Yes, there was the mark of mud.</p>
               <p>You never saw any mud on breeches before? - Yes, but this is a particular round spot.</p>
               <p>You are often a witness in courts of justice? - Not often.</p>
               <p>Once in a sessions; you will know better then for the future. - I never wish to know what will effect the lives of men, more than the truth.</p>
               <p>You did not know these men before? - No.</p>
               <p>How long were they in the shop? - Not ten minutes; their were other people in the shop; if you have ever been in a pawnbroker's shop, there are little closets like.</p>
               <p>No I never was. - Every man has his box, or it will hold two, I believe it would hold three.</p>
               <p>It will not hold two in front, I suppose? One man in front, and a little side view behind.</p>
               <p>Now, this business was not long with him? - Not a great while.</p>
               <p>You looked at them, and saw they were new; how much were they worth? - I do not know how much they were worth.</p>
               <p>Yes, you must? - I knew they were worth 14 s. I asked them their names, and where they lived.</p>
               <p>Then the only opportunity you had of seeing these men, was in this little snug<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150031"/> box, and one behind the other? - I had no other opportunity.</p>
               <p>Court to Ubley. Do you know the persons of both the prisoners? - I know they are the same men that were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Wells, to make you take particular notice of him? He stood near the door, I did not speak to him.</p>
               <p>Are you positive as to his person? are you positive they are the same two men? - I found these two men at the pawnbroker's, these are the same men that I saw there; I am sure Wells is the same man.</p>
               <p>Court to Rookes. Do you know the person of Wells, in particular? - Yes, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Your attention was taken up with Foy? I had attention on both, as I was dealing with both.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wells's Council. Do you take notice so much of every man that comes to your shop, so as to swear to him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What, do you mean to tell the jury that you take such particular notice of every man that comes into your shop? - I know the prisoners by their features.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing remarkable in that man's features? - I know them to be the same persons that were in the shop.</p>
               <p>How long had you conversation with them now? - They might be in the shop two minutes.</p>
               <p>And never saw the men before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And these two men never spoke to each other? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor took the least notice? - No.</p>
               <p>Who has told you to be positive now? No one has told me to be positive, I need not that caution.</p>
               <p>There was nothing to fix your attention? Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Had he his hat on or what? - Both their hats on.</p>
               <p>Hats taken off? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it day-light? - Yes, Sir, it was daylight.</p>

               <p>I am a coachmaker, I was going into the city last Monday with Mr. Davies; and on Mutton-hill we met the prisoner, and Mr. Davis said there is the servant that robbed Mrs. Adeane; and he said he would go for a constable if I would dodge her; he brought a constable and she was apprehended; after which we went to the houses and found the different things by her own direction; some were found on Clerkenwell Green, at Mr. Lowes; some in Leather-lane, and some in the Strand; and at the corner of Stonecutter-street, Fleet Market, there we found a variety of things.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. What is the value of these three silk gowns: - When she took them from me, I valued them at three guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. Why the pawnbroker says one of them was not worth much more than 5 s. And five yards of flannel there was that was found.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem very eager to have this prisoner capitally convicted, which you need not, there is no reward in this case: Can you swear to flannel? - Yes, my Lord, I can produce more of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any private mark on it that you know it by? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any promise made at the time when she told you where things were? - No, my Lord, none at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the subject matter of your consideration, is the three gowns, one of them is pawned for 5 s. There is no doubt at all about the guilt of this woman as a servant, she certainly betrayed her confidence: This indictment is is laid for stealing goods in a dwelling-house above the value of 40 s. Here are only three gowns proved; one of which was pawned for 5 s. and the pawnbroker says it was not worth much more; therefore I think you may reduce the value to 39 s.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of December, about seven or a quarter after I met the prisoner in Turnmil Street with a hamper on his back, I asked him what he had there, he told me, what was that to me, it was Pork; I asked him where he got it, he said from the Borough; I said I thought he could not bring such a load as that from the Borough, I saw this direction upon it, I took the man into custody, and carried him before a magistrate; I opened the hamper to see the contents, and found a letter in it, the magistrate ordered me to go to this Mr. Yarrol's to see whether they had any property to come to town.</p>
               <p>What became of the hamper itself at that time? - I have it in my custody.</p>
               <p>Ever since these letters, were in the hamper and this direction upon it, (The letter and the direction handed up to the court) what account did the prisoner give of himself? - He said he had brought it from the Borough, that a man had given it to him.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of the hamper, a man asked me to carry it for him, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble I was only come up from Gravesend on the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Court to Crana. Do you know the direction that was on that hamper, if you see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at it? - This is the direction that was on it.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose writing it is? - No.</p>
               <p>You can read writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaacs. Is that the same direction you took off the hamper? - Yes; the Pork was ordered to be restored to the party, being a perishable commodity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses.</p>

            : A house that we rent in a court, was broke open the Monday before Christmas day, and we lost the things mentioned in the indictment; the house was shut up, nobody lived in it at the time that the things were taken: they were little tenements that we rent, and we let them out by the week, and the people were gone out of it: about six o'clock the watchman came and said I was robbed, and the prisoner Shipley was with him, and she said, if I would not be angry, she would tell me where the things were, so I went with her, and she shewed me; and the watchman took custody of the things. (The things deposed to.) I told Shipley I thought she used me very ill; she said she did not think any harm in it.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you make her any promise to induce her to go? - No, none at all: she shewed us a wrong place; then the prisoner Shipley went voluntarily, and shewed us the place; then we went back to the watch-house, and the old woman asked Pearce where she had the things, and she said about five yards off where she met her first: the first things, the old woman said the young woman had by herself, and the next things the old woman said, she went into the house and put out the bed to the young one; she said she thought they were Pearce's own things, and Bane said they belonged to her.</p>

               <p>My wife opened the door that leads into the shop, with one hand, and had hold of that woman with the other; she said, here is a pretty jade for you; she said, do not you see she has stole your breeches; I looked then, and saw the breeches drop; then it struck me immediately about the bank note, which was sent to me just before I went to bed; I looked for the note, and pulled it out; I said, you jade you would have had a nice Christmas if you had got this: we took her to the Rotation office; then I missed my stock and stock buckle, which I found upon her.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the note here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(The note produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do no not imagine that she knew any thing of this note, being in my breeches pocket when she stole them.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of the woman? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>What might the value of the other things be? - Under 10 s. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They never took them from me; I was going up the street, and I met a woman, she asked me where I was going, I said, up the street, she said, would I go with her; she said there was a servant maid owed her a little trifle of money, and I went down there with her; when she came out again, she came in a great hurry, says she, keep that stock and stock buckle, and stay till I return; I staid there about two minutes, and then this gentlewoman came out immediately: I am entirely a stranger in London.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of December last, a servant of mine came down and informed me I was wanted in my work-shop; my foreman acquainted me with his suspicions of the prisoner whom he had stopped; I sent for an officer, and ordered him to search him; I was present while he was searched; there were four ounces and a half of silver, in a state of working, not finished, nor unfinished.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any thing in this silver that enabled you to know it? - I knew none of it.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - His father worked with me three years, and he was apprentice to his father at that time.</p>
               <p>How has he been employed lately? - He has a mother; his father died last December was a twelve month; I believe he has been in a gentleman's service since.</p>
               <p>Was he working with any body at the business at that time? - Not that I know, I have no particular knowledge of the silver; I gave charge of the prisoner, he was taken before the sitting Magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have known this boy some time? - Three years.</p>
               <p>Did not he several times come to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had a free intercourse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he inform you that he was out of employment, and should be much obliged to you to get him into employment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you at different times told him that you would exert your self in that way? No sir, I deny it; the boy came backwards and forwards: I employ near 40 men.</p>
               <p>Whether this young man did not when you saw him, make application to you to get him into some honest employ? - Once I allow, I never gave my promise more than once.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand when that boy came again, it was for that purpose? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>- FULLER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am foreman to Mr. Bateman, the prisoner came to me, the 20th of last month, between four and five, he brought a silver seal in his hand and applied to me to know if I had one by me that I could finish the while he staid about that size; having one by me of that size, I did it while he stopped, except the polishing which was not my business; I saw no more of him that evening after he was gone, as his unbecoming behaviour in the shop, caused a general suspicion.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us know what that unbecoming behaviour was? - Such as putting his hands where they file their linnel and turning it about, which was taken notice of: he came again on the 21st, I asked him whether he had got his seal polished, he said no; the polisher was not in the way then, but he should get it done; I saw him advance towards the box where we keep sundry articles of silver, in an unfinished state, this box stands against a window, which gives light to the place where the pack up their working boxes for their country connections; I left the shop of work, and went into this packing place, and close to the window I stood and saw the prisoner put his hand in that box sundry times, and take it out again and put it into his pocket; I could not see what it was; the prisoner moved from the place, and bid the men of the shop good night; I went down stairs before the prisoner, and went to see for the prosecutor; but he was not in his compting house, I then asked the prisoner to go up again as Mr. Bateman, wanted to speak to him which he did; I sent for the prosecutor, and when he came up, he sent for a constable and searched him, there was found upon him four ounces and half of silver, which had been in that box.</p>
               <p>I knew the working of the silver, the prisoner said, if the prosecutor would go into another room, he would speak with</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150044"/>him; the prosecutor said, no, he should be searched there; he then begged for pardon; the prosecutor said, he should trust to the law for that; then the prisoner said, if you will not do your best, you may do your worst.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have known the prisoner some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has had frequent access to this house backwards and forwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And without any degree of suspicion? - Yes, Sir, for me.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to intimate by that, that there was any suspicion in the house? - No, Sir, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>On the 21st the seal was finished? - No, on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Then down to the 20th or 21st, you never had any reason to suspect the prisoner's honesty? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>You described a very extraordinary curiosity in looking over the different things in the shop? - Handling them.</p>
               <p>Is that a curiosity very extraordinary? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do not you think the same curiosity would have fallen upon me, or any other man in this court that had come into your shop, to have taken things up, and to have looked at them? - I do not think it would; where there is a great quantity of silver laying about, it causes suspicion.</p>
               <p>If any other man had done that, would it have given you a suspicion that he was a thief? - It might.</p>
               <p>You spoke of a box that had some silver in it? - I suppose it might have a hundred ounces, or two hundred; it has had three before now.</p>
               <p>In what state was that silver? - It is silver in an unfinished state, in all degrees, some forwarder than others.</p>
               <p>Did not that box contain silver in your shop, in the same kind of state that all boxes would contain silver in another silversmith's shop? - It might, or it might not.</p>
               <p>Then I should suppose if another silversmith's silver was examined in your box, it would be impossible for you to make a distinct severance? - No, Sir, every man would know his own silver.</p>
               <p>Can you then swear to this silver? - Part of it I can.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner take any part of it yourself? - I saw him put his hand in this box, and take it out, and put it in his pocket; I could not discover what he had in his hand when he put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion when he put his hand into the box, and put it into his pocket, that he was doing what was wrong? Yes, Sir.</p>

            , of Russell-court, Drury-lane; I knew nothing of Robbins at that time: I gave him sixteen guineas for the note, I kept the note some time in my possession, and on the 7th of November, I sent it down with some other money and notes to my bankers, Mr. Drummond's; subsequent to that, and previous to the note becoming due, the prisoner had applied to me for other money, which I lent him on other securities, and in the course of that business he asked me where the note lay, I did not tell him at first, for he said, that Mr. Robbins was a very good man, and generally sent to take up his notes as soon as they became due, if not before, in order to prevent trouble: this conversation was subsequent to my having sent the note to Drummond's, and previous to its becoming due; I told him it was a matter of no consequence where the note lay; but the second time I told him it lay at Drummond's; as the note was out of my hands, I did not take any particular notice when the note was due; but on the evening of the 26th of November the prisoner came to me, and requested me to let him have some more money on another note, he then had been in the publick house, which he had taken some few days, he had then had a good deal of money of me upon some notes, and upon a judgment; I told him, I could not let him have any more, he seemed very desirous and pressed me very much; he had had some beer of me to the amount of five or six pound, he would have paid that out of the note, if I would have given him the difference which I thought rather odd: I saw no more of him till he was taken up: the note is satisfied under the bond and judgment, so that I have no claim on the prisoner, nor on Mr. Robbins.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain more particulary how the note is satisfied? - Nothing has been done but what is in the strict line of business; it was a bond for eighty pound, and the judgment was given for double the the penalty of the bond.</p>
               <p>In what way did you conceive the note was satisfied? - The bond was given for one hundred and twenty pounds, it was the sum that he first had of me, but it was returned again; the lease was understood to be for fourteen years, when that agreement was made, and it was afterwards understood to be only for seven; there was a differance meant to be made (but only these things came so fast one upon another) declaring, that though the bond was for one hundred and twenty pound, yet there was only eighty pound lent.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was that bond given prior to the note? - No, Sir, subsequent, I have not the least resentment or severity against the prisoner, very far from it; I stand here in a very disagreeable situation that my evidence should affect his life.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the bond given? - Between the time of discounting the note and its becoming due.</p>
               <p>Court. How much money was actually lent on the bond? - Eighty pound, exclusive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150047"/> of this note; there was some other money that was due on other notes, which I shall say nothing of at present; the money that was levied was not sufficient to pay my demands wholly; I let him have twenty pound on another note and twenty-five on another note.</p>
               <p>But what sum exclusive of these two notes was advanced on the credit of the bond? - Eighty pound, he had engaged to give one hundred and twenty pound for the lease, and that sum was at first meant to be advanced on the bond; it was actually lent, but it was returned again in a day or two; besides the eighty pounds lent on the bond, there were two notes one for twenty pound, and one for twenty-five pounds and some odd shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon failure in payment you took out an execution under this judgement? Yes.</p>
               <p>What was levied under that execution? I do not exactly recollect the sum, my Lord, I was not prepared for that information, it will not be sufficent to pay every thing.</p>
               <p>Will it cover the whole sum of one hundred and twenty pound? - Not with the expence and every thing.</p>
               <p>Was it above one hundred pound? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The other two notes were not paid then? No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What became of the sixteen guinea note afterwards? - It was returned to me upon the day after it was due, the 27th of November by some of Mr. Drummond's people, then I went with the note to Mr. Robbins and it was not paid.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. What did Mr. Robbins say.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot take what he said; all that we can take is the fact of Mr. Robbins refusing to pay this note.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. I think you say that you received a bond and a power of attorney to confess a judgment from the prisoner a week or ten days before this note became due? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That bond was for one hundred and twenty pound, and the warrant of attorney for double that sum? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think you said that all the money that the prisoner received from you before that time was eighty pound and sixteen guineas? He had received one hundred and twenty pound when the bond and judgment were given which was returned, and eighty pound afterwards advanced, so that at the time he had given me the judgment he had received one hundred and twenty pound and sixteen guineas; so that the sixteen guineas never were meant to be included in the one hundred and twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Had not you a transaction with the prisoner about the purchase of this lease? - He deposited the lease in my hands as a security.</p>
               <p>Did not you actually agree for the purchase of it? - No.</p>
               <p>The lease was deposited in your hands as a security? - There was no regular assignment of the lease, there was an agreement.</p>
               <p>But you thought of the value of it, and the value of it was considered between you and the prisoner? - Yes, or else I should not have lent my money to a stranger.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - He was to give eighty pound for it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean, Sir, considering it as a lease for seven or fourteen years, to be of the value of eighty pound? - For seven years.</p>
               <p>Is it not a lease for fourteen years, at the determination of the tenant, not of the landlord, but of the tenant? - Both I believe; it is certainly determinable at the option of the lessor, I am sure of it, because application was made to the landlord to continue it for the whole term, and if he would give his word, that the lease should stand the whole term, Godfrey would give the one hundred and twenty pound.</p>
               <p>What does your whole demand on the prisoner amount to? - The amount is not entirely finished.</p>
               <p>Of what you have actually advanced? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150048"/> I do not exactly know; I have no with to keep this business any secret; so far from it, that I gave the prisoner's wife an account some time back.</p>
               <p>Court. As you put it in such a way that you were satisfied for this note; I thought it my duty to enquire how you were satisfied, - I was satisfied in that way, under that judgment.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect the whole of the sums advanced on all the securities together, to this man? - There was the 16 guineas, the 80 l. and the 20 l. the 25 l.</p>
               <p>Was there any part received from the prisoner, except what was levied under the execution? - No, I never received a halfpenny from him in my life.</p>
               <p>Is the lease in your possession now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is in possession of the house? - One Blazon.</p>
               <p>Then you now hold the lease of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides what was levied under the execution? - Yes, the lease was sold under a bill of sale by the sheriff.</p>
               <p>What, under your execution? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. What was the lease sold for under the execution? - Sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>And purchased by you? - No.</p>
               <p>Purchased for you? - I have it now.</p>
               <p>What did the goods appraised come to?</p>
               <p>Perhaps Mr. Godfrey has the account, I gave it him</p>
               <p>He has an account; it is very odd you cannot recollect these sums? - It is not odd at all, I was not prepared.</p>
               <p>Was the goods appraised at 57 l. 10 s.? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>What other sum was it? - Forty-nine pounds, as I heard; the goods were appraised to Godfrey at 57 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the goods bought in for you? - They were bought in by a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>For your use? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The licence, what did that cost? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have it now, or your representative? - When I sent to Godfrey for the licence, I sent two guineas to him, codering his situation.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. We had better proceed to see whether there is any evidence respecting this note; you shall have the liberty of calling this witness again.</p>

I wish now to enquire more particularly, with suspect to the securities you have in your hands, at the time this note became due: you had a bond for 120 l. the penalty of which, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150050"/> double the fund; and the lease deposited as a collateral security; and you had, besides the other notes for which you had advanced cash, one for 20 l, and the other for 25 l. are those notes still unsatisfied? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, under the execution, you say the goods sold for 49 l. and the lease was bought in at 60 l. that makes 109 l. the lease was valued at 80 l. that makes 129 l. and the goods at 49 l. were brought in for your use. - There was another judgement entered up at the same time that mine was, and part of the money levied, went to Mr. Gillies; he had taken a judgment prior to mine.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of that? - Eleven or twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have stated the goods to be 49 l. and the lease 60 l. what did the gage bill amount to? - The money that I actually received, at the time the present tenant went into the house, was, 99 l.</p>
               <p>I want to know what you received under the execution? - I received nothing, but what I received under the execution.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It turns out, that these several sums nearly cover Mr. Johnson's demand, that may be taken to be the fact; the operation of it is a subsequent one; it happens, that eventually the securities have turned out sufficient to satisfy Mr. Johnson's demand, whether they would have done so or not, is another question.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say at present my Lord.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I attended the examination at Guildhall, and Mr. Alderman Sainsbury desired I would compare the lead with the premises to see if it was the same, and I found it corresponded exactly; there was a place where it was taken from bare, it had been lately taken out; it was one entire piece when laid on, and it had been cut in two.</p>
               <p>Was the shape of the place where it was taken from so particular, that another piece like that would not fit it? - It fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>But would not any other piece of lead of the same measurement have fitted the place? - It might.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing indented? - There was a nail hole where it had been fastened; they corresponded exactly, it was certainly taken from there.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; about a quarter past three on the 17th of December, going by the end of Cock-lane, one of our patrols called to me, and said, a suspicious character was just gone in: I went up stairs, and on the right hand I saw a light in a room, I pushed the door open, and found the prisoner undressing himself, he said he was going to bed, and a quantity of lead was in a basket; I said, what have you there, and he said, only luggage; I took him to the watch-house; the basket was close to the side of the bed, no other person was in the room with him; the house belongs to one Adams, at the Fortune of War, it is let out in separate tenements; the prisoner said, he did not know how the lead came there.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrols; on the 16th at night about 11, I received information of three people having something very heavy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150052"/> and having gone into this house; at a quarter past three, I saw the prisoner on a landing place up one pair of stairs, with a candle in his hand, I said, my friend, are you going to set the house on fire, he said, yes, what is that to you: I drew my cutlass and called the constable, and we went up stairs, and the prisoner was sitting on the side of the bed, and a basket stood close to the bed, and the constable asked him, what he had there, and he said luggage.</p>
               <p>Did you see him have any thing on the stairs, when you first saw him? - Only the candle.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Whose possession has the lead been in since? - The constable's.</p>
               <p>To Taylor. Has the lead been in your possession ever since? - I left it at Guildhall in a closet in the magistrates room: it is the same, I marked it.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. How long have you known the prisoner? - He has worked for me about a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Has he any hurt in his head? - I have heard him mention it.</p>
               <p>Has he ever been indisposed or disordered with it? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, only I served my king and country in America for seven years, and I got this shot in my head; a woman got the lead at Cheapside; I have lodged with her this year and half: this gentleman came in, in the morning, and I being in bed, I whipped out of bed, that made the gentleman see me on the landing place. I have no witnesses, only my discharge can prove my honesty, if I was a rogue or a robber, I should not be recommended to the board; I am willing to serve my king and country again, I am sure I am innocent of this affair; the woman that had the lead is my father's own sister, she is in Newgate; they can prove nothing of my bringing the lead to this house; she is not indicted yet.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, this robbery is of a particular kind; it is a constructive, and not a direct taking from the person; the goods were not in the direct personal custody of Mrs. Ellis when the prisoner took them; but they were in her presence, and under her protection: and it has been held, that where the taking of goods, in the presence of a person, has been the effect of the antecedent putting in fear, that shall be confined as a taking from the person; as for instance, where a man is stopped and desired to throw his purse on the ground, there is not a doubt in that case, because, there he actually parts with it in fear: here is also the additional circumstance of the prisoner's having a concealed weapon, and putting his hand in his bosom for that weapon.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another man come along the street, talking together, as I thought; the prisoner was next to the wall, and the short man in a brown coat, was on the outside, on the prisoner's left hand; I saw the cloaths drop, but which dropped them I cannot pretend to say; I am sure it was one of the two, but which I cannot say; when the cloaths were dropped, the prisoner at the bar was three or four yards from the man; when I first saw them, they were together, and I think they were talking to one another; they were walking the same way.</p>
               <p>Did you see them speak to one another? As I thought; they were as far off, as to the middle of the yard.</p>

               <p>How long a view of him had you before he dropped the cloaths? - I take it about a minute.</p>
               <p>Was there any body walking with him? There was that man in the brown cloaths, but he had not the cloaths; the prisoner had the cloaths; I did not see them speak together; the other ran away before I took the prisoner: the prisoner did not run, he walked to the side of the houses, and dropped the cloaths by the side of the houses; they were by the side of each other.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of December, I lost between three and four dozen of Morocco skins; they were kept in a drawer in the parlour, at the back of my warehouse; I missed them on the 20th: a neighbour of mine; a brother trade; sent his boy with a piece of leather, desiring I would match him three or four skins of that pattern; I went to the drawer where we keep those skins, and they were gone; my man said, he had put them in the drawer the night before: I never saw the prisoner, till I saw him before the justice. On the 27th of the same month, my neighbour, Mr. Bayley, came to me, and said, have not you lost some Morocco skins, I said yes; he said, here has been a man with a skin, offering me to sell, and I saw it had your mark, in your own hand writing: I then went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150056"/> Bow-street, and related the story to Mr. Bond, who advised me to take a friend, and if I found the skins were mine, to seize them and the parties: we went to where the direction led us, to a man that had offered some to sale; that was not the prisoner, he was a shoe-maker; he is not here; we went to a pawnbroker, his name is Creswell; at the pawnbroker's, we found thirty seven of my skins.</p>
               <p>(The skins produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>- BULLER sworn.</p>
               <p>They have remained in my custody ever since, except last night, when I left them with the sheriffs porter; there was no seal on them, but I shall know them again. (looks at them.) They are the same skins; but there are some of them which I cannot identify, because they are pared round; these are the same skins that were at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Court to Adey. How many of those skins can you positively swear to? - Twenty-nine, all in my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>(One of them shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Are you a <rs id="t17830115-35-viclabel215" type="occupation">wholesale dealer</rs>

               <p>Is that the common mark you use on your skins? - It has been altered since, but that is the mark I will swear to.</p>
               <p>You sold a great many similar skins before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who do you deal with for your leather? A great many people.</p>
               <p>Who is your dyer? - They are finished at the dresser's; they live in the Borough; I buy them of the Spanish leather dresser's.</p>
               <p>Are not the skins dyed in the Borough? I do not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. In the indictment they are called Morocco leather skins; it is incumbent on them to prove that they are so.</p>
               <p>Court. That must be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>To Adey. What would you, or any man, in the trade call them? - Morocco skins: I know these skins were in my shop at that period, if there was no mark on them.</p>

            , a shoe-maker, brought a Morocco skin, he shewed it me as a sample, and asked me if I wanted a quantity; he said, he had twenty-seven, and that they were the property of a friend of his, but he was employed to sell them; I told him, if he would leave me his address, and where I should see the skins, I would call that evening; he left his address, and I informed the prosecutor; I asked the prosecutor what quantity of skins he had lost; he said, they were green and blue Morocco: we went to Raine's house; I asked him if he would give me a sight of the skins, he said, yes; he went with us to the house of one Creswell, a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you in the trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you call these skins? - Green and blue Morocco; this is the common expression of the trade, let them be manufactured where they will, they are known by that name: we found them at Creswell's; Raine told him, I was come to look at the skins; he rather hesitated; the skins were in the one pair of stairs; Creswell asked me, two or three times, what trade I was, if I was a shoe-maker: I told him I was in the sale way; he said, what, I suppose in the shoe selling way; I said, no, I am a leather seller sometimes; if you will shew them to me, I will buy them of you if they are worth my money; and he shewed me the skins; the prosecutor was not in the house; they waited to take the shoe-maker and Creswell; there were twenty-seven skins; I looked at them, these are the same; I asked the shoe-maker the price of them, he said, directly upon account of Creswell's being present, that he had absolutely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150057"/> bought the skins of the pawnbroker, since he saw me last: I looked round, and I saw some other skins of a thinner sort; he said, they were not fit for my purpose, they were fit for book-binders; there was ten of them: I said, if they are leather, I can sell them, for I serve book-binders, as well as shoe-makers: Raine seemed not to wish that Creswell should be privy to our bargain: he said, I have bought them; and I said to the shoe-maker, we will withdraw, and have a pot of beer, and I will agree with you; accordingly we withdrew; when we got into the street, I took hold of the shoe-maker by the arm, and said, I am very sorry for you, but I am obliged to take you into custody; these skins are stolen goods; he seemed very much frightened, and desired I would take the other by all means; we took him also: I then demanded the key, to fetch the skins from the first floor; he gave me the key without any hesitation, and I went up and brought the 37 skins; I brought them down, and delivered them to Mr. Fuller, Mr. Adey's servant; then we all went to Bow-street: Raine appearing as an innocent man, only employed by the pawnbroker, he was dismissed directly: Creswell was in custody; he found bail for that night; he said he had them of them prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was merely on the information of Creswell, that the prisoner was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on the prisoner when he was taken up? - Nothing of this property.</p>
               <p>Do you know how these things came into Creswell's hands, any further than that he said the prisoner delivered them to him? - No, he said, he took them for a pledge of three guineas.</p>
               <p>Does Creswell keep an open shop as a pawnbroker? - It does not appear like a pawnbroker's to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This being the case at present, there is no evidence against the prisoner; as the only witness that remains on the bill, is Creswell, and he making such a great deal of mystery about this business, and being so very shy of shewing the skins; I do think, that he manifestly appears in the light of an accomplice; and, either that he took them himself, or else received them, knowing them to be stolen; for if he had not, when one man comes in a common course of trade to buy, and another wants to sell, the man does not look in his face ten times, and ask so many questions; therefore, there is not at present one grain of evidence to affect the prisoner; the whole depending on the testimony of Creswell, who appears so strongly in the light of an accomplice; and there being no other evidence but his, consequently there is no evidence at all affecting the prisoner.</p>

I speak of it with accuracy, by three different people talking of it, and privately putting it down: the prisoner had served a customer, and had taken some money, and was going up stairs with it to his mistress; I told him to take this money up with him; he asked me if there was any account of it, I told him, no;

             was with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner offer to carry it up, or did you tell him to take it? - I told him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150058"/>Did you count the sum? - Yes, I was the last that counted it.</p>
               <p>How long was is between the time that you counted that money, and the moment he took it away? - It was immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that he took the whole sum that was there placed? - I saw it all in his hand.</p>
               <p>It is the custom of your house generally to give an account to your mistress of little sums as they are received? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What happened in your presence when the prisoner was present, and your master came home? - The prisoner was called up, and his master accused him of defrauding him of 6 s. 6 d. the prisoner said, he knew nothing of it; my master said, he certainly did, and had better not deny it, for he had more than one, two, or three people that could prove it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say why he had better not deny it? - He said, he had more than one, two, or three people that could prove it.</p>
               <p>That was all he said? - Yes; then Mr. Thwaites said he had been cheating him; he said, not to his knowledge, he repeated it again, he still made the same answer; he told him, that to his knowledge was nothing, for he could not do it without knowing it himself; the prisoner repeated the same answer; my master told him he was very sure he had, having sufficient proofs.</p>
               <p>Did your master make him any promise of any kind, if he should open any confession to him? - Not to my knowledge then, I am sure he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he at any time afterwards? Not to my knowledge, they were by themselves after; when Mr. Thwaites threatened to send for an officer: this is nearly all that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. If I understand you right, the prisoner was in the shop, and had taken some money of some customer? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon up that sum? - I was unacquainted with it; it was gold.</p>
               <p>Now the other money that was reckoned, you and your fellow servant had separately reveived: why did not you take it yourself? - Because we had strong suspiciouns</p>
               <p>Having strong suspicions, it was your business, and your duty to take up the money that you had received? - Yes, it was, but not that money.</p>
               <p>Then it was a plan laid by you and your fellow servants, to entrap this man if you could? - No, not to entrap him.</p>
               <p>Well, to find him out, make use of your own words? - To be sure if we were right.</p>
               <p>Did this man and you live on a good footing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you reckon the money to him, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Then it was never reckoned by you, in his presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he want to reckon it? - I do not recollect that matter; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Now do; because you can recollect some things so clearly? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him when he wanted to reckon the money, no, no, no; take it up as it is, it is all right? - I believe I did not say such words.</p>
               <p>Are you sure? - I cannot positively say to that matter.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner better wages than you? I do not know, we do not disclose our wages to one another.</p>
               <p>Council for the prosecution. Your master keeps a great many men? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you are not positive, whether the prisoner did not offer to reckon it, and you said there was no occasion? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Have you any idea that such a thing might pass? - I have not, if I had, I would declare it.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect, one way or the other? - I do not.</p>

I called another of my fellow servants, and he counted it, and found it the same.</p>
               <p>How much? - Three pounds seven shillings: the prisoner took it from a little shelf on the counter: then,

               <p>Court. Who gave him the 3 l. 7 s.? - He took it himself from the shelf, and

             gave him 2 s. more.</p>
               <p>How long was it before, that you had reckoned it? - Just then; Capps and Eyre had counted it; the 2 s. was given him, as he was going up stairs with the 3 l. 7 s. I saw him give him the 2 s. Eyre is not here: the prisoner went up to his mistress: when my master came home, he told the prisoner what we laid to his charge, and the prisoner denied it: my master mentioned the sum of 6 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This money was loose on the ledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You received it in small sums? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much a time? - Different sums; sometimes half a crown, sometimes 5 s.</p>
               <p>Then it was all silver? - Not all.</p>
               <p>Some halfpence? - There was some gold that we gave change out of.</p>
               <p>It was your custom, and your duty, I understand, to take this up to your mistress? It was: we should have taken it up, but we had no time.</p>
               <p>This man was carrying up the money he had received? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he was doing what he ought to do, and you called him back to take up your money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which of you desired him? - Papps.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it to him? - He did not reckon it, he took it himself from the shelf; he scraped it into his hand.</p>
               <p>Did he reckon it himself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was nearest this ledge when he took it? - I cannot tell; I, and Capps were on each side, and the ledge was between us.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his wanting to reckon it? - He did not count it.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to count it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that now? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Nor did you reckon it? - No, we did not; we had a suspicion of him before.</p>
               <p>Then this plan was concerted by you? We agreed to count the money, and be particular.</p>
               <p>Mrs. THWAITES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to Mr. Thwaites. The prisoner came to me in the afternoon of the 4th of January, between three and five, and brought me a bill with four guineas, and desired I would take the bill out of it, and give him change, he then told me that the money he had got besides, was money he had taken out of the shop, which he had no account of; I asked him the reason of that: I had a child in my lap, it was crying; I told him to let the man in the shop examine the bill, I only looked at the sum at the bottom, and gave him the right change; we keep no books in the retail trade, therefore we have no copies of the bills that we send out, and I do not know to whom that bill was sent. After I had given change for the four guineas, he then held out his hand to me with the other money, and said he took that up out of the shop, and that they had no account of that at all: I laid the money down on the opposite side of the table to where I had put the first money, and there was no other money near it; I asked him the reason why he did not bring me any account of that, he said, he did not know, there was no account<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150060"/> count of it, only he had taken half a guinea in the shop, which went into that sum: Mr. Capps came up, and asked me, how much money I had received of Wilson, and if I had counted the money, I told him no; I counted it, and he counted it; I asked him how much I was to receive, he said three pounds nine shillings, there was only three pounds two shillings and sixpence; nobody else had been in at the time: three pounds two shillings and sixpence was the whole of the money that was delivered to me by the prisoner, exclusive of the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prisoner brought up the money was it in his pocket or in his hand? - In his hand.</p>
               <p>Was the four guineas and that money in the same hand? - To the best of my knowledge he had the four guineas and the bill in his right hand, and the other money in his left.</p>
               <p>Did the stairs lead immediately up from the shop to the room where you was? - Yes, there is a door between the shop and the stair-case; I was in the one pair of stairs, and the stair-case comes immediately to that door.</p>

               <p>When you came home to your shop, and was informed by your men what had passed, you afterwards saw the prisoner? - Yes</p>
               <p>Before you held any conversation did you make promise to him?</p>
               <p>Court. No: ask him what passed when he and the prisoner were alone? - We were left alone, only Mrs. Thwaites; I said, Wilson, I am sorry for you, I had longknown you, I had a better opinion of you.</p>
               <p>Then you had a good opinion of him? - I had: I desired that as it was too plain and evident to me that he was guilty, that he would let me know the sum that he had robbed me of, as I was taking my stock, for I understood from what I was told, that it was very considerable; I wished him to declare to me himself.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, that if he disclosed the sum he had robbed you of, you would be as favourable as you could? - I told him, if he would make a plain confession, I would be as favourable to him as lay in my power; I likewise said, that I would be favourable to him as far as it concerned myself, and that I would forgive the injury and offence as far as it concerned me.</p>
               <p>You speak very fairly, we cannot take any notice of that confession. - I never said I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. We have heard what you said.</p>

               <p>He promised me free pardon if I would only acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Thwaites. You gave him change of the four guineas in silver? - </p>
               <p>Did you see what he did with that? - No, Sir, he carried the change back with him: I have a little draw, such as there are in desks, in bureaus for silver, and my purse for gold; I kept the table clear on purpose, as they desired I would be particular.</p>
               <p>Which did he give you first, the four guineas or the other money? - The four guineas.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you gave no part of the money in change of the four guineas? I am very sure of it; I laid it down on the table and did not move it till Capps came into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was not you surprized that he should bring up the money of the other peoples? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Is not every man accountable for the money he receives? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That is no answer to my question, is not every servant to give you an account of the money he receives? - Yes, but they do not say for what.</p>
               <p>But do not they say I have taken 10 s. or 20 s. he could not give you an account of what money was there? - No.</p>
               <p>Might not he have given the change of that money below stairs? - Then he would not have had the change up stairs I suppose.</p>
               <p>Certainly, I know that as well as you do, suppose a customer comes in, do they run up to you for change of a guinea? - They mention it then particularly: there is a piece of paper lays on a board, one says 2 s. 6 d. another 3 s. 6 d. and the man that is at leisure brings up the money.</p>
               <p>Court to Capps. Was not there an account of this money as it was received in the shop that day put down on the paper as usual? - No, sir, that was seldom done, we frequently are so busy that we cannot do it, we put it all together, and count it without any distinction.</p>

               <p>Was there any paper that day on which the money was set down? - Three of us privately set it down.</p>
               <p>On what paper? - On the back of a bill, that paper we have not now.</p>
               <p>What became of it? - We carried it up to Mrs. Thwaites.</p>
               <p>You left it in her possession? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it would be material to produce, that paper as you was so particular? - I do not know what is become of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150063"/>Court to Mrs. Thwaits. Do you know what became of it? - It laid on the table, it might be swept away.</p>
               <p>Was the door between the shop and the stair-case shut or open when the prisoner went up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did he shut the door after him? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did he put the money in his pocket? - He did not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. There is a door between the shop, and the stair-case, is not there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Opens directly to the stair-case? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When the prisoner carried the money out of the shop up to your mistress whether that door was shut or open? - I really cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Try? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Then you do not remember his shutting the door after him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>How long was it before Capps went up after the prisoner came down? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>How long did the prisoner stay above with your mistress? - Not above two minutes, he went directly up.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. All but the 2 s. was set down on a piece of paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is become of that paper? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was any search made to see if this money had fallen on the stairs? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Thwaits. Do you know? Our stairs are so very plain, that without any search it must have been seen.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 24th of November, I had orders from Aldermen Townsend and Hart, to keep a strict watch about this place; Fleet-lane I think they call it: we had information that they were all receiving houses, and that they covered one another; and the prisoner was seen to carry in some bundles, into Mr. Turner's house; we went into Turner's house, and in the cellar we found a caravan box, in which were contained, the things mentioned in the indictment; I did not go down into the cellar myself, I was in the shop: this trial was put off from the last sessions by the prisoner's desire, and by the order of the court: I gave the gentleman and lady all their cloaths, except this coat.</p>
               <p>(The coat produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. You saw the rest of the things? Yes.</p>

               <p>Was Gates present then? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Gates. These things that Mr. Willard saw, were the same things that you took in Turner's house? - Yes, I asked Mrs. Turner where Mr. Turner was, she said, he was not at home; she had lain in a little while, and I was tender of her: I asked, whose the things were, she said, the things were Mr. Jones's; I immediately sent for Mr. Jones, who lived but two or three doors off; he came, and I asked him if the things were his; he said that they were his, and take them away if we durst; I told him, I would not only take them, but I would take him too; I took him, and the next day I took him before the Aldermen at Guildhall; he then declared, before the Aldermen Hart and Townsend, that they were his: we found Mr. Willard, by a hand bill.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. You gave evidence before the justice, I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you or not there say, that you saw any thing like silver about him? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Or did you say, that you apprehended you saw something white about his coat? I said something of the glimpse of silver.</p>
               <p>You did not see him dispossess himself of any thing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these spoons that were found? - I carried them home directly.</p>
               <p>Where did you put them? - In the room they were taken from.</p>
               <p>You did not carry them that day to the justices? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you asked for them? - I was.</p>
               <p>What account did you give? - That I could not be positive to them all, but to one I could, it was more battered than the rest.</p>

               <p>Did you see the two last witnesses in pursuit of the prisoner? - Yes, I was standing on Monday the 29th of last month, at my mistress's door in Portland-street, taking some things from a mantua maker; I saw the prisoner come round; and there being a cry of Stop thief! he made a bit of a stop, and threw something down; I saw it white in the end; the first witness was just at the corner, and he put his hand on the rails, to keep himself from falling; I saw the prisoner part with something from his hands; there was no other person between the prisoner and the servant; he took them up in the very same spot, in less than half a minute, and then I saw that they were spoons: I did not see that they were spoons, when the man dropped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Nor what it was that he put down, you could not tell at that time? - No, only that it appeared white.</p>

               <p>I was walking along up Portland-street, by the chapel; I heard a cry of, Stop thief! I walked, not ran; but walked on, and I was stopped by two men, neither of them were these gentlemen; one said to the other, this is not the man; and they asked my pardon, and quitted me; I walked on very easy; then these gentlemen came up, and said, they should stop me; and I was brought before a magistrate; but neither of these men stopped me; but the men that stopped me, acquitted me, because several people said, I was not the person.</p>

             Sworn.</p>
               <p>You are clerk to justice Wilmot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes, both of them; I heard Hayland declare in the office upon his examination, that he had delivered and sold some hops, I think he said a bag of hops to a brewer in Virginia Street, Ratcliffe Highway; he did not say where he got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. Did you take it down in writing? - No, I did not, In consequence of that information a search warrant was issued out, and delivered to the officer, and soon afterwards there was a part of a bag of hops brought into the office from, as I understand Mr. Cotton's house; Hayland, said he, had sold some hops to Cotton, he wanted to make a discovery, he was charged with having that bag of hops in his custody, they took Hayland and the hops together.</p>
               <p>Court. Was not Hayland asked whose hop bag it was, and how he came by it? I do not know that he said how he came by it; he said, he had delivered and sold a bag of hops to one Cotton in Virginia Street, nobody knew any such person as Cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. Pray Mr. justice's clerk, how came Hayland was not asked whose hops these were, and how he got them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. When Hayland was charged with stealing hops that were found upon him, did nobody ask him where he had got these hops, and whose they were? - That was asked of him, I believe before, and he had acknowledged before to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cotton's Council. You was not present? - The officer is in Court.</p>
               <p>When Hayland said he had sold a bag of hops to Cotton, then there was a search warrant made out.</p>
               <p>Court. Were no questions asked? - I cannot say there was.</p>
               <p>When a man is charged for felony, and tells where he has sold the goods, is it an usual thing in your office not to ask him where he got them? - It is not my place to ask him, he might be asked it, the justice examined him, I do not recollect his being asked it. - Was he present when that bag was brought back? - I really am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Take time and recollect, Sir, you as a justice's clerk must know what it is your duty to attend to? - There is another besides me, I do not do all the business.</p>
               <p>But you was present then, was Hayland there when Cotton and the bag was brought back, that is a plain question? - Upon my word, I cannot say directly.</p>
               <p>Did Hayland ever see in your presence that bag that was brought back? - I think he did.</p>
               <p>Recollect, Sir? - I did not expect to be called upon here.</p>
               <p>You must expect it, it is your duty to be called upon, for what purpose are examinations taken before a magistrate? - That is very true, Sir.</p>

               <p>I do not know what kind of clerk you are, you are but a very bad witness; do you know it was not? - It was done all that was necessary; the examination of Hayland was taken down and returned.</p>

               <p>Answer my question without making me repeat it twice; What did you say to the man before his examination? - Nothing that I know of.</p>

               <p>Is the examination returned? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Was you present when this bag of hops was brought back from Cotton's? - I was.</p>
               <p>Then cannot you recollect whether Hayland was there, and acknowledged he had sold it to Cotton? - I recollect he acknowledged he had sold it to Cotton, I do not know that I saw the bag any more.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Yates and Brown, Hopmerchants; Mr. Thornton's brewery deals with them, I have seen that sack, it is one of Mrs. Yates's sacks.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that sack was sold to Mr. Thornton? - I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long ago? - Sometime about March, 1781.</p>
               <p>You deal with many other brewers do not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you let them have hops with your marks on them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You mark them? - No, my fellow servants do</p>
               <p>There are other hop-factors besides you, are not there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not put this mark on this sack? No, but I was by when they were put on, I was by all the sacks that were weighed at that time.</p>

               <p>When was it? - On the 26th of December; I was not at the beginning of the quarrel, I cannot tell the occasion of it, when I came into the room, the deceased was using very bad language to the prisoner, he wanted him to fight, the prisoner said, he would not fight him then, he had a lame hand, he used a good deal of abusive language, and insisted on fighting him, he said, he would not fight him; then the prisoner got up, and the deceased flung his legs on the seat where the prisoner was sitting, and with an oath told him, if he attempted to sit down again, he would strike him; the box was narrow, the prisoner slided down to recover his seat again, in consequence of which the deceased hit him with his flat hand on the top of the head; the prisoner then held up his elbow, and the deceased gave him a blow in the face, they then went to fighting; the watchman some time afterwards came in, at that time a gentleman that was there caught hold of the deceased, and held him for some time, I recollect that at that time, the prisoner said where is your Vanderplank; the deceased in struggling got from the party that had hold of him, and they ran together, and the deceased fell backwards, and I never heard him speak afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here that saw any blows given immediately, and previous to the man's falling down? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any of you see any thing more than has been related by this witness? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is in vain to ask any of them, let the surgeon stand up. - There is no surgeon here; I recollect the coroner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150071"/> said it was of no consequence to bind the surgeon over.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any blows struck, from the time they had been first parted, to the time they set to it again? - No.</p>
               <p>During the second time did you see any blows? - They rushed at one another, and the deceased fell; I do not know whether any blow passed or not.</p>
               <p>Did none of you? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is no surgeon here to account for his death; it should be made out to you, that the deceased actually came by his death in consequence of that affray: when men are in violent passions, it may occasion the breaking of a blood vessel, and may bring on deadly symptoms.</p>

               <p>The house is kept up at the joint expence of you both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your house I suppose is paid out of the partnership? - No, but we both pay the rent of the house.</p>
               <p>In what manner did you lose this out of the house? - When I was coming from dinner on Monday, about half after two o'clock, and came to the shop door, I was going to scrape my feet, but I cast my sight into the shop, and I saw a man standing, reaching over a Pembroke table: a piece of moreen lay upon a chest of drawers, and I saw the prisoner reaching over to the piece of moreen, to turn it about, as it lay upon the drawers; when he got it near him, he took out a pocket handkerchief, laid it on the piece of moreen, and put it under his arm; he came out of the shop; I drew myself a little way from the door, so as I could see him; I took hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he was going to do with the piece of moreen; he answered, what is that to you; I asked him, who gave it him, he said, it belongs to me; then I told him, he should walk into the shop, and I would let him know who had the greatest right to it. Mrs. Abbott, my partner's wife, was sitting in the little room at the end of the shop, at work: she never saw him, though there is nothing but glass; I called to her, and she came out immediately; I desired her to call somebody to my assistance, she immediately went over the way to the publick house, and called Mr. Hardy, who keeps it, and he came, and met with Mr. Fagan, a baker, next door but one; they both came in; I had the prisoner then, with the piece of moreen, which I believe he dropped just as they came in, from under his arm.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took him at the door, he had the piece of moreen? - Yes; then I began to examine what he was going to do with it; and he said, some man who was going by in the street, had offered him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150072"/> shilling to go in and take it out; then Mr. Fagan went to his house, and called his man; without getting of any constable; and we took him to St. Martin's watch-house: this was all in the day time.</p>
               <p>(The cloth produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I understood you said you was at the door, when you first saw this young man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what situation was that parcel upon the counter at that time? - It lay in this paper, folded up in a parcel.</p>
               <p>What was the first account he gave you? - He said what is that you.</p>
               <p>Not knowing I suppose that you was the master of the shop? - I believe so; I asked him, who gave it him, he said, it is my own.</p>
               <p>I understood that you said, that he told you he was directed by somebody that stood in the street to bring it out? - Not when I first challenged him; it was when this man came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Did not he say to carry it? - No.</p>
               <p>I want to know from you, whether this boy did or did not tell you, at the time he gave an account of himself, and what his business was, that he was employed by this man standing at the door, to go into the shop, to take it, and carry it to a certain place? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he saw a man in the street, and he offered him a shilling to go and fetch that parcel out; he said at the watch-house, it was some ticket porter that he thought belonged to the shop.</p>
               <p>The boy did not attempt to make any escape? - He could not.</p>
               <p>But did he? - He could not.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the price of this piece of moreen? - Forty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>That is the price you sell it at? - No, that is the worth of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Was the street door locked? - I cannot say, I had locked it before, it was entirely close, but I did not particularly examine it.</p>
               <p>That is very odd; then for ought you know the street door was locked still? - I know no more.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband? - He was in bed.</p>
               <p>Did he get up? - No, he did not hear of it he was asleep.</p>
               <p>You did not think it worth while to awaken him on this alarm? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you could not be much alarmed, neither to awaken your husband, nor see whether the street door was fast; did you go to bed again? Yes.</p>

               <p>What did she say she came in for? - She said she had had no supper, and she desired the woman that was in bed with me, to get up and fetch some bread and cheese, and beer; and she pulled out a handkerchief, and bonnet, and a shift, a petticoat, and a bed-gown she had on, and shewed them.</p>
               <p>Did she say where she got them? - She did not say as I understood, she talked very low: the woman's name that slept with me, is Goulden: I made a gown out of the petticoat on the Sunday; and I saw her send the woman on Monday morning to pawn the handkerchief and apron: I never heard whose things they were.</p>

               <p>Court. In what way did she pick your pocket? - While I was laying on the bed with her.</p>
               <p>Could not you have stopped her, when you found she was picking your pocket? - I did not find it.</p>
               <p>Did she take your watch too? - No, the other brought the brandy hot, and she took me to her room; she said, she would help me to the other, and get my money again if she could: then I went to her room, and lay on the bed with her; and she took my watch out of my pocket, and handed it to another that was at the feet of the bed; and the other woman that she gave the watch to, went away; then I went down and called the watchman; I charged him with Pass; and then the prisoner Davis came up to her room, and they were both taken to the watch-house. I never had my watch again.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. These are two separate larcenies; if the prisoners had been both in the room, it might have been presumed that they were both concerned in the business; but they cannot be principals to any larcenies when they were not present: now you see by his account, he was robbed by each separately. You cannot find them guilty on this indictment; but you may find either of them guilty, and acquit the other.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you there? - She enticed me there; when I came in the room she asked me for something to eat and drink, I told her, I could not afford to give her any thing to eat, but a pint of beer she might have, and we had a pint of beer; and then she asked me what I would give her, and I could not afford to give her but 6 d. and 6 d. I gave her; then she fastened up the door, and put the candle out, and we went to bed; and I took my breeches, and laid them under my head; and my money and watch were in my breeches; it was a silver watch, I was offered three guineas for it: I fell asleep, and she took this watch and money out of my breeches; I awaked when the watchman went three, and she was gone, and my breeches laid on the pillow, and my money and watch were gone; in that situation I was not willing to leave the room, for fear any thing should be laid to my charge, till the landlady came to see whether all her things were there; which she did, and found them all there; and I found this purse that my money was in, and a farthing on the floor: it was the prisoner's lodging; the landlady went with me to the justices: I was on the search after the prisoner, from the Monday to the Friday: on Friday she came to the same place again, and hired another room, and the landlady let me know, and I took her up. I never was along with any other woman but this.</p>

               <p>Last Friday week, in the morning about six, I was patroling the street; and in Whitechapel I stopped a horse and cart; the prisoner at the bar drove it; I asked him who it belonged to; he said, he was going to carry hops, to one Mr. Chase, a brewer at Tottenham; I told him I believed it was false; I permitted him to go on; and I followed the cart unknown to him, into Bishopsgate-street; the cart stopped there; then I told him that I saw he was not going to Tottenham; and I took him by the collar, and told him, he should go with me before a magistrate; he told me, if I would let him go, he would tell me the truth about the robbery; I told him I should not let him go, and I would know the truth likewise; we went into a publick house, and the prisoner told me, he took them that morning from Ratcliffe-cross, out of a warehouse; he and Milton, (who was convicted this morning) I found by enquiring that these premises from whence they were taken belonged to the prosecutors.</p>

                        targets="t17830115-53-defend591 t17830115-53-deflabel307"/>? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Upon that gentleman's oath, where were these pattern cards found? - In the first cellar which joined to the vault where this press and flies were found, and where the cloaths basket was.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, I stopped in this parlour first.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose house this is? - We understood it to be Davis's that he was a Taylor, and dealt in buttons and cloth and what not, a salesman; when we got into the parlour there was his wife and he standing near together, and I saw his wife shuffle, as if she wanted to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150083"/> something out of her pocket ; and I immediately caught hold of her hand, and in her pocket, I found these 4 papers of halfpence wrapped up; they are 5 s. papers; that is the usual way of putting them up; here are more halfpence that were in a drawer in the same room; we were informed that they were to sup on a hare and the next day they were to go to work, and in the parlour we found the remains of the hare, and in the cellar was the hare skin hanging fresh (The hare skin produced.) I was in the parlour when Jealous asked him who he had let the cellar to; he did not know nor his wife; either he or his wife, then immediately said, his name was Smith; Jealous then asked him, who the keys belonged to, he said, they were his; Jealous then said, that one of the keys unlocked the cellar door; I went into the cellar, and found the press fixed, and a great quantity of halfpence in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you see the card with the patterns? - In the locked place where the press was; they were laying on a table.</p>

               <p>Look at these halfpence found in the man's pocket. - They were struck off the dies we found there; they brought me word down, that the prisoner said, he let the cellar to one Smith: here are three of the halfpence that were made from that die; and all these were coined from that die; these were the dies that were found in the closet, where the large quantity of 5 s. papers were; I never saw such a quantity before.</p>
               <p>And you have seen a great many? - I have; there were an hundred 5 s. papers.</p>
               <p>They sell them six for a guinea, do not they? - Yes, they were laid up in sixes.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these counterfeit halfpence! They are; I should suppose the copper of these is worth ten-pence, or ten-pence halfpenny a pound; at the Mint, they pay sixteen-pence, or sixteen-pence halfpenny a pound.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am rather struck with awe, that I can hardly vindicate my own cause in this awful assembly, but as far as truth will go, I will endeavour to throw a little light on this affair. I kept a house in the mercery and haberdashery business, in Meard's Court, Soho; it was too much, I determined to quit it; I took this apartment, I agreed for four shillings a week, and then by the quarter: I put up a bill to let the kitchen, and two men came and looked at the apartment, and my wife let it for half a crown a week; this I can prove by a person that was present at letting the apartment to a man, who said his name was Smith, but which it afterwards turned out was not his name: I told the man instantly when he asked me, that it was let to a Mr. Smith. The witness says I am a taylor, I deny it: the street door stood always open, and I was in the same dress I am now; the keys were mine, and if one of them opened the door it is more than I knew: my wife has since seen the man in the street that I let the cellar to, and his name is Chamberlayne; she dodged him to his apartments, he told her to come in two hours; she went in one hour, and at the end of the street she saw a coach and goods hanging out of each side of the windows; before she could get at this coach, they drove off, she took another coach and drove after it, it drove somewhere towards ton: my wife is big with child; the coach stopped at the top of St. John-street stopped short of it, and did not proceed after them only to see where they went into; presently the Leicester and Nottingham waggon came up, and these goods went into that waggon, and she came up immediately with the woman: the coachman told her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150084"/> that the husband was to meet his family up at Highgate, and when they came to Islington, the waggoner hearing the story, insisted upon their getting out, and he turned the goods out into the street, and would have nothing to do with the family any further; when she came to Highgate-hill one of this man's sons had been to warn him of my wife's coming: so she came back and informed me, I immediately wrote a letter to Justice Wright myself, and sent it by a porter to inform him of the man's real name, and where he was gone; I offered to be at two guineas expence, and that my wife though in that situation should accompany any person; they made scorn of what she told them, and she came back and informed me; I thought they would have pursued as they could not have been gone further than twenty miles. In this situation I am innocent as the child unborn, respecting the manufacturing any thing of that sort, my business is quite different.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you by these halfpence that were found in your room? - I am much obliged to your Lordship, quarter-day coming on, as the man came frequently up and down, she asked him for the rent, he gave her these halfpence, she objected to them at the time, he told her he had no other money, and if she would endeavour to take them, when he returned he would take them again; I believe she had about twenty shillings worth, he had been eleven weeks the Tuesday before Christmas day: the halfpence that were found on me (I had no more than six-penny worth) I took a few to put off. They took all my money and kept what they pleased. I can prove that any business is quite a different way, that I never knew any thing of coining.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to prove that this man had the possession of this place? - Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Mrs. Marsh. Do you recollect any thing about any person coming about an apartment that I had to let? - I was there at the time in Tower-street, when a man came and knocked at the door, and asked if there was an apartment to let, I told him there was a kitchen, I did not go down with him, Mrs. Davis went down with him, there was a bill on the side of the door to let a kitchen; this was sometime in October about the middle: Mrs. Davis desired him to call at 8 next morning, as Mr. Davis was not at home; he seemed very anxious to have it, and said, he would give half a crown a week: I never saw him above once after that. The prisoner took a garden at Bethnal Green, and there was a bright key belonging to it, I cannot swear to the key, (the key shewn her) I do not think the key of the garden was so big as that, (looks at the other keys) that is more like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Which was the key that undid the door? - This lost.</p>

               <p>(The bacon produced and deposed to by the string.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is there particular in the string? - I can swear to my bacon, and to the place where I cut it; I know it by the example of my string hanging in this place.</p>
               <p>Court. May not it hang in any place; how is it possible you can swear to a piece of bacon? - I have no particular mark, but my string being tied here; many has them tied in other places: I can swear safely to it being mine.</p>
               <p>Does it differ in any thing, from any other piece of bacon? - I know no other difference; but I can swear to the piece.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner taking coals out of of Mr. Eddington's craft, on the evening of Monday the 9th of this month; the prisoner was on board the craft, I was on a platform adjacent to the craft; he was putting coals into his sack after he had got as many as there is now in the sack, he twisted the sack up, and lifted them on shore, and he took them on his back, and walked up the Bridge stairs along Chatham-square, and at the corner I stopped him; I asked him where he got them coals, he said they were given him, he resisted; another young man came by, and attempted to help me, he knocked the young man down: I collared him, he threw the coals off and struck me, and he cleared himself of me and ran away; I pursued him; till we got about the second arch of the bridge and I secured him; I am sure I saw him put the coals into the sack, I was about seven or eight feet off him, I was right over him: I could see him clearly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What are you? - A knot-maker by trade, I am a ticket porter.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner's person? - No, I knew a man of the same description.</p>
               <p>You mean you had heard a man like him spoken of? - I mean that a man like him had been described as being there several times.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of him before? - No.</p>
               <p>As you was in that position upon the wharf where the goods were landed, a kind of wharf or platform, I fancy you could not see any person wherever it was that had the coals, from the time that he took them out of the lighter, till he got up where he had got them on the wharf? - You may as well tell me, I cannot see you all the time.</p>
               <p>Answer me? - I saw him come up, there was nobody but us two, and I walked close behind him, I think he might be about a dozen yards off, I never lost sight of him, I am quite clear in that.</p>

               <p>Should you have known him if he had not been dirty? - Yes, I saw his person, he had on an oil skin round hat, and a rough waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When was it that you began to take this very particular notice of the man? - When he got on the basket.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in my father's compting-house, in Little Distaff-lane, on the 20th of December, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and I ran and came up with the prisoner, who was also crying Stop thief! and we ran twenty yards together: when we came to the bottom of the lane, I asked him which way he was gone, he made a motion with his hand that he was gone to Doctor's Commons, but when we came there he ran the other way: then I suspected him; I ran after him, then thinking he was the thief, and caught him near the bottom of Labour in vain-hill; we took him to the Three Cups, where White immediately knew him, and said, if it was the man, he must be dirty on the knee, and his knee was dirty.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I only saw the prisoner brought along the street, and I followed him, I went to the Three Cups, and when White came he picked him out immediately, I have the box here.</p>
               <p>Court. Who brought you the box? - The book-keeper or master of the inn.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. I will swear it is the same box, I saw it when he dropped it.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Palmer. I had been into Devonshire to see my friends, and I came back by the Bristol and Bath stage, I was an outside passenger, on the roof, my box was in the basket, when I came to the inn, I missed my box, and I saw my box in the street, and I called to the coachman, and said that is my box; the coachman is not in town.</p>

               <p>When White came into the Three Cups, he asked which was the prisoner, he said, if I was the person, I must be all over dirt, there was no dirt about me but a few spots behind, it was a rainy night, there was no dirt on my breeches: my master has been waiting ever since Wednesday. White said, he would serve me as one Sideaway was served.</p>

               for not fulfilling the conditions of his Majesty's pardon, granted to him the said George on the 30th of April 1782
            </rs>, when he addressed the court to the following purport: - My Lord, I trust your Lordship will bear with me a few minutes. I was sentenced to five years hard labour on the Thames: The sentence was, I believe a very rare and severe one; after four years was past, colds that I had repeatedly caught had ulcerated my lungs, and labour often exceeding my strength by day, and putrified air by night, had greatly reduced, and wasted my frame: the surgeons finding that the usual medicines were not sufficient, applied to the superintendant, and obtained a milk and vegetable diet for me; this was a regimen never allowed there, but like extreme unction to those that were at the point of death: growing worse and worse, I petitioned for a remission of my sentence: In consequence of this I was shortly after freely liberated; and whatever reports may have been propogated to my disadvantage, I have done nothing since that day, that a man need be ashamed of: But, my Lord, I have learned that a man whose character has once been blemished, will always be suspected: I was merely for a name apprehended, and some time afterwards I understood that detainers were lodged against me for not fulfilling the conditions of my pardon; I will appeal to the court, whether it was not contrary to every principle of justice, equity, and law, when a very severe sentence was nearly expired, to saddle me with the condition of being transported for ever; of being a fugative for ever from my native country, which would of itself have been considered as a very severe sentence. My Lord, knowing that I had asserted nothing but facts, I subpoened Mr. Campbell, and the surgeons attending the hulks; the surgeons were to speak to the state of my health that I was in a deep decline, and Mr. Campbell, that he might speak to my behaviour. My Lord, no man who has any thing to fear will subpoena his prosecutor, and Mr. Campbell was mine; for these reasons my Lord, I humbly trust that neither prejudices, nor falsehood, nor plausible pretences, nor uncharitable reports, will deprive me of that candor and justice, which so eminently distinguish your Lordship: I trust you will consider my long-sufferings, that my constitution is destroyed by those sufferings; I trust you will consider my behaviour, and the state I now am in, labouring under a nervous fever and shortness of breath.</p>
               <p>Court. In point of law, I can do little more then explain to you the situation in which you now stand: upon what grounds his Majesty thought fit to grant you that pardon at all or granting it to annex the conditions, it is not my business to enquire; no doubt his Majesty was actuated by his usual wisdom and goodness; probably it was thought from the offences of which you had before been convicted, that you were an unsafe person to be trusted at large within this kingdom, where you might have formed bad connections, and that it was better for yourself and the publick, that you should leave it, but whatever the motives were, his Majesty's pardon now appears, that pardon is the only excuse that you can have for not being at this moment on board the hulks, to which you were sentenced; the consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150100"/> your being any where there would be, that this court would be bound by act of parliament, and have no dishonourary power to sentence you to for double the term: you have much of the severity of transporting yourself out of this kingdom, and not returning during your life; but you should observe, that the sentence of banishment, which is the condition of that pardon, of simple banishment; is a much milder sentence than transportation; because, by transportation the place of destination is fixed, and the subject has not a right to go to any other part of the world; nor to that part of the world of his own liberty; but his person is transferred in a state of servitude and slavery during that term; and the property of his service and labour is assigned to the persons who contract with the court: not so with the condition of your pardon; that is only a condition to remove yourself from that society, which you have so grievously offended, and not to return to it again: but whatever might be the motives of his Majesty a pardon is produced as the reason of your being at large; by the condition of which, you were to leave the kingdom within ten days, and never to return; these ten days are expired, and we are in this kingdom; you have therefore broken that condition; it does not follow from any sentence of the court, but it follows from the act and operation of the law itself; which is, that if the condition of his Majesty's pardon is broken, the person to whom that pardon is granted, remains in the same situation that he would have been if that pardon had not been granted; that I conceive to be the clear law: the only enquiry that the court can make, is, what situation you were in at the time of his Majesty's pardon; in that situation you are now; it is a situation of having a certain time to serve on board the lighters; if your ill health is such now, as to render it dangerous for you to serve the time, that will be a reason for your being detained, till you can be with safety removed; or it may be a ground for a further extension of his Majesty's mercy: but at present the consequence of the law must follow; which consequence is, <rs id="o17830115-1-punish423" type="punishmentDescription">

               that you remain in the same situation that you were in at the time of his Majesty's pardon; having then a term to serve on board the lighter; that term you have to remain there; and you must now be detained in custody for that purpose; and remanded under your former sentence
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, my disease is of such a nature, it is not in the power of medicine to relieve me if I go down to that place; and certain death must be the consequence.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be some short time before you can at any rate be removed; if you are in a state that renders that removal unsafe, you will not be removed; but you must represent your situation to his Majesty, for the power rests with the King alone.</p>
