In consequence of in formation, on 13th May I kept watch with Sergeant White to the Windsor Restaurant, Strand, and saw the two prisoners go there about 1.30—they were there about half an hour and came out with Wagner, and the three went to the Fishmongers' Arms, West Street, St. Martin's Lane—we went to a milk shop on the opposite side and did not see either of the prisoners come out—I nave examined the house since and found that they could not come out without our seeing them—Wagner came to us in the milk shop, made a communication, and left, and I saw him enter the Fishmongers' Arms again—they all three left in ten minutes and went to the Lamb and Flag, Rose Street, Covent Garden—we followed them there and saw them go in; we entered a minute or two afterwards with Barnes, who was in uniform; Thorne was sitting in a chair in a corner of the compartment, and Windt was about two feet from him, and Wagner between the two—as I went up I saw Thorne drop this packet from his left hand, by the side of his chair, on the flow between his chair and the counter—I saw it in his hand before he dropped it—I had my hand on him at that time and said, "I am a police sergeant and am going to search you, as I suspect you of haying some counterfeit money in your possession"—he said, "I know better than that"—I saw the packet picked up from the side of the chair—I searched Thorne, but only found a knife—I took him to Bow Street and there examined the packet, it contained ten bad florins, eight bad half-crowns, and ten bad shillings, all separately wrapped in tissue paper and then in brown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Thorne was placed with seven others at the station and Wagner picked him out—they were charged and made no reply.</p>

               <p>Wagner gave me some information through Mr. Rowe, the interpreter, it Charing Cross Hotel—I saw Wagner, and gave him instructions—I was with Enright on 13th May watching the Windsor Restaurant on the opposite side of the road—I had a glass of ale there about noon, but did not go upstairs—about 1.30 I saw the prisoners go in together, and in about half an hour they came out with Wagner and went to the fishmongers' Arms in West Street—Enright and I then went to a milk shop 20 or 30 yards from the Fishmongers' Arms on the other side of the street—Enright watched, and I was at the back of the shop—to street is in St. Martin's Lane, and there is considerable traffic—Wagner came across and spoke to us for two or three minutes, and then went back to the Fishmongers' Arms—I then saw the prisoners come out and go to the Lamb and Flag—I did not see them go into the urinal, and I did not lose sight of them—we got Barnes's assistance, Who was in uniform, and we all three entered the public-house—I saw Thorne sitting down, and Wagner standing opposite him between the two—I heard something drop, but did not see it—Enright took hold of Thorne, and told Barnes to look behind Thorne's chair—I searched Windt, and found a pocket-book, a shilling, and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., good money—he was charged with uttering a half-crown on 5th May, but it turned out to be 6th May—he said, "If I have paid that half-crown I do not know good money from bad"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel Barnes picked up and handed to me—I received these letters from Windt. (<hi rend="italic">One of these was addressed to the Commissioners of Police, signed "G.

               <p>looked and found a small brown paper parcel at the back of a chair in the corner of the compartment nearest to the counter—I gave it to Ser<lb/>geant Wright; this is it—there was three or four inches space between the chair and the parcel, which was against the counter, by the back leg of the chair—I had to pull the chair out before I saw it; it was not exactly under the chair—it could not have rolled more than two inches—when Enright fold me to pick it up I had one foot inside the doorway and one foot out—I did not notice how far Wagner was from the chair.</p>

I keep the Lamb and Flag, Rose Street—on 13th May I saw both the prisoners and Wagner in the bar—Thorne was fitting down, Windt was standing, and Wagner was between them—my wife was serving them, when two detectives came in; Wagner had then gone out—the detectives laid hold of the prisoners, and a constable in uniform moved Thorne's chair and picked up a parcel—I should say that Wagner could not before he went out have dropped the parcel where it was found—I heard something heavy drop on the floor after the con<lb/>stables came in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Windt in his defence stated that Wagner had sworn falsely, and had asked him, Windt, to change false notes for him. He contended that his bribing him with drink proved that he was anxious to conceal something, but that he got frightened and informed the police; and that no doubt Wagner had the packet at the Fishmongers' Arms, but had no opportunity of using it. Thorne in his defence stated that he met Windt, who took him to the Windsor Restaurant, where the waiter talked to him in a foreign language, and charged them nothing for their refreshment; that they then went to the Lamb and Flag, and when the police came he submitted to be searched by them, and Enright told the constable to search for a parcel. He con<lb/>tended that as the police-officers had contradicted each other upon several points, there might be an untruth told about a parcel being dropped, and that Wagner had concocted the matter to clear himself.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am possessed of an income of between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have lost my father and mother—in September, 1882, I was at Eton, and afterwards with a tutor, and went round the world—I became an undergraduate at Magdalen College, Cambridge—in July, 1885, I took a suite of rooms on a second floor in Jermyn Street, at a rent of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—they consist of sitting room, bedroom, smoking room, and bathroom; I furnished them myself—Mr. Tuck was my valet; he slept next door, he usually went away about half-past 10—on Satur<lb/>day night, 13th June, I went to a theatre, and afterwards to my club, and left there about 1—I had only to walk down Albemarle Street; it took me about five or six minutes—the prisoner came up to me at my door in Jermyn Street—there were two or three gaslights in the street, but none immediately near—he said "Will you give me a drink?"—I said "No"—he asked for a drink again, and I said I would not give him one—he said "Oh, do, do, the public-houses are all closed"—I then said I would give him a brandy and soda, and opened the front door with a latch key—there is a gas jet on the two first floors—I preceded him upstairs, and outside my rooms I turned round and said I was going to my rooms to see if there was a light—there was a gas in the corridor, and when I faced round I was able to see his face fairly distinctly—he was wearing a round black hat—I opened my door and he came in—I lighted two candles—he took off his hat, and I said "Here is your brandy and soda"—I poured out some brandy in a glass and opened a soda-water bottle and gave it to him, and he stood and drank it—I asked him what he was doing during the day, and he said he was a clerk to a solicitor in the City, I think he said in Fleet Street—it took him about six minutes to drink the brandy and soda—I did not take anything myself—when he had finished I turned round and said "It is about time for my going off to bed, and I think you had better go"—he said "I am not going",—I said "What do you want? you have had your brandy and soda; you had better go"—he said "I want some money"—I said "You can't have any money, you have had your drink"—he said if I didn't give him some money he would bring his father next morning, and swear I had been taking liberties with him—I waited about half a minute and then said "If you will go away without making any scandal or bother I will give you a sovereign," and I gave him a sovereign—he smiled and said "That won't do, I want 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You infernal blackguard, what do you mean by wanting blackmail of me?"—he said "I want your 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and said the same thing again—I said I had not got the money in the house—he said "Oh yes, you have"—I said "I assure you I have not got it, can't possibly give it you"—he said "If you don't give it me you will have to give me some security"—I said "I don't see why I should give you security"—he said he would wait there till the next morning and then bring his father, and say I had been taking liberties with him—I then said "Rather than have any bother, if you will go away I don't mind giving you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also give you a suit of clothes"—I took out a suit and he fitted on some, and said they would not fit him, he must have something else—I said I would not give him anything more—I then said "I will give you a cheque," so I began</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188606280023"/>
               <p>to write one—he gave the name of George Thompson, Whitcombe Street—the cheque was upon a Gloucester shire bank—he read it, and when I put" Pay Thompson 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on it he said "That won't do, this is a country bank"—I did not give him the cheque—he made an awful fuss about his father's coming, and eventually, rather than have the bother, I agreed to give him my watch and chain, and pencil-case and ring, on the condi<lb/>tion that they were to be redeemed on Monday outside the Alhambra Theatre—he assented to that—finally he carried off 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and my watch and chain and pencil-case and ring—I would not have parted with any of this property if he had not used the statement of intending to wait all night, and then bring his father next morning and charge me with indecent liberties—I would have given him anything rather than have that charge—he left just about 2 o'clock; he remained an hour as far as I remember—I had a full opportunity of seeing his face, and I noticed a peculiar movement in it; he bit his lips rather corner-ways, and I noticed that peculiarity about him on Monday when he was arrested—he was rather frightened, I think—on Sunday, about 11 o'clock, I saw Police-officer Scott, and with his knowledge I went and met the prisoner on Monday outside the Alhambra—I got there about 20 minutes to 1, and saw the prisoner standing near the railings of the public garden on the other side—when he saw me he crossed the road towards me; he said nothing, but beckoned with his hand, and went a few paces past the Alhambra—he shopped for me to get up to him, and I then said "You have turned up," and then I went on to say "You have got the watch and chain you promised to bring?"—he said "I have not"—I said "Why not, you promised to give them to me?"—he said he had borrowed money on them, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "What am I to do, you can't expect me to give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what I have not?"—he said "I can't give it you, because I have pawned it," and at that time the constable came up and took him—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been dining with a friend on this evening and I went with him to the theatre and afterwards to my club, but I took no refreshment there—I went straight from there to Jermyn Street—I have had these chambers about one year altogether—I had been there this time about one week—there are chambers below and above them; I do not know the occupiers—I don't think there were any people in Jermyn Street when the prisoner spoke to me, I didn't look—before the Magistrate I gave the name of William Morton—that is not my right name; I did not explain that to the Magistrate—I have been in London since the beginning of the season—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me—I was perfectly sober when I took the prisoner upstairs; it was a very foolish thing to do, certainly—the light upstairs was between the two doors—I did not mention to the Magistrate about the twitching in the prisoner's face—I was not represented by a solicitor before the Magistrate, but since then I have consulted one—I was very much alarmed about this, as I thought he might make an exposure—I don't know that I was excited—when I got to the Alhambra on the Monday I walked up to him when he crossed over, and then he walked on in front of me and made a sign for me to follow him—I was the first to speak—I said "You have turned up, then?"—I don't think he made any answer to that—I said "You have got my watch and chain?"—he said "No, I</p>

On Sunday, 20th June, between 10 and half-past, the prosecutor saw me at the Marlborough Mews station and I took him to Vine Street to see Inspector Conquest—I met the pro<lb/>secutor at 10 o'clock on Monday morning and it was then arranged I should see him again at 1 o'clock—I did so and then told him he had better walk down to where he had promised to meet the prisoner in the square, and I followed him—I saw the prisoner in the company of two confede<lb/>rates, and soon afterwards I saw them behind a cab, watching the prosecutor and prisoner talking outside the Alhambra; I went up behind them, and as I took hold of the prisoner's arm I heard the prisoner say, "It is pawned"—before I had time to speak to him he said, "I never saw this gentleman before"—I said, "I shall take you in custody for obtaining a watch and chain from this gentleman"—he got loose for about two yards, but I took hold of him again and he was taken to the station—he there said he was an errand boy, he did not say where—I found on him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have known him three years—I never knew him do a day's work—I knew the two men well who were with him.</p>

I am barman at the Duke of York public-house, North Walk Road, Paddington—about half-past twelve on the night of 15th June I was in the bar when Kennedy and Bevan came in with three others, of whom Fitzgerald was one; they had five pots of ale, which they drank together—they stayed about a quarter or half an hour and then all left together, each one having paid for what they had—in about five minutes they came in again and Bevan ordered a pot of ale—one of the men not in custody said, "No, we don't want it"—Bevan called for it again and I drew it—they all turned round and seemed to pass something between them—I did not see anything pass—Bevan paid me with a half-crown—I looked at it and tried it between my teeth and bit it, it was soft—I said to Bevan, "It is bad"—I cannot say if Kenny was there, but the other prisoners were—they then all went outside—I gave the half-crown to the landlord, Mr. Whitlock—I had not given change—I was present when</p>

I am a shoeblack, and live at 54, Broad Walk, Blackfriars—on 15th June, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, I was outside the Crown public-house in Curtain Road; I saw the prisoner and deceased there—there was a quarrel about a ring; the deceased said it was a good one, the prisoner said it was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, and they got to high words—it subsided a bit, and they went out together and had a drink in the private bar—they came back, and the deceased and went out again—he returned with a big man, who said to the prisoner "I'll fight you"—the prisoner told him to "put up," meaning his fists; he then hit the big man two or three blows—after that the big man said, "I'll give you best"—the prisoner turned round to the deceased and said, "I will have a go at you as you have brought a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> to fight me," and he gave the deceased two or three blows, and he fell—I did not see him strike the prisoner; he took the blows quietly—he was going back, the prisoner following him, and he fell, whether from the blows or whether he slipped I could not see—I was about 10 yards distant—the deceased might have put up his hands to parry the blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am caterer to the Royal Natal College, Greenwich—in Feb., 1885, I received a circular similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) referring to shares in the Copper Queens, signed "John Lenn and Co., Limited, Grocers' Hall Court, City"—I applied for 50 shares, and sent a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Capital and Counties Bank—I received this telegram from J. Lenn and Co., dated February 19th: "Order to hand; strongly advise you to pay up in full now, by so doing better allotment obtainable; should strongly recommend at least double order, quite confident it would pay handsomely."—I telegraphed back that I would take 100 shares, and on 20th February I sent a cheque for 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to complete the purchase, and received this acknowledgment, enclosing a sold note and a receipt for the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in due course I received the transfers to sign, which I executed and sent back—I had notice during May that the copper market was going down; in consequence of that I wrote, and received this reply, of May 11th, 1885, advising me to exchange my interest from the Copper to the Silver Queens—on the 12th I wrote this letter, leaving it in their hands, and on the 13th I received this reply, enclosing a contract note for the transfer, which I signed and returned, and on the 14th I sent this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to complete the purchase of the 110 shares, as I was advised—I have the sold note of the Silver Queens here—on the 12th October I received this letter, enclosing a dividend warrant for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and cheque to that amount, which I paid in through the Capital and Counties Bank—I never received the certifi<lb/>cate for my shares either in the Copper or Silver Queens—I wrote to the defendant about it, and in May last I went to the office and found it closed, I then consulted my solicitor, and a warrant was issued—there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I authorised the Copper Queens to be sold, for the purpose of reinvesting in the Silver Queens—that is an existing Company, and the shares are at a premium—I had never seen the prisoner until he appeared at the Mansion House—my charge was made solely upon the written documents before the Court—I never heard of or saw Mr. Hinton—many of these documents are signed by Hinton in the name of John Lenn and Co.—this is not the only circular I have received from stock<lb/>brokers f a similar character, not by many—I do not say that John Lenn and Co. made any false representations to me as regards the Silver Queens—the Copper Queens was an existing Company—John Lenn and Co. are a registered company—if I had made a civil claim for this money I should have sued the proper representative of that Company—I did contract with the Company—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the proper amount of the dividend on the shares I held, that was the only dividend then due, the next dividend was due when we were at the Mansion House; I didn't get it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Perry Vale, Catford—previous to Sept. last year I had dealings with Lenn and Co.; they bought shares for me—I had from them a circular relative to the Copper Queens, and also to the Silver Queens—on the 3rd September I wrote to them to secure me 10 Silver Queens—I had called at the office, and I think saw Mr. Hinton—I sent a post-office order as a deposit—on the 4th September I received this letter from John Lenn and Co., informing me that they had secured 116 shares in the Silver Queens, and enclosing receipt for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with the sold note, also the transfer form, which I executed and returned—on the 17th September I paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the office, and on the 21st 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., here is the receipt—I went up on the Tuesday and paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in reference to the 10 shares, here is the receipt—I received a transfer form for this, which I executed, also a sold note, and on the 21st I sent the second halves of some bank-notes—on the 25th November I went to the office and paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I afterwards received this statement of the shares I bad bought during the year through Lenn and Co.—on the 1st January, 1886, I wrote expressing my surprise that I had not received my certificates in many instances, and requesting to have them ready when I called—8, Old Jewry, is the Silver Queens office—on the 5th Jan. I received this note from Lenn and Co., expressing regret at the absence of the secretary when I called, and hoping to have my script ready in a few days—on 23rd Jan. I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had called at the office of the Silver Queens and found that his shares had never been registered, and that he had called many times at the office of Lenn and Co. without being able to see the secretary or Mr. Hinton, who was always said to be engaged.</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188606280040"/>
               <p>That is quite true, I did call many times—I never received the certificate—I have not had any dividend warrants on the 40 shares—I have certifi<lb/>cates of the Company for 46 in addition to the 40—I have perhaps seen the prisoner once or twice when I have called at the office, but very rarely—I generally saw Mr. Hinton, who was represented to be the secre<lb/>tary of the Company, and the prisoner, the manager—when I wished to see him I asked for the manager—when I became anxious as to the non-registration of the certificates I persisted in seeing Mr. Tamblyn—I didn't say his name, I knew him simply as manager—I did see him, and he assured me that in a few days the whole matter would be settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not conduct the whole business with Mr. Hinton—I believe he had gone abroad previous to my anxiety about the non-registration—when I saw the prisoner I told him that I was very much surprised that my certificates had not been registered, and he said he would see about it—he acknowledged that there were 40 shares owing to me, and that very shortly they should be registered; that was distinctly and repeatedly acknowledged—my earliest business with them was satis<lb/>factory—I understood they were acting in the same way as agents—I knew nothing of them except from their circulars—I think they stated, when I called some time, that they held a great many shares; that was only to encourage me to buy, as I understood—the transfers in no case were in their name; the party transferring to me was quite a different individual, but I don't remember the name; I made an entry at the time of the name, but I do remember it, they were quite distinct from the firm, and in one or two instances the parties resided in the north of London—they told me they possessed shares, they didn't tell me they were for sale—I have received dividends more than once on the previous transactions and in respect of La Trinidad shares—I believe those were allotted to me by the Company, at least a portion of them—I got a cheque of theirs for a dividend similar to that in Mr. Adams's case, but I cannot say on what particular shares; I think it was for a dividend due on them when I purchased them—I received my dividends on the Silver Queens up to two months since, therefore I should have no objection to receive the shares, but on the whole I would rather have the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Press Association, Limited, who collect and disseminate news among papers in town and the country; it is incorporated—I have known the defendant 10 or 12 years as a penny-a-liner, and I know his writing very well—some years ago, in con<lb/>sequence of information, I gave instructions respecting his communications—these two documents A1 and D1 concerning; the murder of a wife and the murder of a sweetheart are in his handwriting, and were received by our office—our system is that if the paragraph is used the sender will be credited with so much, according to the quantity—as a rule we credit him with a round sum, either '2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was credited for the murder of a sweetheart paragraph to Harrison, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that of the murder of the wife to Mortimer—persons calling for those sums in those names would be entitled to receive those amounts—we have a list of all kinds of papers which we supply; we practically send all over the country—I received a letter calling my attention to one of the paragraphs, and I made a communication to our clerks; that was how we discovered it—the whole of this paper purporting to be signed by Mortimer and Harrison is in the prisoner's writing—I know no person of the name of Mortimer or Harrison as liners—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) purports to be a list of papers all over Great Britain and Ireland in the prisoner's writing—the Press Association is responsible to the newspapers for the accuracy of the news which it sends to them.</p>

I am a clerk to the Press Association—on or about 4th December the prisoner came into the office and asked me if there was anything due for Mr. Morrison—I referred to the ledger, and told him there was nothing due—he grumbled, and said he thought the paragraph had been used, and he asked if there was anything due to Harrison or Mortimer—I asked him what the subjects were—he said "Attempted murder"—Mr. Bowskill, the cashier, then came up and told him his name was neither Harrison nor Mortimer, but Fowler—I had previously looked out these documents; A 1 and D 1, and examined them, and I told the prisoner they were both in the same handwriting—he said they were his partner's—the cashier told him he would not pay him unless he produced a written authority, otherwise the telegrams would be sent to the towns from which they had been sent—I think that was all that took place—on 7th December a boy brought this document to the office signed "H. Mortimer "and "Harrison"—I had then received instructions from Mr. Robins, and refused to give the boy any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 25, Down Street, Piccadilly, and am on the editorial staff of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I received this report relative to a meeting of the unemployed on Hackney Downs, I believe on 7th Febru<lb/>ary, in the ordinary way, and I was requested to look at it and see if it was of sufficient interest for publication—I fancy I cut out a portion which was too long, and then I sent it on to the printers, and it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of 8th February in that form—the address on it is "C. Hill, 3, Aviary Street, Canning Town"—that is put on by the reporter, that he may be paid for it—those reports are addressed to the editor, marked "Copy," left at the porter's desk, and if they are fit for publication I hand them on—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I am registered printer and publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—when copy is sent in the sub-editor looks it through, and then passes it through to me for the purpose of printing, and if it appears, the reporter's name which is on the copy, appears in the ledger, with the amount of copy at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a line credited to him—he would see the report, and apply for the money with the receipt ready written, or he would write it out—the account would be checked by the ledger clerk, and the bill presented to me for payment—I pay any day except Saturday, but I always insist on one day in case it should be inaccurate—these are the reports of <hi rend="italic">liners</hi> who do not belong to our regular staff—I paid this bill out of the coffers of the <hi rend="italic">Times:</hi> "The proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in account with Charles Hill, mass meeting on Hackney Downs, February 8th, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received on 9th, Charles Hill"—the initials of the ledger clerk are in the corner—payment is made upon the accuracy of the report—the next copy sent is of the Victoria Park Meeting on the 28th February, with "Charles Hill, 3, Aviary Street, Canning Town," upon it—that was passed by one of our editors, and appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of March 1st—the account was paid on March 2nd; this is the receipt: "In account with the proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, March 1st, Unemployed Demonstration in Victoria Park, 40 lines, examined G. P., received March 2nd, Charles Hill"—I have this entry in my book of the payment of that money; "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Charles Hill"—I cannot say if I paid that—there are two others in my office, and if I am away in another part of the office the cash would be left out, and they would pay it, and when I saw it was paid I should make the entry; I am bound to do that to make the balance at the end of the day—the copy would be sent in one day and printed in next day's paper—the next copy relates to a meeting at the Walworth Radical Club, Old Kent Road—it has the name "M. Darrell, 8, Middlesex Street, St. Pancras," upon it—those 42 lines, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., passed through the sub-editor's hands on Sunday, 11th April, and appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the 12th—I also pro<lb/>duce a flimsey, which was sent in on 12th April, and appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the 13th, of a meeting of the West London Traders' Association at the Mabledon Hotel, Euston Road, on the Railway Rates Bill—it bears the name of "M Darrell, 8, Middlesex Street, St. Pancras"—that was 24 lines, price 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the two accounts together amount to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this receipt: "8, Middlesex Street, <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> debtor to M.

Darrell," was handed to me by a man on the 28th April—I asked him his name—he said "Jones"—I kept the receipt, and refused to pay him, and told him Darrell had better call himself, but he never did—the next flimsey sent is that of a meeting of the London Trades Congress Association at the Napier Hotel, Jermyn Street, and bears upon it the name of "J. Lynch, 228, Gray's Inn Road"—that was sent in on 22nd April, and appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the 23rd—this receipt: "J. Lynch, 228, Gray's Inn Road, 23rd April, 1886, Railway and Canal Traffic Bill, 30 lines, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., paid 29th April, J.</p>

               <p>Lynch," was brought to me by a woman, who I afterwards saw at the Mansion House—I declined to pay the money, telling her to tell Mr. Lynch to call himself, but he never came, and the money has never been paid—Mr. Vincent, one of the checking clerks, was in the office at the time she came—persons who brought receipts would go to him, and he would initial them, and then they would come to me, and on seeing Mr. Vincent's initials I should pay the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I speak to three receipts in the names of Hill, Darrell, and Lynch; they are all marked "Paid," but in two of them no money was handed over; my holding the receipts is no evidence of money being paid—apart from the receipt there is nothing to show that the money was paid in Hill's case—this book is in the general cashier's writing—if anybody paid the money out he would make a memorandum, and I should make an entry in the book—part of this book is what other people told me—I balance the books every day—if a perfect stranger sent in a flimsey with his name and address, we should insert it if we knew nothing against him—I always wait one day before paying, to see that the report is correct, because supposing a wrong name is given probably as soon as it is published that person would make a complaint, and if it was well founded and of sufficient interest we should make an apology—I know a man named Booth, a line reporter—this meeting of represen<lb/>tatives of working men's clubs against Home Rule is leaded, but not double leaded—I found out this was untrue about 12 o'clock on the morning of publication—he was a line reporter—I was satisfied it was a bogus report next morning, but we did not publish any contradiction—it depends on whether it is important or not—this was false, but I did not publish a contradiction—I told a responsible person, and he did con<lb/>tradict it—we published a Fenian Manifesto some time ago—we did not contradict that, nor did I see a contradiction in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—we did not know the author of that manifesto, and we did not make any inquiries of the person who sent it in—I know that reports in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> have frequently been contradicted in the House of Commons—our correspondent in Dublin relies on reports that are sent from persons in other parts of Ireland—he has been deceived in outrages which have not occurred, but we have not dismissed him or prosecuted him; he still receives his salary, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are ordinary correspondents and ordinary liners—I have no doubt the Fenian Manifesto was a genuine document—it is for the editor to determine whether it is worth while contradicting these paragraphs or not—if it was an occurrence of great importance we should nave the news from more than one reporter, so that it would be verified, but in a meeting at a public-house we have no means of checking it—these matters are got ready up to between three and four o'clock in the morning, so as to appear in the morning paper.</p>

On 5th June, about 20 minutes past 1 in the early morning, I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I charged him and he said "I own I have done it; what I have done I was driven to do"—he was the worse for drink—about half-past 1 that morning I went to the house and examined the back room, and found thin clothing and broken paraffin lamp in the fireplace, and also these pieces of paper—the whole of the linen was partly burnt—I examined it to try and find paraffin, but could not—there was a strong smell in the room of burning linen; the smell of paraffin would have remained there up till then—I found this lamp in the passage, and oil was spilt on the two bottom stairs—the furniture was in a broken condi<lb/>tion—about 10 next morning I went to the house and examined the boards about the fireplace; there were no marks traceable on the floor—there had been some floorcloth over there, and the place had been washed out a little then—when I was there on the previous night the floor was covered with ashes from the paper and clothes—I was in Court when Mrs. Williams was examined—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining her, and I saw her sign her depositions.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker of 165, Brockley Road—prior to 18th June I believed that money was being taken from me, in consequence of which I went to the police and some coins were marked in my presence, two florins, a half-crown, one or two half-sovereigns, and a sovereign—they were put into this purse and put in a wardrobe in a bedroom on the first floor—the last time I saw the coins counted was about half-past eight on the Saturday morning, the 19th—I am sure the coins</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188606280057"/>
               <p>were all there then—an electric bell was taken from the shop door and put on the wardrobe so that no one could see it—the prisoner was at work on that Saturday—her husband has been in my service about five years and is so still, he has been married a year or eighteen months—I went out on my rounds on Saturday and returned about 11; a communication was then made to me and I called in the detective, Harris—he was handy—I called the prisoner down off the stain where she was cleaning, and Harris ordered her to turn out her pockets in the back parlour—she took out her purse and gave it to him and he put it on the table and opened it—there were some halfpence in it and a two-shilling piece—I think he took out the coins bit by bit—I saw it as he took it out—he looked at it and handed it to me and laid "Can you swear to this?"—I said, "Yes, I can"—I don't think the prisoner made any answer, she was taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave the coins to Harris to mark, and was present when they were marked; the inspector was also there—if the inspector lays there was only one florin there, that is a mistake—as far as I know the prisoner has denied her guilt all through—when she was shown the florin she said she had brought it with her—she did not say in my hearing that she had been the night before to buy some methylated spirits—I have other persons in my employment; a woman who attends to the shop, and a maid servant, and my family—they could get into the bedroom—I charged the prisoner at the station.</p>

I live with my father at Eversfield Grove Park—about 6.30 p.m. on 28th May I was out for a walk with Miss Jones and went into an unoccupied house which was to let, near Grove Park Station—before doing so we saw the prisoner, but did not notice him; I had not seen him before, to my knowledge—while we were on the ground floor of the house the prisoner came in—we went upstairs, and he came up into the room we were in and asked what right we had in the house—we said that the house was to let, and we thought it belonged to Mr. Pound, and that we were sure he would have no objec<lb/>tion to our seeing it—he said he was Mr. Pound's clerk, and had orders that if any one came in the house he was to keep them till Mr. Pound could be sent for—I gave him my stepfather's name, Mr. Adelard, and</p>

               <p>said we were well known in Grove Park, and I was sure Mr. Found would not mind our seeing the house—the prisoner said we must come up with him into the rooms, to show we had been doing no harm—we said we had not done anything to the rooms; we could not do anything to them, there was nothing in them—he said we must go with him into the rooms, and I said we would—upstairs there was a room with a cup<lb/>board—when we got upstairs he said "Now that I have seen you have not hurt the rooms I am to keep you here till Mr. Found comes"—I said we would come downstairs and wait till he fetched Mr. Pound—he said it would not do, he must lock us into the rooms, and he said Miss Jones must be locked into one room and I into another—I said "Why not both in the same room?"—he wanted me to go into a cupboard; it was so dirty I did not want to—he said if we did not go in he would force us in—I asked if we could not wait in the bedroom till they came—he said no, and he said that one or other must go upstairs—he pushed me into the cupboard and looked the door, and said Miss Jones was going with him to fetch Mr. Pound—I asked him to fetch Mr. Pound it once—he took Miss Jones away directly he had locked the door; I heard her screaming as if she were being dragged down-stairs, the screams came from downstairs—I heard a crash of glass and I heard Miss Jones ask him not to hurt her, and saying she would not say anything if he would let her go, begging him not to hurt us—after that there was quiet, then the prisoner came upstairs and un<lb/>locked the door and stood with his back to it—I said "Has Miss Jones gone to fetch Mr. Pound?"—he said "Yes;" they would not be long—he then asked if I would let him tie my hands; I said "Certainly not"—I asked him if Mr. Pound was coming, he said "Yes"—he promised if I would let him tie my hands he would let me come downstairs and wait in the hall for Mr. Pound—I said I would let him, and he tied my hands with a piece of string in front—I wanted to go downstairs and walked to the door; he would not let me go out—I said he had promised to let me go—then he began pulling the silk handkerchief at my throat—I broke the string and began to cry and scream—I asked him if it was my money he wanted; he asked me now much I had in my purse, I said 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so; he said it was scarcely worth taking—about this time I heard somebody coming, I tried to get by him, he flung me from the door and would not let me pose—then he wanted to tie my hands again; he wanted to see if my boots had laces in them, I said no; he took the lace out of his own boot and tied my hands behind my back—I resisted as much as I could, and called out and tried to pass him; he flung me against the wall and knocked my head against the wall, and then flung me on the floor and put his hand on my mouth, and I thought he was going to stifle me—before that he had taken my silk handkerchief from round my neck and tied it over my mouth to prevent my screaming—I gave a scream, struggled, and broke the boot-lace over my hands—then he asked for my puree and I gave it to him—he could not get the gold out, and I took it out and threw it on the floor and told him to pick it up, as I thought I might then get past him; he would not move from the door—there was a sovereign and a half and some silver—he said I must pick up the money—at first I would not, and then he said he would force me to go on my knees and pick it up, and I then picked up the money and gave it to him—I then thought I heard some one downstairs, I screamed and tried to get to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary of the Brixton Incorporated Indus<lb/>trial Society, Limited—I produce the Articles of Incorporation signed by the Registrar—the Welfield branch is at Streatham—there is a savings bank department e-t each branch, and also a storekeeper, and a member of the Committee visits the bank every Saturday, for which he receives 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—the defendant was appointed for that duty at the Wel<lb/>field branch; he has been there about three years—he visited the branch every Saturday to receive deposits and pay depositors who wished to with-draw—if the deposits exceed the withdrawals he pays the balance to the storekeeper immediately the bank is closed, and if the withdrawals exceed the deposits, he gets the money from the storekeeper, and it is his duty to enter the sums deposited or withdrawn, in the day book—each member has a deposit book like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and when he withdraws any sum the amount is entered in it, and the amount ought to tally with the day book which he signs as having withdrawn—each deposit book has a number which is entered in the books—I find by the day book of 10th April, 1886, that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was drawn by H. Edgington, who has signed it—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seems clear enough, but the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. seems to have been entered afterwards; there are two dots, and the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. seems to have been entered over them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Edgington's book; it is No. 164, and on 10th April I find, in the prisoner's writing, to the best of my belief; 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only withdrawn—on February 6th, 1886, by the daybook Ernest Wilson, book 141, has withdrawn 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is signed "E. Neale," and by Wilson's deposit book I find only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. withdrawn—on 19th Decem<lb/>ber, 1885, Ada King is entered as drawing out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is signed "H. King," and her deposit book only shows 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. drawn out—to the best of my belief the entries are the defendant's writing, and it was his duty to make them—on 30th May, 1885, Clara Wheeler withdrew 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by the day book, which is signed "Clara Wheeler," and there is no money withdrawn by the deposit book—she only had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at that date, and could only withdraw that sum—on June 17th George Panting is entered in the day book as withdrawing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 27th June, 1885, but by his deposit book he withdrew nothing—on 15th August, 1885, H.</p>

               <p>King withdrew 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by the day book, and by his book he only with<lb/>draw 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 20th March, 1886, I find by the day book 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. withdrawn by F. Waterman, but no money is marked in his book as withdrawn—the amounts are posted in the ledger afterwards under each customer's name—I find by the ledger of January 3rd, 1883, that the books tallied at that time; the balance in hand was 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the deposits up to March amounted to 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which with 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. added for interest amounts to 253<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including the 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the withdrawals in January, 1883, amount to 314<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that shows a deficiency of 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that is assuming that all the amounts have been withdrawn by every depositor; but the money in hand belong<lb/>ing to depositors in the ledger is 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the total deficiency being 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The defendant was one of 12 Committeemen—we endeavour to get three from each branch living in the district—the Committee are elected by the members quarterly—sometimes the Com<lb/>mitteemen relieve each other, but at Welfield Road the defendant has done it alone, except in case of sickness or holiday—if he found it difficult to attend he could ask a brother Committeeman to attend for him—groceries and so on are sold at the Welfield Road branch—it is an ordinary branch, open every day, and the storekeeper renders an account of the stock to the head office on Thursdays; our weeks end on Wednesday—no money is sent down from the head office for the banking business, the money in the shop is used for that purpose—money deposited on Saturday night ought to come into his account on Wednesday—the bank is only open from 7 to 9 on Saturdays—if the prisoner had to pay any money before he had taken any, he would apply to the storekeeper, and sometimes he sends the member to the store<lb/>keeper instead of going himself, and the money would not pass through his hands—the day-book is left with the storekeeper on Saturday night after it is totalled up—the committeeman keeps a ledger, which ought to be balanced quarterly and sent to the head office at the end of the quarter—there are also balance-sheets and reports every three months, and the accounts are audited—if the day-book vas left with the store<lb/>keeper on Saturday night, and the committeeman had got his ledger at home, it would be his duty to take the day-book and make up the ledge from it—he was not obliged to leave it with the storekeeper, but that was the practice at Brixton—I sign the day-book once a week, but only that the addition is correct, I cannot tell whether the amounts have been withdrawn or not—I did not observe that in Edgington's case the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was written afterwards—it is the practice of the committeeman who pays a member to put his initials to the book, and in many cases I find the defendant's initials—there are no initials to the withdrawal book—on 6th February, in Wilson's book, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is withdrawn, and it is signed "E. Neale," but there are no initials—I do not think there are any initials in the depositors' books; he does not seem to sign withdrawals, only receipts—here is G. Panting's signature in the day-book for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with<lb/>drawn on 27th June, although there is no entry in the depositors' book, and the same in Saunders's case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the defendant's book; he was a depositor himself, or it may be one of his children, as this is F. Walker's book—I cannot say whose figures these are in the day-book, but they seem the same as the other entries—I will not say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188606280071"/>
               <p>that these figures on 23rd January are not the storekeeper's; I do not think they are, but it is difficult to swear to figures—I do not pretend to distinguish between the three committeemen—to the best of my know<lb/>ledge the prisoner was absent two or three weeks at the beginning of the year, and there was nothing wrong with the accounts—Frank Walker's book is made up, showing only a balance of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the deposit book has never been made up, it does not show that the amount has been withdrawn—I find in the day-book of 23rd June 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. withdrawn and no signature; that was when the prisoner was absent—if he wanted to be dishonest in making up the ledger there is no reason why he should not have copied the depositor's book—he was a letter-carrier when he joined the Society, and has been ever since—I know nothing against his character—only three cases were brought against him before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Three committeemen were appointed to the branch, but the defendant did the work himself except when he was ill—the figures in this day-book are in his writing, except one or two weeks when he was away—he did not send in the ledger every quarter; I first obtained it this year in the middle of February, and then I had not seen it for three quarters; if I had had it before I might have noticed the dis<lb/>crepancies—the whole of the totals would have been taken out and compared, but it was impossible to do that in the middle of a quarter—in the cases enumerated the total of withdrawals exceeds as a rule the total of deposits—there is no entry of the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his child's book, but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered in the day-book without a signature; it does not appear who withdrew it.</p>

I live at 29, Willow Street, Bermondsey—on Fri<lb/>day, 14th May, about 10 p.m., I was near a beershop in Alscott Road, Bermondsey, and saw the prisoner next door to a baker's shop; she said, "Will you go and get me a half-quartern of gin and cloves, and I will give you a halfpenny?" and gave me a half-crown—I went into the Alscott Arms and gave the half-crown to the witness Mould; she spoke to me and I went out with a gentleman, but could not see the prisoner—I afterwards saw her in custody and am quite sure she is the woman who gave me the half-crown.</p>

I am a grocer at 50a, Trinity Square—about midnight on 14th June, Bank Holiday, I was in High Street, Borough, and saw Williams and Willmott having a scuffle, as I thought—I stopped and said, "Don't fight there; why don't you come to terms? come, have a pot of beer"—we went into a public-house, and I treated them—they then asked me to go to a coffee-stall, which I thought was a coffee-house—we went across to the stall, and Pearson knocked me down—I was then severely knocked about by the other two prisoners—I lost my stick and hat—I had said nothing to provoke them—I did not know them before—I saw a detective take Williams and Willmott—Pearson was not in the public-house with us, but joined us when going across to the coffee-stall—I charged them with stealing my stick and hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Williams.</hi> I met you at the corner of Mint Street—you all three hit me after we came from the stall—I was very sore three or four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Pearson.</hi> I said at the police-court I did not see you before I saw you at the station-house, but I was excited at the time—I did not say I gave you a pot of beer—I first saw you at the coffee-stall—I said at the police-court I went into a coffee-house, and that I was there four or five minutes with you—I cannot say which of you took my stick—you were all three together.</p>
