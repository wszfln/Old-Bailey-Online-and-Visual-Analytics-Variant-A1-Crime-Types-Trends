                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Welsh, and live at No. 20, Great Saffron-bill. On Tuesday morning, the 26th of Aug., I went to the prisoner's room, and knocked at her door—she told me to come in—I did her good morning, and she did me good morning—I said, "Mary, you have served me very pretty for the last two days, and abused me most shamefully, and I do not deserve it from you: I have always been a good friend to you"—she said, "Yes, that I acknowledge"—I said, "You said yesterday you would rip my bowels out, and I don't deserve such state<lb/>ments as you have made for the last two days; if you are a better woman than me, come down into the court if you like, and we will decide it with<lb/>out any further variance"—she said, "Go out of my room," and seized the. chopper from the corner of the room—I said, "I did not come into your room to injure you"—she took the chopper, and immediately was going to hit me—I caught the chopper and took it out of her hand, and while doing so she made several blows at my shoulder—I said, "Take care of the child"—she had her child in her arras—I took the cho<lb/>pper out of her hand and laid it on the table—Mary Leary, who was in the room, took it off the table, and put it in one corner under<lb/>neath the cupboard—the prisoner then ran and took either a jug or a basin and threw it, but it did not touch me—she then took the chopper again</p>

               <p>from underneath the cupboard and hit me a violent blow with it—I do not know how deep it was—I did not look in the glass to see—I said to the women that were in the room, "Oh, she has murdered me, she has hit me with the chopper"—Mary Leary and Catherine Cashman, the two women, said, "Come out of the room, for we shall be all killed here"—they both cried out at the same time—as they were bringing me out at the door she hit me with the milk-pot and cut me under the eye—I have the mark now—I was taken into my own room by Leary, Cashman, and two more neigh<lb/>bours who ran down stairs—I was hardly able to walk—I lost a great deal of blood, and the blow stunned me—I walked with their assistance—I sent for Mr. Bartlett, who advised me that the hospital was the best place for me—I went to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they took off the strapping, and sewed up this part of my eye where it was cut—they would not keep me in, as I was pregnant, but said I should be an out-patient—I then walked home, and kept my bed for a week from the injury, except going to give evidence against her before the Magistrate on the Friday following.</p>

Catmur, No. 8, Hollybush-row, Bethnal-green-road")—when I read it I asked him who Mr. Catmur was—he said, Mr. Catmur was a very respectable man—I said, "Why does he apply to us? Who has he been accustomed to have his paper of? or, where does he have his paper?"—he mentioned Messrs. Morgan and others—I said, "Who does he work for?"—he mentioned Mr. Tegg, the extensive bookseller, in Cheapside, and some other persons—he repre<lb/>sented Mr. Catmur as a bookbinder—I asked why he did not continue to buy the paper where they had been accustomed, particularly Messrs. Mor<lb/>gan, who, I thought, would supply them with verything they wanted—he said, Mr. Catmur had been so much disappointed that he was losing his customers for want of getting his goods in proper time—I asked how long he had been in the service of Mr. Catmur—he said not a great while, not many months—upon this I gave orders for him to have the paper—I saw it delivered to him, and a boy who was with him at the time assisting him—eight reams were delivered to him, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never got the money for it—I made inquiries afterwards, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Upper Charles-street. I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years—when I first knew him, he was a chemist in Regent-street—about July he came to my house in Charles-street, and brought a bill of exchange—this is the bill—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at one produced by Pearce</hi>)—he wished me to get it discounted for him—I had never got any discounted for him before—I had told him previously, if he brought me a bill on a respectable party I could get it discounted for him—I asked him if this bill was genuine—he said he saw Mr. Gunter accept it—he said it was Mr. Gunter, of Berkeley-square—he said he did business with him, and could do more if he had larger means—I got the bill discounted for him in the City—he went with me—I went to a friend of mine, named Bannister, who lives at Islington—he has no office, but I frequently meet him at a coffee-house in the City—I took his check for it, went to the Union Bank, received the money, and gave it to the prisoner.</p>

Be<lb/>tween ten and eleven o'clock in the morning on the 3rd of Sept, I was in my first floor room—my daughters called me down—I saw the prisoner—he had been up stairs to my second floor room, which is used as a counting-house—I did not see him there, but saw him on the stairs—I asked what he wanted—he said he wanted to speak to me—I invited him up stairs to my second floor room to inquire his business—he said he did not want to go up again, he had been up, he wanted a situation—I said, "If you will wait a bit I will get you a situation"—I sent for the policeman, and in my own great coat, which the prisoner had got on his back, he found my silk handkerchief—I had not discovered that he had my coat on—this is my coat and handkerchief—they had been in the second floor front room, which was open—I had seen them there the day before.</p>

On the 25th of Aug., about eleven o'clock at night, I was walking down Threadneedle-street—I was accosted by the prisoner, who had a shabby genteel man with her—she came to me in a very rode way, and snatched at my watch, but could not get it—the man walked off almost immediately—he had come close to my side with her, but I do not think he touched me—the prisoner continued dancing and singing very rode airs all the time I was going along Threadneedle-street—I pushed her off several times, and after five or eight minutes I got rid of her, and bid her good night—the policeman was opposite, and told me to take care of my money, as I was in queer company—after I had got ten or fifteen yards I began to feel for my money, and it was gone—I fancied I had taken my purse out at the Bull in Bishopsgate-street, where I had been, and had left it there—I had seen it safe when I had left the Queen's Arms, which was three quarters of an hour before—I had seven sovereigns and six half-sovereigns in it—I followed the prisoner a little way up a court, and examined my pockets—she was afterwards taken by the policeman, and when he asked me if my money was safe, I said it was gone—ten or twelve minutes had elapsed between the singing and dancing and my missing my money—when the policeman took her she dropped the purse containing the seven sovereigns and six half-sovereigns on his boot—I had not charged her with it before, as I was not positive where I had left it—this is my purse and money.</p>

I saw the prisoner that evening with a man, who left her, and then I saw the prosecutor with his hand on the prisoner—I looked them in the face, and they moved a few yards to the corner of Broad-street—I heard the prosecutor say "Good night"—he went in the middle of the road, and the prisoner went up the court, which has no thoroughfare—the prosecutor made a stop, felt his pockets, and rushed up the court—they were there two or three minutes,</p>

               <p>and I heard him say, "What are you going to do now?"—the prisoner said, "Sit down"—I went up the court and said, "Is your property safe?"—he said, "Yes"—he came out of the court—I brought the prisoner out, and was holding her—he was feeling his pockets, and then he said, "For God's sake hold her fast, she has got my purse"—he came up and said to her, "Give me my purse, or I will give you in charge"—I let go of her left arm, and seized her by her right hand—I then heard something, and felt something fall on my boot—I stooped down and took up this purse, which has been sworn to by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Camberwell. On the 23rd of Aug., at a quarter before four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Bridge-street—I stood for a minute or a minute and a half, hearing a dispute with a man with a cart and the toll-collector—I felt my handkerchief go from my pocket—I turned, and the prisoner was placing it under his coat—I charged him with it—he did not deny it—I took it from him—this is it—it has no mark on it, but I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> There were a great many people looking at the cart; I saw this handkerchief on the ground; I took it up, looked at it; the prose<lb/>cutor caught me by the arm, and said, "You have got my handkerchief;" I pulled it out and gave it him; I was just going to put it into my pocket; I gave him my address, and told him I was on business. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did, and I gave it to the officer—I am sure I felt the handkerchief go from my pocket—I turned and saw him with it, moving on—when I overtook him with it, he was about three yards from me—there was a crowd of six or seven persons, and I had to go through them to get to him.</p>

I was returning home on the 5th of Sept., about fi ve o'clock, and whilst I was knocking at the door, a person pulled a purse which I had in my hand—it was twisted round my finger, and the person did not succeed in getting it from me, but he drew me about two yards from the door—the purse contained about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I heard some one call out while the person was pulling the purse from me—in consequence of that call the person let go the purse and ran away—I did not see his face.</p>

I was on the dry arch over Thames-street, in consequence of directions I had received from Miller and Locock—I was in company with Coombs about five minutes—after two o'clock I saw Hincks and Brazier come down Miles'-lane, and turn to the right-hand—they looked about some little time, and then turned up Arthur-street, they went up a little way, and turned back in a short time—I saw Brazier had a white paper parcel in his hand—he gave that parcel to Hincks—they passed on towards where I was, and I then saw Williams come round Arthur-street, with his cart—Hincks then had the parcel in his hand-Williams came from Arthur-street into Thames-street—I saw Hincks</p>

               <p>put the parcel into his own 'right-hand coat pocket—he had a pepper-and-salt blouse on—the pocket was not big enough to receive the parcel and hide it—part of it was out of the pocket—I then crossed the road and passed down the steps into Thames-street—Hincks passed me, and went into a public-house at the corner of Fish-street-hill—I do not know the sign of it—Williams then drew up to the public-house with his cart, got out of his cart, and went into the house—I did not see Brazier then at all—I stopped some time till Williams and Hincks were going out at one door, and 1 went in at another—Williams got into his cart—I saw through the window that he was in his cart—he was in the act of putting something into the cart, and covering it over.</p>

I am one of the firm of Catherine Fincham and Co., tea-dealers, Martin Vlane, in the City—I was shown a parcel of tea, said to have been taken from Williams's cart—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is fine gunpowder tea—we had tea of this description in our stock at the time this matter occurred—there was half a chest of it open at the back part of our ware-house, and it had been so for some little time—half a chest is about 60lbs.—I have not a doubt in my own mind as to this being a part of our stock—this</p>

Between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 5th of Sept, I was returning home by Piccadilly, and met the prisoners at Hyde Park Corner—they were near each other—Wright accosted me, and asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she wished me to go with her—I told her I should not—she put her hands on two posts which I had to go through, and said I should not go through—in about a second I felt something cut round my neck—I felt, and missed my watch from my right-hand waist<lb/>coat pocket—it had been attached with a swivel to a silver guard-chain</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Clay Hall public-house, at Old Ford. It is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford, Bow—the prisoner used to be pccasionally at my house—Mr. Spring has a bed-room at my house—on Monday the 28th of July, about eleven or twelve o'clock at night, I went outside the house to fasten the garden gate, and saw a glimmering light in Mr. Spring's room—I knew there had no business to be a light there at that time, and felt alarmed—I went in-doors and alarmed my sister and Mr. Spring—they went up stairs—I went to the foot of the stairs, and there stopped—I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs—I asked him what he was doing there, or what he was about—he said he wanted to go to the water-closet—I said, "Have you not been into Mr. Spring's room?—he said, "Yes, Mr. Spring sent me—with that I allowed him to pass, supposing all to be right, on his way to the water-closet at the back of the house—I saw him no more till he was apprehended—he could not get from the back of the premises without getting over a wall or a high railing—I afterwards went into Mr. Spring's room with Mr. Spring and my sister—I discovered a strong smell of burning, and a good deal of smoke in the room—I then looked about the room, and perceived different parts of the ashes of paper</p>

               <p>recently burnt—Mr. Spring went to a desk in the room—he made no remark, but directly went out of the house, finding, I apprehend, that he was robbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, lodging with Mr. Hulme. On Saturday, the 26th of July, I had a sum of money for the purpose of paying my men—on the Monday, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I put some of the notes into my writing-desk—there were eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, seven in one place, and one was folded in an envelope, and put under some papers, for the purpose of paying a bill—I afterwards went to Sydenham—I returned about eleven on the Monday night—I then went to my desk, and placed four sovereigns on the seven notes—they were then safe, exactly as I had left them in the morning—I locked my desk, and came down stairs—I had also a pair of gold shirt-pins, in a piece of paper, there—I did not see them in the evening—I did not look for them—there was another desk in the room, containing a silver hunting-watch—the key was in that desk—I saw that safe about eight o'clock on the Monday morning, not afterwards—I did not see the prisoner that night—I had seen him in the morning about half-past eleven—he then said he was going to work at Mr. Adams's factory, at Fairfield, in the afternoon, and asked if I would lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would pay me at the end of the week—he said he owed Mr. Hulme a few shillings, and he had no doubt he would allow him to keep on to the end of the week—in consequence of something I heard from Gardener, I thought it necessary to lock my room door in the early part of Monday—I saw nothing more of the prisoner till he was apprehended—I did not send him to my room that night, nor at any part of the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James M'Kenzie, and live at No. 39, Cable-street, St. George's. On the 2nd of Sept I went and staid out with a friend—she wished me to stop all night—I did not wish to do so, and her servant saw me home—I asked if he would take a glass of some<lb/>thing, and we went into a public-house in Cable-street, which leads out of Rosemary-lane—there were two or three men there—I took my purse out to pay for what he had—I kept my purse in my hand; and whilst I was wishing the servant good night, the prisoner knocked me down, and got the purse out of my hand—I am quite sure, without looking at him, that he is the person that knocked me down—I am very sorry to see him in such a place—I had never seen him before—he was in the public-house, and saw my money in my purse—I cannot tell to a shilling what was in it—there were several shillings in it—I had just that moment bid the ser<lb/>vant good bye, and I said, "Oh, Sam, this person has got my purse;" and he ran after him directly—he hit me in the chest—I do not say that he hurt me—he merely knocked me down—he seized my purse—I got up, and shouted, "Stop thief"—Sam got hold of him—he flung the purse down—I did not see him do so—I know Sam picked it up—it was my purse.</p>

Debenham and Store's—shortly before that sale, a person named Richardson called on me—he is a customer of mine—he called with a piece of paper, with the number of this watch on it, and made some in<lb/>quiry about the watch—I gave him my opinion upon it—I saw him again I think about the Friday after the sale—I go to wind his clocks every week, and when I saw him there, he told me the watch had been stolen from Debenham and Store's—I then lost sight of the transaction until Aug. last, when the watch was brought to me by the witness Cloughly—something took place between us, which led to our going to Debenham and Store's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Debenham and Storr—I remember three days' sale at our rooms, on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of April, 1844—there was property of Miss Fleming's there—among the articles to be sold on Wednesday, the 17th, was a gold watch, numbered in the catalogue, 580, and on the Thursday a golden casket containing about 31 oz. of gold, worth about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to melt—there were also some doubloons and a watch-chain—the sale went on all right on the Tuesday—about half-past twelve o'clock on the Wednesday, and before we had come to lot 580, I came down into the room and found the casket was missing—it was placed at the upper end of the room, the furthest from the entrance, on an extra counter formed across that end of the room—it was quite away from the counter where the glass-case was which contained the gold watch—the side-counter on the left hand as you enter is approached by a hatchway, which lifts up—the dealers, and persons that are known and considered respectable, are permitted to come inside the hatch, and go round inside the counter, and look into the glass-cases—the prisoner was at the sale on the Wednesday—I had seen him there before twelve o'clock—he was there all the morning—he has been in the habit of attending our sales as a dealer—the proper place for the watch was in a glass-case on the counter, within about three yards of the hatch—the prisoner went within the hatch, and I saw him at that glass-case examining the things—I think that was about half-past eleven—I know the watch was safe in that case between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I had possession of it up to that time, and I then put it into the case—upon missing the casket I imme<lb/>diately called out to the auctioneer, and went and shut the doors of the room—on returning into the room I came behind the counter to see what else was missing, and on looking found that the watch was missing, and other things, amounting in the whole to somewhere about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was made public immediately—some of the persons in the room offered to be searched—the prisoner was one—if the property had been simultaneously taken it must have been taken by more than one person—I do not remem<lb/>ber that we had any other watch of that modern make in the sale—it is an article that would excite the attention of dealers—it is a very superior watch, one that we do not often have, at least not bo often as other watches—we have one now and then—there were many dealers there besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About how many do you suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might have been at one time in the morning as many as forty—when we have a popular sale the room is crowded—I had known the pri<lb/>soner for some time, as a person frequenting sales of that description and making purchases—there are a great number of persons who gain their livelihood in that manner—articles of this sort are passed from hand to hand very much, with a small increased profit—that is the system of deal<lb/>ing—he came as usual after this robbery, and as frequently as before, making purchases, and conducting himself in every respect as he had done previously—I cannot call to mind any person who has been absent since</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since that period has not the prisoner communicated to you a fact against one of the other dealers in another matter, about a diamond pin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not with respect to a dealer—he spoke to me of a young man in our employment having a diamond pin in his possession, which I afterwards inquired into, and found he had come properly by it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of Messrs. Debenham and Storr—I remember the loss of this property—on the follow<lb/>ing day, about ten minutes or a quarter to one o'clock, I was in the office, and received directions from my employers to go to the bullion-dealers, to make a communication to them—the prisoner was in the office at that time—as I went out he followed me, and overtook me in Bedford-street, about 150 yards from my master's premises—he said, "Where are you going to?"—I said, "Into the City"—he said—"Have you dined?"—I said "No"—he said, "Then we may as well have dinner toge<lb/>ther; and after that, if you like, I will go into the City with you"—I said, "No" at the time, but we walked on, and he said, "If you will allow me to go into the City I can point out the places you should go to, although it will be of no use your going, as the purchasers never take down the names of the parties they buy of"—we went into an eating-house in Maiden-lane, and there dined—I had never been on such familiar terms as to dine with him before—as we were at dinner he said, "I believe the firm have employed Inspector Pearce"—I said, "They have"—at which he became very much agitated—I noticed his appearance; and in consequence of suspicion which that excited in my mind, I left the eating-house, walked to the top of Maiden-lane and Bedford-street, left him, and went round by another way to my employers'—I there disclosed what had passed—in consequence of directions I received, I was again about proceeding to the bullion-dealers—when I got to my masters' door I again found the prisoner—he asked what I had been in for? I made an excuse, and said for something I had forgotten—I then proceeded on my way, and he with me as far as Holborn—he said his wife was going off from the Bell and Crown by the coach, that afternoon, and if I went as far as there he would go into the City with me—but he only went as far as there, and then I left him, and went on about my business—I do not remember the name of the house I dined at in Maiden-lane—I was always in the habit of dining there at that time—but I never dined there when the prisoner has been dining there—I had only been in his company once before, in New-street, Covent-garden—he came in while I was dining there, that is the only time I remember.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Puzey. I was looking after Mr. Harvey George's property, at Stowe Hall, Essex—he had some fowls—I saw them safe on Sunday night, the 24th of Aug.—I did not see one of them on the Tuesday—the policeman brought it afterwards—I know it was Mr. George's hen.</p>

I refused first, and told her I could not, I was rather in a hurry: and she requested me so, and told me she would not be long; however, I went with her. I was only acquainted with her about six weeks; when she went into the shop she never asked for the boots. I was rather surprised; she made an excuse, by looking at some second-hand dresses. I told her I could not go any further, if she did not mean purchasing the boots in that shop; it was the last of my thoughts to think she had got them in her possession at the time; when she got a short distance from the shop, she told me she had stolen them. I was glad to leave her company as soon as I could, so I wished her good afternoon. I had been at home about two hours, when, to my surprise, a policeman knocked at the door, and asked for me. I came down stairs; he said he wanted me, and asked me if I knew any<lb/>thing about the boots. I told him the truth. I went to the station-house, and asked Watson her meaning, for trying to get me into trouble; she said she did not think the policeman would take me, and she did not know what to say; therefore, to clear herself, she has got me into trouble; and I declare solemnly I am innocent; she told several different tales at the station-house."</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Daniel Delaney, a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. During the week preceding the 5th of Sept., I was in the shop—I saw the prisoner come there several times—on Tues<lb/>day, the 2nd of Sept., she came to the shop as usual, to inquire about two cloaks which she said had been pawned there—I said we had searched the premises and the books, and we had not got them, and I did not believe she came for anything but to steal, as she had attempted to steal a gown on the Saturday previous—I left the prisoner in the shop, and went into the warehouse—when I came back she had just gone out—I went after her, and overtook her—I found on her this shawl, which is the pro<lb/>perty of my master—when the prisoner came it was lying on the sale<lb/>board in the shop, which is for the purpose of exposing the goods to view—the prisoner had been standing at the end of the board, having a child in her arms, she sometimes asked to be allowed to sit on the end of this board where the goods were kept—I took the shawl from her, and brought it back—I said, "You have stolen this shawl"—she said, "No, I have not"—she cried—I took the shawl, and did not intend to give her into custody—she was afterwards brought to the shop, and this other shawl and gown were found upon her—they are Mr. Delaney's property—they were in the shop when the prisoner came, and were missed directly she was gone.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 19th of Aug., I was returning home, about ten minutes past one o'clock in the morning—it was three or four weeks ago—I do not want to do any harm to the prisoner—I had come from my uncle's, in Kingsgate-street, Holborn—it rained very hard—when I got to the corner of Marshall-street, London-road, three men met me—one man laid at the end of my feet, with his hands holding each of my ancles—the others were one on each side of me—they <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> my hands over my back—the fourth man came up, put his hand on my mouth, and his knee on my chest, and took three half-sovereigns from my pocket, and left one sovereign and four half-sovereigns behind.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 95.) On the morning of the 19th of Aug. I was at the window of Mr. Richardson's house, at the corner of Marshall-street and London-road—I saw the prosecutor come up—when he was under the lamp he staggered off the pavement into the road—I saw four persons come to the top of Marshall-street—one of them said, "Halloo"—three of them came down and laid hold of the prosecutor—the prisoner is one of them—I have known him four or five years—one still remained at the top of the street—the three came towards him, laid hold of his arm, and put it behind him—the prisoner directly let go his arm, came round in front of him, and put his hand into the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket—the prosecutor hallooed, "Police!"—I saw the prisoner put his hand on his mouth, throw him down on the ground, and lay a-top of him, or stand over him—the fourth person had then come down to the other three—I did not see that fourth man do anything to the prosecutor—I immediately came down stairs, and asked Mr. Richardson to open the door—I went out, and saw the prosecutor on his hands and knees, getting up off the ground—the four men were then turning the corner—the prisoner and another ran down Union-street, which is the next street to Marshall-street—the other two ran down the London-road, towards the Blind-school—the prisoner ran up a court that has no thoroughfare, and stood at the door of the last house on the left, in his shirt sleeves—(when I saw him with the prosecutor he had a blouse on)—I said, "I want you, Mr. Hyde"—he said, "Want me! I live here"—I said, "I know better; you knocked a man down just now, and robbed him"—I took him round to Marshall-street, but could not find the prosecutor—I then took him to the station, and charged him on suspicion—I afterwards went to this court in Union-street—I saw something white under a closet door at the end of the court—there was a vacancy of about nine inches at the top of the door—I forced the door open, and there found a blouse—I took it to the station, aud next morning I saw the prisoner with it on—he asked me who brought his blouse to the station—I said I did—he asked me where I found it—I said in the privy—the house I was in when this occurred belonged to Mr. Richardson—a wall next his house had been condemned, and pulled down, and he applied at the station for two men to be about at night, as the house was exposed—I had a view of the street where the prose<lb/>cutor was standing—there was a gas lamp right opposite—I had a full view of them—they all three paused there for a minute.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey-square, and am a broker; I knew the deceased; he was called <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Curtis, but I understand his name was M'Donald. On the 2nd of Aug. I was at the Lord Monteagle public-house, Walworth—the prisoner and a person named Barker, a grease-buyer, were there—the prisoner was telling Barker that he had some fat to sell, and that his name was Owen Buckley—Curtis interfered, and said his name was not Owen Buckley—the dispute was entirely about the name—the quarrel rose so high that there was a challenge—the deceased said he would have a <hi rend="italic">set-to</hi> with the prisoner—they agreed together to go out and have a <hi rend="italic">set-to</hi>—they both went out and took off their coats—they caught hold of one another in the way of throwing one another—they threw each other twice—both were tipsy—if they had not been tipsy I think it would not have occurred—they stood in the middle of the road arguing, "Do you want anything of me?" and like that—they then took hold of one another sharply, and threw one another down in the mud in the kennel—it was a very awkward place—there is a drain-hole about a foot deep—they fell off the road across the kennel, and the deceased was undermost the first time—they got up again, and were persuaded to go away—the deceased crossed the pavement to the road again, to the prisoner, and they had at it again—they caught hold of each other, and threw one another down on the other side of the road—I stepped up and picked one of them up, I do not know which, but, I believe, the prisoner, and per<lb/>suaded him to come away, and not fight any more—several others also per<lb/>suaded him, and several persuaded the deceased to do so, and they were separated—they put on their coats, and walked away—Curtis walked with two or three more—I was at the same beer-shop on the Saturday following, and saw Curtis there having a pint of ale—he asked me to drink—I refused at first; at last I took a drink, and he said, "What two fools me and this Buckley must have been to have gone out on Saturday week to roll one another in the mud, for I do not think we hit one another a blow, or hurt one another."</p>

I saw Williams on the 16th of Aug., about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, carrying a bag—he went into Pim's shop—Pim was behind the counter—Williams opened the bag, and took some paper shavings out of it—I saw Pim handle these book covers as the bag was on the counter, after the paper shavings were weighed—I should say there was from 6lbs. to 7lbs. weight of paper shav<lb/>ings, from the appearance of them, they being light—previous to the bag going in, it appeared to have something heavy at the bottom of it—the quantity which the bag contained was put in the scale—Mr. Pim came round his counter, and lifted the bag on the counter—I saw Pim take the covers in his hand, look at them, and appear to examine them—I did not see him take them from the bag—I saw them in his hand, he lifted from the mouth of the bag when the bag was on the counter—at that time I left the door, crossed over to West, and communicated what I saw—I stood a short time, and saw the bag delivered over to Williams empty, and he came oat with it under his arm—I followed till West took Williams, with the bag under his arm—I then returned to Pim's shop, and stationed myself to see if I could see anything of this kind come out—I watched till West came back—I then went into the shop, and West asked Pim if he had bought any paper—he replied that he had not bought any for three weeks—West described what sort of a young man he saw go into the shop, and about the time—Pim replied he had not seen any such person as that there, and when he had bought the paper he bought it of a female—I mentioned that at the Magistrate's office—West said he would search the place, and Pim consented, saying he would take him to where his paper was—he said he had a great quantity, that he was in the habit of buying it by the ton weight at a time—West then went in the rear of the premises, and I went to a bin where I suspected this was, and I found it in the bin—there was nothing over it—I found it as soon as I got to the edge of the bin—Pim's attention was drawn to these books—he said a part of it did not belong to these books at all, that it was part of his own book, and had been there for some time—he told us we had no businsss to take it away—we brought it away, and took it to the station—he afterwards admitted, when he came to the station, that he had bought the rest—he said he might have bought it, to the best of his belief, that evening—I heard him say that as I stood aside of him—Williams said this was the identical quantity of paper he sold to Pim, and Pim told us to look at Williams, and see what a false young man he was.</p>

I saw Williams go with some<lb/>thing into Pim's shop, but what I could not say—he had a bag which seemed heavy—I saw Pim come round the counter, take something from the floor, and put it on the counter—I waited a short time and saw Wil<lb/>liams come out of the shop—I followed him some distance—I stopped him, and asked him what he was doing with that bag—he said it was his own bag—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said he brought it from home—I went to Pim's and asked him if he had bought any paper that night—he said he had not—that was about three quarters of an hour after<lb/>wards—I told him it was a young man with a hat on, and a brown fustian jacket—he said he had not seen such a person that night—I told him I should go and search his place—he then took me backwards into a large warehouse and showed me some paper there—I said, "Let us go back again"—I went back and found this paper lying on some rags behind the counter—I said, "Here is some paper here"—he said, "That has been in my place three weeks"—the other officer told me he had taken it out of a little bin—I said I should take him and the paper to the station-house—ingoing along to the station I asked him what he came round the counter and took from the floor and put on the counter—he said he had not been round—when we got to the station the paper was placed before Williams, and he was asked if he knew anything of this paper—he said, Yes, it was the paper he took to Pim's—Pim denied it, and said, "Look at him and see if he is not telling a falsehood"—I am sure Pim said he had not seen such a person that night—after he said he had not bought the paper I described the person, and he said he had not seen such a person.</p>
