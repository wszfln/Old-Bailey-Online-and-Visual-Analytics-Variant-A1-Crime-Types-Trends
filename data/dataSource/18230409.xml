            . I am an officer. On Sunday, the 2d of March, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in the Commercial-road, with a bundle on his shoulder, and asked him what he was carrying, he said,</p>
               <p>"Copper;" I said, I thought something was wrong, and that I must see it - he told me I had no occasion to look for it was copper. I took him into a public-house, and found it was copper done up in canvas; it was in three square cakes. I said it was marked, and I must take him to the watch-house; he said,</p>
               <p>"I hope Mr. Carter you won't do that as you know the consequence will be I shall be convicted and have to pay a penalty of 5 l.," and it would be better for me if I had 5 l.; I said I must do my duty, and took him to the office. He knew me before.</p>

            , Esq. In February last, (I think the 26th or 27th) the prisonerapplied to me, and said he understood there was a cable on board the ship Mellish, which was for sale; (I did not know him before) I said it was an old one, and he had better go on board and see it - he returned to me the next day or the day after, and said he would purchase it. The price was 70 l., which he paid, viz 20 l. in money and a bill for 50 l., which was regularly paid. He expressed a wish to go on board and chop the cable up - I gave him an order to go on board, and do what he pleased with it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Williams and Greenfield. On the 26th of February, I delivered 1218 cakes of copper, marked W. and G., to Voss - they were put into the barge from the warehouse. I sent out no other copper of that description for a month before; but some was sent out a week or ten days afterwards, but none so early as the 2d of March. The copper produced is part of that I delivered; I speak to it from the initials, quality, and size. It is worth about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the value of the largest piece - A. I should think not less than 50 s. All the copper goes through my hands. The mark W. and G. is put on in casting it.</p>

I was on board in the afternoon when the copper was put on board, both on Thursday and Friday - it was stowed in different places in the hold, and on Monday the 3d of March, I found three cakes stowed in different places from where they originally were. Other goods had come on board so that we could not get to the copper to count it without unlading the vessel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You have not ascertained how much remains on board - A. No. There were thirty labourers employed on board getting in the cargo. I had not observed the prisoner on board.</p>

            . I am foreman of the labourers on board. On Thursday, while the copper was putting on board, I saw the prisoner there, he went between the decks, and said he had come to buy a cable - I do not know how long he stopped. He was there again on the Friday.</p>
               <p>MR. KERSHAW re-examined. Mr. Majoribanks and I are the sole owners of the vessel. These cakes of copper are much smaller than the usual size. They cost 1 s. 1 d. per l b. - one weighs 56 lbs., and the others 28 lbs. each.</p>

She left the room, and I suspected I was robbed, and missed 129 l. odd; it consisted of a 100 l., a 20 l., and a 5 l. Bank notes, and the rest in gold and silver. It was in my right hand breeches pocket. I raised an alarm - this was about eight o'clock at night. A man named Archer offered to assist me - he led me round several streets, but did not find her. I knew the numbers and dates of the notes, and stopped them next morning - they were 100 l., 19,834, 11th of October; 20 l., 3948, 24th of October, 1822. I do not know the number of the 5 l. note.</p>

On the 20th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner - I served Archer with two pints of beer; a man named Griffiths came in after him, and asked for a man in a fustian jacket; I called Archer out to him - they spoke together, and then went away again - the prisoner was behind him. Griffiths called Archer out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, it's all right" - they all went out together. I had frequently seen the prisoner in their company - Archer was tried here afterwards. M'Kinnon has since shewn me the house he went to - I know the prisoner lived there at that time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence, Written. Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was going up Upper Harley-street, in my way to Paddington-street, to see a friend - I heard a cry of Stop thief; looked up, and a man immediately passed me; I followed him with others, he turned into Devonshire-street; we did not then see him, but concluding he had gone into the mews, we took that way, and fifty yards down the mews I was pushed down by the witness, who said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I have got you;" I replied you are mistaken, I am in pursuit of the thief, who is gone on before; but he took me back to the gentleman at the house, who said</p>
               <p>"I have lost my chain and seals, have you got them, or, are you the person who took them;" being alarmed, I only declared my innocence, but the man who stopped me said he saw no one pass before me, which induced the gentleman to suspect I had robbed him. A person brought the chain and seals, which were found a short way from where I was pushed down; this strengthened the suspicion of my guilt, and I was taken to the office - these are the general facts of the case. The mews is a thoroughfare, and the man who stopped me was one hundred yards down, and the cry of Stop thief! had not reached his ear till we entered the mews in pursuit; the man we were pursuing was two hundred yards before us, therefore he could have passed the man unnoticed, and reached Weymonth-street.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 19th of February, I was there, and was the last person up, and saw that the house was fastened up carefully. About seven o'clock next morning the servants, White, and Bye, called me up; I examined the premises and found somebody must have got down the grating where the coals are let into the cellar; it was lifted up - they had then got into the cellar, and cut away the wood work of the kitchen door, and undone the bolt; they had undone the kitchen window, and got out that way. I missed a table clock from the parlour, two volumes of a folio Bible, two great coats, and a body coat, an umbrella, a cloak, and a table cloth - my keys were taken out of my body coat with my pocket book, and left behind on a table. I also missed a tea caddy, which had been filled with tea a day or two before, and a silver caddy spoon in it. I went to town immediately, had hand bills printed, and distributed at the pawnbrokers, and on Friday, the 21st, I had information, and went to Mr. Button's a pawnbroker, Battle-bridge, and saw my great coat and the tea-caddy, still locked, and the spoon in it. The prisoner was a servant of mine; he had left me about nine months, and had been in a situation at Ponder's-end - he lived in Edmonton; I saw him on the Thursday evening after the robbery on the top of the Edmonton coach, at the

I went home on getting to Edmonton, and had him taken into custody at his lodgings - he was searched, and four knives found upon him, and some tinder in a paper, and a file - one knife appears to fit the place in the door, where the wood is cut off; the constable fitted it. We found the feet of the stockings which he had on were muddy, as if he had been walking without shoes. I saw footsteps by the house in the morning, but did not notice them.</p>

I saw some candle grease outside the kitchen window where the person had got out, and the print of a footmark on the flower border, which appeared to have been made by a person without a shoe; some more footmarks were on the gravel, at a greater distance from the house, these had shoemarks, and the appearance of a piece of leather having been put on at the toe, fastened on with four nails, the marks of which were visible. When I took the prisoner into custody, there was a piece of leather on his shoe with four nails - I said,</p>
               <p>"Barnes, you ought to have put the leather here the contrary way;" it corresponded in appearance with the marks on the ground, I did not fit it. I went to his lodging to enquire for him about nine o'clock that morning, but did not find him - I was in search of him all the day, and in the evening took him. I found some pieces of wood at the house, and in his lodging three knives, and one in his waistcoat pocket, with the tinder and file. I fitted the blade of the knife to the piece of wood, it appeared to correspond with the impression; a piece had been broken out at the point of the knife, and there was a notch left in the door where it did not cut, and one piece of wood has the mark of the broken part. I asked where he had been all day; he said he had been at work at Tottenham, and said nothing about coming to town on the stage. Mr. Houghton was not with me. The file was in the paper with the tinder.</p>

I tried to get work at Tottenham, but could not, and went to town, and in crossing the fields to Newington, I overtook a man, who asked me to pawn the caddy and coat for him, and said he would give me some bread and cheese, and beer, and 1 s. - he came to Battle-bridge with me; I asked what name I should pawn them in; he said Tayley, and when we had had refreshment we parted. He said he might see me at Edmonton. This man has been brought into prison since, and put into the same ward as me - I got the Governor to move me as I did not like to be with him.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 9th of March, a little after eleven o'clock, I went out, leaving nobody at home, and taking the key with me - I returned about half-past eleven o'clock the same evening and found the door still locked; I unlocked it and went into the shop - I observed my drawers taken out of their places and put upon the counter. I went and fetched Mr. Spence, my next door neighbour; we got a light at his house, and went into the shop, and found a large screw driver and chisel - we then went up stairs into the sitting room and bed room, and found the boxes broken open, and my clothes all thrown about; I looked into a little box where I kept my money and missed twelve sovereigns, also a great quantity of wearing apparel. We then went down into the kitchen below the shop, and there found Pestell laying asleep against the door; I sent for the watchman, who took him to Islington watch-house, and there found upon him five handkerchiefs, three pair of white cotton stockings, and other things which were mine. I examined the house; they had got in at the front area door by taking out a piece where the bolt went into the post - that door opens into the area, so that they could pull it open; they had another door to enter into the kitchen, a pannel was taken out of that, and the bolts undone, which were bolted before - the shop door was forced also. I missed a quantity of tea, sugar candy, almonds, raisins, rice, and eight waistcoats, worth about 25 s., and other articles as stated in the indictment, worth more than 6 l. together. I had seen the prisoner Pestell several times before - he lived within twenty yards of my house; his father is a gardener. I do not know the other prisoners.</p>

I had been to search Day's house on Monday, the 10th of March, but found nothing; but while I was searching I saw Hatchett outside. On the 14th I had information, and went down the Hornsey-road, and took Day - I said I came for some property stolen from Mr. Birkenshaw; he said he knew nothing of any property - I took him to Worship-street; he there said if he could get bail he could recover part of the property; that he knew where it was, it was not at a house, but in a field; the Magistrate said he could not have bail, but we might take him down with us, and get the property. Gleed and I went with him down the Hornsey-road, on Saturday, the 15th, Hatchett came out of a gentleman's house with a ladder; Collins my brother officer stopped him till I came up; Day then stopped with me while Hatchett, Gleed, and Collins went some where and brought back two waistcoats. Day had said that Hatchett knew where the property was as we came along from Worship-street. I left them in Gleed's custody at the Cock, public-house at Islington.</p>

On the 20th of February, I missed a great coat and a silk handkerchief; I had put my coat over the prisoner, who went to bed before me, as he said he had a very bad cold, and asked me to do so. I awoke at half-past three o'clock; he was in bed then, and the coat over him - I awoke again between four and five o'clock, he was gone and my coat and handkerchief - the room door was wide open, and the street door also. Hickey and Carroll slept in the same room as us; they missed their coats also. Mine was worth 30 s.; I have not found it. The prisoner was taken at six o'clock the same night.</p>

On Sunday, the 2d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and took a lodging for a week; he fetched his chest and clothes; I helped him carry them up stairs - he came down and sat by the fire, and then went up stairs; the landlady went up soon after, and found him in the room where I slept; he had no business there. A young man missed his night cap about eight o'clock; I then missed my clothes; he was in bed - I went to him, and asked if he knew anything of them, he said, No; but I found them in his bag. I sent for the watchman, and gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>WM. PARKER. I keep St. Botolph's watch-house. The female prisoner came to me on the 1st of March, about five in the afternoon, and brought me nineteen sovereigns and a gold seal, and said they belonged to a man who was intoxicated, and who was then at her house asleep, and desired me to take care of it for him. Went over to the house afterwards, and saw the man. She came about an hour after, and wanted money from me to go to market. I refused, and went over to the house, and found the man dressing himself. I told him she had given me nineteen sovereigns; he said he gave her 36 l. to take care of.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is nothing to bring the charge home to the prisoners.</p>

             was a scholar under my care for two years and a half. I have seen him several times since Christmas about his settling in life. I received a letter purporting to come from him; I sealed that letter up with half a sovereign in it, and delivered it to one of my servants, directing it to Mr. B. Winter; I told the servant to deliver it to him, or to any person calling in his name. I subsequently received other letters similar to that, and always sent them back in the same way, but all of them containing larger sums than the one in question. The letter was signed R. Winter, and requested the loan of 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You ordered it to be delivered to whoever called for it - A. It was left at my door by a young man who said he would call in a quarter of an hour for an answer.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were frequently in his company - A. Yes; we went to different places together. He sent letters to people in my presence, and I believe he received answers to them; and some enclosed money. I never received any money in a letter. I had mentioned Mr. Bellamy's name to him as a gentleman disposed to do a generous action. I wrote a letter about a situation, as the prisoner said he could get me one. I never saw any of his letters to Mr. Bellamy till after this was discovered. I have seen him write letters to persons who he expected would do him a generous action; he was to reap the benefit of them himself; I had nothing to do with it. I never received any money whatever from him - he never paid any tavern bills for me. There was a letter which he wrote for me in consequence of my writing a bad hand; I delivered that to a friend of mine, and waited for the answer. I mentioned my brother's address to him, and he wrote to him, representing himself as Lieutenant Whitworth, and that he could get me a situation. I had told him Mr. Bellamy's address, and that he had assisted me, and told him I had an uncle named Wheeler. I have seen the prisoner since he was apprehended, and told him that he was in danger of being transported; that it was entirely owing to himself, and said I should pity him. I knew what he was charged with at that time. Mr. Bellamy had shown me the letters.</p>

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You met him on Saffron-hill - A. Yes, at an eating-house - he came up stairs, and introduced himself to me. I was out of employ at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BELLAMY. In consequence of what passed between Winter and me, the prisoner was apprehended, and brought to my house - I charged him with this; he said he had made the application, and received the money, and trusted I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, stated that by the prosecutor's request, he had exerted himself to get him a situation - that he had got him to write letters in his name, to Mr. Bellamy, by his consent. He came, and said</p>

I followed him into Cow-cross, and saw him go into an iron shop, and just as he entered the door, I sprung upon him, and took a piece of iron from him. The officer found two other pieces in his pocket, he begged for mercy; he earned 4 l. a week, and therefore I refused to pardon him. I have advanced him 45 l. to get his family out of distress.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and was employed on the premises. I had sent the prisoner as a labourer there the day before this occurred; Mr. Hansard called on the 26th of March, and gave me information which led me to Kerby's where I found a basket, containing a number of Dutch tiles and lead, which was cut in three pieces. and weighed about 40 lbs.; they fitted to each other. I took them to the premises, and missed some lead from a gutter by the side of a chimney, which had been pulled down the day before. I measured the lead, and from the manner it was folded, I have no doubt it was removed from the gutter. It had not been moved by my direction. I was repairing the premises for Mr. Hansard. I noticed the day before, that one of the fire places was lined with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090010"/>Dutch tiles, and white washed over, and had told the bricklayer to take them down and send them to my house, but they never were sent. As the prisoner came out of the office next day, I told him I was very sorry he should have acted in such a way, and that he was a different man to what I thought him; he smiled, and said misfortunes would happen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the tiles were taken down by your men, you cannot say - No. When I last saw the lead, it laid in the gutter covered with tiles. He only came to work for me the day before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 26th of March, before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, coming round the corner towards Newport-street, The tiles were at the top, but from his manner of carrying it, I thought there must be something heavy underneath. I followed him into Shoe-lane, to one Green, a dealer in marine stores; he put the basket on the floor. I asked what he had got; he answered nothing. I asked where he brought it from, he said, from the Old Bailey. While I was looking into the basket, he tried to get by me. I seized him, and struggled with him for ten minutes, and secured him. I produced the basket to Mr. Hansard that morning. The edges of the lead were bright and fresh cut.</p>

The prisoner was employed by me for three months; he boarded in the house, but lodged out. This property was in my warehouse shortly before it was taken. The officer came to me on Monday morning, the 24th of March, and asked if I had a lad named Tunnicliff, and produced these articles, which I knew to be ours - I compared them with the pieces in the warehouse, from which they had been cut, without our knowledge.

I found him standing at the butcher's shop nearly opposite; I think it was between one and two o'clock; when we got in, Wright held the bill in his hand, he asked Mrs. Smith, if that (Bynon) was Mr. Smith, she said</p>
               <p>"No, that is Mr. Bynon," he then held the bill in his hand towards Mr. Bynon, who took it out of his hand, folded it up and put it in his pocket; as he put it in, he asked Wright where he brought it from, he said from Mr. Devey, coal-merchant. Mr. Bynon, then took out a card, and said Here is my card; I shall detain the bill, as it has been fraudulently kept from me; he then went out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090012"/>shop; Wright turned to Mrs. Smith, and said, he should look to her for the bill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 28th of November, I placed this bill in the hands of Mr. Hatch, who offered to get it discounted by Johnson, a coal-merchant; he came to me and said, it was not convenient for Johnson to give the cash that day, but he would give a cheque for it next morning. Johnson avoided it for four or five days, and at last wrote to Hatch, stating that he detained it in part of 50 l. due to him from Hatch. I applied at Union Hall, for a summons, but the Magistrate would not interfere, but refered me to a solicitor, but Johnson took no notice; I therefore waited at Smith's. When it became due the girl fetched me; Mrs. Smith, handed it over to me; I put it into my pocket, and gave the young man my card as he states.</p>

            , I live in Nile-place, New Kent-road. I received this bill from the prisoner to get discounted. I went to Mr. Johnson, who had previously offered to discount for me, he asked me to endorse it, which I did; he said if I would call on Saturday, he would do it. I went, the clerk desired me to come on Monday, which I did, and Johnson said it was not convenient; he made the same excuse five times. I at last asked him for the bill, he said he was going out of town, and would leave it with his clerk. I went next morning, he said, if I would go down to Vauxhall-walk, it should be sent. Bynon and I went, and in half an hour the clerk brought me a note. I have never received the bill or money.</p>

We got to the end of the high wall, and then a tall man, who they called Smith, was alongside me, on my left; my right hand was to the wall, and the prisoner was close at my heels on the right, next the wall, and the other three were outside. The tall man turned his head towards me, with the pipe in his mouth, and said,</p>
               <p>"Old cock, you'll see Stockley in a moment," and on coming to the end of the wall they tripped me up, knelt upon me, and caught me by the throat; his knees were on my right chest; my head laid against the ditch; he screwed my neck round to the left, and the prisoner took my handkerchief and money out of my left pocket. It was a half-crown and two shillings in silver in my left-hand jacket-pocket; I lost a sixpence, twopence-half-penny, and some tobacco in a paper, from my right-hand pocket. I received no blows, but was very much hurt in the chest; I had two ribs broken, and my lungs injured. The prisoner was one of the four men in the house when I went in; he was sitting on my left, and talking about Malta. I was confined to my bed several weeks in consequence of the injury, and attended by the doctor. They all left me on getting my money, and ran down the lane. The watchman came on; I crawled down to the turnpike with him, and with assistance I got to Hammersmith that night. I did not see the prisoner again until I recovered, when he was in custody, in the cage, at Kensington. I went to the Goat afterwards, and the landlord knew me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did it happen - A. A little after nine o'clock in the evening. When I called on Cole, the landlord, he said he had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know me before you saw me that night - A. I was never in his company, but had seen him frequently before, driving a glass coach at Kensington at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn back to look behind you after you left the Goat - A. Yes. I saw him on my knees, taking the money out of my pocket. He was close at my heels all the way under the wall.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on Thursday, the 20th of March, as he came out of the Marquis of Granby, public-house, at Kensington. The prosecutor had described him to me the night before; Butler was with me. I fetched the prosecutor, who immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090013"/>said he was the man who took the money from his pocket, but not the man who used him ill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not represented to you that I had not been out of that place from the time the robbery was committed - A. I told him he was charged with a highway robbery; he was very particular in enquiring when and where it was - I have seen him about before. I have endeavoured to find Smith, but cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the charge. I went to the public-house with Smith, to have a pint of beer; two more came in, who were strangers to me, but Smith knew them - we sat down together, and they began talking to the prosecutor. When I came out, I turned to the right, towards a corner for a necessary purpose, and went straight home. It is unfortunate for me that he does not know the date when it happened, or I could have brought respectable witnesses, who knew I was at home at the time. The Magistrate particularly asked if he saw my hand in his pocket; he said he felt me, that he could not tell it was my hand, but he thought so. I had not been out of the town a long time before or since, and could have been taken if I was wanted. I have known Smith some time; he is a stone-mason.</p>

On the 29th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was behind my counter; it was dark - I heard a crash of glass at the shop window, which is plate glass; it made a great noise. I looked to the window, and saw different things in motion; I ran out at the private door, and saw a person running, whom I believe to be the prisoner; he was close at the corner of Castle-street - he turned along Castle-street; I followed crying Stop thief! Upon getting into Castle-street, I saw him again. He went down three turnings before he was taken, and was therefore three times out of my sight - I found him knocked down, and on the ground, in Margaret-street, Cavendish-square - I pulled him up, and brought him back to the shop. Lloyd delivered me a silver mug, value 2 l. 10 s., and a cushion, containing fifty gold pins, value 7 l. 10 s.; I had seen them in the window two hours before. I gave them to Sellers.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 9th of March, at seven o'clock, I was coming down the road, towards my master's house, and was about half a mile from the house - a man ran after me, and caught hold of me; I begged of him to let me alone; he said he would not - I said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't you may depend on it it will be worse for you;" he then let go - I went on a little way, and he laid hold of me again, and threw me down by the side of a ditch, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, if you speak again I'll murder you." He behaved very indecent to me; took up my clothes, and undid his own - I screamed out; he laid upon me, and endeavoured to posses himself of my person. Mr. Sandilands came up; he then got up and took my scarf, and ran away with it. I have seen him pass the house before, but never spoke to him. The prisoner is the man, I am certain of him. I saw him again on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I take the shawl off your neck, or off the ground - A. I do not know.</p>

            . I live at Southgate. On Sunday evening, the 9th of March, I was at home with my family - two young girls under fourteen years of age, came into the house about seven o'clock, and said there was a man murdering a woman below my house; I immediately went out with a candle, which I gave into their hands, and proceeded to the spot as fast as possible, and found the prisoner on the top of the prosecutrix in the ditch; I am sure it was him. I knew the prosecutrix before - I heard her cry in a faint voice, when I got within a short distance of her,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father" - seeing him in that situation, I said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d rascal, what are you at," and in stooping down to lay hold of him he jumped up, stooped down, and took her scarf off the ground, and ran off; it lay close by her - she immediately jumped up, threw her arms round my neck, and cried,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father," and fainted.

John said he worked for his mother next door, and not for him. We then went to his mother's, went up stairs, and began to search the room. The prosecutor went up to the soot room with John, the mother, Thomas, and another boy - I heard the prosecutor say to him, if he would tell the truth and give him his money, he would give him a crown, and would not hurt him; he had charged Thomas with stealing the money when he first came in, and he said he had not seen it. I went up, and told the prosecutor he was doing wrong in making promises, and threatened to take Thomas away, and then Thomas said, when he sifted his soot, he found this bag in it, and that he had done two more jobs that morning, and could not tell who it belonged to; that his brother had taken it to take care of for him, and he meant to advertise it. John then went out, and fetched the bag and money in, and I took them both into custody. When I got to the office, I counted the money, and found twelve sovereigns, five guineas, four half guineas, a crown piece, and six shillings.

I did my work and went away, and in quarter of an hour, he came, and told my brother, he had lost some money, and a boy named Fletcher had done it; my brother said he knew nothing about it, and directly he sent for an officer. My brother made me go up and search the dirt - I went and found the bag, and when the gentleman came again I came down, and he said it was me. I took him up to the room where the soot was, and he said he would give me a crown to say where it was - I then said I gave it to my brother to put away safe, and my brother fetched it.</p>

I have known the prisoner many years; she and her husband were in my employ in February last. She had access to the warehouse, and to the sitting-room, which the family used. On Friday, the 7th of February, I received a dividend at the Bank, of 61 l. 10 s., it consisted of six 10 l. notes, a sovereign, and a half sovereign. Mr. Bazing is my son-in-law; I paid him the next morning four of the same 10 l. notes, I received at the Bank; twenty-one sovereigns, and a half sovereign. I have no doubt that I paid him four of the same notes I received at the Bank.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at Pangbourn, Berks. At the time in question, I was living with my father-in-law, the last witness, and about the 7th of February, I received from him, four 10 l. notes, and 21 l. 10 s. in gold - I recollect that the notes were new. I immediately took the money down stairs, and asked my wife for her purse; she said it was in her reticule - I took the purse out of the reticule, put the notes in it, and returned it to the reticule, and saw no more of it - I kept the gold myself. On the 1st of March, in consequence of what my wife said, I went to Bow-street, got a search warrant, and went to my father-in-law's house at Hampstead, and saw the prisoner on her return from dinner. I was not present when the officer searched her; but I afterwards went with him to her house, in Horse and Groom-yard - we there found a box, which was locked; we took the box to my father-in-law's, and the prisoner produced a key, which opened it, and in it we found my wife's purse, containing two 10 l. notes, and a 5 l. note, which the officer took into his possession.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 8th of February, I saw him put the 10 l. notes into my purse; I had no occasion to look at them for a fortnight after, when I changed one of the 10 l. notes and received 7 l. in change. I gave my brother change on the 27th, for a 5 l. note, which I also put into my purse, and put that into my reticule, and laid the reticule on the piano-forte, in the sitting-room, at my father's house, and on the 28th, I missed my reticule, and its contents; there was a quarter of a hundred of needles also in it.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 1st of March, I accompanied Mr. Bazing to Mr. Paxon's, and saw the prisoner in the counting-house, sitting at work - I searched her, and found in her pocket, a 5 l. note, put into a small piece of leopard skin. I then went to her own house, where I found a box, which I brought to Mr. Paxon's, and asked her for the key of it - she said she had something to say to me; I had neither promised or threatened her; she gave me the key, and said she found the purse on the ground, that the purse was in that box - I opened the box, and found two 10 l. notes, a 5 l. note, and a paper of needles, inside the purse. She said she had paid a butcher's bill with part of the money. While she was untying her pockets, I thought she was a long time about it; she threw her pockets on the sofa, and some gold was afterwards found on the sofa.</p>
               <p>MRS. BAZING. The purse is mine; the needles are No. 7, which is the size I lost. I went out with my brother on the 27th, after seeing it safe, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and took my reticule with me, and brought it back. I had no occasion to open it while I was out.</p>

I searched her pockets, and found a purse containing 1 s. 6 d. which she said was her own. I asked her what money she had; she said she had none at all; that was all she had. On searching further, in the hem at the bottom of her petticoat I found a sovereign sewed in, and a half sovereign in the hem of her gown. I said if she did not tell me where to find the half sovereign I should take her things off. She said she had no more; I did not find any more.</p>

            , JUN. I live in Squirry-street, Bethnal-green. On the 17th of January, between five and six o'clock, I was returning home from my warehouse in Lawrence-lane, and stopped at the corner of Bell-square, Moorfields, (I shewed the spot to Mr. Wontner,) for a necessary purpose. A man stopped by me apparently for the same purpose; he was a stranger; then another man came up and laid hold both of me and the other person. I cannot recollect the person to swear to him. I had not buttoned up my clothes at that time, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have caught you, I have caught many so." I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean," he said, we had committed an unnatural crime, and he would take us to the watch-house, if we did not give him some money. The other man seemed frightened, and asked what he wanted, he said, he must have 10 l. between us. The other man said, he would give him a sovereign and his watch. The man then said, I must give him 5 l. I said, I did not know what he meant, and that I had no money, I had done nothing to cause any suspicion, and that it was a false charge; then the man who laid hold of me, said, he must go home with me, and I must give him some, and as I came along, he asked, if I would give him 50 s. The other man continued with him. I said, I had no money, (nor had I any,) he then asked for 1 l., and then he asked, if I had any money about me, I said No; he then asked if I had a watch, I said, No. They went on with me to my own door. I stopped there and he asked for 10 s., I said, I did not think I had so much in the house, he said, I must go in and get what I could, and bring it out, and they would wait until I brought it out, I went in and told my wife all that had happened; I heard a knock at the door, I went out at the back door, to my father-in-law and told him all that had passed; he lives three quarters of a mile off. I stopped there all night, and returned to my house next day between nine and ten o'clock, and found the prisoner in the house; my father-in-law was with me, and asked him what he wanted, he said all the blunt he could get. He asked what he meant, he said, he must have four sovereigns. He asked how he got his living; he said, he was a bookbinder and would write his address down, and wrote something on a paper which is lost. I don't know what it was. An officer was sent for and he was detained.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I wanted you to go with me to the other man - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER. I accompanied the prosecutor to a spot which he shewed me, it is in the City.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor, he came home on the 17th of January, from the warehouse between six and seven o'clock, he seemed rather alarmed and trembled, and said, two men were waiting at the door; one of them had accused him of a crime that he did not know the name of, and told me the particulars; he had scarcely finished before I heard a knock at the door, he then went out at the back door; I went to the street door, and saw two persons, I could not say whether the prisoner was one of them; it was dark; I asked them what they wanted, one of them said,</p>

               <p>"Is the young man the weaver at home," I said he is not; one of them said it is false, and used a very improper expression, and said he had better come forward and face him like a man. I shut the door and heard a knock again; I went up stairs and opened the window, two persons were still there, I asked them what they wanted, they said to see the young man; I said he was not at home, they said it is false - I said I would be on my oath that he was not, they said I was a false woman; they would not take my word. I said, if they had any message to leave, I would tell him when he came home, they said it was not a woman's business, and they would not leave their message. One of them asked if I had a husband, (that was a different man to the one who spoke before,) I said Yes; they asked if he was at home, I said No, he then said</p>
               <p>"Why do not you open the door and let the gentlemen in to search the house, then we shall be satisfied whether he is there or not;" I refused, he then said to the other,</p>
               <p>"Why do not you break open the door;" the other said, he had better come forward, and face it like a man, it would be better for him, and asked what public-house he used, I said I did not know; then a voice which I am certain was the prisoner's, asked what sign of public-houses there was near, I said I did not know that; there was the sign of the Hoop near; they then consulted together and the prisoner's voice said,</p>
               <p>"Suppose we meet him here to-morrow morning at his own house, at nine o'clock," the other said,</p>
               <p>"It shall be so" - they called up to me, and said they would meet him there at nine o'clock, and it would be better for him to face them like a man, they then went away, they were at the door about half an hour, I went to my father's and found my husband there, I told them, and I went home. The next morning my father came early, and the prisoner came between nine and ten o'clock; I opened the door to him, he asked if the young man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090018"/>at home, I told him to walk in; he did so; I shewed him into the back room, where my father-in-law was waiting for him; I then fetched my husband's uncle Samuel, and after that I heard him tell my father, he was come to get what blunt he could. My father asked him what he meant, he said he would not take less than four sovereigns; my father asked what it was for; he said to give to the other man who was with him the over night; my father asked where he was, he said, at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Fleet-market, or the Mail Coach, Fleet-street, he could not tell which.</p>

            , SEN. I am the father of the prosecutor. I live in John-street, Bethnal-green, and am a weaver; I first heard of this on the morning after it happened, I went to my son's house about nine o'clock, and about three quarters of an hour after, my son's wife let the prisoner in, he was shewn into the room where I was; I asked what his pleasure was, he asked if the young man was at home, I said</p>
               <p>"What is your pleasure with him;" he said, to speak him privately, very particular, and what was for his good, I said, I suppose you are one of the chaps that followed him home last night, he said, he was. I asked what he came for, he made no reply, I sent for my brother and when he came, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"This is not the person I want." We asked what he came for; he said, for what he could get. I heard him use the word blunt, I asked him how he got his living; he said his father was a respectable man, a liveryman of the City, and that he was a stationer and bookbinder, living in Fenchurch-street. I said it was a pity his father did not know it, and if he would give me his direction I would let him know it. He said he could do his business without his father. I went up then for a piece of paper for him to write his address, and then left him as the officer was come; he never offered to take us to the other man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are one who was accused with him" - A. No. I said, I suppose you are one of the two who followed him home.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's uncle. I first heard of this on the following morning. I got to the house about a quarter to ten o'clock. The prisoner was in the back room. I asked what he wanted. He said,</p>
               <p>"You are not the young man, I want the young man I was with last night." I said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I am not the young man you want, I wish I was, for if I had been you would not have got off quite so easy as you did. I wish I had known as much last night as I do this morning, I would have had you and the other one put in the watch-house." I then asked him how he got his living. He said his father was a respectable man, and a liveryman of the city of London. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry he has not got a very respectable son." He then said his father was a bookbinder, living in Fenchurch Street, and that he followed the business. I went there, but could find no such person. I then asked what he came for. He said, to get what blunt he could, to take it to the other man. I asked where at - he said, at the Mail Coach and Horses, Fleet-street, or Fleet-market, he did not know which. The officer came and took him. He never offered to shew me where the other man was. He wrote something on a piece of paper for a direction, but what it was I do not know. He afterwards said his father was a chimney-sweeper, and lived in Northumberland-alley, Fenchurch-street - which I found was right.</p>
               <p>WM. PUNNELL. I am a weaver. I live near Mr. Dowsett. On the night of the 17th of January the prosecutor came to me - I am his father-in-law - he gave this account. My daughter came some time afterwards - I saw her home; and next morning, about a quarter to ten o'clock, I went to his house, and found the prisoner there. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is your business here" - He said, he was one of the party who was with Dowsett last night. I asked what he was come for - The word blunt was mentioned - I thought he meant money. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is blunt" - he said he must have four sovereigns to take to the other person. I asked him where the other person was; and why he did not come with him. He said he was to meet him at the Coach and Horses, or Mail Coach, in Fleet-market, or Fleet-street. The officer came and took him. He wrote on a piece of paper,</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the morning of the 18th of January, a little after ten o'clock. When I entered the room I asked him a few questions about his business - he answered, as the last witness has stated. He said he came for four sovereigns to take to the man. I took him in charge. He said he was no thief, and I need not confine him as such. I said, if he did not make a better tale out before the magistrate he would be committed. I advised him to send for his friends to speak for him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated, that he was going on an errand, and had occasion to stop at the corner of Bell Square, that the prosecutor also stopped for the same purpose, when another man came up and accused them. Dowsett said, if he would let him go, he would give him any thing. The man asked for 5 l. from each; and Dowsett said, if he would come home with him he would give him what he demanded. But when he got close to his house, he said, he did not think he had so much, but if he appointed where to meet him, he would bring him the sum on Wednesday. The man refused to wait. Dowsett said, if he came to-morrow, he would meet him and the prisoner. That he went in, and the man kept menacing him (the prisoner) about what he would do if he did not procure him some money. Being terrified, he did not know what to do. The prosecutor did not come out, and the man getting outrageous at his not coming out, a female answered out of the window, that Dowsett was not at home, but had left word for him to call at nine o'clock next morning, when he said the prisoner might fetch him to meet the prosecutor, at the Coach and Horses, at nine o'clock, or bring the money. That he, the prisoner, never spoke to Mrs. Dowsett; nor did he use the word blunt at the house.</p>

I walked with her a little way up the street, and turned up <placeName id="t18230409-35-crimeloc188">Half Moon-alley</placeName>

She turned into Leadenhall-street; I stopped looking at her, and saw her turn into Leadenhall-market; I did not go after her, but put my hand to my pocket and missed my purse; I then went after her, but could not find her; I told the watchman; I went down to Lime-street, and met with her in Lime-street with a cloak under her arm, which she had on before; I stopped her and said she had robbed me; she denied it. The watchman came up and took her; I saw her drop the purse when he took her; the silver was in it, but not the sovereign; I knew the purse to be mine; she had asked me for a shilling, but I gave her nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you not a little tipsey - A. I was not; I am sure she is the woman; the alley is not very dark; I did not pull out my purse or give her any money; I had nothing to do with her.</p>

            . I am watchman of Lime-street. On the night of the 20th of March, about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor came to me by the private door of the India House; I saw the prisoner first, and then I saw the prosecutor go after her, and say "You are the one who robbed me." She denied it; I endeavoured to search her, and saw her throw the purse down; I picked it up, and asked the prosecutor what he had lost, he said a sovereign, and 18 s. or 19 s. in a green purse; I found 19 s. in silver in it, but no sovereign; he described the purse by a hole at the end of it; he appeared sober. When the constable searched her, a sovereign fell from her bosom without any paper; the prosecutor said his was wrapped in paper.</p>

On the 26th of March, I was opposite the Mansion House, and seeing a crowd, I crossed over to them - the prisoner was there, and the prosecutor's boy accusing him of robbing his master; I detained him. Mr. Woodward charged him with it - I asked him what he had done with the cheque; he said he threw it away with other papers, in Fleet-street. I asked him if the money was all in gold; he said No, there was a 5 l. note, and gold and silver, amounting to about 11 l.</p>

I got over a hedge to watch - East was driving his team just behind. They stopped their horses, and the corn sack of coals was shifted from my waggon to East's. Roby was bringing coals from the wharf. I went up, and asked what he had done with them; he said he knew nothing of it.

I first became acquainted with the prisoner on the 1st of February - he resided at the Steyne-hotel; I believe he was there eight or ten days after I first knew him, and hired saddle horses of me. I went out with him twice myself, and he had a horse several times after that; he borrowed 2 l. of me. On the 11th of February, about nine o'clock, he sent to me for a horse by the person who had been in the habit of coming from him before; I let the person have it, and expected it to be returned in about three hours; it was not returned that day, and in the evening, about eleven o'clock, I enquired at the hotel, but he was not there. I waited till twelve o'clock, and then set off to town, on horseback; I arrived between six and seven o'clock; and met him in Holborn, between ten and eleven, on my horse. I seized it by the bridle, and took him to St. Giles's watch-house, and at a public-house opposite Marlborough-street Office, he proposed to pay a bill he owed me and my expences, to be liberated. I went to the office, and returned to him - he said he would pay, and Furzman asked what means he had of paying; he said he had a bill that he would send to the Bank - he produced a bill; it was given to Furzman to send or take to the banking-house of Jones, Lloyd, and Co., to see if they would honour it. I saw him write on the back of it. Bartlett took it to the bankers'; he was detained till he returned, and said it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. He had hired horses and returned them - A. Yes; but never kept them beyond a day. He knew he was to remain in custody till the messenger returned from the bankers'.</p>

            , to where her husband (the prisoner) worked, in St. Mary-axe - she had been separated from him; I had known her two or three years, but I never saw him before this happened; she and I waited together a few minutes, (it was then a little past eight o'clock,) and I saw the prisoner come out, she said,</p>
               <p>"Marshall, is that you," and caught hold of his coat. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be in a passion," (she did not appear in a passion;) he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, what do you want;" she said she came for 3 s., her weekly sum, and that it was a great deal too little. He said if she was not satisfied with that, she should have no more, and he would sooner leave the country - there was a great deal of talk. She said,</p>
               <p>"It's a hard winter, and I am in debt for rent,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090021"/>give me a shilling or two more" - he gave her the three shillings, and said he had no more for her. She tried to persuade him to give her more; he said he had had good advice from four or five Magistrates, and he would fix her - she said if he would not hear her in the street, she would go home to his house - they then parted; she lived at No. 4, Moor-lane. I told him he must pardon my interfering, but the poor old lady had been very ill, and was in arrears for rent and 3 s. was very little; he asked if I lived in the same house as her, I said No; we parted, she went home, and about quarter before ten o'clock I accompanied her to his house; I went in with her and was told he was a bed - I sat down and got into conversation with the woman of the house for a short time, and he came out of the bed room on the same floor; no message had been sent to him; I suppose he heard our voices - I think he was dressed, but his night cap was on - he came out with a sword in his hand, and brandished it about, and said</p>
               <p>"d - n your eyes I'll kill you both." The people of the house ran round the table; his wife got up and run. I was struck to the ground by the fright; I tried to go up stairs, but not knowing the house, I got into a corner; he struck at me with the sword; not a word had passed between us before; the clock had struck; and his wife said</p>
               <p>"That is my clock," I worked hard for it; I was the first person he struck at; the first blow I received was on the head. He looked more like a madman than a man in his senses. I received a blow on my shoulder also. I got in the corner as I was afraid of my life; he called out</p>
               <p>"Come out d - n you, or I will kill you or murder you." I said "I will come out, but do not strike me;" his wife had got to the door and got out; but she was wounded on her arm. I had got the poker and shielded it off; his wife opened the door and cried murder, and the watchman came up. I believe I received four or five blows; the people of the house had run up stairs crying murder. I had one wound in the shoulder, one in my hand, and one in my head. They are nothing to mention. I was bruised in my arm; he struck with the sword, but I suppose it must be with the left side of it; his wife had been separated from him two or three years. I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you first saw him in the street, did not the wife take hold of him by the collar - A. No; she took hold of his waiscoat by the breast. I told her not to be in a passion. I went to make peace between them. I went to accompany her.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking her not a match for him - A. I do not think she was; one son lives with her; another is married, and lives with him. I was sober and believe she was; I never saw her in liquor. I did not threaten to break the windows, nor did she - she went there to fetch her son, and persuaded me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the supper table spread, and seated yourselves - A. I did not sit down till I was asked; we were laughing when he came into the room. I took and held the poker up, but never flourished it; but by God's providence it saved my life.</p>

            . I am assistant to a surgeon. I was called up, by the prosecutrix, about one o'clock. I examined her wounds - she had one on the back of her head, a very slight one, and a slight cut on each shoulder - the blow on one shoulder must have been done with the same stroke as that on the head. There was also a slight cut on her thumb; they appeared to be done by a sharp instrument - none of them were at all dangerous. I dressed them three or four times - they were perfectly healed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you were not a surgeon you would not call them wounds - A. I should call them slight wounds.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of February, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, my attention was drawn to the house, by hearing female voices calling murder, and watch, repeatedly. I got within the threshold of the street door, and saw the shadow of a man, with a cutlass in his hand. He shut the door in my face. The prosecutrix and the wife were then outside the door. The wife lifted up her arm, and shewed me where she was struck; Harding had a cut on her head, the blood was running down on her neck. I persuaded them to go to the watch-house. I heard no more of it. Marshall's wife knocked at the door. I heard a man's voice, saying,</p>
               <p>"If you don't go about your business, I'll blow your brains out." She seemed in a violent passion to get in, and said it was her house. I took both the women to the watch-house, and on the following day they got a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say they talked loudly - A. They had not much power to speak - they were too much confused. The wife knocked at the door, in a great passion, and said it was her house. I think she had had a drop - the prosecutrix appeared sober.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated that his wife had been in the habit of getting intoxicated for the last twenty years, pawning his property, running him in debt, and cohabiting with other men; in consequence of which, he was resolved to live no longer with her, and allowed her three shillings a week; but on the day in question, he met the prosecutrix and her, who abused him much in the street; and as he was going to bed, he was greasing his sword, to prevent its rusting, and, unfortunately having it in his hand, he went out with it, hearing them abuse him, and not intending to injure them, he said,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the house." The prosecutrix caught up the poker, and brandished it at him; he lifted up the sword to ward of the blows, and she might have received a cut, but not intentionally; for had he intended it, one blow must have been mortal.</p>

I saw the prosecutrix on the 23d; her wounds were very trifling. The prisoner has been an old soldier; and, if he had intended to give her a blow, he would have destroyed her instantly.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 20th of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at Hyde Park-corner alone - I was sweeping a crosssing; he came up to me, and asked if I could ride a horse; I said Yes - he said he would give me 18 d. to take a horse for him down to Fleet-market; he had none with him. I said I would; he left me, and returned in about half an hour - I saw him coming along; a man was with him leading a horse in the road, and another man dressed as a soldier. It was a dark brown horse, and I think was blind - he came up and asked me to lend him three half-pence to pay the turnpike, and he would give me a handkerchief as security for the money; I did so, and received the handkerchief. I saw them go through the turnpike - he gave the halfpence to the man who led the horse - all the three men came through with the horse; I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not particularly notice the horse - A. No; I cannot be positive to the colour, or whether it was blind; I think it was - the soldier was in his company. It was not dark.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Rhodes, of Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; he is a horse slaughterer. The prisoner came to the yard on Thursday afternoon, the 20th of March, about five o'clock; another man was leading the horse, and a soldier with them - it was a dark brown mare, blind with both eyes, and very old. The prisoner asked if I would buy it, I said Yes; he asked 20 s. for it - I offered 14 s.; he said he had been bid 16 s. for it; I then agreed for 16 s.; I had not enough money about me, but gave him 10 s. in the yard, and went and borrowed 8 s. of Mr. Bagnell - then we all four went to the Castle public-house, in Cow-cross. I paid him the 6 s. there, had something to drink, and they left me; I never saw him before. The prosecutor came and claimed it. I delivered it to him and his partner at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it fit for any thing but slaughter - A. No; I gave the full value, and do not think it was fit for work - we should have killed it, if it had not been owned - very few words passed between us. He said he bought it in Smithfield-market.</p>

Last Wednesday week, about half past twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoners in Bow-street, as I was going to the Rainbow, public-house, King-street, to sleep. I heard somebody talking, and met them coming up Bow-street - they asked me to give them a glass of something to drink - I went with them to the Brown Bear, public-house; I drank nothing. We left the house - when we came out they asked for something to eat; I took them to a house a door or two from the Brown Bear, and gave them something, but took nothing myself. We came out; they asked me to go home with them; I walked up Bow-street with them to <placeName id="t18230409-42-crimeloc219">Broad-court</placeName>

Previous to this, as we went up Broad-court they stopped behind several times, and whispered to each other, and when I turned round under the archway, Francis said to the other, 'now now'; they immediately came, and both clasped me round the waist, and Scott snatched my watch from my fob - they both ran off as hard as they could, and I after them; Scott turned round, put out her hand and gave something to Francis as they ran; I could not see what it was. When they came down to the middle of the court they ran different ways - I followed Scott, and took her half way down the court - I felt my watch taken; I had looked at it in the eating-house, and am sure I had it in the court. While I was holding Scott, and calling Watch! the people collected, and six or seven minutes after Francis returned, and asked what was the matter - I have not found the watch; it was worth 10 l., with the appendages.</p>

While I was taking up my stick, a fourth man came in, but I did not take much notice of him. The prisoners Read and Kelly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090023"/>are two of the three. When I came out I left the four men and the two women in the parlour - I went out at the front door, turned up against a railing for a necessary purpose on the right hand, and then proceeded down the steps, and saw two men on the left; one on the right as if waiting for somebody to come down - when I got on the last step, the one on the right put his right hand on my fob, and his other hand on my collar - he put his hand outside my apron, took hold of the watch chain, and demanded what I had got; the other two, on the left, directly seized me by the throat, and throttled me so that I could not call for assistance. I attempted to strike the one who seized my chain, with my stick, but being so close, I had not power to strike. A struggle ensued, and one of the two said,</p>
               <p>"You b - r, if you don't let go, we will do your job for you." I still struggled with them and got one of them towards the door of

I then opened the door, and went out; it was dark - the lamp gave a very bad light. I saw Jones, who I knew, laying on the ground, a short distance from my house, and three men at a little distance from him - I helped Jones up. I found his hat a little way from him, and put it on his head - he appeared exhausted. I said to them,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you go about your business, and let the man alone." I had not seen them do any thing. I led Jones towards his house; the three men followed; one of them took hold of my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"He has robbed a man of his handkerchief," and while I was speaking, the other two knocked Jones down - he got up, and was knocked down a second time. I said,</p>
               <p>"You'll kill the man." Two of them went up the steps; one of them, a short man, who wore white stockings, had Jones's hat in his hand. Neither of the three prisoners are the men who held my arm, I am certain, for that was a tall man. I cannot say that either of the prisoners is the one who had the hat. A woman came to the door of No. 7, with candles, and then they went away.</p>

On the 3d of March, Jones came to my house, and went into the parlour, where the three prisoners were - there was also a fourth man, taller than them, and two women - one was the wife of Sweeney, the tall man; and the other was the wife of one of the prisoners, but I do not know which. They had all four been to the house before, and sometimes used it. They have lived in the neighbourhood for years. When Jones went, he left them there; and in eight or ten minutes, they all four went to the door - the women remained. They all returned in about ten minutes, and went into the parlour. I did not see whether they brought any thing with them. They stopped nearly an hour after, and went away together with the women. Two other young men had been in after Jones left, and stopped till after the prisoners left. I cannot say, whether either of them had on white stockings. I found a hat in the parlour next morning. I do not know who brought it there. It was delivered to Jones's servant.</p>

Yes; the two young men came in after Jones went out, and before the four returned - the prisoners were drinking at my house the night before they were apprehended; they are respectable tailors, and have lived in the neighbourhood many years.</p>

We went to bed a little past eleven; I had these notes and bills in my pocket book, and in my purse was twenty-four sovereigns and a half guinea. I did not lock my room door. I have the numbers and dates of all the notes. When I went to bed my pocket book was in one trowser pocket and my purse in the other; when I awoke, about seven o'clock in the morning, my trowsers were on the floor, close to the chair; I believe I had put them on the chair; I was not disturbed in the night. I had received the 10 l. notes at the Bank a few days before, and at that time took the numbers and dates; they were all dated the 5th of November, 1821, and numbered from 6117 to 6131, both inclusive. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner there that evening with another person named Durley, alias Smith; they came together, and both slept there in one room on the third floor. They went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and left about seven next morning. They had blue trowsers and Wellington boots on when they went away, very muddy, and would not wait to have them cleaned. The prosecutor slept on the second floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you do not know whether he has any rich relations - A. I understand he has. He shewed me the sovereigns, and said he had done it, and could do it again, and almost pointed out the house where he did the robbery. He said there was a board sticking up to tell where he had done the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you do your last work - A. On Saturday; I worked for Mr. Christian. When I knew him, he lodged at my brother's house, which is the way I knew him. I never saw him with much cash before.</p>

            . I live in Catherine-street, Commercial-road. On the 18th of December, 1821, I went to Moulsey-hurst - the prisoner was one of the party, and Moriatt also. I saw Durley alias Smith there; he and the prisoner were dressed in Wellington boots, blue trowsers, and fustian shooting jackets, and new silk hats. The prisoner and Durley paid all the expences of the trip between them. Warren, the Excise-officer, is my brother-in-law; the prisoner bought a new silver hunting watch of him, on the 19th of December, 1821. The prisoner, I, and the party at the fight, had agreed to meet next morning, at the Star, public-house, and they came to us again in the evening, at the Roe-buck, public-house, Commercial-road, and we were to meet them next morning in Albion-street - we went there, but did not see them. A woman at the door said, the officers were in the house, and we had better go. I met the prisoner that day, and asked how long he had been from No. 12, Albion-street; he said not long - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you not had some curious visitors there this morning," he said, No. I said if he had done anything he had better not go there again - he swore at me, and went away towards Albion-street, and in ten minutes after he came running to me, and begged of me to run with him; we both run to a public-house, at the back of the London Hospital, and had some refreshments; he said it would not be proper for him to be seen in Albion-street again, and begged I would not betray him - I said I would not. I saw him next day at Hackney. The last time I saw him was the 1st or 2d of January, 1822, and from that time not till eight months after.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 20th of December, 1821, I went to No. 12, Albion-street, Commercial-road, and saw a girl there - I asked for Bob and George; she said they were out. I searched the rooms, and found a blue surtout coat. I know Durley, I saw him at the office six months after the robbery, dressed in this shooting jacket, which was taken from him, (producing it) - he has been tried since.</p>

On the 24th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner jump over a hedge into a field, where I was, with a bundle of things; he ran towards Margaret-street, towards town. I followed and saw his face. When he got up to the canal, I saw him throw the things in - I took them out, and delivered them to Algar afterwards, and gave an alarm. He was brought back in a moment - I secured him. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was I from you - A. He passed close by me - I was cleaning the ditch out. I saw his face plainly, and called to him to stop; but he would not. When he was brought back, he said the handkerchief that contained the things belonged to him. I pulled them all out of the canal directly, and saw him knocked down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 8th of April, at No. 28, George-street, Manchester-square, where she was in service. She opened the door, and I said, I wanted to speak to her, about some money lost by the prosecutor, at No. 12, Circus-street. She said, she knew nothing at all about it - she had the newspaper in her hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I must go up to my mistress, for she is very ill a bed." I said,</p>
               <p>"Are there no other servants in the house." She said,</p>
               <p>"No." I allowed her to go up stairs; I stopped in the passage; she came down in two or three minutes, with a water bottle, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am going to get some water for my mistress." She went down, and stopped longer than I thought necessary; and when she came up, I asked her what had made her so long. See said, she had been filling the kettle. I then went down stairs with her in the front area, and found some wearing apparel, quite new, thrown there behind an empty beer cask. I said.</p>
               <p>"This is what made you stay so long down stairs." She said, she was very sorry for it; and, if I would accompany her to her friends, she would make the money good, - I had neither promised nor threatened her. The wearing apparel consisted of a bonnet, silk scarf, bombazeen and cotton gown, and some muslin. I asked her where the rest of the money was.

            . I am a constable. On Monday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Paul's-alley, Redcross-street; I asked him what he had under his coat, he said what was that to me - I said I insisted on knowing - he said he was only going a little way with it, and that he picked it up somewhere about Whitechapel; that he did not know what was in it. I took him into Mr. Reeves's, broke it open, and found it was snuff; a bill in it lead me to Mr. Sykes's - he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090027"/>nothing about Cooper then. But two days after he said Cooper gave it him; he also said he had sent a private letter to the Alderman that contained all about it. I took Cooper before the Alderman.</p>

The prisoners were two of the four; I sent for Jackson, the officer, to be on the watch - I saw the prisoner standing next door and go over to Mr. Duthoit's door. Tilyard placed himself by the doorpost, and Copper went in and brought out the box from the inner door, put it down close by Tilyard at the outer door, looked down the street, then put it on his shoulder.

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Calvert, who have premises in the Ward of Dowgate. On Saturday, the 8th of March, between five and six o'clock, Mr. Church called on me, saying, some boys were taking some lead off an empty house, in <placeName id="t18230409-54-crimeloc290">Red Bull Yard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230409-54-crimeloc290" type="placeName" value="Red Bull Yard"/>

                        targets="t18230409-54-off288 t18230409-54-crimeloc290"/>. I went with him into a house which commanded a view of the premises. I saw Means cutting away the lead from the gutters in front of the house, and a little boy with him. We went down, and got into the house by the staircase window, and found the sink cut away. I went up stairs, and found the house a complete wreck; the tiles and partitions all torn away; the gutters taken away; the edge of the lead was quite bright; the pipes too were cut away, and gone. There was a window open at the back part of the premises. I found the prisoners down in a place where Mr. Calvert's empty butts were; we took them to the watch-house. On Means we found two steels, two flints and two matches, and a small piece of lead in his pocket, fresh cut - but nothing on the other. I asked what they had done with the lead they had cut away. Sharboard said I should find five pieces down by the cellar flap. We found about 3/4 of a cwt. there. There has been about a ton stolen in all. Sharboard said, they had lived in the house four days, and had had a fire there, made of wood torn from the wainscot. They said they had sold it to a man over the water, at Chain-gate. I have known Sharboard a long time, and believe he has a good character before.</p>

He drove towards home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. - Q. Have you never said that it was dark - A. It was towards dusk. I was thirty or forty yards from the dray - the letter T was chalked on the cask; I said nothing to him, but informed Mr. Basset, the cask inspectors, eleven or twelve days after, a bill was posted up, offering a reward of 5 l., that lead me to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That induced you to go him - A. That lead me to him; but it was not particularly for the money. I only know the prisoner by sight. I have called at his house. He is a brewer. I have been at work nearly all the winter. When I have no work on my own account, I do journey-work.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Was the reward offered for this theft in particular - A. No; for any person stealing casks. I was attending a Captain, who I expected to go abroad with, which prevented my giving information, for if I had gone abroad I could not have given evidence.</p>

I was sitting in a little back room; nobody was in the shop; I heard a noise of glass falling,; I then went in and saw a man's hand inside the window; he had hold of a cheese. I called Stop thief! I saw the cheese go out of the window in the man's hand; there were two candles in the shop, one stood near the window, and the other at the end of the shop. I saw his face as I went towards the door distinctly. I opened the inner shop door leading into the passage, but when I came to the street door, I found it tied with a cord, so that I could not immediately open it. I gave it three sudden jerks, and the gimblet which fastened it gave way. I ran out with a stick, and in about an hour I met him in Church-street, going into the King's Head, public-house. I said nothing, but sent an officer to take him. I missed the two other pieces of cheese from the window; when I returned, after he was taken. I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of March, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I went out of my room to the chandler's shop, to buy a candle - I returned in about five minutes; my room is the back garret. I pulled the street door to when I went out, but I do not know whether I shut it or not. When I came back I put the key in the key hole, and opened it. I went into the passage; I had no light. There was a man inside the door, who said,</p>
               <p>"Is that Mr. Leacy," I said it was - he asked if I was not going to force the law against him, for robbing me - I said, were it not that he had robbed me I would not. I know by the voice that it was the prisoner; he said he would give me more reason to do it, and rose his hand to strike me; I put up my two hands up to catch his, and I caught a knife in his hand - he drew it through my hand, and cut it. He struck at me with the knife, and cut me in the breast; I had hold of the knife all the time - he thrust it through my hand into my breast; it penetrated through my clothes, and the skin of my breast - he only struck me once; we caught each other, and struggled about. I ran to the stairs. I received a cut in the back part of my left hand in the struggle; I cannot say whether it was done by accident or not. Two women came down from the first floor, with a light in their hands; he then went out at the street door, taking the knife with him. The wound was not very deep in my breast - I had seen him two days before this affair; we had no quarrel. I suspected him of breaking open my box. I met him in Oxford-street, and told him so, and desired him to send me home what he had taken from me, or I would go before a Magistrate for a warrant - he told me not to bother him; this was all that passed. I did not see him again till I found him in the passage. I went to the watchman the night it happened. Both my hands were cut. I did not go to the doctor at all about it.</p>

            . I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 18th of March. Leacy came to the office and produced the clothes he wore that day. Here is a mark on the shirt which the knife went through, and also on his jacket and apron.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that the prosecutor had run away from Ireland last summer; and in order to gain the affections of the prisoner's wife, had represented her as inconstant, in consequence of which the prisoner left her for six months, and found she was living with the prosecutor, and on going to demand her the prosecutor produced a spring bayonet, and threatened to run him through, and swore he would put an end to his life, and if his wife returned to him he would be her butcher. That upon her returning to live with the prisoner he detained her box, clothes, and some duplicates; it then went on to state as follows: -</p>
               <p>"he took his oath that if she would come and stop in the passage he would bring her box down. She went, he locked her in the privy, fetched his bayonet down, and swore he would take her life if she did not go up to his room, which she was obliged to do, and he kept there till six o'clock the next morning, with his spring bayonet drawn for fear she should scream. She told me this on the morning of the 15th, and I went to his room to correct him - found the door unlocked and brought the box away, it being mine - he went to swear a robbery against me, but could not make it out, and so he swore I way-laid him in the passage and stabbed him, and that he saw me by the light of the lamp, and there is no lamp near the door - this is a plot between him and my wife to take my life that they may live together."</p>

I said I do not know that; I went across the room to a box which I had padlocked in the morning, and found the padlock forced off, and several things taken out and placed in a chair behind the door. I took him to the watch-house - several things were lying on the floor, and two sticks which had hung on a nail were lying there too; a hat had been taken from the box and put in a chair, also a shawl of my mother's, who lives with me, but was not at home - two boxes had been opened. Some handkerchiefs were in the chair, but I do not know from which box they were taken - nothing but the hat belonged to me. I cannot say whether Cowell was in the house when it happened.</p>

On some night in March last, about nine o'clock at night, I was down in the kitchen; I heard the street door bang; I ran up and missed the clock out of the front parlour; I had been there about half an hour before, but did not notice it. The front door was fast when I left the parlour; nobody had been out for three or four hours before. I immediately went down to the watch-house and found the clock - a small red trunk, a tea pot, and cream jug. The trunk contained the other articles as stated in the indictment. I had seen them all safe about two o'clock that afternoon. The trunk was in the bed-room on the same floor as the parlour. The cream jug and tea pot were in the front parlour, the window of which was open, there is a palisade before the door.</p>

They joined him and went down Spring-street, and down York-place. The servant came out calling watch; I directed the watchman which way they were gone; they had passed close me, and to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man who came out of the house, he had a long dark blue coat, but I can not speak to his face.

            . I am the watchman of Spring-street. On the 26th of March, about nine o'clock in the evening, when I was in York-street, I heard the call of watch; I went into Paddington-street, and saw a hackney-coach moving on; and just as I overtook it, it stopped, as one of the springs gave way. Another coach was close by the side of it; I went between the two coaches with my lanthorn; both the doors were open. There were four men in the coach which had broken down; two of them got into the other coach, the third man went off, and the fourth was the prisoner; he had a clock in his hand. I was holding my lanthorn up, he said,</p>
               <p>"Watchman I don't want a light, thank you." He was going to hand the clock to the coachman of the coach which had been called, I said,</p>
               <p>"I will hand that in myself if you please." I took it from his hand and kept it, and when he got out himself and was getting into the other coach, I collared him; he asked why I did that. I said, I had information that a clock was stolen, and suspected him; he said it was his own, and that he was a clock-maker by trade. I put the clock into the coach and sprang my rattle; but on taking him towards the pavement he struggled; gave a turn and both his coats came off. I dropped them and seized him round the body and sprang my rattle; the watchman came; one of the other men were taken, and both taken to the watch-house. I searched the prisoner and found a small red trunk in his pocket, and also a tea pot and cream jug, fourpence halfpenny and two duplicates. The other man was not detained. I gave the property up at the watch-house, the prosecutrix claimed it before it was out of my sight, I know that produced to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Why was the other discharged - A. I do not know; there was a mistake about it. The prisoner said they were his own property; not that they were given him to take care of.</p>

            . I am bailiff to the prosecutor, and live at his farm at Twickenham. On the 8th of February, there was a hundred and six lambs. I counted them that day. There was another after, making a hundred and seven. I saw them every day, and missed none of them. I had asked the prisoner how his flock was, once or twice; he said very well. They were counted on the 15th of March, and then there were only a hundred and two. I asked what had become of the others; he said they had died, and that he had sold the skins to those who would give the most for them. He afterwards said he had sold them to one Saxton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many did he say he had sold - A. Five. He said he was entitled to them in the country he came from; that when they foaled double, and the lamb died, it was his from lambing to shearing time; or he was to have a guinea and a month's board. He said so when he was first spoken to about them. He continued at his duty as usual, and was taken seven days after.</p>

He said he knew what it was for, that he had expected it this three days; that it was for selling three lamb's skins for three halfpence each, to Saxton, on the Heath. I called on him when he was in prison, and particularly cautioned him what he said. He stated he had sold two lambs to Mrs. Clark's little boy, at the Cross Lancers, Hounslow-heath; that he considered them his property, and that he had 1 s. 6 d. for one, and 2 s. for the other.</p>

               <p>"Very well, my little man, I'll see about one for you when there is one to spare." Next afternoon he brought one; I gave him a bottle. He got a quill and milk, to show the child how to make it suck. The lamb was weak, and I put it into a box with hay. He then went into the tap-room, and had a pot of beer. I gave him 1 s. and he went away.</p>

               <p>"Let me have what you have got of mine." He took me into the street, and begged I would not discharge him. I asked what he had done with the shoes. He said, he did not take them with intent to keep them, but he had got a customer for them, and he would bring me either the money or shoes in an hour. I never authorised him to sell any. He then left me and went in doors. Ward afterwards brought me a pair of shoes. I saw the prisoner about fifty yards off at the time, watching him. He came to work next day. I told him Ward had brought a pair. He said he had five pair at a pawnbroker's, he was very sorry, and did not know but there were more; and that he had one pair in pawn in Stingo-lane, and one pair in Crawford-street. I fetched an officer - he said, he did it for drink.</p>

Olson came in the evening, and claimed them, and on Monday, a boy brought the duplicate to redeem them - he took us to a Jew's shop at Shadwell, where I found the prisoner, and asked how he came by them; he said he bought them in East Smithfield.

             - she had been to see me that day - she was seventy-two years old; she left my house about half-past eight o'clock - it was dark. She lived at Pentonville - I lit her out, and stopped at the door with a light in my hand; she was crossing the street towards a doctor's shop, which threw out a great light, and before she could get across, a cart came in contact with her; it was galloping - three men were in it. The horse or the shaft struck her down, and when she was down they called out; but before the cart went on, after she was down, they struck the horse with the whip; they pulled up directly. I was going to pick her up, but as several people went to her assistance, I run to take the number of the cart. Wier was the man who had the whip in his hand; he followed her into the shop, and said he was very sorry, and seemed so - he almost fainted away. The cart was going towards Shoreditch church. She was taken away in a coach, and died next day in St. Bartholemews Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. In what part of the road did it happen - A. Near the turnpike. The doctor's shop is on the left hand going towards Shoreditch - the cart was about six yards from the doctor's - there was a strong gas light from the shop. It was a small horse, not a pony.</p>

I had heard no cry for her to get out of the way; but when she was down there was a cry of Hallo! Three men were in the cart - I ran and took the woman by the hand, she apeared motionless. I assisted her into the shop - Wier came in, and said he was very sorry for what had happened, and she had better be taken to her own house than to the Hospital. I assisted her to the Hospital in a coach.</p>

I saw the deceased immediately she was brought in; she was bleeding from a cut on her head, which penetrated to the bone, and the flesh had fallen down - I gave her to the care of another gentleman next morning.

I seized her with her hand in my trowser's pocket; I told her to deliver my money four or five times, she would not. I called for assistance as loud as I could - I kept the door fast to keep her in; the watchman came and the officer of the night; I gave charge of her - twelve sovereigns were found in her pocket - I found only twelve left in mine, two were entirely gone.

            . I am a watchman, my beat is on the side of Fleet-market; I went to the house in George-alley, hearing a cry of murder between the hours of two and three o'clock in the morning. The prosecutor complained of being robbed and ill used. I demanded admission and got in; I found him on the first floor, holding the bed-room door, and preventing the woman from coming out, there was another female there named Lewis. King was undressed with his trowsers in his hand, Holland also ran down stairs undressed, but finding the door fastened ran up again into Connor's room. King said he had twenty-six sovereigns when he came into the house; he could only find twelve in his pocket. I found Holland in Connor's bed; I saw twelve sovereigns and some silver found in her pocket; the tin-box, with the licence in it, was found between Connor's bed and the mattrass; there were also three pair of braces, eight watch ribbons, and one or two handkerchiefs. Before Holland was searched she said she had nothing at all. The man said if she would give up the money he would say nothing about it, but she denied having any; when the property was found Holland said</p>
               <p>"it's all over with us now;" I had asked Connor who the woman was that was in her bed - she said she did not know any thing of her being there; and as soon as I went into the room I saw Holland in the bed - she had run into the room about ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Connor in bed when you went into the room - A. No; she came down stairs, and let me in - Holland ran into her room after that, and Connor went in four or five minutes after to dress.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper; I went to the house after Evans; King was on the stairs partly undressed - he charged Holland with robbing him; she was taken into the room where they had been. I did not see her in Connor's room - she declared she had no property about her. I found nothing on her; I went down stairs and afterwards went to Connor's room, she had got to bed then. I found the goods under her bed, tied up between the bed and mattrass; there was three parcels, the prosecutor claimed one, and the others were Connor's stays and pocket. Holland dressed to go to the watch-house; I then searched her again, and on taking off her pocket, she said,</p>
               <p>"All that is there is mine." I found there was twelve sovereigns; she said at the watch-house they were given her by a countryman. As we went to the Compter the next morning, Holland said very likely in the hurry when the watchman came she must have placed the property under Connor's bed - Connor appeared to me not to know how they got under the bed;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090035"/>her stays and pocket were quite on the other side, not near the property.</p>

Mr. Sharp first searched them, and produced five pair of stockings to me - he was allowed to go away; in a few hours after I searched the box in his presence, found two handkerchief and the remainder of the articles stated in the indictment. I cannot say whether there was one or two pair of silk stockings in the box; one pair appeared to have been worn once - I know them well to be mine, from their pattern, quality, and manufacture.

The prisoner went willingly with me to search his box; I found five pair of cotton stockings; he said I should find nothing in it but what was there when there was a search about the porters. I was present also when Mr. Flint searched, and found the silk stockings and handkerchiefs, and claimed them. He acknowledged that he stole them all, and told Mr. Flint where he took them from and when; previous to that he said he bought them of his uncle. When I searched, I found a pair of white silk stockings in his pocket, which had been worn once; he wondered how they came there, and said he bought them near Middle-row.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday night, the 15th of March, about half past eight o'clock, I was in the Old Change, I saw four suspicious characters. I saw the prisoner come from behind them with the bed on his back; he was about three minutes walk from Broken-wharf - I stopped him, and asked him what it was - he said it was the same inside as out - I questioned him; he said he fetched it from his master's, and was going to take it home; that his master lived at No. 12, Catherine-wheel-alley. I took him to the watch-house. I went to 12, Catherine-wheel-alley, which is kept by a widow woman, who knew nothing of it. When I returned to the watch-house, I found he had escaped through the bars of the windows; and on Tuesday, at ten o'clock in the morning, I met him with a person I knew, and took him.</p>

I said it was a very unreasonable time to come, and to take it away and to bring it to-morrow. He said No, that it was his own and he would leave it till to-morrow, and come then for the money; he referred me to No. 9, Tudor-street, Blackfriars.

I had not got my watchman's coat on, so that they would not suspect us, but on looking at us, Needham run off up Safforn-hill, and Hill up the court, and got away.

I went into a public-house, the prisoner rushed in after me, and said, I had better give them some. I told the landlady to give them half a pint of gin - I pulled out my purse and paid for it. I then had 1 l. 18 s. 6 d., and came out, they rushed out after me. The prisoner thrust her hand into my pocket, and took my purse and money out. The others pushed against me. I called the watchman and pursued her - I am sure she was the one who took it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half past two o'clock, on the morning of the 1st of March, the prosecutor called to me, and described the prisoner to me. I knew her by his description. I took her at night, and said,</p>

               <p>"Now Kit you have done him." She smiled, and said she had. I said,</p>
               <p>"He thinks worse about the purse, than about the money." She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it was as pretty a steel purse as ever a man put into his pocket; and Barry, you shall have it to-morrow night."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left him in company with five females; and why does he not swear to the other two, who are in the prison, as well as to me - he is paid not to prosecute them.</p>
               <p>MURRAY re-examined. The bill was thrown out against the other two. Their friends came home to me several times, and asked me to take money not to prosecute them. I said I must do my duty; and one night a friend came and offered me 5 l. I said, if they gave me 10 l., I would prosecute. He put down 16 s., and said, that is yours. I took it up, threw it down, and said, I would not have it - he went away, so I put it in my pocket.</p>

I went on the roof with others, and found the lead rolled up. I had seen it on the Friday before it was separated from the building. We searched the premises, and took Allis in the cellar, and asked who else there was - he said only one. Curtis was secured getting up from the cellar, through the parlour floor. The lead was moved nearer to a hole, which was made in the roof, than on Friday - it is an unfinished house.

            . My husband is a post-boy. We live at Hounslow. The prisoner came and opened our door a little after four o'clock, and offered a pair of women's half-boots for sale, and asked 1 s. 3 d. for them - I bought them of her. I live about a quarter of a mile from Beswick. She said she was in great distress, and did not know where to go. I am certain of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take them, or sell them. A young girl came and took me to the door, and asked for some water. She brought out the boots, and said the lady gave them to her. She sold them to this woman, but I did not go in.</p>

My husband shewed him some, which he measured with a bit of tape, and said it would do, and went away, saying he would call in half an hour. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 26th, he came again, and said he was sorry he could not come at the time he stated, but would come at nine o'clock next morning; which he did. I opened the door to him, and told him my husband was in bed - I left the shop for two minutes, to call the apprentice; and on returning, he was gone with the desk. I found it a week after in the possession of the officer.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I apprehended the prisoner on the 1st of March, in consequence of suspicion. He said he had been in an East Indiaman, and had brought the money from there - he had left the nineteen sovereigns with Boughton, who keeps a brothel; I though this story was not true, and detained him - he then sent for Mr. Brooks. The woman brought nineteen sovereigns to the watch-house.</p>

I unfortunately drank with him to such excess, that I lost my memory, and got into this woman's house. I believe my master's money was then safe. In the morning she asked if she should take care of it - I remember her taking it from under my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090040"/>pillow, and at night a fellow seamen came and said if I did not go over to the watch-house, I should lose every farthing - I went and found nineteen sovereigns there.

            . I am errand boy to Mr. Morgan, wholesale ironmonger - Mr. Doncaster is his clerk. On the 26th of February, I had his box on the truck about a quarter before eight o'clock at night. The prisoner came up to me near a doctor's shop in the Bethnal-green-road, and asked how far I was going, I said to the Mansion-house - he said he would push behind for me as far as he was going; I was glad of his assistance, as it was very heavy.

I pursued him a good way, calling Stop thief! - he got away; I found a sheet and handkerchief laying by the chest. An officer came up and put them in - he helped me with it to Walbrook. Mr. Doncaster was very ill, but when he recovered he missed these things out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the trunk closed while you went in pursuit - A. Yes; and when he came up it was well corded. I found the cord cut - I never saw him before, but am sure of him - my back was towards him when he was pushing - it was dusk; but there was gas lights. I saw him again in about an hour; I pointed him out myself - he opened the turnpike-gate for me, and then I saw him plainly, as there are two gas lights there. The officers took me to about five public-houses to look for him. I described him as having a velvet collar, a flock hat, and being marked with the smallpox.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bethnal-green; I heard the alarm and came out of my house, and saw the boy, who said the trunk was robbed, and the thief had gone down a turning - I found the cord cut. He said the man had a very rusty velvet collar, and a flock hat, and was pitted very much with the small-pox. Gibbs and I went with him and delivered the box at Walbrook, then returned to Bethnal-green - we went to four or five public-houses, and when we got to the Bladebone public-house, there were nine or ten people in the tap-room. The boy went into the tap-room before me; he came out and said, the man who did it was standing in the corner smoking his pipe. I went in and took the prisoner - he denied it; he answered the description given by the boy. I found 10 s. 2 d. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see no other man in a velvet collar and flock hat - No; not answering the description given by the boy - he cried when he went home to his master and seemed much agitated. The cord was not cut clean - it must have been done with some instrument; I found no instrument upon the prisoner - none of the property has been found.</p>

               <p>"The young man who robbed me is smoking his pipe." I went in and called the prisoner out by his name - he denied the charge - he lives in Gibraltar-walk, about a hundred yards from where he ran away from the truck.</p>

On Saturday the 22d of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I met the prisoner with this box of soap on his shoulder in Drury-lane; he went up Dunstan's-court, and came round into Drury-lane again; he was looking round him - I secured him and asked what he had; he said something; I asked who it belonged to - he said</p>
               <p>"Find out." He said he had been after it five nights.</p>

On the 8th of April, these pins laid on the counter - the prisoner and another boy came into the shop about seven o'clock in the evening, just as the porter was shutting up, and the dog went out, I went after it, and on returning I met the prisoner and the other boy with the pins. I went into the shop and missed them, and sent the porter after them; they were brought back in about five minutes. I am certain he is one of them. The other escaped, and has never been taken.</p>

            . I was in the shop; the prisoner and another came in, and asked for a halfpenny worth of pins - they watched Mr. Besant run out after the dog, and while my back was turned they caught up the pins and ran out. I missed them directly and ran after them; the prisoner ran as hard as he could, and threw them down as he crossed the road; I picked them up. He was secured.</p>

             - I had known him some years; I said I was sorry to tell him his father was charged with pawning Mr. Knight's property, to the amount of 17 l., and I was ordered to take him into custody for stealing them; he was agitated. I found nothing particular on him. He walked with me to Duke-street, and he was unwell; it was necessary to take him into a house - he was lamenting the distress he had brought on his wife and family. I asked him whether it was a fair question if his father was wicked enough to induce him to rob his employers; he said No, his father did not. I asked him whether the property was pawned - he said he pawned none, but met his father by appointment in different places, generally in the street, and his father gave him what he pleased, but he knew nothing of any pawnings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was Mr. Knight present at this conversation - A. Yes; I suppose he heard all that passed. I said nothing to induce him to confess. We had a shilling's worth of brandy and water between us three.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was present at the time the marshalsman speaks of - A. Yes. I was so agitated that I hardly knew what I did, and the prisoner was much more so agitated.

He had sent us some beer; we were drinking together, (I and the prisoner) - nobody else was in the shop; the boy might be there. He said I had been telling some lies about him to his master that morning; I said not - he said that I had; I said</p>
               <p>"Let it be; let us sweep up the shop, and I will ask my master before I go home to night." He made no answer - I went to lay hold of the birch-broom, at the end of the shop, I turned my back to him to get it, he then came behind, and struck me on the head with a hammer, on the temple; I fell against the counter - he said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you are not killed yet; I'll give you another blow" - he was going to give me another blow, but I caught his hand, and prevented it; he did not strike me afterwards. I had taken the broom to sweep the ceiling down. I had not doubled my fist at him. I was cut on the head, and it bled immediately - I knew him by sight before; we often spoke, but I never worked with him before; I am quite certain I never offered to strike him; we never drank together. We are both Irish, and come from Galway - I never had any dispute with him. I had not been to work all day until seven o'clock in the evening: I had drank no spirits except the gin; had a share of two pots of beer at dinner. I was walking about all day - he was as sober as I was. I could get no work in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you get up - A. About six o'clock; but could get no work. I met a friend about two o'clock, and drank with him; there was two pots of beer between three of us; no whisky nor spirits. I gave him no provocation; he came behind me and struck me on the head; I am sure he struck me behind - I did not pull him off a plank, nor pull the plank away; we had not finished work - I gave him no provocation whatever; I did not kick him - I gave him the fist when he wanted to give the second blow. I was knocked senseless against the counter, but when I recovered, I struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the blow in front of your head - A. No, on the side. I have known him two years, but never drank with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a scaffold in the room - A. Yes; we did not quarrel till we came on the ground.</p>

            . I am a chemist and druggist. This man came to our house about nine o'clock; I looked at his head - It was a slight cut just across the forehead, about half an inch long; I cannot say with what instrument it was done - it was not with a sharp instrument; it was more of a bruise than a cut, though it was cut through the skin; had it been done with a sharp instrument, it would be a clear wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You see the prisoner and prosecutor - would it be possible with the prosecutor's back turned from him, to have hit him in the forehead, unless he faced him - A. It is certainly much more like facing than being behind him. It was a slight wound.</p>

I found some butter in his pocket.</p>

All the things were then safe - we were in the kitchen below; she went away about two o'clock; I have no lodgers. The street door is generally open - I did not miss the things till Thursday afternoon, the 6th of March. She had told me she lived at No. 11, Goldsmith-place, Hackney-road, and that her sister lived in service at No. 17, there. I went to her sister on the Friday morning, but I found nothing there; I found every thing but a gown at Wyatt's, a little higher up; also the fragments of a gown and shirt which had been cut up, I am sure they are mine.</p>

            . I live in Margaret-place, Hackney-fields. I took the prisoner in to sleep for a few nights, at the request of my neighbours. She slept in a small back room. She had a small hand box, and two bonnet boxes, with her; and was frequently in and out; and could bring things in without my seeing her. I keep a haberdasher's shop. Mrs. Joseph called on me on Friday, with Elias. I called the servant down. Mrs. Joseph said, she suspected her of having articles which she missed. She said she knew nothing of them. They asked her to fetch her box down, which she refused. I took Mrs. Joseph up to her room - there was a part of a gown cut up on the bed, which Mrs. Joseph claimed - her box was unlocked, and Mrs. Joseph took from it the rest of the things. and brought them down into her presence. The prisoner seemed agitated.</p>

The watch hung over the chimney-piece in the parlour - it was a metal gilt watch, gold seals, a gold key, and a metal chain. I saw it about twelve o'clock on Thursday last. hanging up. There is a garden before the house. I had been in the garden in the morning, and left the street door open, but the gate locked. I went down into the kitchen for a few minutes. There was a ring at the bell; my servant looked through the kitchen window, and said; there was a boy at the garden gate with earthenware. I desired her to say we wanted none. While I stood in the kitchen, we heard a noise in the parlour - I think one of the windows were up. I looked through the kitchen window, and saw a man going from the door. The earthenware man was gone. The garden gate being locked, the man must have got over. I only saw his back. I ran into the parlour, and missed the watch. I ran and unlocked the garden gate, and gave an alarm, and then saw two men running (they had no earthenware). One of them appeared the same size and appearance as the person who ran from the street door. One of the two called out to the other to stop. I saw them pursued, and heard they had made their way into the fields. I ran through the house, went out at the back door, and met them both - they were then standing by a pond, about forty yards from the house. I told one of them he had stolen the watch. He said he had not got it; a little boy who stood by said,</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, if you have lost a watch, I think I saw one of them put it into the pond." Some persons came up and took them, and searched them at the public-house. The watch was brought to me wet out of the pond. I am certain the prisoners are the persons who were running when I got to the garden gate; and I think nobody else could have put the watch in the pond. it is worth at least 7 l. or 8 l. together. I have had it ever, since.</p>

On the 10th of April, at about half past twelve o'clock, I saw the lady at the back of the house, and the prisoners running. They went and stood at the corner of the pond. They were the only persons there. The lady said,</p>
               <p>"Stop! you have got my watch." Bushell said he had not got it. I saw Barlow with his hands in his breast - he pulled something from it, and threw it in the pond. I could not be certain what it was. I ran directly and got the watch out of the pond. It had a chain, seal, and key to it. I gave it to the lady. Two men came and took them.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I saw both the prisoners in company together; they made across a vacant piece of ground; Barlow sat down on some stones, while Bushell went and rang at the bell. I had seen them at the Southampton Arms, public-house, just before, and then each had a bundle of wood - they then separated, and Bushell went to the bell; Barlow directed his attention much to Bushell while he was at the garden gate - they were then about thirty yards distant. I had my suspicions, seeing that they had no stock of wood. I was dressing at the time, and thought I would put on my clothes and go down; but before I could get them on, I heard the alarm, and saw Mrs. Broughton opening the front gate to let out the servant, and several people runing round to the pond. When I was dressed I found them custody. I went to the public-house, and mentioned what I had seen. Bushell said, I had no business with it; that they were in custody, and I had no right to say any thing about it.</p>

I have got the number of the note from the bankers' since. I had left one of my workmen at home to pay a bill with it, if it should come while I was out (he is not here).

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner last Friday morning at his house in Willer-street, Tothill-fields - I told him he was charged with robbing his master, and asked what he had done with the money - he said he had spent it; I asked him how much it was; he said 7 l. 14 s. I asked him where he had been since he committed the robbery; he said he walked to Bath to see a relation, and had been absent till the day before I took him. I found no money on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master did not use me well; he kept me short of victuals. I heard he was going to send me away, and not knowing what for, I did this. I always did my best to serve him - this is the first crime I was ever guilty of.</p>

About the 5th of March, the prisoner met me, and asked for employment - I had employed him before. I said I had no work for him; he said if I gave him only his victuals, that would satisfy him. As we went along, he said he knew where to sell the coals - he took me near Saffron-hill, and told me to stop at the end of the street, and he would go to an old lady, and ask her to buy them - he returned, and said she wanted two bushels, but she had no change - they came to 3 s. I gave him three half crowns, a sixpence, and nine shillings; he told me to measure the coals while he went and fetched the sovereign. I waited about an hour, he did not return. I saw him twice about a week after, but he ran away from me; I met him a third time; he stopped, and said he was very sorry for what he had done, but he would bring the money on Monday. I let him go, intending to give him in charge when he came on the Monday, but he never came. I gave information, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Taylor - A. Yes; from a child. I very seldom saw him and my brother together - we slept at my father's on the Common. I heard of the robbery next morning; he slept with me every night. I went to know where he was, and found he was in custody; he said he was charged with stealing two coats from Mr. Mills, and I told the people outside the office that I slept with him at the time. Mr. Mills lives about two hundred yards off. I did not go and tell him what I could prove. I did not tell Webb, for he is no friend to a poor man. My father and mother, and brother Henry could also prove it, but they are not here.</p>

On the 14th of March, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop and said he wanted five legs of pork for a supper for Mr. Hocker, of St. John's-street, who I knew, he brought a clean tray with him. I put three legs of pork, weighing 24 lbs. into it - he wanted to take them himself, but I sent my own servant with them. I told him to bring the money back; he went away with the boy, but the boy returned without the money or meat. I apprehended him next night at a butcher's shop in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in my master's shop; he had three legs of pork weighed and a tray, and was dressed like a butcher; he asked for them for Mr. Hocker - my master gave them to me with strict orders to take them to Mr. Hocker and receive the money for them. I went out with the prisoner, and by the turnpike he told me to go on to Mr. Hocker's, and I went there till he came as he was going back to master's again; he overtook me before I got to Mr. Hocker's, and said he had got two more legs of pork; left two sovereigns for them, and I was to bring the change and those other two legs to Mr. Hooker's after I had delivered these; I followed him down the road into Rosamond-street; he took me to the Red Lion, public-house, and called for a pint of beer, pen, ink, and paper, and went into the tap-room and made out a bill for three legs of pork - he took two away first; he was gone about five minutes - he then came for the other, and told me to wait there for there was a gentleman coming to ask me the price; he then took the other leg away. I waited twenty minutes; he did not return - I went back to my master's, and asked for the other two legs, but found it was a trick - I saw him again next night, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Should you have left them with Hocker - A. Yes, if I had the money.</p>

Yes; he did tell me so - he did not threaten to beat me; my master certainly did tell me before I left the shop with the pork, that I was not to leave it without the money.</p>

On the 28th of February, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called into my shop, and observed the prisoner and another boy passing over my area rails from Mr. Barker's shop. One of them had the oil-cloth under his arm - they were in company with each other. I went out and turned to my left - saw nobody; turned again, and by that time they had got to Foley-place. I am quite certain of the prisoner - I saw them again in Foley-place. The man who had it was waiting to see if he was followed, and seeing me threw it down and ran off. I threw it into a public-house, and pursued him, but he got off. As I returned I met Barker, and saw the prisoner before him. I secured him; he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

            , of Ludgate-hill. Pearson was our porter. We had about 7 cwt. of copper-plates in the warehouse. On the 5th of March some were missing. White, the apprentice, went to make enquiry. I then charged Pearson with it. He denied any knowledge of it; but after some time, and under some inducements, he made a confession. In consequence of what I learnt from him, I went to Field-lane, and saw a person, named Gray. Part of the house was a green shop, and the other part an old iron shop. From the information of Pearson, I went on the 7th or 8th of March, to the prisoner's house in Giltspur Street. I asked what he had done with his stock when he quitted the old iron trade, - to whom he had sold it - I did not mention Field-lane. he said he sold it to one and Nathan; that man was the only person he did business with, except the hawkers who came about to buy small quantities of brass and copper. Nothing further passed. Before this, the officers had brought him into the presence of Pearson, into our counting-house. Mr. Mawman asked Pearson if that was the person to whom he had sold the property. He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, it is." Robinson said, he never saw him, nor had he ever bought a plate of him. Robinson was then taken to the Compter, and I asked him about his stock, as I before stated; and in consequence of what I learnt from Mrs. Gray, I went to the witness Ham. The value of the property may be 100 l. or 500 l., it depends on the sale of the work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was Pearson in custody when you first saw the prisoner - A. Yes. He said he dealt with Nathan for the stock he had on hand when he left off business.</p>

            . I was porter to Mr. Mawman, and was charged with stealing this property. The prisoner kept an iron shop in Fleet-lane. I took some engraved copper-plates there for sale, about April, 1822. I got them from master's warehouse. He paid me 4 d. per pound. I received that day 10 s. or 12 s. for them. They were wrapped up in paper. I knew they belonged to the Dilitanti society. The paper on them was marked so; he never asked who I came from, or who I was - his wife and child were present. There were engravings with the plates - the children laid hold of them, and his wife said,</p>
               <p>"My dear, you had better burn them." I do not know whether he did or no. After he left the shop Mrs. Gray succeeded him. I went to sell her some copper-plates, which I also stole from master. I asked if she bought old copper. She said, Yes. She bought some of me after she had taken time to enquire about it. I told her I had sold some to the man who kept the shop before. When she paid me, she told me she had been to Mr. Robinson about them. I have sold some to another person who lived in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you lived with this gentleman - A. Five years; on and off. I did not know the value of them; some of them were quite clean. I was examined four times, and then admitted as an evidence - his wife and daughter were in the shop; he gave me the money himself, and took the ready-reckoner to cast it up. I sold him some in October; the last I sold him was about a week before he went to keep a cook-shop, in Giltspur-street, which was in September. I sold them to him on the day on which I stole them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is he the man to whom you sold them - A. He is; the conversation about burning the prints, was in his presence - he gave four pence a pound for the first lot, and six pence for the last.</p>

            . I succeeded the prisoner in his shop in Fleet-lane; he carried on a tailor's business, and an iron-shop there. I believe Pearson to be the person I bought 23 lbs. of copper of, in September; they were engraved plates. The prisoner called on me, and in consequence of what Pearson said, I told him a person had been concerning some copper-plates, he said I might give him six pence a pound; and they were perfectly safe, meaning that I might deal safely with him. Pearson came afterwards and I refused to buy any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was to share no profit in them - A. No. I thought he meant to say they were honestly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090050"/>come by. His old iron business was managed by his wife; he left the shop in October.</p>

               <p>"Dilitanti Society" I gave him seven pence half-penny, and eight pence half-penny a pound for them, which was the price of metal. I saw one before the Justice which corresponds with what he sold me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he sell you any in September - A. Yes; I believe he did not know what they were - I melted them as old copper. I had some of the same description last week, from a respectable house in Shoe-lane; when they are worn they become old copper, and it is impossible for a man not acquainted with engravings to know whether they are worn or not.</p>

            . I live in Ludgate-street. These plates belong to me, and Mr. Payne. I have the care of them; it is impossible to state their value. I bought half of them at Mr. White's sale, under an idea there would be a second volume of the work, and if so, they would be worth 1500 l. or 1000 l. I have no doubt but the common value of them is 200 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What becomes of worn-out plates - A. Many are scratched across, so as not to be used, and sent to the coppersmith, either by my clerk or myself. There are collectors who give much more than copper-smiths for them, but these are in a high state of preservation; and I think it impossible any one could suppose them worn out. I cannot say how the trade dispose of their plates.</p>

On Wednesday, the 26th of March, I went up to my bedroom, and found my drawers broken open; she had left me the night before - her master and her had had a few words, and she went, as he said she might go if she liked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and four sovereigns out of a purse. I had seen them on the Sunday. She had left a bundle behind her; I sent for an officer, who found a handkerchief in her bundle. A week after somebody called for her bundle; I followed the person home, and gave information. The officer went to her lodging and found the property.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 3d of April, I was sent for - I found the prisoner in Threefox-court, Long-lane, and took her to the prosecutor; she denied the charge. I found a room-door key, a street-door key, and the key of her box, in her pocket - I asked where she lived; she refused to tell me; I locked her up in the Compter; and went to a room in White-Street, Moorfields. The key found on her opened the door. I found two pieces of muslin, a piece of net, and two pieces of lace, and two muslin handkerchiefs. The prisoner claimed a handkerchief which I found in the same drawer; she never would tell me where she lived.</p>

             was in the house by accident; she does not live in the house - I had known the prisoner when a child, but had not seen him for years; he said he came from Mr. Montague, (who is treasurer of the parish,) that he had a note from him for Mr. Horn. I said Mr. Horne was at his office at the Townhall; that he had better go there and he would see him; he said it was something very particular, and Mr. Montague requested it might be left at the house. The Townhall is about three hundred yards from the house. He asked me to lend him a pen and ink to write something on the letter. I turned round from him to go into the front parlour for the pen and ink, and he shut the street door and followed me, I got into the front parlour, and was opening the book case to get the pen and ink, and then received two blows at the back of my head, which stunned me very much; there was nobody else near me; he had something in a handkerchief under his arm when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What further passed - A. I turned round to see what it was, and he tripped me up; I fell on my left side, and immediately I was down I received three blows on the side of my head, from a weapon which was afterwards produced; it was a little hatchet. I was hardly able to move; I had no power to move till the blood ran profusely down to my mouth which I think revived me. I then seized him by the neckcloth and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you murdering villain." He then dragged me out of the front parlour into the passage; I was on my feet but I do not know how I came there; I continued to hold him all the time, and when in the passage he tripped me up again; I fell on my right side and there I received several blows on the left side with the same instrument. I still held him by the neckcloth, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Let go, you won't let go;" these were the only words I heard him speak; at that instant I heard a violent rapping at the street door; before that, I had screamed out as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>"Fillaroy! Fillaroy," and then he put his fingers into my mouth to prevent my screaming; I bit his finger very hard, this was before I was dragged into the passage; I kept screaming as loud as I could; I do not know whether I could he heard outside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you heard a rapping at the door - A. Yes; I still held him by the neckcloth and dragged him towards the door; I opened the street door, still holding him; a vast concourse of people were at the door, to whom I said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, I am murdered." Some one took the prisoner, and I know nothing more about it. I was taken into the parlour and a surgeon came to my assistance; I do not know whether I walked into the parlour or was carried; he was brought to my bed-room next day for the Magistrate to take my deposition in his presence; I kept my bed for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This happened a little after two o'clock in the afternoon - A Yes Sir. I live in the High-street, not in a lone house, it is a very public place, where coaches pass at all times, there are shops opposite; it is a narrow street, and no area before the door; the house lays low. I had not seen him since he was a child; there was no malice or ill will between us. I know his mother very well, and go to the same chapel as her; she does not belong to the same class as me. I have told all that passed, there was nothing of anger or provocation, nor any words, it was done so very instantaneously; he had not spoken a word in anger or demanded any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. There was really no cause present, or past, that you could assign for it - A. None at all. I screamed during the whole transaction, calling</p>
               <p>"Fillaroy" - I do not know that I called murder. I have no reason to believe that he was ever at the house before. I have lived there twenty-six years.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are there blinds to the parlour window - A. Yes, very high ones - there is a garden at the back of the house which is divided from the fields by a ditch only.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does his mother sit near you at chapel - A. No, she sits in the gallery and I below - I never observed him with her. I recollect that there is a bridge over the ditch, which could easily be let down, and a person might escape into the fields. His mother is a straw bonnet maker.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier. I was passing the house at the back of a stage, and heard a very violent scream of murder. A mob collected round the door - I jumped off, pushed the door open, and saw Mrs. Rookes behind the door, screaming, and blood running all down her, from her head; the prisoner had hold of her behind, pulling her away from the door. I made a snatch at his right wrist, and he let go of her immediately. I did not perceive any thing in his hand at that time; he let go with the other hand immediately, and I took hold of that wrist, held both wrists, and said</p>
               <p>"You rascal, what have you been about here;" he said she had been very much ill-treating him; he tried to lift up his hands - I pulled them down, and said I would stand no nonsense with him: by that time a number of people rushed in and seized him by the collar, and assisted in securing him, I pulled him into the back kitchen, on the same floor. Coltman, the officer, came in, bound his hands, and took him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I went into the house, hearing a noise, and thinking my assistance might be wanted. I went in the back way, and found some slight resistance within, at the back door, as if somebody wished to get out, for a second. I then went in, and found the prisoner in custody, and Mrs. Rooke in the front parlour, in an agitated state, and her face covered with blood. I found a small wound on the right temple, rather contused, which had divided an artery, from whence the blood had proceeded. I stopped it instantly; there was another wound on the left side of the head, that was a contused triangular wound: there was another on the back of the head - that was a cut, and must have been made with the corner of the sharp part of the hatchet; but from the shape of the triangular wound, I think it was made with the back of it. She was much agitated, and nearly fainted, and kept her bed a fortnight, I have attended her till now. I was there the next day, when the magistrate attended, to take her deposition. I apprehended danger, fearing fever might come on, but not from the wounds themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You think the triangular wound was made with the back of the hatchet - A. Yes; had the wound in the forehead been in a more fleshy part, I should have called it more of a puncture - it was the depth of the skin - a good deal of blood flowed from the artery. The wound in the head was an incision about three-fourths of an inch long, and not above an eighth of a sixth of an inch deep. The back wound must have been done with the sharp part, no other part of the instrument could have done it. I found the prisoner very much agitated, and almost fainting.</p>

I knew him perfectly well; there had been no quarrel whatever between us of any sort; he lived some distance from me; he has been maintained at our work-house, and relieved as a pauper.

            . I am the prisoner's father, I am a shipwright by trade, but have not done business in that way for seven years - since the war I have been in the straw-bonnet trade; he lived with me when this unfortunate circumstance happened, he was twenty-six years old last December - he had a paralytic stroke seven years ago which affected his instep and leg; since which time he was first employed as clerk to Mr. Hatton, of Great St. Helen's, and afterwards acted as usher at a school; he has lately been very much given to study, and was remarkable for seclusion, the most so of any one I ever knew - his health was so bad that he declined his place as usher two years ago last June; since that time he has been employed twelvemonth as a ladies' shoe-maker down to December last - the cause of his leaving that employ was the rupture of a blood-vessel, but I do not know where, there was a great discharge of blood; he was under Mr. Frampton's care, as an out-patient of the London Infirmary - his conduct has materially altered since that, he gave many evidences of his derangement of mind. I I have observed, for many years past, a temporary derangement of intellect; after he had in a measure recovered from the paralytic, he left home and went to Bristol without any intimation; a week afterwards I received a letter from him, saying he was there and in want of money to come home - this was about seven years ago; we sent him money and he returned - he was absent rather more than a week; he had no relation there, only he had heard me say I was born there; after his return he was a considerable time out of employ, but by means of an advertisement obtained a situation with Mr. Hatton, as an accountant, where he continued between two and three years; left him in August, 1820, and immediately engaged as usher to Mr. Gilson, and staid with him till Midsummer, 1821; his health was evidently on the decline while with Mr. Gilson, and at the expiration of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090054"/>holidays he was too ill to return, which he intended, and declined going again - after that he manifested an unusual dejection of spirits, such as I ever witnessed before, and as much as in him laid, secluded himself entirely from the observation of the family and society; he scarcely ever attended meals - we never could prevail upon him to come down stairs. I had remonstrated with him on the mode of conduct he pursued, and said the probable consequence of this seclusion would be injurious to his health - this had no other effect than making him, if possible, more secluded than ever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason for this seclusion - A. Not the least; he was hardly able of communication, he was so little communicative, I never knew the like. Some time after this he went to Mr. Cole to learn the shoemaking business, and left him in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Now come to the last two or three months; has he been at home since he left Mr. Cole - A. Yes; we observed some particular traits of his conduct, which I always considered savoured strongly of insanity, some of which came within my own knowledge - on several occasions when he entered his room where he secluded himself, he has did himself behind the door to avoid observation. This seclusion has increased within the last three months, and caused fearful apprehension on our minds, as it respected his personal safety - we were fearful lest he should destroy himself from, despondency.</p>
               <p>Q. From despondency of spirits, or derangement - A. The derangement I considered would arise from the lowness of spirits; I considered he had evident marks of temporary derangement arising from his spirits, dejection of mind, and intense study. He would not be seen by me for two or three days together frequently, though he was in the house, and he shunned me, particularly since I remonstrated with him - he never was so communicative as the rest of my family; he kept up stairs in his room, and scarcely ever went out. He spent his evenings at home either reading or sleeping; reading was his employment all day - he has lately been much disposed to make himself master of the Latin tongue. I believe he was pretty competent in mathematics, before this seclusion, so as to apply it to navigation - he knew geometry and mensuration, but was not so correct in them as I wished.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long is it since he left off being a shoemaker - A. In December; he used the tools requisite.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What you have related as to your fear of his destroying himself arose since December - A.

The habits of seclusion took place at my house.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. At two particular times he has been affected in such a way as to cause considerable alarm; the first was seven years ago; he was very ill for some weeks. We missed him one morning at breakfast, and found him sitting in his room with his legs across, and when called to breakfast we could get no answer from him; we were obliged to take his breakfast up to him for some weeks after, he refused to come down, and at the end of some weeks he lost all appetite, and had a paralytic attack - he was more communicative at this time, and applied to the London Hospital. When he recovered he was not able to walk without crutches, and was absent for a week Last December he was taken very ill with a spitting of blood, and from that time he remained at our house night and day; he had lived at home for the last twelve months, and about five weeks after December, he complained of great pain and illness, and went again to Dr. Clapton, at the London Hospital, as an out patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to mix with the family or was he secluded - A. Till we observed this change, he was as the rest of the family, but since he confined himself wholly to his bed-room. He only went to the Hospital once, and was bled, and then he was seized in this melancholy way, and went no more - I think the last time he went to the Hospital was in February, after that he confined himself altogether to his bed-room, till evening, when he would go down into the yard at the back of the house, and remain there alone for two or three hours; this was his habit when the snow lay thick on the ground, ancle deep - this happened constantly from the time the alteration took place - we have frequently gone down to see where he was. There is no out-house in the yard; he was in the open air, and that in all the severity of winter. On the Tuesday before this affair, I was ill in bed, and in consequence of what I was informed of, I had my son and daughter called up, and desired them particularly to keep a watch over him - I had some time before that gone into his room, and found him in such a posture that I apprehended he contemplated suicide. The door opens close against the wall, and he had pushed a chair against the door, which was ajar, and stood in the corner, where there was scarcely room to stand. An unusual change had taken place in his conduct, for he was of such habits, he used to shun every body before, and I was informed of several things, such as his running down stairs naked, and he went out on the Tuesday towards evening for the first time after his seclusion - this was on the Tuesday before this happened; he returned about nine o'clock. I was confined to my bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the charge you gave your son and daughter arise from any fear you had of his doing mischief to himself or others - A. I thought his injuring any one was the most unlikely thing in the world, for from his infancy he was the most harmless inoffensive temper, and was often imposed upon.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and am younger than him. I remember his coming home about Christmas. He broke a blood-vessel; since that time his conduct has been considerably altered. He secluded himself from the family. I do not think that he had any books, but I cannot say; he kept close to his room, and would have nothing to say to any of the family; and we had great difficulty to get him down stairs to meals. Sometimes he had them up stairs, and sometimes would come down - we had to call him five or six times before he came. I suffered considerable anxiety of mind about about him. I went into his bed-room one day, since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090055"/>Christmas, and saw him behind the door, and was horror struck when I saw him, and could not speak to him, he was in such a situation - standing behind the door, close in the corner, looking down on the ground, with his hands up to his mouth. I immediately went out of the room - there was a chair near the door, but not behind it. This was after he left Mr. Cole, in the early part of the time, when he began to seclude himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What struck you with horror when you saw him - A. I considered he was contemplating self destruction.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any means of self destruction by - A. Not that I saw; but from his strange manner before, and his keeping from the family, I thought so; and during the hard winter, he retired every night into the back yard, and staid three or four hours, when the snow was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the open yards; or is there any covering - A. He used to remain in the privy. I have frequently made observations to him, but could get no answer. On the Wednesday before this melancholy occurrence took place. my mother charged me and my brother to keep an eye on him; for, on the night before, he came home at nine o'clock - I let him in - and the first thing he did was to fix his eyes, in a wild manner, upon me, and put up his left arm, as if to ward off a blow. He then went to the end of the passage leading to the yard; then turned, and fixed his eyes again as before; then he went down to the kitchen. I went up and told my mother, I did not know that I had done any thing to offend him, but he looked at me, as if he would murder me - and so I told her. I never had any words with him, or any disagreement in my life. And once (I think it was on the Tuesday) he came down to dinner, and was some time down before I observed him, and then I saw he was naked, all but his trowsers. He had neither shirt, or any thing on. He was in the room sometime before I observed him; I was at needle work, and a female lodger talking to me, so I did not observe it immediately - he did nothing. I observed him in that state for about half an hour; sometimes walking, and sometimes standing against the mantle-piece. We did not speak to him. I cannot tell whether the children were in the room. My father was out, and my mother was ill a bed. My brother was not there. I never saw him commit such indecencies before - quite the reverse. I never heard him express any dislike to Mr. Horne - he always spoke of him with the greatest respect - saying, Mr. Horne had always behaved uncommonly well since our circumstances had taken an unfortunate change. He was very weak. We had a small chopper in the house - but the one produced does not look like it - I do not think it is ours.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How often did he shave himself - A. I cannot tell - he did shave himself.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He had no razor when you saw him behind the door - A. No. I have frequently heard him talking, or muttering to himself; and, being uneasy, have listened at the door, but could never make out what he said.</p>

            . I lodge at the prisoner's father's, and have lived there two years; but, for the last six months I have noticed several things in the prisoner's behaviour - his keeping up stairs all day; and going into the yard every evening; and remaing there two or three hours on cold nights, when the snow was ancle deep; and besides, the next morning the blood has been on the privy when I have gone there. I have observed this several times when I went to the privy of a morning. If we met on the stairs, and he was coming down, he would run up - he always avoided me. On the Tuesday previous to this occurrence his mother was ill. I went down stairs, and was standing at the front window with his sister - the door between the two rooms is half glass. I happened to turn my eye, I saw him walking backward and forward, in the room, as fast as he could, naked, all but his trowsers. I did not mention it to his sister; but, before a quarter of an hour, he came across to the room, and stood before the glass, and began combing his hair as fast as he could. I I left the room as soon as I could. I thought it very singular, when he would never come into my presence at any other time; and that he never could be in his senses to have done so; and said so to his sister; he looked very wild at me when he came into the room. I observed that he looked very evil at me for the last five or six months, but could never think what it was for - his looks were very unpleasant. During the two years I have been there, I can safely say, he has not exchanged half a dozen words with me.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You thought he was out of his mind, by coming before the glass to comb his hair - A. I thought it strange. I never saw him do it before - he looked very wild, and had no shirt on.</p>

I indicted him and he gave false bail; I had a Bench warrant against him; I told the watchman he had robbed me. I did not go to his house for him, as I did not know where it was; he keeps two or three places, I went to Phoenix-street with the constable. When he was apprehended I told this story; the Justice ordered him to Clerkenwell; he said the bench warrant was enough. I did not see him after the robbery, till he was apprehended. I was perfectly sober; I did not see him before he struck me; after I received the blow, one of them said;</p>
               <p>"You villain, you have knocked down a child." I am certain it was his voice.</p>

            , JUN. I am thirteen years old. I was going to the grocers with my father, and at the corner of Charlton-street, two men came up to my father and said,</p>
               <p>"What made you knock a child down," and as the words came out of his mouth, he hit him by the side of his head, and knocked him down; I called out,</p>
               <p>"Corfield do not kill my father"; then he said,</p>

               <p>"You rascal, if you make a noise I'll kill you"; the skirts of my fathers coat turned up, as he fell on his face and hands; Corfield felt in his pocket, and took his pocket-book out, and ran away with it. I knew him before; he used to live in our house; I told my father who the man was; he did not know who it was; I did not tell the watchman. I saw him about a mouth after in Wilstead-street, as I was going to school, I was alone and did not call after him, my father told me whenever I saw him again to follow him. I saw him two days after, but was afraid to follow him. I saw him two or three times, but was always alone. The prisoner took the pocket-book, but the other man knocked my father down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did your father tell you that he did not see him - A. Yes; he was stunned for three minutes. I saw him walking up and down Harford-street, but did not know he lived there, till a shoe-boy told me so, and then I told my father; this was before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. The prisoner surrendered himself to me on a Bench warrant I had against him for assaulting the prosecutor before this. I took him to Bow-street; we waited two hours at a public-house for the prosecutor to come - he then said he was a rogue and a robber, and was going to say what he had done, but I sent him to the office. This was on the 12th of April; he had given me notice on Thursday that he should be ready to go with me.</p>

            . I live in Harford-street, Somer's-town. The prisoner has lodged a year and a half with me. On the 29th of March, he was not well; he came home in the evening - I cannot say whether the clock had struck ten, but I fetched his candle before the watchman went half-past ten. I was up myself till half-past twelve, it being Easter-eve; he did not go out again. The prosecutor knew where he lived, for he has come and insulted me several times before the robbery, and asked for the prisoner. He did not come after the robbery.</p>

             PETERS. I am a clerk in the Custom-house, and was so in February. On Saturday, the 8th of February, I went to Messrs. Bosanquet and Co., with a cheque, and received a 5 l. note, four sovereigns, and a half - I wrapped the money in the note, took it home, and on the Monday morning brought it to the Custom-house, and deposited it in my drawer in the long-room, about ten o'clock. I wrote</p>
               <p>"Bosanquet and Co., February 23," on it when I took it - it was quite clean then. I left the Custom-house between a quarter and ten minutes before four. I had been away from my desk several times in the course of the day; and had been out of the room; but I saw the note safe when I left the Custom-house. I looked to see that it was safe, and locked my desk. I opened it next morning upon returning, and it was gone. I desired payment to be stopped at the Bank; and, in consequence of information on the Thursday, I went to the Bank with Mr. Stokes, and soon after we got there, the prisoner,

            , came up. Mr. Lees, who was present, questioned him as to when, and where he had taken the note. He stated, that it had been taken at a coal-shed in Margaret-street, Hackney-fields, which he kept; and from a person (whom he believed to be in a public office.) for a debt of about 17 s. 6 d., and that he did not know the person's name. On being further questioned, he said, he would point out the person's house, if he could not tell the name. It was proposed that Stokes and Lees should go with the prisoner to see where he had taken it. I left them at the door of the Bank; and, as I parted with them, as soon as I crossed the way, I looked back to see if they were going on, and saw the other male prisoner join them. I believe the female prisoner is servant to Miss Kelly, housekeeper at the Custom-house, as I have seen her several times dusting the desks of the long room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, ELEANOR M'KENNA. Q. Did you take your keys out of your desk - A. I did I swear that; I had them next morning when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a second key to your desk - A. Yes, formerly; but I had lost it. I had made enquiry about it - it was a key of my desk, and a larger one attached to it. I had lost them a few days before, and never recovered them.</p>

            . On the 13th of February I went to the Bank with Mr. Peters, and saw Grubb there. A note was shewn me by Mr. Lees, which Grubb had produced. I asked Grubb where he got it. He said his brother had taken it the day before at a coal-shed, in Margaret-street, Hackney; that he lived there, and kept that coal-shed. I asked of whom he thought his brother had taken it. He said, he thought of a gentleman, who held a very respectable situation under Government. I asked why his brother did not write the name of the party on the back of it. He said, he did not think that that was of much consequence - his brother knew it to be good. I asked, whether, if I went home with him, he could point out the house where the gentleman lived who gave him the note. He said, he thought he could. We left the Bank, and as we got outside the door, I observed the other male prisoner standing on the opposite side. He came over to us immediately, and Grubb introduced him to me as his brother. I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I understand you took a 5 l. note yesterday?" He said, he had not taken it, but the boy whom he employed to carry out coals had taken it, and brought it in to him; that he had taken 17 s. 6 d. out of it for a score, and gave change for it. We went on towards Hackney, and when we had got about a hundred yards beyond Shoreditch church, the prisoners both stopped, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use taking you any further Sir, we are sorry we have took you so far - we found that note yesterday in Petticoat-lane." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is a pity you did not state this to Mr. Lees, at the Bank." One of them said, in the presence of the other, that he was sorry he had told a falsehood about it; and asked, if I thought there was any chance of their having the note restored to them. I said, I could not answer that, they must return to the Bank with me. They agreed to return, and when we got to the Refuge for the Destitute, in Shoreditch, Grubb slipped away, and got away. I told M'Kenna he must go back with me. He said, he was sorry Grubb was gone away, he supposed he was frightened. I returned to the Bank with him, and requested Mr. Lees to keep him there while I fetched Mr. Golding from the Custom-house. We were too late for an examination at the Mansion-house that day. We went to Wentworth-street to look for Grubb, but did not find him there. As we passed Petticoat-lane, M'Kenna pointed out the corner of a court, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the very spot where I found the note." I asked if it was wrapped up in any thing. He said, No, it was folded up. I asked if any thing was wrapped in it. He said there was nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GRUBB. Q. What time was it - A. Between one and two o'clock. I think it was a very fine day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not wait several times for me to keep up with you - A. No; I believe M'Kenna was on first, I kept about a yard from him, and was about another yard from Grubb. I do not remember waiting for him, I did not observe that his shoes were bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did he slip away from you - A. Close at the Curtain-road turnpike. I had seen him not two minutes before; I did not observe him go, but when I looked for him he was gone.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Bank of England. I produce a 5 l. note, which I received in the secretaries' office, in Grubb's presence; I asked where he received it. he said his brother, who kept a coal-shed and potatoe warehouse in Margaret-street, Hackney, received it for a score; that he did not know the person's name, but dare say his brother did; that it was not marked, but he had brought it to the Bank, as it was very much inked. Mr. Stokes set off with him to point out where it was received; and in two minutes they returned with M'Kenna. Mr. Stokes said,</p>
               <p>"Oh here is his brother; he was waiting for him outside." I asked Grubb if that was his brother - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090058"/>said it was; and M'Kenna said he was so - I said,</p>
               <p>"Then you can tell us who you received the note from" - he said,</p>
               <p>"I did not receive it myself, it was my boy received it"</p>
               <p>"I asked if it was from a regular customer - he said he did not know the name, but had no doubt his boy could show us the house; and it was agreed that Stokes should go with them for the boy to point out the house - and Grubb said he understood it was taken from the wife of a person in a public office. I was not present when the note was brought to the Bank; it came to me in this inky state; and the reason they assigned for bringing it, was having inked it by accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GRUBB. Q. When I brought the note did not you ask me to step aside, as you had something particular to say to somebody - A. No; I believe it is the course of business in the secretaries' office, to ask people to call again in an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I was asked to call again in an hour - it was then near twelve o'clock; I returned five minutes before one - A. I do not know myself that he was there more than once, but I believe he had left the note, as it is the usual course when notes are stopped.</p>
               <p>MR. PETERS. The note was clean when I had it - here is</p>

            . I am a coal-dealer, and live at No. 24, Chicksand-street, Osborne-place, Whitechapel. On Wednesday night, the 12th of February, about six o'clock, or half past, the female prisoner came to my house, and said she had been to the west-end of the town, on an errand for Miss Kelly, and was rather fatigued; she sat down a few minutes, then presented a 5 l. note to me, and asked me to change it; it was dirty. I do not know whether it was ink or dirt; I took down the number - it was 14991, (looks at it) I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't like the appearance of it; I am afraid it is a bad one, but if you like to let it lay in my hands till tomorrow, I will take it to the Bank and get you the change" - she left it with me, and was to call next morning for the change. She said it belonged to her fellow-servant - I cannot write, but can make figures; I put down the number while it was in my possession; I gave it to my wife, who put it into a little box, and shortly after I went to my club.</p>

            , ESQ. I am principal clerk in the secretaries office, Custom-House - It belongs to the Crown; part of it is in the parish of St. Dunstan, in the East - The whole of the Long-room is in that parish I believe.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR M'KENNA. I have to say that the men are perfectly innocent of any guilt attached to the crime; and I wish to ask the prosecutor if he is in the habit of trusting his keys to any person besides himself.</p>
               <p>MR. PETERS. I never trust them with any body.</p>

               <p>GRUBB'S Defence. I trust this will have considerable weight on my part; I was requested by M'Kenna to get change; had I the least idea of the note being stolen, it is not likely I should go to the Bank; and having an hour given me to call again, my returning proves I knew nothing of the transaction. I examined the note and saw it was good; as to the prevarication, knowing it was good, I only used those words to get it changed.</p>

On Thursday night the 20th of February, I was at home, nobody else was in the house; I was sitting in the warehouse, and heard the house bell ring; it rang a second time; I did not go to the door; I then heard the lock of the door being tried; I went to the room above with a brace of pistols, I looked into the court, and saw two or three men come up at a time; this continued for about two hours, till about half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090059"/>past ten o'clock; there was a light in the court, and I could always observe them making to the door, but could not distinguish any particular person. Next night I went with my brother and two other friends into a house, the ack windows of which look on to my door; we placed ourselves at the back window of this house. and observed two persons go up at a time; five separate times, they rang the bell and knocked as before, and looked up at the house to see if any lights were moving. I kept my station till half past ten o'clock; there was nobody in the house to answer the bell; I saw a number of persons watching about. On the Saturday night I took the same station, to watch with two friends, and saw them come up in the same way; ring and knock, and about half past ten o'clock, two men came up with a ladder, placed it at the window, and one mounted half way up; then a boy came down the court which disturbed them; he came down the ladder, and they carried it away; two more returned in about ten minutes with the ladder, and placed it against the house, one of them went up, and lifted the window up and got in, and the other carried the ladder away; I kept my post, and in about five minutes a party of five arrived with the ladder, pitched it at the window; two of them, mounted it, when one of the gentlemen who were on the watch gave an alarm, and I went to the passage leading to the court to prevent their escape, and met two men coming out, I presented a pistol to one and my friend did the same to the other which stopped them, and in a few minutes some persons rushed in, and pushed us out of the court into the street, and on turning my arm, my pistol fired and the man got away; I was thrown down; we chased the party and came up with the prisoner; my brother took him; I came up within fifteen seconds, and found him in custody. I went into the house and missed three amethists set in gold, and some more work which was in progress; I went to the watch-house with the prisoner, he asked if I would swear he was in the house. I said No, for I have every reason to believe he was not, for I consider him one of the party who did not enter.</p>

            . I am the last witness's brother, and joint owner of the house. On Saturday the 22d of February, I went to watch the house, and saw a man knock at the door twice; I think he also rang; a man came and stood and looked up the court at him and went away; after that I saw two men come up the passage, take a ladder from under it and place it against our window; a man went half way up it, a boy came running up the court; the man directly dropped from the ladder, placed it where they took it from and went off. In half an hour a man came up the court, looked up at the house and went away; two men came up, (apparently the same) and one got into the house with the ladder, the other put it back in its place, and after that five men came with the ladder again, three of them got on it; a signal was given for us to run out, they observed this and immediately began to descend, and at that moment, I went down to the street door, and through the court, and found a stoppage in the passage of some persons; my brother's pistol went off; one of them crossed the street, and ran towards Jewin-street, on the other side of the hackney coaches; I followed on the other side, and at the end of Jewin-street, a person caught hold of the prisoner by his coat; he was running and was with the others in the court; I saw him cross the street; the tail of his coat came off. I had not lost sight of him till then; I first saw him at the end of the court, with the party I am certain; it was not possible for any other persons to come into the court, so that he must be one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation did you first see him - A. Among the others with the ladder; whether he was on it, or at the foot, I cannot say, but I am sure he is one of them; when he was caught his coat skirt gave way; I followed immediately, and caught him by the back of his coat and neckcloth, and took him without losing sight of him and have not the least doubt of his being one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said at Guildhall you could not swear whether I was inside the court or not - A. My memory will not serve me to say what I said there. I will not swear that I did not say so; but I should think I did not say so. I said I saw him on the steps of the court, which are at the end of the court, quite away from our door. I had not seen him in the court, but on the steps at the end of the passage; but before that I saw him at the foot of the ladder. I saw him near my brother, on the step at the end of the passage - he appeared in contact with my brother, forcing himself from him. The man who got into the house made his escape through a trapdoor on the roof.</p>

            . I live at Aylesbury. On the night of the 22d of February, I was passing the end of this passage, and heard a cry for assistance. I immediately ran across the street, and saw the prisoner, and several others, endeavouring to rush out of the passage. A gentleman, dressed in a white coat, was keeping them in the passage. I immediately rushed into the passage, and endeavoured to secure the prisoner - at the same time a pistol went off, and they all made a rush together. I slipped down the step, and left my hold of the prisoner - he ran towards Jewin-street. I followed, and saw him taken, and taken to the watch-house. I did not see him lose his coat tail. I had an opportunity of seeing him in the court, and kept my eye on him till he was taken. I did not lose sight of him when I fell - he is the man.</p>

            . I am a linen draper, and live in Aldersgate Street. On the 22d of February, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was going by; as I passed the entrance of this passage, I saw a man rush from the entrance, and run across the street - I am sure the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him, but pursued him across the street some distance; and when about two yards from him, I saw him throw away a small parcel. I immediately seized him by the skirt of his coat, which gave way, and I have it here. I do not know what became of the parcel.</p>

            . Pearce lodged in the same room I met him in the Strand one Saturday morning, in February, and went with him to the Borough. He said he was going with some hats and bonnets. I waited on the bridge till he returned with some hats in a bag. I carried the bag part of the way. We came to Field-lane; he wished me to sell the hats. We were to have a pair of shoes each with the money. He gave me a hat in Field-lane; I took it into one Solomon's shop but did not sell it. In the evening I went to the west end of the town with him. We went together to Marks's shop in Field-lane. Pearce sold him some bonnets for 7 s. 6 d. - this was Saturday; and on Monday I sold Marks two of the hats for 15 s., and gave 
               <persName id="t18230409-141-person1290">Pearce</persName>

On the 19th of March, at seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked for two penny worth of cakes; I gave him four buns - he told me to wrap them up in paper, for they were for his master's children, and gave me a half crown, which I sounded, it was good, and I put it in the till, and gave him change - he then said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, I have got halfpence." I returned him the half-crown - then he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not," and gave me a half crown again, which I thought was the same, and put it into the till without looking at it - there was no other there. He went out; a little boy in the shop named Punch, told me to examine it, which I did, and found it was bad. I gave it to my mistress half an hour afterwards. I am certain he is the man.</p>

I let him have fifty-six yards of lutestring, worth 12 l., upon his promising to return the money or goods that night, or by nine o'clock next morning - he did not come next morning, and I sent my apprentice after him; but did not see him for two days, when he came to my place, and said he had fallen down on Blackfriars-bridge, and hurt himself; that he had sold the goods with some gloves to Mr. Attfield in the country, and wanted more goods; that he had an order upon Messrs. Fry's, bankers, for 50 l., by letter, which he did not produce. I never saw Attfield; he gave me this paper, (looking at it) - I was to keep it, and he was to send a copy of it to Attfield, to remit up the money; I have not received the goods or money. I had delivered him other goods, between the 18th of January, and the time this letter was written.

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. He was to bring the money or goods back next morning for the first goods - A. Yes.

             and Co." Before that time, I had learnt from the prisoner that Stamford was his partner, that he resided in Northamptonshire, where he had considerable freehold property, and that Stamford was to advance between two and 3000 l. in the business, which he (Needham) was to carry on as his partner; this passed in August last. The bill was in my hands on the 27th of January; when it became due it was not paid; the answer was that the acceptor was a bankrupt; in consequence of which I wrote a letter to Smith, White and Co. of Jersey, to Mr. Packwood, and to the endorsers; the Jersey letter was returned by the dead letter office. I could never find any such persons at Jersey. I have sent my clerk over there since this charge has been preferred. I did not see the prisoner after the bill was returned, but after other bills endorsed,</p>
               <p>"Stamford and Co." had been refused payment; I enquired of him particularly about Stamford; he was very angry at my pressing the enquiry, and said the bills would be taken up in a few days, and that it was not Stamford and Co's business to take them up, but the acceptors, and previous endorsers. Not being able to get the money from any one, I pressed him for the address of Stamford; he said I should hear of him at Mr. Jermaine's, upholsterer, Cumberland-street, New-road; I have not been there myself. I expressed my disapprobation, at his representing Stamford as a man of such property in Northamptonshire, when I had ascertained that he was only a porter to Mr. Jermaine; he then said that although only a porter, he had by his industry saved money, and possessed several freeholds in the neighbourhood of London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived in Norfolk-street - My family went there in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then - A. I was a prisoner in the Fleet, living in the rules, at Mrs. Hoare's, No. 45, or 46, Ludgate-hill. I was discharged from the Fleet on the 26th of October. I had been there a year and a half. I was eight months of that time in the walls.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not twelve months and upwards - A. I cannot speak to it exactly, but think it was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You certainly must recollect within a month or so - A. I think it was about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. You state yourself as carrying on business as a merchant - you must know whether people were giving you credit within the walls - A. They gave me credit within the walls and without.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you more than twelve months in the rules - A. I was admitted to a day-rule before, (hesitating) I think I was eleven months in the walls; I was moved there by habeas, from Ilchester.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a prisoner at Ilchester - A. Yes; for two years. A circumstance comes to my recollection now, by which I know I got the rules in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than fourteen months before you got the rules - A. Certainly; I think I was removed to the Fleet on the 14th of May, and in April in the next year I got the rules. I continued doing business at Mrs. Hoare's, till the end of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you to Ilchester gaol; was it one of the officers of the King's Bench - A. Yes; from the King's Bench prison. I had received sentence, on the floor of the King's Bench court.</p>

            . We were convicted of a mercantile conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have you not said that you transacted your business with the prisoner, at Mrs. Hoare's house, in Ludgate-hill - A. I received the bills in Norfolk-street. I stated to the magistrate, that the prisoner represented Stamford as a freeholder in Northamptonshire - and that he was to advance 2 or 3000 l. I said I took another bill, partly on the credit of the endorsement, but not this; he handed me over 4 or 500 l. worth of bills at once; it was in Norfolk-street, subsequently to my being discharged from the Fleet. The prisoner gave me a character on my trial for a conspiracy. The bills were left with me three or four days before I delivered any goods for them; I paid them all away long subsequent to the delivery of the goods. I know Mr. Wagstaff, but do not know that he carried on business under the firm of Stamford and Co. - I had not seen him more than once at the time of this transaction. The prisoner has done business with me and for me to the amount of many thousands. I should think he did 2000 l. worth of business for me, while I was in the Fleet; he has done business for me by agency, for five or six years past. I have done business to the extent of about 2400 l. with Wagstaffs, who are now bankrupts. I have endeavoured to get money on those bills, on which his name has been, but not to put an end to this prosecution. I made no such proposal to Levi or to Isaacs, but he did to me; he said he came with a view to serve me, and wished to get me my money - he said the prisoner had been drawn into it, and that Wagstaff was the man I ought to prosecute; I did not ask him if Needham's family would accept bills to the amount; I referred him to Mr. Cope, my attorney, and urged him to go there.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he ever call on you when Cope your attorney was present - A. He spoke to me as we came out of Marlborough-street - Mr. Cope advised me to refer him to him. Isaacs proposed my giving up this charge, and to prosecute for a fraud; and said probably I should get the money from Wagstaff in that event; he urged me to prosecute Wagstaff, and make Needham a witness. I remember advising Cope to go to Isaacs; he said it was his business professionally to call on him.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you, after your discharge from the Fleet, to continue at Mrs. Hoare's - A. A great many people called upon me there, and it was convenient for me to meet people there, who I did not wish to come where my family were, annoying me at meals, and out of business hours, and it was a convenient counting-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you recollect the amount of the fraud for which you were sent to gaol - A. I think there was an affidavit made, that the fraud would have amounted to 50,000 l. but the amount in the indictment was about 10,000 l.</p>
               <p>FRYER TODD. I am clerk to Mr. Kinnear. I went to Jersey, in March last, to enquire respecting the house of Smith, White, and Co. but could discover no such house; I advertised in four newspapers, and enquired at the Custom-House agents, and bankers, and went to five villages; I found one White, and Co. and presented the bill there; they denied all knowledge whatever of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. - Q. You were sent after this prosecution was commenced - A. I do not know that; he had gone to the public-office before that - I have been with Mr. Kinnear four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he find you - A. He has been at my house years ago - I first became acquainted with him about 1817, in Curzon-street, May fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a merchant there - A. I am sure I do not know. Mrs. Kinnear came to my house, in Curson-street. I do not know where he lived then; it was an invitation which came from my wife; it was an evening party. I did not know where he lived - The first residence I knew of his was at Battersea; some years elapsed between his visiting me in Curzon-street, and my seeing him again - I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know him live at Battersea - A. In 1821; that was after he was prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. After - A. Mrs. Kinnear had a house there.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know he was in gaol in 1821 for a conspiracy - A. I do not, I only heard it from report.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say he lived at Battersea, when you knew, from report, that he was at Ilchester - A. I might have been informed afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. After when - A. After I came into his employ. I do not know what year he was in gaol. I went to see Mrs. Kinnear, at Battersea. I did not ask where he was. I heard, by report, that he was at Ilchester, but never saw him there. I saw him in the Fleet. I was a prisoner there when he came from Ilchester. I was sent there in January, 1822, till March; he was a ruler there at the time I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he was in the rules of the Fleet in January or March, 1822 - A. After March. He was not within the walls in January. He might be at the commencement of January. I believe he was not in the walls. I have seen him come in and go out. During the time I was a prisoner there, he was not within the walls.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You are quite sure you met him at one of Mrs. Todd's routs - A. Yes. I renewed my acquaintance with him in the rules of the Fleet. I did not doubt his being convicted of a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you became his clerk - A. Yes. I never accepted bills for him. I have been a merchant, and became a bankrupt twice, and was discharged once under the insolvent act - that was in March, 1822. I lived thirteen years in Bury-street, and then went to Great Winchester-street.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Kinnear. I have been so at various periods since 1817. I knew he was at Ilchester. He came to the Fleet in 1821, and was within the walls about five months, and not more. I believe he took the rules at the latter end of September, 1821, and went to live at No. 46, Ludgate-hill. I was his clerk, from May 1821 till the end of January 1822; and from September, 1822 to the present time. In October last, the prisoner owed Mr. Kinnear about 500 l. I saw this bill in Mr. Kinnear's possession; the endorsement,</p>
               <p>"Stamford and Co," is the prisoner's writing. I have no doubt of it. When it became due I wrote to Stamford, Colville, and to Smith, White, and Co. - the letter to Smith and Co. was returned. I saw a man at Marlborough-street office, answering to the name of

            , at the time this charge was made, he was a round shouldered man, about the middle size and height. I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. How many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090064"/>times have you been Mr. Kinnear's clerk - A. Three. From February 1817 to 1819, and the other times, I have; mentioned I went into his service directly he came from Ilchester. I have a perfect recollection of this bill. I called on Colville, one of the endorsers, at St. Mary Axe. I do not believe there was any connexion between him and Kinnear. I recollected the prisoner handing this bill, and several others over. I copied them upon paper, at Ludgate-hill. I copied them there in the back room; they were afterwards taken by Mr. Needham, into the front room. I do not know that I ever saw them afterwards. The goods were not all furnished at once. I know J. and H. Wagstaff, they dealt with Kinnear. I understood they lived in Skinner-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the house of Stamford and Co. in Fore-street - A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you the slightest reason to believe there was any connexion between Kinnear and Colville - A. None.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Perhaps you attended the Court of King's Bench on the trial of the conspiracy - A. I was occasionally in Court. I heard the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any situation to go into the service of this infamous conspirator - A. I had been clerk to Mr. Keats, an army contractor; I left him previous to Kinnear coming to town; I had no employment; I have looked for no other since.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that he embarked in life with most respectable connexions, as an insurance broker, but met with considerable losses, when one Lec, of Liverpool, insinuated himself into his favour, and procured acceptances to a large amount from him, which got into Kinnear's hands, who struck a docket against him, and kept harrassing him till Kinnear went to Ilchester, and since his return, he (the prisoner) had accepted several bills for him - that in July last Wagstaff, who was a friend of the prosecutor's, and who represented himself as a man of property, applied to him to become one of the firm of Stamford and Co., representing Stamford as a man of considerable property, and being treated as a partner, he accepted and endorsed bills in the name of Stamford and Co. - that he derived no benefit from it, but Messrs.

On the 5th of April, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at Heston, about three miles from the Green Dragon, with this bed furniture under his arm - he said he came from Staines, and a gentleman there gave it him to deliver to a master butcher at Hammersmith. Thompkins the officer came up, and then he owned that he had stolen it at a public-house about four miles off, where there was a pond before the door, which answers the description of the house.</p>

The prisoner was in the habit of coming to our house for goods, on account of Miss Priestly, of Cambden-town, who dealt with us. On the 15th of March, he brought me an order, which has been mislaid; it purported to come from Miss Priestly to send by the Hampstead coach five pieces of Irish linen, a hundred and eight handkerchiefs, two shawls, and eight tippets; he said he was going by the same coach, and would take them with him - he looked out the handkerchiefs himself; the porter tied the goods up. I did not see him take them away. After he was apprehended, he told me he wrote the letter himself; the invoice of the goods was found upon him - he said he lodged in the room No. 8, Brown Bear, public-house, Bow-street.</p>

             till then. While my husband was confined in Newgate, I saw Samuel in Petticoat-lane - I knew him before by sight. He acted as a lawyer. He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Marks, I understand your husband is in trouble. I know the officers who have taken him, and if you have got any money I could settle it." I said, I had no money, but how much did he want. He said he would enquire, and let me know. Next day I was waiting at home with

            ; we were drinking coffee when Samuel came up into the room, and asked to speak with me. I said, he had no occasion to be afraid, for it was Ryan's sister - (Ryan was in Newgate with my husband). He then said, he had seen the officers, and could settle it for 20 l. I said, I had no money, and did not know what to do. He said, it wanted three weeks to the sessions, and perhaps I could get it by then. Next day I went to my husband, and told him. In consequence of having seen my husband, I saw Samuel again, two or three days after, he came to my place. I said, I was getting the money ready as fast as I could; that I had seen my husband, and he was satisfied. I sold my bed, bedstead, drawers, two tables, and a stove for 7 l.; my friends advanced me 3 l.; and

             gave me 3 l.; I got a coat and breeches from Ryan's son in Newgate, which I pawned for 20 s.; I pawned my wearing apparel for 2 l.; this was all I could raise. Samuel came to me several times. I told him I had got 16 l., and promised if he would take it I would give him the other 4 l. after my husband was discharged. He was to take the whole of the money, and divide it all among the officers, and I was to give him 4 l. to make up the 20 l. He said, he would trust to my generosity to be paid for his trouble afterwards. In the course of conversation, I said, I was not satisfied that he was doing right by me, unless I saw some of the officers. He said, he would soon satisfy me. In the evening I was sitting with Mrs. Ryan; a boy came and said I was wanted at the Three Pigeons, public-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090066"/>Houndsditch. I went there, and and saw Taylor and Samuel. Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Make yourself happy, for it shall be all right." I asked where the other officers were. He said, they were all under him, and he could satisfy them, for he could do as he liked with them. I drank with them - nothing more passed then. They came down to me once after that, and I was sent for again to the Three Pigeons, and saw Taylor and Samuel in the back parlour alone. They told me to make myself as happy as I could, for I should soon have my husband at home. It then, I believe, wanted about a week to the sessions. After that I saw Samuel almost every day, he told me the bill was to be thrown out; that the sessions began on a Monday, and Tuesday was appointed for the bill to be thrown out. I was to attend Clerkenwell sessions to see they were doing right by me. I attended, and saw Taylor, Samuel, Harris, and Allensby there, all speaking together. I waited in the Court until I heard the bill called out</p>
               <p>"not found against Ryan and Marks;" and when I came down the steps of the Sessions House, Samuel and Taylor took my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"Come along home, and get the money." They called a coach. The money was to be given the moment the bill was thrown out. I and Samuel, and his son, and

               <p>"Make yourself happy, for all is right." They asked me to drink. I said I could not, for it was tea time. Taylor called out</p>
               <p>"Tea for six." The landlady asked me to take tea with her, which I did. After tea I went into the back parlour; Taylor and Samuel were drinking - there were other people (strangers) in the room. I bid them good night, and went away. Next night a stranger came to me, saying, I was wanted at one Green's chandler's shop, in Petticoat-lane. Taylor had told me his sister livid there. I went with Mrs. Ryan, and saw Taylor. I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter" - He said,</p>
               <p>"There is a nice bother with the officers, they are not satisfied, and are going to prefer another bill against your husband." I cried, and said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know what in the world to do, for I have not another shilling in the world to bless myself with." He bid me stop while he looked for Romaine. I stopped near an hour, he never returned. I then went to the Three Pigeons, and saw Taylor and Romaine speaking together. I cried to them, and said, I did not know what I should do, for I was distressed to the utmost. Romaine said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will provide you two counsel;" and Taylor said</p>
               <p>"Never mind, when it comes to the Old Bailey I'll try and save your husband." I left them satisfied, and did not see them after. On Sunday morning I was at my place, and somebody said there was a true bill found against my husband. I did not see them again until the day my husband was tried here, I then saw Taylor and Samuel. Taylor said,</p>
               <p>"Make no noise, make no bother, I'll try and save your husband yet." My husband is now in prison. He was tried on the Tuesday after I heard the bill was found, and has never been at liberty since. - (See December Sessions, page 46.) I saw Samuel after the trial, and told him I was very much hurt at his wickedness, and I did not know what to do. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, do not say any thing. I'll do any thing in the world to serve you - I'll give you your money back again." After this, an enquiry was made, and I was summoned to Marlborough-street about it. This was a week or a fortnight after my husband was tried. Before I was examined I saw Samuel. He said if I would say what he told me, he would save my husband, and be a witness for me, and told me to say, I gave the officers the money, instead of giving it to him - and I did tell the Justice so.</p>

Yes; I told my friends the whole concern - he sent and came to me, and said he heard I was going to tell the truth, and put him in it, and if I did not do it he would give me 4 l. to prosecute the officers to keep him out of it.

               <p>"I want to speak to you" - she said</p>
               <p>"this is Ryan's sister, what you have to say say before her, you need not be afraid." He then sat down on the table, and said</p>

               <p>"It wants three weeks to the sessions, and you have good friends, and must do your endeavours" - she said she would see her husband next day; she sold goods to a broker for 7 l. - I went to Newgate with her. My brother told me to do what lay in my power for him, and I gave three sovereigns to Mrs. Marks, which was all I could raise. I went to her again two or three days after.

I staid all day, and at night heard somebody say</p>
               <p>"no bill against Ryan and Marks" - we came down the steps; Taylor took hold of Mrs. Marks with one shoulder and Romaine on the other; a coach was called, we got in with her, Romaine, and his son.

               <p>"I have an acquaintance in Houndsditch who keeps<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090067"/>the Fleur-de-lis, we will meet there" - he went away. I went home to my mother, stopped there two or three minutes, then came and met Marks in Houndsditch, and went with her to the Fleur-de-lis.

               <p>"Here is the money," and counted 16 l. into Romaine's hands - he called Taylor, and they went into the back parlour together. I staid a minute or two; Romaine and Taylor went out, called for tea, and I went away; another bill was found, and my brother is transported for life. There was an enquiry about it before the Magistrate afterwards, and Romaine said if I would say what he told me he would regain my brother's liberty, for it was not too late, and he would be an evidence against the officers - he told me to say the money was paid into Taylor's hands instead of his, and by saying that one word, I need not fret, for it would regain by brother's liberty. I did say so, it was not true, but I would have said any thing else to regain my brother's liberty.</p>

               <p>COATES Defence. On the Wednesday prior to this affair, I went to White Cross-street, Prison, to see my father with my brother; my father wished to have some private conversation with me, and would not let my brother stop; he told me, he should want some clothes and money. I went on the Monday and found nobody at home; I went to Vine-street, and saw this man, and asked him to carry a bundle or two for me; he waited at the public-house, while I went and pawned some for money to take to my father.</p>
               <p>SIMCOE'S Defence. I am a porter, and was standing at my beat, with my knott, this man hired me to carry the bundle; I stopped at the head of the stairs while he went down, he took me to the public-house, to have some beer, and took something out to pawn, to get money for his father, and sent me to pawn some, and when I returned the landlady said I had better stop, for the officer had been about it - so I waited and refused to give the money up.</p>

            . I am a publican. On the 20th of February, about three o'clock, I was standing at my door in Arbour-square, and saw the prisoner passing with two hams - a parcel of boys were running after him. A man came up, and took the hams from the prisoner, and told the boys to go away - I went up and told him I thought he was stealing them for him - two people took them from him, and I took charge of the prisoner. The man said the prisoner had no parents.</p>

I saw King put his hand in his pocket, and give something to the other - he went over into the shop, and came out with a white deal box on his arm; King lifted it on the man's shoulder, who ran off down Golden-lane; I followed; they turned back, and asked where I was going - I said, home - Murphy was with me.

He ran down the lane, and in a short time Bishop came up; and at half past ten o'clock, I saw them all in Whitecross-street; and then I think they were in liquor.

               <p>"Go on, I'll be with you in a moment" - Cross and I went up stairs; I got the box to strike a light, to make a fire - the tinder-box was in the drawer with the money, which was safe when I took the box out. I was striking a light, and Cross pulled the drawer out, took something out and turned round, saying she wanted to go into the back-yard - I directed her to the yard; she said I had better lay down and have a sleep; I was rather fresh; she said she would be up in a moment, and as soon as she was out of the room, I felt and found my watch gone from my fob, and the money from the drawer. I went down, and they were both gone, and the door shut. I found them in custody afterwards.</p>

I found three bags of pepper concealed under some planks in the Company's yard - next morning I concealed myself in a watch-box, about ten yards from where they were concealed, and about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the planks and took the bags; he put one in his hat and one in each pocket - they weighed 5 lbs. together; he left two empty bags and a pocket handkerchief in the place where the pepper was; I ran out and took him to the warehouse-keeper's room - the warehouse is not open till eight o'clock; he would not be searched if he went out before eight - the prisoner worked in the same warehouse, but not on the same floor as the pepper was kept.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to find them there - A. I was told some had been there before - eight o'clock was the time to come to work; I have seen labourers go in and out without being searched - I have seen the prisoner go out without being searched. He did not say he was going to the counting-house.</p>

               <p>PRISONER. Q. Are you confident she was alive, when I married my last wife - A. I saw her in June or September last. I think there were five marriages that morning. Mr. Humphries was the clergyman, the attesting witnesses are all her relations. I am certain of him as I knew him well before. I am elected by the corporation, and was never suspended. The Church plate is kept at my house now, and was never moved from it.</p>

            . I was married to the prisoner at Shoreditch, on the 14th of November, 1819. I have one child by him, and am now in the family way. He lived about two years at first with me; then left me in distress without a penny to buy bread; he returned to me about seven months ago, and left me in the family way again, after saying he had a comfortable home for me. He went by the name of

             when he married me; I heard he was married before, and told him of it; he said she was only a kept woman, this was some time after I married him. I was acquainted with him for three months before I married him. I had no fortune, I believed him to be single; my uncle was foreman in Bishopsgate-street, were he worked as a tailor; he pawned the ring off my finger and my clothes, and then deserted me.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and live in Lower Sloane-street, about three minutes walk from Atkinson's. I put my coach up in the yard, three or four doors from Atkinson's house. A little after twelve o'clock at night, as I passed the shop, I kicked against against a roll of lead. I looked up, and saw two men on the leads of the shop, which are about twenty feet high. It was rather a dark night. I called the watchman two or three times. They laid down on the leads to hide themselves. I could find no watchman, and did not know what to do. As I stood there, the prisoner came down from the leads; (I had known him six months - he lived near the place.) I asked him what he was doing. He said, he was doing wrong. I said, I was sorry for it, and went home - there were three of them. I told my mistress of it at eleven o'clock, and she told Atkinson.</p>

            . I live at No. 17, Long-acre; I lodge on the second floor, and am a clerk - I am out of employ. I came from Liverpool about eighteen months ago, and have not had any regular employment since. Hollingsworth is landlord of the house. On the 20th of February, last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool he would take them - I told him No; I did not know his name. He was going to Ireland that way; I had seen him once or twice, only, at two or three inns in London. We stood in conversation in the street, opposite Mr. Martin's door; our conservation lasted upwards of twelve or fourteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, during which time I saw

I had known him for about fourteen months - I had sold him things belonging to a lady, whose husband was dead, and she is gone to Scotland; it was Mrs. Johnson of Broad-street, at the bottom of Poland-street.

I have been a good deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090076"/>supported by a sister of mine, who lives at Manchester, and my brother.</p>

             how he did I suppose - A. No; I was standing in conversation. I cannot tell the name of the person, who was in conversation with me; he was going to Ireland by way of Liverpool.</p>
               <p>A. When your friend left you, why not go over and ask how he did - A. It was of no material consequence; it was on a Thursday. I had sold him a few brushes and various kitchen utensils, and a pan or two belonging to the lady, they amounted to about 10 s. in all. He always paid ready money. I sold them within four months. He was never at my lodgings. I told him where I lived, when I lived in Rose-street, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him at any other time - A. Yes; nine months ago or more, I lived in Rose-street about eight months ago. I have been seven months where I now am, and previous to that I was there. I did not keep company with

               <p>Q. All the articles you have dealt in, only amounted to 10 s. - A. It might be 1 s. more, they did not ask where I lived, after I had told them once; I lived in Rose-street, then, I do not recollect his asking where I lived afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear, you told him you lived in Long-acre - A. I think I told Mrs. Martin so, because she was mostly in the shop. I will swear, I told her I lived in Long-acre. I told Mr. Martin where I lived in Rose-street, and think I told Mrs. Martin, I lived in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to, to be a witness - A. Last Friday, Mrs. Martin applied to me. I was going by the house, on the 21st of February, and saw Mrs. Martin, at the door and asked her how she was; she said she was in a little trouble about her son and Mr. Martin; then she related the circumstance to me; this was about noon.</p>
               <p>Q. Noon is twelve o'clock in the day - A. Yes; she told me then, that her son and Mr. Martin were taken up; about noon. I swear that positively; she did not say who had taken them. She said they were taken at her house, at least her son was. I believe Mr. Martin was not taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you at noon, that they were both taken up - A. At noon the following day.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you this on the 21st of February, at noon, that Mr. Martin and his son were both taken up, do you swear that positively - A. I do - she said her son; was taken there, and her husband at Clerkenwell, she told me so at noon; Clerkenwell, is half a mile from her house; she said they were taken to Bow-street. I said nothing more to her, but wished her good morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then tell her, you saw her son the day before, at the time he was charged with this offence - A. Yes; I forgot that; I immediately replied</p>
               <p>"I was by here last night and saw your son Robert." I told her the very time I had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that the time was material - A. I said I was by a few minutes before six o'clock, talking to a gentleman, and saw him last night; she asked me what time I had seen him - I told her it struck six o'clock just as the gentleman accosted me, and we were twelve or fourteen minutes together. She said they were taken up for some candles I believe; nothing else; she did not mention about candle moulds. I did not go to see Martin.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you told Mrs. Martin where you lived - A. Nine months ago. I told her I lived in Rose-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How then could they find you out in Long-acre - A. I believe I told her that four or five months ago. I called in and told her, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you positively swear you told her you lived at No. 17, Long-acre - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear she said Martin sen. was in custody, as early as noon that day - A. Yes.</p>

We had planted several crab stock plants on the 19th of March; I left the ground in the afternoon; the men usually leave at six o'clock - it is dark before seven. Next morning, between nine and ten, I went to the grounds, and found that about eighteen hundred had been stolen; the ground was trodden down - it had been a wet night - I did not see the ground when it was finished at night, but plants were left standing in different places. I afterwards saw six or seven of them - our clerk brought them from Vauxhall; they appeared to be a part of those stolen, as far as I could judge. I had not assisted in planting them, but was present part of the day. We always trim them in planting them. If they are intended for sale they are not trimmed. I do not know the prisoner. After his committal he came up to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I am guilty," and begged I would not prosecute, on account of his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Nothing had been said to him - A. No; he said this voluntarily, - he asked to speak to me, and said so. I understand he is a market gardener. There were more than than three hundred plants gone, certainly, - the value of the whole is between 30 s. and 40 s.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. I was with the men planting the trees. They left work on the evening of the 19th - it was not dark then. I returned to the ground soon after six o'clock next morning, the sun had risen about ten minutes. I found a number of rows, and about eighteen hundred plants pulled up and gone. We had left the ground pretty level. The land is rather of a yellowish hue, and a stiff soil. I did not observe any earth on the parts of the plants that were above the ground. I assisted in pruning them - they were done for planting, and not for sale; we could not have exposed such for sale. There was the print of men's feet on the ground. Some rows were taken entirely; and sometimes one left here and there, as if done in a hurry, and in the dark. In consequence of information from Phillip, I went to his grounds at Vauxhall, and saw about two thousand plants, being near the number we lost; they were not planted, but the roots merely covered with earth. I have seven of them here, and am positive they are part of those stolen from our ground. I had pruned them myself, and cut the roots much closer than if they were intended for sale - we always cut them closer for planting; and the leaders of some were on, and others were not; and in cutting them. I frequently left a small piece of bark, which I observe on these. I will swear that at least fifteen hundred of them are ours - our soil is a yellow loom colour, and these were covered with mud at the top, above the roots, which would not have been the case, if they had not been taken from the ground in a hurry, laid on the wet ground and walked over; they have the same sort of soil on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Are they now in the state you found them - A. There was a little more earth about them than now.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the earth that is now on them weigh twelve grains - A. I think not. I speak from the quality and nature of the soil which was on them at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you saw them they were fresh - A. Yes. I positively swear they are ours. I received them from Phillips on the Saturday following.</p>

            , sen. I have a nursery ground at Vauxhall. About a week previous to the 22d of March, the prisoner called on me, and produced a sample of crab<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090080"/>and pear stocks, I agreed for two thousand of each. About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 22d of March, he brought two thousand of each. I covered the roots with earth to keep the air from them. I saw they were much injured in the bark, and in a state improper to be sold. They appeared to have been trampled on in the dark. He accounted for the injury, by saying, they were damaged by rubbing against the sides of the cart. I shewed him that the interior of the bundles were the same. He could give no satisfactory answer to that. The stems were very muddy - I refused to pay for them, as I had suspicions, and wrote to the prosecutors immediately. The clerk came over, and I shewed him the same; he took a few away as a sample - they were cut in an unusual manner for sale. He observed, in reply to that, that he had been so kind as to do that for me, as they were prepared for planting; and that he would not charge me any thing for it, though they were worth 7 s. 6 d. for it. He delivered them on the 22d. I left my ground on the Saturday evening, and on the Monday morning found them all stolen, except seven, which had escaped notice. The pear stocks were not taken; they were not the prosecutors', nor were they in the same state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have bought of him before - A. Yes, at different times; I had ordered these a week previous. I wrote to him on the 13th of March to bring me a sample. I was never at his grounds.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman. When plants are to be sold, they are cut different to when they are intended for planting. Those in question are cut for planting only.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if sold for planting they would be cut that way - A. Never; the small fibres are never cut off when they are sold, or they would spoil; they should be cut off at the moment of planting. They are not sold after being planted and pruned; they never take them up. No nursery man would sell them in that state; the expence of planting is too great to sell them afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Every person has his own way of trimming - A. Yes. I should certainly have declined buying them in this state; I should have suspected they had been stolen after planting.</p>

An officer came in a few minutes, and said in her presence, he had come for a watch, which she had taken from a young man - she said she had none. She came and stood by me, and wanted to slip the watch into my hand - I would not, and it dropped down. Dargue picked it up.</p>

I saw something pass towards Hearn; I had another girl in my charge, and on turning round I saw the watch in the prosecutor's hand; he claimed it. The prisoner was flurried, and said nothing, The man had been intoxicated, and could not say whether she was the girl or not. He is not here.</p>

I saw her leaning over the counter with her whittle; she had a piece of lace in her hand, and sent the young man to the window to fetch some more, and while he was gone the prisoner put it quite under her whittle; she then offered a low price for the lace, and was going away without buying any thing. I stopped her at the door; she shook her whittle and this lace fell at her feet, it was two yards from the counter.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I went with a search warrant to the prisoner's room, No. 19, Wood-street, Cromer-street, to look for other articles. She lodged in the front parlour. I found a chest of drawers; one drawer was locked. I insisted on its being opened. she hesitated, and at last opened it with a key, and put herself down to try to conceal something, she took hold of a pint pot trying to conceal it. I found another quart pot and two pints, each wrapped in separate cloths; they had the names and signs of the houses, all on them. There was wearing apparel in the drawers.</p>

I knew nothing of the pots being there. The partition to the drawers does not meet half way, so that they could put any thing there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was attending at the Opera-house, and received the prisoner in charge for picking pockets - several gentlemen were round; he said he knew nothing about it. Mr. Delisle said, he had taken his snuff box out of his coat pocket - he made no answer. I asked him how he came to go into the pit, being only a journeyman carpenter. He said he went to see the performance, and paid 10 s. 6 d.; that he saw a man drop a box, he picked it up and put it into his pocket. The prosecutor did not attend at the office, and he was discharged.</p>

On Thursday week, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to melt a small quantity of gold. I weighed 21 dwts., and put it in a crucible, on the work board, where he was at work alone. Having lost gold and pearls at times, I thought I would fix the crucible, so that I should know if it had been disturbed - he had no occasion to move it at all. I returned in three or four minutes, and found it had been removed a few inches from where I placed it; it then weighed 19 dwts. 13 grains - he seemed confused, and went up stairs, and shortly afterwards returned, and was shuffling among some old boxes. I sent him on an errand, and found the gold wrapped up in paper, in an old box, among some old iron - I replaced it there, and sent for an officer, and when he came in, I asked him to produce the gold he had taken from the crucible; he denied having taken any. The officer spoke sharp to him, and he put his hand up the flue, and produced it. I had left it in the box - he must have moved it from there.</p>

I had been robbed before by the apprentices; I then said, if they wanted a broach, to ask my leave, and they should have it; but the first who robbed me I would prosecute.</p>

These things were in a box in my bed-room not locked - I went to the box and missed some children's things; I called her up, and she said they were in the other room - I went, but they were not there. She then said they were at the mangler's. I had her fetched, and she said she had brought them home on Friday - the prisoner then said she would give them to me in the morning - but we gave her in charge. I found them in pawn.</p>

I replaced the things, as she had asked to go out that evening - I examined the plate, and found a spoon missing. I got up early next morning, and watched at the bed-room window, which commanded a view of the street, and in about twenty minutes I saw Riley come opposite the house, and look down the kitchen - she went backwards and forwards six or seven times, she then stopped; she had a small white handkerchief, which appeared to be empty, she opened the gate and appeared to come in at the street-door; this was about six o'clock. Riley left the house endeavouring to conceal a bundle under her cloak; I then ran down and before she turned the corner of the street, I came up with her, and asked what she had under her cloak; she said some broken victuals, which had been given her by a person close by - I asked her where; she pointed towards the chapel, which is in a contrary direction to my house - I told her to return with me; she did - I placed her in the in the front parlour, where the other prisoner was. I had her bundle put on the table; she made a motion which I thought to be curtsying, but I found she had dropped a bottle of port wine; I made her sit down. and would suffer no communication between the two; close by the door where she sat, was another bottle of sherry, which I have compared with my stock. I sent for a constable, who examined the bundle - it was the same I had found under the bed, but two plates were added to it. I found a letter with a direction in it, in the parcel which gave me the residence of the prisoner Riley. I went there and found five plates, of the same pattern as the other two; and about four yards of ribbon, which I knew to be mine, as it was on the card of a friend of mine, and I had seen it on my wife's bonnet; five pair of gloves were in the bundle, and some of which have my name on them. Riley said she had found the wine that morning, in a field behind the House of Correction, wrapped in a napkin. Dunkin said she did not care what I did with her, provided I let the other go. She called her aunt - I found the spoon at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The gloves are dirty - A. Certainly; they were perhaps left in my hat, or put in a drawer to be cleaned - the ribbon cost 16 d., a yard. I can swear to the plates, by their shape, size, and pattern, and by a deficiency in the set.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, how many plates you had - A. I do; for we had had a party the night before; and the prisoner was very anxious to have the key to put them out. I know they were not broken - we allow our servants 10 s. 6 d. a year, in addition to their wages for accidents; and if they were broken, we should know it. I knew the wine by the taste, and colour.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Neale, who lives opposite Mr. Fish. I saw Riley walking up and down the street, before Mr. Fish's door, a little after six o'clock in the morning; and noticed her looking down the kitchen window. Then the servant let her in - she had no bundle then, only a white handkerchief; she came out in about five minutes, with a bundle under her arm - I went away from the window directly; Mr. Fish came over, and I told him what I had seen.</p>

On the 11th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I received five sovereigns and eleven shillings at Chelsea Hospital. I spent some of it in drink, and was rather fresh. I was going home, and lost it between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. I do not remember meeting any woman - I was going to look for a woman, whom I had promised to go home with, but could not find her. I either fell down or was knocked down, and the officer picked me up. I cannot say whether I had been in company with any woman or not.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Pimlico.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090085"/>I was passing Buckingham-gate, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prosecutor coming out of a public-house, very drunk, and coming down the steps he fell, and cut his head very much - the prisoner followed him out of the house, and endeavoured to raise him up. I asked if she knew any thing of him; she said, No, and seeing him in that state I proposed to search his pockets to see if we could find where he belonged to, which I did, and his pockets were empty. A person who came out of the public-house, said they had seen him with sovereigns; I then suspected the prisoner must have robbed him, searched her, and found a bag concealed under her arm, containing three sovereigns, a crown, and four half crown pieces. I delivered it to the landlord, gave her in charge, and sent the prosecutor to the Infirmary. The bag and money was delivered to me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker. On the 15th of January, about half past eight o'clock in the morning; I took this watch in pawn of the prisoner for 17 s.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I made a ship in miniature, and sold it to the prosecutor for 25 s., he paid me 5 s. I wanted to go into the country, and I asked the prosecutor for the rest; he would not give it me; his sister suggested that I should pawn his watch; I did so, and gave him the duplicate; he returned it to me, saying it was useless to him. He walked with me as far as Hammersmith, I returned in three days and drank tea with him; he said nothing. I was apprehended about a week after, and the prosecutor desired the the officer to let me go; he did so, and I visited him for a month after.</p>
               <p>E. G. PAPWORTH. He came to the house two or three times after the watch was taken. He gave me the duplicate when my sister was with me.</p>

On the 6th of April, at seven o'clock, I went into the Bell public-house Ratcliffe-highway. The female prisoner was in the tap-room; she drank with me - we were together about an hour. She then asked me to go home with her, and took me to a private piece of ground near the fields; we stopped there about six minutes, and then a man passed me very close, (this was about eight o'clock at night). The man pushed before me, and in an instant I missed my watch from my fob. I instantly charged her with stealing it - she denied it, and said she did not know that I had got one. I said I would not let her go till she gave it me - she asked if I saw a man pass; I said Yes.</p>
               <p>"Well," said she,</p>
               <p>"he has got your watch, and I will take you to his home." She took me to a house in Seven Star-alley, to the male prisoner's mother - I took her to the watch-house. I only know that one of the two must have taken it.</p>
