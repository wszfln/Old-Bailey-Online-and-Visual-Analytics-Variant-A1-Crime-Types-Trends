I live at 4, Ledbury Road, Bayswater, and am a clergyman—about 6 on afternoon of 9th February I saw two men taken into custody at the corner of Endell Street—I do not recognise them—I saw a slight struggle, and Turrell placing his hands over their clothing—there were fifteen or twenty people there—I looked and saw a man picking up something off the ground—he handed it to me—it was a package of these 10 counterfeit shillings—I marked them—they were all wrapped in paper, and with paper between each—I tested one between my teeth; it was bad—I put it in my pocket, and walked away about 100 yards—then two men came after me—a policeman came up, and I went to the station and gave them up to the inspector—the man picked up the coins about two or three yards from the struggle, in the gutter beside the curb.</p>

I said, "Very well, if it is to send to my son I will let you have the watch," and under those circumstances I let him have the watch—my son is an actor, and was employed by the prisoner at 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I did not lend the prisoner the money—it is not true that he was to use some of it in the concern—he has not written to say he would pay me back by instal<lb/>ments.</p>

I live at 19, Hart Street, Grosvenor Square—I was living there on 20th January—I occupied a bed in the back-room ground floor—the prisoner lived in that room with me, and occupied a bed there—he had lived in the house about eight months, not all that time in that room, but two storeys higher up—it is a six-roomed house—he had slept in the same room with me for about six months—Ann Sutton lived in the room above me, with a child, aged about a year and eight months—Ann Sutton was about forty years of age—Emily Sharp and Mary Elizabeth Coten lived in the same room on 20th January, and, Charles Stanfield and William Jewell lived in the front-room first floor—the prisoner was often speaking of Ann Sutton; I could not say how long before 20th January—he was merely talking about her most nights—he used to ask her to mend some of his clothes sometimes—he said once or twice, when he was cross and swearing, that if he could not have her nobody else should—I could not tell on what day he said that—there was somebody present at the time—up to the Saturday before 20th January the prisoner had been at work—I should say he was a bricklayer's labourer—he did not go to work on Monday, the 17th, or on the Tuesday and Wednesday—he was drunk all day on the Monday and Tuesday—he was drunk when he went to bed on Tuesday—on Wednesday he was sober—he went to bed on Wednesday about half-past 9, or a quarter to ten—he was quite sober then—I saw him on Thursday morning when he got up, about twenty minutes past 8—he dressed, and put on his wide-awake and greatcoat, and when he left the room he said "Daddy, I am going out for a little while"—in about twenty minutes, or a little more, I heard Mrs. Sutton scream in the passage—I jumped out of bed, and drew on my trousers—the prisoner rushed upstairs—I knew it was him because there was nobody in the passage but Mrs. Sutton and him—as soon as I had helped Mrs. Sutton to go downstairs I ran out for the police and for help—when I came out of my room I saw Mrs. Button standing opposite my door, with her neck bleeding very much—on the Wednesday night I had a razor on my dressing-table which I had kept there this four years, and on the Thursday a policeman showed it to me all stained with blood—there was no one but the prisoner and myself occupying the room during the night—Mrs. Sutton was not there—she might have come in by chance in the early part of the evening, but she never came in there after we retired—I do not sleep soundly—the prisoner was very quiet and cool and collected, and very pleasant on the Thursday morning, and he had been so on the Wednesday night, and when he went to bed he bid all good night.</p>

               <p>Wednesday before this happened that he used those words—I remember a man named Rolf coming to see Mrs. Sutton on Sunday, the 16th, between 5 and 6 p.m.—he had formerly been a lodger there, and had come to Mrs. Sutton's room with reference to some washing—about 10 minutes, or it might have been 20 minutes, after he had gone the prisoner came into the room and said to Mrs. Sutton, "You would have been on the floor, and that man Rolf; you are my sweetheart; I have got my coat, pipe, and tobacco, ready to be locked up for you," and he said he would go up to his knees in blood for her—Mrs. Pearson was in the room at the time and heard the threats, and said to the prisoner, "You will leave my house, for I won't have such behaviour here"—between 6 and 7 the same evening the prisoner came up to our door—it was bolted, and I think he said, "Good night, my darling; I am going out"—on the next day, Monday, about 2, I went out with Mrs. Sutton for a walk—we left the house separately, because Mrs. Sutton was afraid of the prisoner—I left first with the baby, and the prisoner came out of his door at the bottom of the stairs and kissed the baby—I told him I was going to take the baby out for a walk, to mislead him—I then waited at the corner outside for twenty minutes for Mrs. Sutton, and then she came, and the prisoner followed her—she told him to go back, or she would have him locked up, but he took no notice—he said he thought she was going to see somebody else, and he said, "I am going to see where you are going to," and he continued to follow us until we returned home—on Thursday morning, 20th, Mrs. Sutton got up about a quarter-past 8, and went out to buy bread and milk, and about twenty minutes afterwards I heard her voice from the stairs say, "Get off the stairs, and let me pass; you have no business on these stairs; and keep your hands off me"—about four or five minutes afterwards I heard her scream, and my friend Emily Sharp and I jumped out of bed, and when I opened the door the prisoner was on the landing—I was going to shut it again, but he pushed it against my strength, and pushed past me to get to the baby—he had a dosed razor in his hand—I went into Mr. Stanfield's room—about half-an-hour afterwards I saw the prisoner in his own room, and when he saw me he said, "You little devil! you will be the next one"—a constable was with him then.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I am divisional surgeon of the E Division of Police—about 9 on this Thursday morning I went to 19, Hart Street—I went up to the room on the first floor, and there saw</p>

               <p>the child, quite dead—there was a very serious Wound in the throat, which had caused instantaneous death—I saw the prisoner a little before 9 the same morning, sitting in the back room ground floor—I asked him some questions as to where he came from, and after some general conversation he made a statement—I had previously felt his pulse and looked at his tongue, and asked him to hold out his hands to see if they were steady or if there were any indications of delirium tremens—he then said, "I have been keeping company with Mrs. Button, she has drank with me and I have given her money,; but she has treated me very cruelly and has turned me up; a week ago I told her I would cut her throat, and she said, 'If you do so, kill the child, and don't leave it to the mercy of the world,' and I have done so"—that was all he said—he was per<lb/>fectly calm, and I saw no indication of insanity—he appeared like a man recovering from the effects of drink, who had had a drinking bout—I had never seen him before—I afterwards saw that Stanfield's thumb had been cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I have had a great deal to do with cases of insanity in connection with my public appointment and privately—I have never been at Broadmoor or served in any asylum—I am constantly called in as surgeon to the police and medical officer to certify in cases of insanity, for 25 years—I should say that insane persons have not a knowledge of the character of the act they commit—a madman may know that he has killed a person, he is not wholly bereft of knowledge, and he reasons from certain premises—it has not been my duty or vocation to attend persons charged with crimes in connection with insanity—I noticed nothing abnormal in the pupils of the prisoner's eyes—a violent act of insanity is often very suddenly pro<lb/>duced—a person may for a long time not have excited any suspicion of insanity, and then suddenly commit an insane act—it is the disease of the mind which renders the person unable to control his actions—in many instances it is very difficult to diagnose insanity, but not generally—the border line between sanity and insanity is very narrow—it is very difficult to define the border line between eccentricity and insanity, almost impos<lb/>sible—you may define insanity as a morbid life growth from a diseased germ—serious injury to the head is a fruitful cause of insanity—I should expect it to show its effects at an early date, not necessarily immediately, not in a violent form—drink is a fruitful source of insanity, granting previous indication of it—drink combined with head injury would be likely to develope it—delusions, as a rule, come on at a comparatively early period—when insanity has once begun there is very often melancholia or eccentric action before delusions—the fact of a man not trying to avoid the consequences of his crime, or seeming proud of it, I should not con<lb/>sider an index to insanity—the exceedingly abnormal calmness in the prisoner after the act did point to insanity—the causes of insanity are exceedingly numerous; such as injury to the head, sudden mental shock, excessive fatigue, and drunkenness—paralysis is frequently a symptom of certain forms of insanity, but you cannot tell unless you know the character of the paralysis—the form of paralysis I have in my mind is a recognised paralysis of the insane—I should not like to say that insane acts of violence are more frequently directed against most intimate friends or dearest relations—I very much question that—one point in insanity is a total change of feeling towards persons—these impulses may come, on</p>

I am divisional surgeon of the C Division of Police—on the morning of 20th January, about quarter to ten, I was called to the police-station to see the prisoner—I examined him to ascertain the condition of his mind—as far as I could judge I found him quite of sound mind, able to answer any ordinary question—he said he found out that I was a doctor, and hoped I should not think he was insane, that this morning he had committed two murders and that he could die for it—he said he had been deceived in two women before, and that he did not intend to be so in a third—he said he had threatened the woman some time previously, and she had asked him if he killed her not to leave the child to the mercy of the world—he was quite sober—he had been drinking some days previously, I should say, and had not altogether recovered from the effects of it, but he had not been drinking within the last few hours—I said, "Have you been drinking?" and he admitted it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, one of the Physicians of University College Hospital, and also Physician to the Hospital for Paralysed and Epileptic Patients—I have had a large experience in cases of insanity—on 11th, and also on 15th February I went to Holloway Prison and there saw the prisoner—I examined him for the purpose of ascertaining the state of his mind—I examined his head—I found a scar on the upper part of the right frontal region, about an inch and a quarter in length—there was a considerable irregularity of the bone in that situation, so much so that I thought it probable that the bone had been fractured—there was distinct tenderness on percussion, and none over other parts of the head—he said he fre<lb/>quently had very severe pains in that part, that about 17 years ago he had been thrown over the head of a horse, pitching on his head, that he was stunned for about half a day, that he remained in bed from two to three weeks, and that he had done no work for 67 weeks; he said his head had been cut, and bled very much at the time—from the state in which I found his head I should think that was a probable and correct account that he gave me—I think there had been actual fracture, from the irregularity of the bone, still that was not certain—there was some evi<lb/>dence of paralysis on the right side of the face, and some slight weakness of the right limbs, from those appearances I think it possible that there had been some injury to the brain—I could get no history from him of his having had any illness or any affection of the brain—I think it possible that he may have had damage to the brain which caused that slight paralysis—I could discover no evidence that he was of unsound mind, but he is an extremely weak-minded man, so weak-minded as to border upon imbecility—I spoke to him upon the subject</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188702280029"/>
               <p>of the charge—he spoke freely on the subject—he seemed then to have no definite conception of the real nature of the acts, I mean the moral nature of the acts—for instance, he seemed to think that the fact that the woman had wished him to kill the child if he did anything to her, was a perfectly sufficient justification for his taking the life of the child—I gathered from him that the woman had had sexual relations with him for some time past, but not since the Thursday previous to the acts, and that he had quarrelled with her on the next day, Friday, about some request on her part to give her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go the theatre—he repeated over and over again that the woman was in the habit of coming to his bed in the night for an hour or two, two or three times a week—I said, "Did the man Bartholomew know of that?"—he said, "Oh! he is an old man, rather deaf, and didn't hear"—I discovered no evidence of delusions, my impression was that what he said was correct—he impressed me with the notion that he believed what he was telling me—I gathered from him that there had been several quarrels in the day between the com<lb/>mencement of the Friday and the Wednesday night, that he had been drinking a good deal also, that he had tried to get work on the Thursday morning, had failed in two places, and came back, as he termed it, "down on his luck"—that he came back depressed, that he took up the razor and went out, intending to commit suicide, that he met the woman in the passage, and then determined, as he said, to make a clean sweep of it, beginning with the woman, then going to the child, and he declared that if the razor had not been wrested from him, he should have cut his own throat—he seemed to recollect all the details of the occurrence—Mr. Gilbert, the surgeon of the goal, was with me at the time I examined him, and I had seen the same statement in the notes taken by Mr. Gilbert—I think the prisoner knew I was a doctor—I could certainly discover no evidence of insanity, but I considered that the man had had his brain damaged, and that he was on that account congenitally of very weak and feeble mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he told me this story about his having been out to two places to get work, he told it as if he believed it—I thought he was telling the truth—he did not mention the places he had been to—imbecility is one of the worst and most exaggerated forms of weakness, but this man was not imbecile—I said there was weak-mindedness bordering upon imbecility—there is a great distinction between the two—he was not to be described as an imbecile at all—imbecility is a very bad form of madness—there are other forms of insanity in which perhaps a man may have less consciousness than an imbecile—it is difficult to say where sanity ends and insanity begins—it would depend upon the definitions for what is sanity and insanity—I should not like to try to define it, many have tried and failed—I was at Broadmoor many years ago—the practice there then was very different to what it is now, all sorts of people were sent there then—I should scarcely think that injury to the head was one of the most fruitful causes of insanity—it is a frequent one, and also drink, and the two combined would be very likely—he didn't tell me that the woman had slept in that room, he merely said that she had been to his room—my impression was that he believed it, and that he was telling the truth—of course I could not tell that, but when one talks to a man for many hours one can get a shrewd notion whether he is telling the truth or not, and my impression was that he was telling the truth—certain</p>

               <p>forms of insanity acts of violence are very sudden—I don't think that hard work would be apt to give signs of symptoms of insanity, not the ordinary work of a bricklayer's labourer—it would be very deplorable if that were so—the injury to the head was a bad one, I found traces of it 17 years afterwards—a man receiving a brain injury would be more likely to be affected by drink—acts of violence frequently spring from delusions—the paralysis I found was slight paralysis of the right side of the face, the cheek, and tongue—that is not connected with insanity—thousands of people are paralysed for life who are not insane—it does not give rise to insanity, or help to cause it—some forms of paralysis are of themselves indicative that a man may be of unsound mind, but certainly not the sort of paralysis that I found here—this was the common form of paralysis unconnected with mental.</p>

I am provisional superintendent of the Ceylon police—on 7th September I received a telegram from the Lieut.-Governor of Ceylon, in consequence of which I kept watch—I kept watch for the ships Carthage and Nepaul—the Carthage had arrived—I went on board and saw the purser, who showed me the list of the passengers who had come to Port Said, but who were not there—the Nepaul came in next day—I went on board her with a warrant, and saw the captain, and the passengers were introduced to me, Guites and Esther Pollock as Mr. and Mrs. Abrams, and Bittan, who said his name was Benjamin—I sent an inspector to the Carthage to bring their luggage, which I had previously seized—I took them ashore, and they signed their names Mr. and Mrs. Abrahams at the Custom House—I drove them up to my office, about 4 a.m., and the head inspector kept them till daylight, and suggested taking them to his house, which I approved of—I was present at the search of their baggage, and I made this list of what was found in each package—they were in their cabin twenty minutes or half an hour before I arrested her—she was said to be packing up and dressing—they were taken before a Magistrate the same day, and gave their names Guites, Bittan, and Pollock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Pollock was taken on 8th September, and remained in custody till I saw her despatched back to England—Guites described her as his wife, and said that she was in the family way, and apparently she was.</p>

Bank of England notes, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—several trinkets were found on her arms and neck, and in Guites' bag—I said "What are these things which I have not seen before; you said that you had nothing?"—she enumerated them—I said "Have you got any more things besides these?" she said "No"—I searched her clothing, felt it all over, and felt a piece of folded paper in the trimming of her dress—I asked her what it was—she rushed out from behind the screen, came to me and said that it was her earnings and savings and pocket-money which her father allowed her—I wanted to tear the trimming—she said "Do not tear the dress"—some scissors were brought, she cut the dress and I took out these two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes folded up small—she begged and implored me to let her have them, and said if she was thrown on the streets of London without any protection from Guites, it would be her ruin, and she offered me all the other things if I would let her have the notes—Guites, who was in the adjoining room, came in and said that the notes were her earnings and savings, and were not his money.</p>

On 15th February I was on duty in plain cloths, and about 4 o'clock p.m. I saw the prisoner at the Coach and Horses—a communication was made to me—I called Sheppered to help me, and followed the prisoner to the corner of Windmill-street, where I stopped him, and said, "I am a police constable, I want to see what you have got about you"—he said nothing—I searched and found in his right jacket pocket ten counterfeit shillings wrapped in this paper, and with paper between each coin, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. good money, and several collecting books relating to the Prudential Assurance Company, which he is connected with—I said, "I shall take you in custody"—he made no reply—about a quarter hour before, I had seen him outside the Coach and Horses public-house, Compton-street—he there beckoned to some one inside the middle bar, and after that Phillips came out—I know Phillips by seeing him every day; he is connected with coiners—they walked together for a minute or so, and then went into the middle bar together, and afterwards the prisoner came out rather hurriedly alone, and I saw him put something into his right overcoat pocket—I followed him 400 or 500 yards, and before I stopped him I saw him in Church Street take something out of his overcoat pocket and look at it and put it into his right-hand jacket pocket—that was the pocket from which I afterwards took the coins.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant C</hi>). On 22nd February, about 5 p.m., I went with Langrish and other officers to the Coach and Horses public-house, Little Compton Street, having obtained a search-warrant—the house had been under my observation continuously from 28th January—as soon as I entered I had the doors closed—there were about 30 persons Inside—all the prisoners were there—there are three bars—Keefe, Phillips, and Field were standing in the middle one—the landlord was behind the first bar—Kingston, the potman, was somewhere at the back of the house, and was brought in afterwards—after reading the warrant, a search commenced—Sergeant Gethen began to search Phillips, who was standing on my right, and who threw away a parcel, which struck me on my face as Gethen caught his arms—I was behind the bar—I saw Greet pick that parcel up—it contained base florins wrapped in paper—I am sure one coin fell out, and others might have—Gethen took a parcel out of Phillips's waistcoat pocket, and said "Here is some more coin," showing it to me—Kitching stooped down, and then rising up he said "Here is some more that he has just thrown down"—I saw Keefe brought to the front by Crackitt and Holder—Holder went to seize his hand—I heard something fall, and picked up some base coins, I believe six—Crackitt searched his pockets, and pulled out one base half-crown—Field was then brought to the front, at the corner of the middle bar, by Mott, who searched him while someone else held him—after feeling over Field, Mott said "What have you here?"—he said "Nothing; what do you</p>

               <p>think," putting his hand right through his pocket—Mott said, "That won't do for me, there is something here," and put his hand in and pulled out a parcel containing base shillings. I saw Sergeant Greet searching Kingston behind the bar—Kingston had no hat or coat, on—Greet said, "He has nothing on him"—I said, "All right, keep him there"—I jumped over the bar, and, assisted by Crackett and Drew and two uniform officers searched the bar, we took down a large board under a window, which concealed the shutters—the bench of the window is a fixture with a little slanting screen of mahogany, a wooden frame standing up, an ordinary public-house fixture; under that a board runs across, which looks as if it was the wall just battened over perfectly upright—it was directly in front of the counter, so that a person standing behind the counter looks straight at it—I could see it from there—on taking the board back we saw portable wooden shutters for the glass doors standing on their edges, and resting on them at the end nearest the street I saw an old boot, in which I found this packet of 4 half-crowns and this packet of 6 shillings, with this tissue paper between them and covering them and then wrapped in a rather stronger piece of paper and doubled as now—I heard Crackett from the other end of the shutters say "Here is a lot," and then he pulled up a lot of bad coin from the side of the shutters nearest the partition—Drew said, "Here is another packet of coins"—that was a packet of 20 shillings, I believe, which he took from the shelf—I stepped back over the counter, and in consequence of what I said to my inspector, he said to Kingston, "You will be in custody," as my search-warrant named the potman and manager of the public-house, Steingraber, a German, whose name I did not then know—Kingston said, "Let me go for my coat"—Greet said he would fetch it for him—I asked him where it was—he said,' 'I have not any coat here, my coat is at home"—I accompanied Langrish and Greet to the cellars—I saw Greet searching the pockets of a coat that was hanging just at the bottom of the stairs—he said, "Here is some bad money"—they were ten base florins, I think—he went upstairs with the coat, and said, "Whose coat is this?"—Kingston's wife, who was behind the bar, said, "That is <hi rend="italic">Jack's</hi>"—Kingston, who was behind the bar and could hear, said, "It is not my coat, it is a b—lie"—Greet said, "I believe it is yours, and there is some coin in the pockets"—after some hesitation he said to Greet, "It is my coat, let me have it; I did not know there was any coin there; you must have put them there"—he took it, and put it on—we searched the other parts of the house—no more coin was found—I told the landlord in Langrish's presence that I should take him in custody also—he replied, "Well, I wish you had not come to-day, I was about to give up possession: I am innocent about any of this coin, although I know I have a funny lot about me, I wish I had never seen the house"—I searched him—he had gold and silver, but no bad money—he was taken to Vine Street Police Station, where the others had been previously taken—they were all charged at Marlborough Mews—they made no answer to the charge except Phillips, who said, "Oh, all right, it is a got-up job for the lot of us"—we only found base coin in the bar and on the prisoners—I had been watching the house for some time—the middle bar was usually opened between 11 and 12 a.m.—I had seen all the prisoners except the landlord, who resided on the premises, enter it everyday—I occasionally saw other persons go there—I</p>

               <p>have seen a number try to get in who were not able to, the door was kept closed—I have seen Keefe, Phillips, King, and Field tap three knocks at the door, and then it was opened—I have seen Steingraber speaking to Phillips and Keefe outside the house—on the evening of the arrest Keefe said, "Give us a drink, governor, before I go,"—I said, "No drinking"—Steingraber said, "All right, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>"—I said, "No"—but the governor gave him a drink—this middle bar was a private one—scarcely anyone visited the house except those who came to visit these men—I have been there and not seen a single cus<lb/>tomer go into the two bars—I have done nothing else but watch this house since 28th January, and at various times I have seen persons there who were connected with uttering counterfeit coin—I have seen Emily Smith there with Phillips, Kingston, Keefe, and other females—I don't think I ever saw her speak to Field—I saw her with Phillips, Kingston, and Keefe the day she was arrested for uttering base coin, and on two previous days also—she is now waiting to be sentenced—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Steingraber said nothing in answer to the charge at the station—he was charged with having counter<lb/>feit coin in his possession—a warrant was granted against the landlord and potman, and a search warrant for the house—he had the advantage of a solicitor next morning—the Magistrate refused bail, but next day, the 24th, bail was granted—I know now that Steingraber took on Kinston as the potman who had been there before; I did not know it then—Steigraber is registered on the books as having gone there on 16th December last year; the license was transferred then, but he carried on business under a protection order since October or November—I do not know he was a freeman of the City, and had kept a restaurant in Fore Street for 20 years, or the Barley Mow, in Baker Street—he had managed a Little public-house of Whitbread's, in the East India Dock Road—the Coach and Horses is Whitbread's, and has been licensed half a century—the Charing Cross Road has come there, and demolished working-men's houses there—it would be the duty of the police to report any misconduct of the house at the annual licensing, if they knew it—it would depend on the view the police took of it if they summoned them because it was the resort of bad characters—a fine could be imposed, and the license endorsed if it were so—the police never take out a summons against the previous occupier—I think I knew the previous landlord there three years—I have known the house over six years, during that time he was not summoned—I took a lodging opposite, not on the 28th January—there had been many attempts to get them into custody, this Was my first attempt—I never said anything to Steingraber about not receiving the prisoners there—Green was barman there, as he was also in the time of Mr. Leader, the previous occupier, and he was supposed to be manager when Mr. Leader was away—I cannot say whether he managed on his own account—when Steingraber took the house in Sept. or Oct., he allowed the barman and potman to go on—no bad money was found on Steingraber—I searched the house most thoroughly—he was leaving the house next day—it did not take me three minutes to search the house, as all the furniture had gone except a small quantity—there were cupboards in one or two rooms—I searched every corner of the house—Steingraber said if I liked to go to his lodgings, where he had removed everything, that I might do so—I went there and asked for the</p>

About 4 p.m. on Thursday, 17th Feb., I was in plain clothes in London Wall, by Blomfield Street, and saw a crowd there, caused by a woman—the prisoners with three others were there; they all spoke together and seemed acquainted—they were hustling persons—Vaughan separated from the other four and stood near me—Clark passed me and went to overlook the crowd, his coat was open and his chain showing—Vaughan went back and spoke to Arnold, who placed himself on Vaughan's left, and put his right arm on Clark's breast, so that he could not see down, and with his left hand he got his watch—I could see that by his movements—I pushed vaughan, who was hiding his movements from his left, and caught Arnold's hand, and this watch dropped from it; I picked it up—Vaughan stepped into the road from Arnold's side—I was holding Arnold; I called another constable and gave Vaughan into his custody, and then I turned to Clark and said, "You have lost your watch," pointing to his chain, which was hanging down "I am a police officer, I have the watch in my pocket, these two men will be charged with stealing it"—I asked Clark to accompany me to the police station, he did so, and the prisoners were taken there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic artist, of Clifton Villas, Albert Road, Norbiton—on 7th August, 1886, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, "Respectable man wanted for position of trust, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash security required. Address A. J., 603, Deacon's Advertise<lb/>ment Offices"—I wrote, and received a note in reply asking me to call, and then I called at Granville House, Bleisho Road, Clapham Junction, where I saw the younger Smith—he asked my business—I said I came on account of the advertisement in the papers, and I was anxious to receive an engagement in a position of trust, and should like to know what it was—he said, "We require a gentleman as collector and traveller"—I asked what the business was—he said, "We have a large grocery establishment in Nottingham, and retail branches all round the Midland Counties, and it would be your duty to go round and collect, and to act in the absence of the firm as their representative"—he said, "My father will write to you"—I went away, and soon after a letter came from Percy and Co., Albert Street, Nottingham, to me. (<hi rend="italic">This, dated August</hi> 13th, 1886, <hi rend="italic">said that in regard to the interview he had had with their foreman, he gathered that the position they required him for had been stated—that his duties would chiefly be outdoor collecting, and that if he were an artist he would be very useful—it asked him to to call on Monday, and stated that if he did not hear from him he would prepare the agreement; and that he should like him to go to Nottingham with him, and that he could reside in London or Nottingham as he preferred.</hi>) That is in the elder prisoner's handwriting—I called on the</p>

               <p>Monday, 16th, when I saw the younger prisoner at first) and he explained about the situation, told me the salary would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week, and showed me the agreement made out but not filled in; then he sent for his sister, and he asked her if his father was in, and the father was called in—I was under the impression that the advertisement named 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit; I was asked about it by the younger prisoner, and I said I could only deposit 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I only had 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the younger prisoner said 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would do—the senior prisoner and I then signed the agreement, and the younger prisoner signed afterwards as witness—the elder prisoner said, "My son has explained the agreement to you—I read one copy and he the other—both were supposed to be identical. (<hi rend="italic">By this agreement, dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1886, <hi rend="italic">Smith engaged the entire services of Mittau at a salary of</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a-week, payable weekly, and in consideration of Mittau lodging with Smith</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Smith undertook to pay to Mittau the above salary, and 5 per cent. per annum quarterly. The agreement was to be binding for</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">months, and at the end of that time Smith undertook to pay back</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">with all interest thereon to Mittau, and the agreement might then be renewed on the same terms if agreed on. There was also a clause stating that Mittau had prior claim on Smith's business to the extent of</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) When the document was signed, Smith asked me if I had the money with me; I told him no, I had not drawn anything from the bank—we arranged that I should meet the younger Smith at the Bank of England next morning—I did so, and handed him two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and he then handed me this agreement and this receipt. (<hi rend="italic">August</hi> 18, 1886. <hi rend="italic">Received of Mr. S. Mittau</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on interest, as per agreement. Sidney H. Smith.</hi>) Several appointments were made for me to go to Nottingham with Smith senior—I did not go there, because on each occasion something was supposed to have taken place which prevented Smith from going, the son told me—I parted with my 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. solely from my desire to obtain a responsible position of trust; my sight became weak and I had to give up the artistic business, and I thought a collector's and manager's place would be just the kind of situation I should like—when young Smith told me they had a large grocery establishment at Nottingham, and various branches, that had all the effect on my mind, because I said to him, "Suppose one of your establishments fails?"—he said, "It would not affect us at all;" and he showed me on a piece of paper, "Here is the wholesale depart<lb/>ment, and here in the Midlands are the branches situated; if one branch fails all we do is to shut it up and open one in another direction"—I believed they had a wholesale grocery shop in Nottingham, that was the reason that induced me to part with my money, and when they said they had warehouses all round, I felt anxious to get a collectorship, and so paid them my money—eventually Smith took a warehouse in Wood Street, where I went as manager a few weeks after signing the agree<lb/>ment, I think—when we went there it was empty, scarcely any business was done there except a few artificial flowers; no grocery came in—I stopped there as long as I could, till 26th December—I received my 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week for the first few weeks—I could not claim the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so long as I received my salary—I have never received back my 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left those premises because the landlord put some one in charge, the Sheriff's officers came and took possession on 26th December.</p>

               <p>had a notion it was in this way I should not have parted with it—my sole reason was their representation of a large wholesale business in Notting<lb/>ham—young Smith said if one shop does not pay its expenses we close it, and open another in another direction—I have been in England about 20 years—I understand the English language pretty fairly—the agreement was read to me before I parted with my money—the consideration of my being taken as a traveller and collector at Nottingham was one of my reasons for parting with my money—I understood that from the son—my impression was that I was to go to Nottingham to manage there—I did not insist on anything about Nottingham being inserted in the agreement, because I took it for granted; I was so anxious to obtain the situation; if I had made inquiries I should not have paid my money—I always had it in my mind that it was on account of the Nottingham business I parted with my money—it was to obtain a position anywhere, so long as I got a position of trust—I am certain the younger prisoner said they had a large wholesale business at Nottingham, with several branches; he did not say "and intend opening branches in the midland counties"—one business would not have induced me to part with my money—I said before the Magistrate in cross-examination that I was told by the younger Smith I was to be collector and manager of a business at Nottingham—I have not been to Nottingham—I took no steps to find out if there was a busi<lb/>ness there—I cannot say the extent of the business there—I had the idea he had a large extent of business there, and that proves to be not the case—I have no personal knowledge of his business at Nottingham—I am not surprised if you say he had five businesses there—he had no extent of business to need a collector and manager—I did not go there because the prisoner did not take me—I went to the station once and waited several hours, but he never came—I met him once at Waterloo, Station, and he took me to Wood Street then; I did not meet him in order to go to St. Pancras and on to Nottingham—I said I would rather remain in London if I could, and he found me business in London—that was after the agreement; but my understanding was that I was to go to Nottingham—when I met the prisoner at Waterloo I did not know where I was going; I had my bag packed with me; the prisoner then mentioned the Wood Street business, and I then said I preferred to be in London—I waited at the station to go to Nottingham; I could not go alone there; I knew nothing about any one there—I went to Wood Street a week or so after signing the agreement—each time I was to go to Nottingham, and called at his house, they said no, he cannot go—I took no notice of the dates—there was very little indeed on the premises, nothing for some weeks—the elder prisoner's daughters came there once or twice—I think one or other of them was in the City Road branch—nothing being done on the premises, at first excited my suspicions—I received my salary for the first few weeks, and then afterwards I received cheques which came back from the bank—I was not paid my quarter's interest which became due, but I paid myself for that from the takings in the warehouse—I entered them in the book and took charge of the amount—I took Smith's goods away from the place and sold them a few days ago for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay myself something for salary—when I found I could get nothing, and no one came near the place, I placed the matter in the hands of Mr. Fenn, a solicitor; I had nothing to pay him with—I had written to the elder prisoner several times, but could obtain nothing—the solicitor told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188702280051"/>
               <p>afterwards he had received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Smith—I authorised the solicitor to act to get back the money—the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is repayable is 12 months' time; that will be next August, but the salary has been due all along, and the warehouse is left by itself, and there is no business there—the younger prisoner came to me in December, and asked me what salary was due to me—I showed him the entries in the books that I had paid myself, and I said no salary was due except 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I placed it in my solicitor's hands to take these criminal proceedings to get back my investment—I could never see the prisoners whenever I called, and I swore an information that they were likely to abscond when I applied for a warrant against them; I could not say what they would do—I was afterwards shown a piece out of a newspaper about a bankruptcy at Nottingham—I told Miss Smith if I took proceedings it would be a criminal and not a civil affair, because of the obtaining money under these pretences and there being no business done—I said if I received half the amount in money I would sign a receipt for the whole, and square these proceedings—all I wanted was to get back my investment.</p>

I am housekeeper at 6, Arthur Street East, City—I am landlord of a warehouse, 44, King William Street, City—I showed the defendant over it about the end of February and accepted his terms—he said he was a wholesale grocer—it was very nicely furnished—there were some very large pier glasses, and some oak and walnut fittings, shelves, gas fittings, and eight or nine very large loose counters, and some linoleum and other fittings, which were all mine—he entered on 4th or 5th March, and I saw sugar, tea, biscuits, and general grocery come in for a week afterwards—a boy carried them in, and I saw a van once—I saw no customers, but quite 20 people called for their money—on 12th March a distress for rent was put in, and the sale realised 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was some office furniture, a few odd bottles of sauce, 20lb. of sugar, and 300 of these packets (<hi rend="italic">Guaranteed Finest Tea Imported</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. lb.)—they are filled with sawdust.</p>

I should say that the large masses of raisins, currants, and tea in grocers' windows are solid—I examined all these 300 packets myself, and they are all dummies—the eight pier glasses have been up eight years; they were permanent fixtures attached to the premises—the fixtures cost nearly 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fit—if Mr. Dubisant swore "There were no goods at all there," that is not true—as many as 20 creditors called in one day—the warehouse is on the ground floor, and my office is on the second floor—the persons who called rang the house bell and came up to me and asked when they could see Smith, as they had been every day and the place was padlocked up until 11 in the morning, and then Smith was only in and out again—the persons who called said that they were creditors, and asked me about their different accounts—I have not said that before that I am aware of—have not talked this</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French correspondent—on 5th March, 1886, I inserted this advertisement in <hi rend="italic">the Daily Telegraph</hi>, "A French, gentleman, knowing English and English business, desires to invest 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and give services. Address L. B., box 995, <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> office, E.C."—I received this reply, which is in the prisoner's writing) <hi rend="italic">Offering him employment, signed E.

Smith, stating that he had secured wholesale premises in King William Street, and had several branch shops, and asking the witness to pay money into his bankers, for which he would pay interest</hi>)—I saw the defendant after that, I believe on 7th March, at the office of my late partner in Watling Street—he said "Is this your business?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "In case of the failure of your partner what security would you get?—I am in a position to give you better security than this"—I said, "What is your business?" and he said "The grocery and provision trade, the fact is this, I have three shops, and if I had the money I should take ten; unfortunately I have not got enough money; if we come to terms the security I will give you will consist of a charge on my stock in my shops, and the fixtures in the various shops, which will cover amply the amount invested by you"—I said "That will satisfy me," and we agreed on the terms, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary, and 5 per cent, interest on the amount I invested—he said that one shop was in Edgware Road, one in Camberwell, and one in Kensington—I afterwards received this letter: "Sir, I told you when I last saw you that I was in treaty with several other gentle<lb/>men, and I have one who is very anxious to join me and place at my bankers 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once I, should therefore like to see you to-day at four o'clock to have a chat with you, H.S. Smith, <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> Smith and Son, 44, King William Street," &amp;c.—I went to King William Street and saw the defendant and one of his other sons—we went over the warehouse—I noticed that there was no stock, and mentioned it—he said, "I have got my stock in my Kensington branch, it is worth over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I expressed a desire to see that shop, but he said, "I am in a difficulty with the landlord, and the shop is closed for a little time; you cannot see it now"—I saw some fixtures, counters, and looking glasses, and said, "Do these belong to you?"—he said, "Yes, they do; I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only for the carpets"—I asked what security he intended to give me—he said the stock which was at Kensington, and the, fixtures at 44, King William Street, and the different shops; I should have a charge upon each of them—we came to terms, and on 22nd March I saw the defendant—he produced this agreement, which is in his handwriting—I said that I should have liked to do the transaction through a solicitor—he said, "We don't want solicitors, I know as much about the law as they do, it only leads to expenses"—the last clause says, "The said A. Dubisant shall have a prior claim on it to the extent of the before-mentioned sum of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—I said, "Does this give me a charge on the stock which you have in your shops, and also on the fixtures?"—he said "Yes, it does"—I said, "Then shall I have a charge on the fixtures which are here?"—he said, "Certainly, it is understood?"—(<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here read</hi>,</p>

Crosse and Black well—that was all I did that day—no goods came in for a long time and no customers—some persons came for money and asked for Mr. Smith, but he was always out; he used to come and stay a few minutes, and then go away—I grew suspicious, made inquiries, and found that the fixtures did not belong to him—the Kensington branch shop was never opened to my knowledge: I did not go there—I know nothing about the business in Edgware Road or the Camberwell branch—no goods were supplied from the warehouse to any of the three branches—I inquired about the Camberwell shop, and he said "I have altered my plans; I intend to take a shop there" in July I saw the defendant's son tearing a letter in pieces as I entered the office, and he blushed—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This had been pasted together, and was from the defendant to his son Charles. It stated</hi> "You had better give Dubisant a Holiday, or get him to stop at the Peckham shop. Tell him you are afraid about the manager, &amp;c. Glover must be paid right off. If the man with 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. can come at once we can settle Glover at once, &amp;c As soon as I hear from you I shall go to Leicester.") After seeing that letter I wrote to the defendant asking him to cancel the agreement, and received this reply: "July 21-86—Sir,—I am surprised at your letter, and if you are not careful you will make a rod for your own back. I will send you a full letter to-morrow. If I am injured by your indiscretion, talking about my business, how can you expect me to give you so large an income as I am giving you? However, I can easily satisfy your claim if we come to terms.—<hi rend="smallCaps">S. H. SMITH</hi>." Next day I received this letter: "Dear Sir—You are a strange man. I will reply fully to yours to-morrow, also enclose cheque for your salary, which you will deceive on Saturday morning. Don't fear losing anything by me, much less fear losing it yourself. You are too excited. "I received my salary up to November 27th, but I had stayed away from the business for two months, in consequence of this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated Clapham, October</hi> 11, 1886, <hi rend="italic">and stating</hi>; "It is no use your going to No. 44. Keep away till see you, when I want you to go to Nottingham, &amp;c. Don't go near 44. When you want a cheque write to me here.") I called several times at his house at Bleisho Road, Clapham Junction, but have never been able to see him since August.</p>

               <p>stock at Kensington worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I thought he was an honest man, but he has been sent to five years' penal servitude—I am not very vin<lb/>dictive against him, but I want to spare other people from what I have suffered; he has ruined me, and I have been starving for two months—I am not the only one who has been defrauded in this way—I called several times for my salary at Granville House, and could not obtain it; I saw Miss Smith several times—I have never said that I would kill the defendant if I did not get my money—the glasses were very large, and to put such fixtures in, a man must be in a good way of business; the rent was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I invested my money because I believed the fixtures were his, and that I could sell them if I did not get my money—I posi<lb/>tively swear that he said that they were his—I relied also on the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stock at Kensington—I did not go to see it, because I believed him to be an honest man; I saw the shop, but I did not see what was inside—the fixtures at King William Street did not appear new; I understood he had bought them from the landlord—I should be very much surprised to hear that he paid 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the things at Kensington—I did not go to see them; I am not a grocer, and if I had seen sawdust packets there I might have thought that there was a deal of value there—I paid the money eight days after the interview at my partner's, during which time I made no inquiries as to the other shops—I did not stop the bills when I found there was no stock; how could I do so without taking law proceedings?—my late partner did not join with me in the bill, he gave me the bill; I knew the defendant would have to go to him to get the money, but I took no means to stop the bill; I did not know that I could do so; I thought I should have to take law proceedings—the order I gave to Crosse and Blackwell came in—a small quantity of tea came in—it just passed through the place; I don't know where it went to—the defendant came there at different times drunk, and it was disgusting—most times when he came he was drunk—when a man cannot stand upright any one can see that he is drunk—he has treated me to a glass, and I have accepted it, but not 10 or 20—I discovered about the end of April that the fixtures belonged to the landlord, and told the defendant that he had deceived me—I know Mr. Hislop; I do not know whether he is a clergyman—I received a promissory note—I went to the defendant and told him he had deceived me, and I wanted my money back; he said "Don't get excited, it is useless; I could answer that you have made an agreement, and it is too late, but I will give you the signature of a clergyman of the Church of England"; I said" I should much prefer to have my money back"; he said "Tour money is invested, and I cannot withdraw it"—the bill is not due yet.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed by the prisoner, and was stated to be for fees and retainers, for proof of identity.</hi>) It was arranged that the prisoner should go to England to make inquiries, and to communicate with us, and my father was to follow at the proper time—we afterwards received this letter from the prisoner, dated December 17th, 1885. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had found the case at represented, and would do everything to bring about a prompt and satisfactory adjustment of the claim.</hi>) Some time in January, I believe, my father advanced 1, 000 dollars—there is no receipt for that—we afterwards received this letter.

               <p>said he thought it would be better for us to go to a private houset, hat there were a good many sharp people round a place like where we were, and he found a lodging for us at 28, Langham Street, to which we went on the Saturday, the same day as the interview—the prisoner came there that evening about 8; my father had gone to bed—the first thing the prisoner said was "This has been the most eventful day of my life; there are parties here who want to buy this claim of yours; they will give 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and he wanted me to wake my father and get him up—ultimately he went into my father's bedroom and saw him, and repeated what he had told me—my father said he wanted to see the property before he sold it, and it was arranged that we should go on Monday and see it—on the Monday the prisoner and my father drove to the Surrey side of London, and the prisoner showed us some property; he pointed out three shops, and said those were part of the property, and then a dwelling-house: just before we got there I saw the name of Solomon over a door—I asked the prisoner if that was the trustee's place of business; he said "Yes"; it was only houses he showed us—I have since tried to find the place, but have not found it—that was my first visit to London—he did not tell us where the three acres were—we then went back and had lunch in Regent Street—I then asked him about the three acres, how far it was; I think he said three or four miles, quite a long distance, and my father declined to go; he said he was too tired, but he would be willing to accept 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the prisoner said it was worth 60, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if he was willing to take his percentage on the 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he was; we then instructed him to make arrangements for closing up the business—we saw him again the same evening; he brought a con<lb/>tract or agreement for us to sign—he said one of the parties was at Bombay—the money was to be payable at New York city—this is the contract which the prisoner produced drawn up; my father signed it in my presence.

               <p>we started he lent me 25 dollars, which I have repaid him—on board the ship before we sailed he asked me when I got to Susquehanna if I would make this money up to 1, 200 dollars—I said I would see—he said his funds were tied up here, and he was short of money—he said the ship we were going by was not good enough for him; there was a better vessel going on Tuesday—we sailed on 21st August, leaving him behind—I received this letter from him on 24th August, when I reached home. (<hi rend="italic">This excused himself for not following, on account of hit wife's ill-health, adding "cable at my expense, I depend upon you fully, William, to act as herein directed.</hi>") Before receiving that letter I had a telegram from him, in consequence of which I telegraphed a credit of 700 dollars to the City Bank, and I received another telegram which induced me to send 70 dollars more—when I telegraphed the first credit I wrote this letter to the prisoner, announcing that I had done so. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th September, and stated</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">My brothers and all concerned are delighted with the outcome of our case.

(<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Mr. W.D. Carrington, requesting</hi> 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for taxes due.</hi>) On the 21st I cabled to the prisoner 3, 000 dollars to the City Bank—on 4th November I sailed for London with my brother-in-law, Mr. Stanford; we arrived on the 14th, and saw the prisoner; I brought with me this power of attorney from my father—the prisoner looked at it, and said it was no good—he proposed that I should get another; I did so; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced, with several seals attached</hi>)—Mr. Stanford and the prisoner had a discussion as to whether this was valid; ultimately the prisoner agreed that it was—while waiting for the arrival of the second power of attorney I said I should like to see the three acre lot; at first he offered to do it, but failed; he said my business was to look after the 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not the three acres—the morning that I got the new power I went to the Metropole and saw the prisoner; he said "A remarkable thing, one of the contractors died last night"—either at that or some other time he said he had not taken any legal proceedings, that the parties who bought the claim would have to take them—on 6th or 7th January this year he showed me a letter purporting to come from Mr. Wright, of Liverpool, the effect of which was that Mr. Wright had in his possession 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid to me, I think, on 15th February—at one time the prisoner showed me a sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I forget whether that was before or after Mr. Wright's letter was shown to me; he showed me the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes, and said it was to pay the solicitor in our case—I believed his statement about his taking legal proceedings in this claim, that there was a three acre lot, that there was money in the bank, and the whole story about the deposit, and that there was a legal claim to 21, Cock Lane.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The 200 dollars and the 300 dollars in August was my own money—I afterwards sent over all the money I had of my own, and some from my brother and Mr. Stanford—since the prisoner has been in custody I have seen his wife—I have of course been anxious to get back all the money I could—when I put myself in the hands of the police and the author<lb/>ities I acted under their directions—these two telegrams I should say were the prisoner's writing (these urged the necessity of protecting the title)—I sent the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the taxes and complete the title.</p>

               <p>then—upon that we arranged to send for the new power—it arrived about 13th December—I showed it to him—he examined it, and he said that there was a fault in it—he afterwards found it was good—he said one of the parties to the proceedings had died, he had an only son, and that would take him into the country to bury him and there would necessarily be a delay for a few days—as soon as he returned the matter would be settled and the money paid—he afterwards told me that he had taken no proceedings—that was the week before he was arrested—he said that he should not bring any proceedings in Court, that he didn't do business that way, he was selling the claim to other parties—he didn't say to whom he had sold it—I told him I did not think they could claim it in Court under the circumstances—he said that didn't make any difference to him as long as he got the money, they must look out for themselves—that same evening he showed me a letter purporting to come from Mr. Wright, of Liverpool, agreeing to purchase the claim, and that 25, 000 was in his hands which would be paid on 15th February—on one occa<lb/>sion I saw him at the hotel when he showed us 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes which he said he had to pay the solicitors in this case—I asked him if he had paid the taxes on the Cock Lane property—he said he had, as well as the other property—he has not given me any money since I have been in England—Mr. Deakin gave me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I suppose was to help pay my expenses here—after he was in custody I was anxious to get my money back and go to America.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Liverpool—in 1883 I made the prisoner's acquaintance on board the <hi rend="italic">Alaska</hi> coming from America—in August, 1886, I was introduced to Mr. Deakin at Liverpool—early in January this year I received a telegram from the prisoner from London, and on 4th January I went to the Hotel Metropole and saw him—he said that Mr. Deakin had some property to sell in London which he wanted 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for, that he was the solicitor in the matter, and as the property was worth more it would be a good investment; he said, "I wish to buy it for myself, but I do not wish my name appearing as the purchaser; allow me to use your name, and I will find the money which you will pay to Mr. Deakin"—he then gave me this cheque for 20, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., post-dated, which I had to pay to Mr. Deakin as the first instalment—I never paid it—he said it aid not matter to Mr. Deakin whose 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had if he got the value of the property, it did not matter whether he or I paid it—he gave me a draft of the letter, which I copied in his room and signed—the original was retained—the effect of it was to say that I would make the first instalment on 15th February, 25, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. On 1st April, and 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st September, as the value of this property which I was supposed to be buying—of course I thought it genuine—before I left London the next day he gave me a memorandum, which I was requested to telegraph from Liverpool—this is a copy of the memo<lb/>randum—I made it in the Hotel Metropole in his presence, and took it to Liverpool with me, and telegraphed it the following morning. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I find no effort on my part can bring about an arrangement; if you desire it I will see you next Wednesday; I see no necessity of remaining till Thursday; I shall make the first payment on February 15th, 1887; write to me at Adelphi at once.") The next thing I saw was in the paper that the prisoner was in custody—he paid my expenses to come up from Liverpool—he said the property was some property in Cock Lane and some in Leicester.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Great Aubyn Street, and am a messenger in the Great Northern Railway Company—On 26th February, about quarter past 5, I met a Mend named Gilham and went with him to the Nag's Head public-house in Leather Lane—I there saw five men, the prisoners are two of them—after two or three minutes one of the men nodded to me as if he knew me—I told him I didn't know him, and he then turned to Carey and said, "He makes out he does not know me"—Carey then stepped up to me and said, "Stand me a drink"—I said, "No, I can't stand you a drink"—he said, "Well, pay for a pot"—I said, "I can't pay for a pot for you"—he called for a pot of four ale, and the potman put it on the counter, and Carey told me to pay for it—I said, "I shall not pay for it"—he said, "it is called for now, pay for it for us"—I said, "I can't pay for it, I told you I could not and I won't"—he then caught hold of my watch chain and said, "You think you are b—tricky with that, but you don't go out of this public-house with that watch on"—O'Leary could hear that—I then buttoned up my coat, and as my friend was going out they shoved him back on me, and he jumped up on a form and they pulled him off—the men were all standing across the doorway—all this took place in front of the bar within hearing of the potman—the landlord said, "Let them go out," but they would not, and he let us out—I passed through, thinking my friend was going to follow, but it appears they pulled him back—I got outside, and then saw my friend lying on the pavement, between the public-house and next door, and all the men on him—he sprang up and got into the road, and held his arms up above his face, as they were punching him about the face and neck—I went into the road to pull him away, and Carey then left him and turned upon me and struck me in the shoulder, and then caught me from the back and made a tear at my coat, which</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 439, Liverpool Road, Islington, and am a shopman working at a cornchandler's in Leather Lane—I was with the last witness on this evening—about half past 5 we went into the Nag's Head, and there saw the prisoners and two other men, one of the other men wanted to shake hands with my friend, and pretended to know him; he said "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, how are you?"; that is the name I had called him by in the hearing of these men; <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> said he did not know him, and I know he did not—after that Carey came up and asked both of us to stand a drink, and we would not; he said "Well, pay for a pot"; we would not, and he called the barman, and he drew a pot and put it on the counter; he then said "Well, it is drawn now, you might as well pay for it," but we would not—I then said in the hearing of the five men "Well, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, we might as well drink up and go out"; I drank up and attempted to go out, but they all stood across the door and pushed me back against my friend; I said "If I can't get out one way I will another," and I got on the form to get into the other compartment, but they laid hold of my legs and pulled me down—I then asked the landlord if we could go out, and he said "Yes"—I told him to keep the two prisoners and the other three men, but they still stood across the door and would not let us—the landlord then opened the side door leading into the next compartment, and my friend went through, but they laid hold of my coat and would not let me go; O'Leary did nothing, it was the other four; one then booted me and another <hi rend="italic">clouted</hi> me in the face, I could not say who it was—when I got outside the clothier's he still <hi rend="italic">banged</hi> me about the face, and some one caught me round the waist to put their hand into my trousers pocket from behind; I put my hand in, and as I did so the lot of them knocked me down; Carey was one of them; my trousers were torn—I managed to get up, and when I got in the middle of the road Carey was still standing by me, <hi rend="italic">clouting</hi> me on the face—I told my friend to go into my shop, as he would be safe there, and after that I managed to go in myself.</p>

Shortly after my second marriage I went to Sunderland and got a copy of the certificate of death from the Registrar's office, when I found, that my first wife died on 30th September, 1880, one day after I married my second wife; I arrived in London a few days afterwards, and gave the certificate to my second wife, and told her the marriage was not legal, and if she liked we would have it performed over again, but she refused to do so, saying, that if one marriage was not sufficient she would not enter into another one"—I read that to him after I had taken it down and he signed it.</p>

I am a retired licensed victualler, and live at Common Wood, Watford—the prisoner Moss is my son—he was sum<lb/>moned to Uxbridge for furious driving, and asked me to lend him my pony and cart to go there—I did so, and sent Holloway with him, and said, "Send the pony and cart home by the man if you are convicted"—Uxbridge is 11 or 12 miles from Common Wood—they started at 9 a.m. on 31st January—neither of them returned that day—Holloway returned about 9 o'clock the next night, having walked home—I did not see him till the Wednesday morning—he told me something, and on the Thursday the Sarrat police came to my place—I went to Uxbridge on the Friday, and found my pony at Mr. Bywater's, the King's Arms, in the stable in the ordinary way—I value him at from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the cart at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the harness at 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not seen the cart since, but I believe it is at Cheswick police station—I identified the harness at Watford police court—I do not think this receipt is in my son's writing, unless he was beastly intoxicated.</p>

I am landlord of the King's Arms, Uxbridge—on 31st January, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner and a young man came with a horse and trap, which I always understood were the property of Moss junior—I know the father; he and his son and daughter slept at my house on December 26th, and they had this cart with them—when Moss came on 31st January he produced a summons, and said, "This is a nice thing they have done for me" and that they had fined him a sovereign at the Town Hall for furious driving, and as that had got him into trouble he would sell the lot, and asked me to buy the pony, trap, and harness—I said that I did not want them—he said, "Well, the fact is, I want a stronger horse to work on the farm, that can pull a load in a cart"—I said, "Well, if you mean that, I have got a horse which is too large for me in my business; I will make an exchange with you"—he looked at my horse, and asked me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my horse for his pony—I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he should like to show it to Mr. Freeman, a livery stable keeper—he took it there and tried it, and brought it back and said that Freeman offered him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I said that he ought to have taken it—he said no, he knew that the pony would have a good home with me and that he would let me have him in exchange for my horse and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent my man with him, and he tried my horse in my cart—he and his friend slept at my house that night—this is the receipt, it is my writing and Moss's signature—"I hereby certify that the black cob is my property, having bought him at Croydon fair for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Received in exchange for the bay cob, his bay horse and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., F.J. Moss"—he signed this in my presence—I had said, "Does this pony belong to you?"—he said, "Yes; why do you ask me such a question?"—he took his cart and the harness of the pony away next morning, and my horse—on the following Friday night he came again for something to drink, and asked if he could have a bed—I said, "No, we are full," and while he was there I went to the station and Sergeant Vincent came.</p>

I am stationed at Uxbridge—on 4th February Mr. Moss gave me information, and at 7 o'clock that evening Mr. Bywater told me that the prisoner Moss was in the town—I went in search of him, met him, and said, "What is your name?"—he said, "John Day"—I said, "I have reason to believe your name is Moss"—he said, "It is no such thing"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "At Watford"—I said, "You will have to come with me to Mr. Bywater, at the King's Arms, where I can ascertain"—he said, "You need not do that, my name is Moss"—I said, "You will have to go to the police-station with me, and I shall detain you on a charge of stealing your father's pony, cart, and harness"—he said, "All right, I have sold the cob to Mr. Bywater; you had better take the other man, as he has some of the harness now on him"—the "other man" was Thompson, who appeared as a witness for the defence—I took Moss and Thompson to the station—I found a kicking-strap on Thompson—he was discharged—I communicated with Superintendent Hummerton, at Watford—on the same evening I went with Draper to Mr. Bywater's, and next day, Saturday, I traced the cart to Bryant's possession at Acton Green, about 11 miles from Uxbridge, and found Bryant at the Stag public-house—I said, "I believe you purchased a cart from a young man named Moss some time this week?"—he said, "I have, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paying 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit," and produced this receipt: "I, Walter Brynent, <hi rend="italic">his court</hi> of F.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to W. and T. Restall and Co., wine and spirit importers, 29, Mark Lane—I know the prisoner—we first did business with him about the end of 1884; from that date we have from time to time sold wines for him at our public sales—in March or April, 1886, I remember his speaking of a parcel of claret which he was in treaty for; I did not know the name of the party at the time—he showed me a sample of it; the quantity was said to be from 60, 000 to 65, 000 bottles; he asked me what I thought it would realise if placed on the London market—I told him I thought from 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, in bond—he mentioned the price they were asking for it as some<lb/>thing like 4 francs per bottle—we afterwards agreed to open a credit for him for a certain sum, to be paid at Bordeaux against the bills of lading—about 3rd May we received the bills of lading for this wine, for about 55, 000 bottles of Mouton Rothschild of 1873—at the prisoner's request we opened a credit at Bordeaux for him for 5,684<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the money was paid at Bordeaux to the holders of the wine, to get the, bills of lading—the prisoner signed this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1886, <hi rend="italic">and authorised the sale of the wine without reserve.</hi>) We afterwards received the wine and sold it by public auction—we offered the whole of it, but only sold 51, 120 bottles, which realised 6, 004<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we sold the rest on 19th August for 395<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we charged 5 per cent, for selling—there was a discount to the buyers of 2 1/2 per cent.; after deducting all charges it realised 6, 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not gone into the average price per dozen, but I estimate it at from 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bond; deducting discount and commission it would be more than 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., something less than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 8th May, 1886, we received a deposit on the prisoner's account of 195 cases of claret; I think this is the invoice of Messrs.

Benoit is the same; the quantities are the same, but the qualities may be different; they are marked "Vintage of 1878"; they appear to be the same; the invoice appears to be made out "nett"; there may be some very heavy discounts or allowances; there is nothing on the invoice to show that the price is 219<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; they may have been bought at cash prices for aught I know—we advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on these goods—we sold them on 22nd June—they realised 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., showing on the invoice a loss of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we sold those in the same way, by his authority, without reserve—on 13th July he deposited with us 400 cases of champagne; they appear to be the same goods as are referred to in this invoice of A.J. Delacroix at 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we advanced the prisoner 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on those goods, and sold them on 19th August by his authority without reserve; they realised 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., showing a loss on the invoice price of 152<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all these advances were made on the understanding that the wine was to be sold without reserve—except as to the Mouton Rothschild—the prisoner did not inform us of the cost of the wines to him; we never saw the invoices—we fixed the amount to be advanced by tasting the wine—the 13th July was the last transac<lb/>tion we had with him—he offered more goods after that, but we declined to receive them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Messrs. Restall and Co. have been in business about 25 years as auctioneers and wine and spirit brokers—they deal very largely in this way with wines entrusted to them without reserve—we have two or three sales a month; they are advertised in the trade circulars and in the daily papers, with a description of the chief parcels; the Mouton Rothschild's were specially described and largely advertised—we had the particulars from the prisoner—we began to deal with him in 1884—we had a great number of transactions with him; we did not know him previous to 1884—we have sold him goods by private treaty as a wine and spirit merchant—we sell largely by private sale as well as by public auction—he gave us references when we started business with him; I believe one was the London Joint Stock Bank; they spoke well of him—I have heard that he has sold wines for Travers and Sons—the wines in question came generally from Bordeaux—we never? asked to look at the invoices, it is not usual for us to do so—I think on one or two of the earlier transactions in 1884 we did not make advances—in 1886 we advanced in every case—we generally taste the wine and form an opinion as to what it will realise, and advance about two-thirds, not as a hard-and-fast rule, but what we think safe—I think in most instances the prisoner brought us samples; in some cases we saw the bills of lading, and in others warrants; we believed him to be a respectable man, we had no reason to doubt his <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi>—I thought he wanted to make a profit on the transactions, by buying in Bordeaux and selling in London—the Beque and Pellet transaction was a large one—we opened a credit at Bordeaux through our bankers; that was to obtain possession of the wine; the Bordeaux people wanted so much money in exchange for the bills of lading; that was the arrangement; we paid 5,640<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against the bills of lading in Bordeaux; that money did not go to the prisoner; I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188702280080"/>
               <p>believe it would go to Beque and Pellet; I believe we had their receipt for the money, before they would part with the shipping documents; that was the agreement, I believe—the selling of wine without reserve and without special regard to the invoice is the usual way of doing business; a very large business is done in that way, I believe—I should think that wine sold in that way would be well known in Bordeaux—I have known foreigners put very high prices on their produce, more than I should think they were worth—we found afterwards that the prisoner had persons present at the sales to keep up the bidding; in some instances they bought some of the wine, and the invoice was afterwards transferred to his account—he did the best he could to get the best possible prices, and so did we—I think we generally get a steady average price; of course the market fluctuates—from memory, I think the market in 1886 was fairly good; the sales were largely attended; if it sold at a low price I think it was very badly bought; if a man buys well, he may make money by telling through us; it is not selling at a sacrifice; I should think it was one of the best markets; the quantity we are selling by public auction is on the increase; it is becoming a favourite mode of dis<lb/>posing of wines here—I heard that before 1884 the prisoner was acting as traveller to Beque and Pellet for some time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I consider that as good a way of selling as could be—the sale is improved by selling without reserve, it makes the sale appear more <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>—this champagne is not a well-known brand in England—the price I obtained was a very fair price—I never see the invoice price—if I found the invoice price 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. beyond the price I mentioned I should suspect it was very much beyond what could be reasonably obtained—I do not think I tasted the wine, I was very unwell at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Kingscote and Co., Water Lane, London agents to Moet and Chandon—about the end of June, 1886, the prisoner called at our office, and inquired our prices, and tasted some wine—he said he wanted to buy some of our wine, that he had an order to export, and he subsequently stated that he wished to send it to Galverston, Texas—possibly our wine had been there before—there was no great demand for it there—on 1st July he called again, and gave an order for 100 dozen of the Broel Imperiale—I told him he could have it at once from the London stock landed some 12 months—he said that would not do, as it was being exported, he would consequently lose the duty—I said that he should pay cash; he demurred to paying cash at once, and wanted some slight credit; in the result we agreed to let him have a nominal credit of 28 days from the date of invoice on his accept<lb/>ance—the invoice was dated 5th July—the wine had to come from Epernay, and we did not give him the order till the 23rd, so there would only be about 10 days left of the credit—the nett invoice price was 296<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., after taking off discount—on delivering it he gave us his acceptance for that amount, due on 2nd August—the bill was presented and dishonoured—he requested us to present it again on the following Saturday; I did so, and it was again dishonoured—I then put the matter in the hands of our solicitors to commence legal proceedings against him—the solicitors' clerk went to his office to serve him with a writ, but he was not there—on 20th August I found him at Fenchurch Street Station, and there served him with the writ—I afterwards found that our wine was included in Messrs. Southard's catalogue of 26th August, and I went there and identified it—if he had had the wine from the London stock he would have had a delivery order and would have been able to get a warrant from the docks—it is not so easy to get an advance on a delivery order as on a warrant—if I had known that the champagne was to be sold by public auction I should not have let him have it—I was induced</p>

               <p>to let him have it by the fact that he was going to export it, part of it to a market where we were anxious to see it well sold—I am now a creditor proving for the amount of the invoice—there is no difficulty in selling our wine in London at a profit on the invoice price, without the assistance of Messrs. Southard, in the ordinary way of business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is great competition in champagne, even among first-class brands like ours—I did not ask him who his customers were or any details—he gave references, one was a bank, the other was a foreign one—we applied to the bank, and got a satisfactory answer—I do not know much about Texas—this was my only transaction with the prisoner.</p>

Billery, of Bohn—on 7th July I wrote a note to the prisoner, and on 12th July a clerk of Messrs. Mercier's called at my office—I then told the prisoner I heard that he had been disposing of wine by public auction—he said that it was untrue, he had only done so when he had orders to do so from his correspondents abroad—I asked if he intended to dispose of our wine by public auction, as if so I should decline to execute the order—he said that he did not intend to do so, and he had made a special contract for the disposal of the wine, and that he would pay at 45 days instead of 90 if we gave him extra discount—that was agreed to, and the wine was delivered to his order on 24th July, 1886, and I sent a draft for his acceptance—he afterwards called on me and said that the bill was drawn at 45 days instead of 90, and he expected the extra discount taken off, and I complied, and enclosed another bill on 30th August, which he never returned to me, and I never saw him again till I saw him at the police-court—I afterwards found that the 1,000 cases of wine had been sent to Messrs. Southard's; I went there and identified it—I allowed it to be delivered to the prisoner, on his assurance that it was not going to be sold by public auction and the contract not to do so.</p>

I live at 73, Navarino Road, Dalston, and am a shorthand clerk—at half-past 9 on Wednesday, 9th February, I was going along Gray's Inn Road, and just at the corner of Portpool Lane the prisoner rushed out, struck me a violent blow in the stomach, snatching my chain, and rushed round the corner of Portpool Lane—the chain broke, leaving my watch in my pocket—three or four men ran behind him to cover him; they had been standing at the corner as I passed—I spoke to a policeman standing at the corner of the Town Hall, and he took me to a common lodging-house in Portpool Lane—we went into the house, and to the door of the kitchen—the constable said "Have a good look round"—I looked in and saw between 12 and 16 people there—I was afraid to go in, I backed into the street, and the constable followed me—directly we got outside another constable came along, and I went into the kitchen then with the two constables—directly I got in I saw the prisoner standing at the back of the kitchen—I said "That is the man, pointing to him—that was all that was said—the prisoner came boldly up and said, "What time was it stolen"—the constable asked me if I would give him in charge—I said "Yes," and we went to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, at 24, Plumstead Road, Plumstead—my front parlour is my shop—on Wednesday night, 9th February, watches and jewellery to the value of about £120 were there—I was the last up—I went to bed about half-past 11, having shut and fastened all the doors and windows—there were inside shutters to the windows, I fastened them myself—about 20 minutes to 3 a.m. I was disturbed by a noise down<lb/>stairs, and then I heard a man outside the house call "Jackson"—I went at once downstairs but could find nobody—the window of my back parlour was open, and the shutters on the floor, and all the jewellery, to the value of about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cleared out of the shop—I went at once to the police-station—this watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I know the watch by the number—they were lost with the other things that night—I have the number of the watch in my book—it is a a Geneva lever—I have had the chain six months—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are pieces of a ring that belonged to me; I can say so by the engraving and the stone—I had it more than three months, and had cleaned it once and sometimes twice a week.</p>

               <p>about 6 or 7 o'clock—I went out with them and had something to drink, and we went to the Gun Music Hall at Woolwich—we stopped there till half-past 12 o'clock I think—the prisoners had return tickets, which were of no use to them then—I said if they came home they could stay till morning and go up then—Jackson said his wife would be anxious about him—I said "If so you can catch the quarter to 5 o'clock train at Greenwich," but they need not go home then as it was so late—we went home at 1 o'clock—we took in beer and tobacco, and they had cigars, and stayed in my house—we sat up for some considerable time after we got in, then I was tired and I got into bed, after 2 o'clock I think—the prisoners sat up in the same room (I have only one)—I did not go to sleep—they left at 4 or quarter-past 4 o'clock in the morning—the clock had stopped, as I had not pulled the chains up; I had had too much to drink—my house is about three miles from the train terminus, and they were to leave at 4 to catch the quarter to 5 o'clock train—when they left they did not shut the door and I got up and shut it, and men were not going to work then—Jackson had a watch and chain on that night, but Jones had not—Jack<lb/>son was the only one who could tell us the time.</p>

I bought that a long while ago, and I got a receipt for it"—I said, "Where is the receipt?"—he said, "Oh! that is my business"—I said, "If you tell me where the receipt is I will make inquiries about it, and see if it is true"—he said, "I shan't"—in Jackson's presence, on the same day, these portions of the ring were shown to Waller, who identified them—I have frequently seen the prisoners together—it was more than three years ago I first saw them, but it is only the last two months they have been working together—on Wednesday, the 9th, I saw them in the Macclesfield Arms, City Road, about 500 yards from Jackson's lodgings, about 1 o'clock in the day, drinking with a lot of others, and coming back from the City I met them going towards Cannon Street—on the following morning, Thursday, Jackson was in the Macclesfield Arms under the influence of drink, and spending his money freely—he was then wearing a cat's-head pin in his scarf; in the evening when I saw him he had a horse-shoe pin in his scarf.</p>

On 15th January at 7.15 a.m. I went with Clamfield to Robinson's place and saw the tank in the warehouse, folded up—I took Champ into the office and the sergeant said "Did you buy any lead of this lad?"—the prisoner Robinson said "No, I don't remember the boy at all"—Champ said, "Did not we bring some lead down to you and you gave us 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—Robinson went to a book, I believe it was this book, looked at it and said "No one has been here but Eagleton, of 10, Queen Street"—the boy said "Did you not say we were to bring the copper down?"—Robinson said "I think I remember his face"—the sergeant said "Will you please come to the station?"—he said "Yes"—Robinson had an invoice or a piece of paper in his hand, and made an entry somewhere before he went to the station—the book was left there and the sergeant went into the office and then into the store-room, picked up the tank and said "Is this the tank?"—he said "I think it is" one office leads into the other, and in that office Robinson made another entry in the same book—the sergeant said "May we take this lead?"—the father said "Yes, and I will lend you a sack to take it in, call one of the men out of the yard"—I called the metal boy, and I took the tank and went to the station, and we went back to watch the premises—about a quarter to 9 o'clock Inspectors Robinson and Phillips came, and about 10.15 I saw a loaded van coming from Robinson's premises—I stopped it, spoke to the carman, and it was taken to the station—I assisted the inspector in taking a copper from it—there was metal of various kinds in it—I got this memorandum from the carman.</p>

I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and one of the Physicians of University College Hospital, and Physician to the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic—I have seen the prisoner since she has been in the prison on this charge—I examined her on the 17th February—she is about 42 years of age; I have no doubt that she is of unsound mind, suffering from what is termed melancholia—I believe she was of unsound mind on 1st February—from the account she gave me I have no doubt that she has been suffering from that for some time before this act was committed so as not to know the nature and quality of the act she was doing—she has improved considerably since she has been in prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman, and live at 19, Richmond Street, Kennington Road—early on Sunday morning, 27th, about 10 minutes past 12, I was on Waterloo Bridge and saw the prisoner standing on a seat on the Surrey side, and two children with her—they were babies, one a boy, the other a girl—the prisoner had a scarf in her hands, which I saw her tie round their necks—I watched her, thinking there was something wrong; they were standing side by side—she tied the scarf in a single knot—there was no knot between the two heads, the two heads were together, and the scarf was crossed first round the girl's neck and then round the boy's, and then tied in a knot—she raised the children in her arms as if to throw them over the parapet—I pulled them back, and said, "What are you going to do?"—she said she was going to drown her two children—I laid hold of her—she tried to get away from me—a crowd collected, some held her, and I fetched a constable—she was sober.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 229). About a quarter past 12 on this Sunday morning I was called by the last witness to the second recess on Waterloo Bridge coming from the Surrey side—I then saw the prisoner and the two children—they were tied by the necks together by this scarf, not tightly so as to injure them in any way, no tighter than you would to carry them—it was tied across one of their necks, crossed over and tied round the other—it was fully tied, but not tightly so as to strangle them—I said to the prisoner, "What was your intention by tying the children together like this?"—she said, "Find out," but afterwards said, "If it had not been for this man (meaning the last witness), I should have been over, children and all"—I said I should take her into custody—she said, "That was what I wanted"—on the way to the station she remarked that she could only get to Heaven once, and in another few minutes she would have been there, and the children with her—at the station, when the charge was read to her, she made as much noise as possible, and said it was a made up pack of lies—she was under the influence of drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at 24, Trinity Street, Newington—about quarter to 7 p.m. on the 27th December I was at the corner of Warner Street, coming from a urinal, and saw Bates pass me, and then Johnson—I knew them by sight before—Bates clipped me round the waist—when Johnson was within three yards I shouted "Police," and Garter hit me on the head and knocked my hat off, and Johnson put one hand over my mouth and the other one over my nose and held my head back, and then they rifled my pockets of a purse and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and four pawn<lb/>tickets and a pocket-knife—Bates did not rifle my pockets, it was Carter and the other man not in custody—after my pockets were rifled Johnson let go of my mouth, and came round to the front of me and struck me a blow on the jaw bone, knocking me into the road, and while I was lying there Bates and Johnson kicked me on the back and shoulders, and I have not got rid of the pain yet—they then ran away, and I tried to follow them, but I could not, I was too much hurt, and I lost sight of them—on the 30th January I saw all the three prisoners in the City Arms, Borough Road, and called a policeman and gave them in custody.</p>

I live at 33, Colliston Road, East Greenwich, and am conductor of tramcar 81, in the service of the London Tramways Company—on 20th January, at 11 p.m., the prisoner travelled in my ear from Westminster Bridge to the Elephant and Castle—he there gave me a two-shilling piece—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., silver and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. coppers, and he left—I went on my journey to Greenwich, and I then found this florin and no other in my bag; I had not taken or parted with one in the mean time—I found it was bad, kept it apart, and afterwards gave it to the constable—I am certain the prisoner is the man that gave it to me—on Saturday, 12th February, at 10 minutes past 10 p.m., the prison was again inside my car going along the Westminster Bridge Road, and he gave me another florin—I said "Have you anything smaller?"—he said "No; I will get out"—I said "You know this two-shilling piece is a bad one"—he said "My wife gate it to me; she took it in change of half a sovereign"—I said "I will call a constable and give you into custody"—I did so, and charged him—he was taken to Kennington Road Police-station, and there charged—when I went into the car to collect the fares, suspicion came into my mind immediately that the prisoner was the man who had been in on the 20th—I knew him again—I see a great many people in and out.</p>
