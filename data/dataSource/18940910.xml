                  </hi>. I am a produce broker, and was carry<lb/>ing on business with the late Mr. Charles Holmes at 13, Cullum Street, City—I am acquainted with Mr. Coe, a dentist—on 7th June, in cones<lb/>quence of a statement made by him, I drew these two cheques, one for £100 and the other for £150—Mr. Coe went to the bank with them—about half-past three on the same day, in consequence of a telegram purporting to come from Holmes, I went to my bank, the London and Provincial, and ascertained the number of a £100 note, which had been paid for the £100 cheque—I then went to the Bank of England, and found that the £100 note had been changed for twenty £5 notes about ten minutes before I got there—up to that time I never saw Frank Dale—on 22nd June Mr. Holmes lodged an information at Bow Street, and on that day he was found dead in his office, by his own hand.</p>

I am a dental surgeon—on 7th June I went with Mr. Holmes to the London and Provincial Bank, and he cashed a £100 cheque—I did not see the money—on that same day, about two, I was with Holmes in Pall Mall, and met Frank Dale outside 118—I had seen him before for about five minutes that morning—he was an absolute stranger—he was with Stebbing and Brown—I had never seen Stebbing before—Brown asked Holmes to hand him £250, and said, "I will then go with Mr. Dale and Stebbing to the Victoria Club, of which they are members, and collect a bet, and return and hand you £350"—Holmes objected—it was then agreed that we should all go to the club, and on the steps of the club Brown asked Holmes for the money, and said, "I will be responsible for the money," and Holmes then handed Brown the notes—Dale was present—Brown said, "Mr. Dale will go into</p>

               <p>the club and return in three minutes and hand me the money"—Brown then handed the notes to Dale, and he went into the club alone—he said to Holmes, "I will return and hand you the £350"—I objected, but he went in, and came back in a few minutes with a piece of paper, and said, "Topping's not in; I will fetch him and return in ten minutes"—he did not mention the money—he walked towards the Strand—Holmes, Brown, Stebbing, and myself crossed the street and waited in the porch of the Lyceum Theatre for a long time, but Dale did not return—I did not see him any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do a little betting once in a while, not for a living—I had known Holmes between six months and a year—I never borrowed money from him—I only had this one bet this year on Ladas for £150; I won that—I gave a post-dated cheque to Brown—it was with him I had the bet—I had no bet with Stebbing or Dale—the cheque for, £150 was not presented—I had no conversation with Brown or Stebbing about it—I had not the money to meet it at the time—my account was overdrawn £ 50—I had a bet for £50 on Bullingdon; that was included in the £ 150; it was £100 on Ladas and £50 on Bullingdon—I did not make a bet of £500 on Sempronius—I saw Dale at Holloway the last day of the remand at Bow Street—the two Dales, Brown and myself were, for want of accommodation, put into one cell, and I then asked Dale openly if I had ever had a bet with him—he said "No"—no one has talked to me about a bet of £500—I asked him the question, because it was given in evidence against me at Bow Street that I had made a bet to that effect—Stebbing said so—I deny it; I know nothing about it; I never lost £500 on Sempronius—I never had any transaction with Stebbing or Dale, I only dealt with Brown—I was not asked for the balance, between £150 and £500—I had no conversation with Stebbing in consequence of that demand—I arranged about that £250 with Holmes—it was not in con<lb/>sequence of my owing the balance of £400 that I went to Holmes to get the £250—it was an utter impossibility, because that race was not run till after the Derby—I had no bet on Sempronius whatever—this occurred on the Thursday, the day following the Derby—I know that Sempronius was run after the Derby; I don't know the day—I never backed Sempronius—I did see Dale when he came back from the club—the bet was not in my name, Holmes had all the management—the £250 was obtained for my benefit—Holmes was to have £25 for his trouble—I owed Brown nothing.</p>

Do you know if it is all right?"—he said, "Yes; it is all right, Mr. Dodd"—I then put £4 15s. 6d. on the counter, and the prisoner took it and put it in his pocket—he said nothing—I paid the cheque over with others to Mr. Poole, a general dealer, a next-door neighbour, in settlement of some account—about three days after it was returned to me by Mr. Poole, and I refunded the money to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barrett, of 72, Brooks' Wharf, Hommerton—on August 24th, about 10.15 p.m., I got into an omnibus at Victoria Street—the prisoners got in together after me, and Horniman sat next to me—the one with the cork leg sat forward; the other one told him to do so—I felt a fumbling by my side, and said, "Oh,</p>

               <p>my money"—I put my hand to my pocket and felt Feinberg's hand move away—I knew what money I had in the morning, and what I spent—I lost 3s. 2d.—I spoke to Feinberg—he said, "Do not accuse me; you must be careful"—I said, "I have got no one to accuse only you"—I spoke to the conductor, and a policeman was called—I had pulled my purse out when I paid, but I put it back in my pocket—the prisoners were taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Clephane Road, Canonbury—on 19th July I left home and shut up my house; I came back that day week and found all right—I went away again and returned and found it had been broken into—I identify these clocks and pencil-case, but not this ther<lb/>mometer—one clock was in the dining-room and one in the front bed-room; I found one in the hall and one on a chair on the first landing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent at 114, Fore street,—I represent Messrs. Ainsworth and Sons, linen thread manufac<lb/>turers, and also Messrs. Paton, lace manufacturers—Coten has been my customer on six occasions for thread, and on one occasion for laces—Winter and Connolly were porters in my service—about 12th June I had some conversation with my stock-keeper, and on 25th June I checked a portion of my stock—on 25th June my brother made a com<lb/>munication to me, in consequence of which I went with him to Alfred Dennison's shop at 25, Brick Lane, about 6.30 p.m.—in his window I saw two boxes of boot-laces, with Paton's name on—they are called mohair, but they are cotton—I saw Dennison's wife—I went then to Coten's shop, about seven minutes' walk further on along Brick Lane—saw Coten; I asked him about the laces I had seen in Dennison's window—I said that Mrs. Dennison had informed me that she was buying laces from him at very reasonable prices, that these laces I had recognised as mine, and I knew I had not supplied them to him, and I asked how he got them—he said he had bought some from a hawker, and sold a job line to Dennison at 10s. 6d. some time since—I pulled out one of these leather laces, and recognised it as similar to what was in Dennison's window—I spoke to the prisoner about that, and also about a mohair lace—I said, "These are the same laces that I saw at Dennison's"—I saw some of Paton's square lace at the prisoner's—I could identify them; other people besides Paton make square laces—I went back to Dennison's, and saw Dennison there—I then went back to Coten's, and on the way I met him coming towards Dennison's shop—I went back with him to his shop, and asked him if he would give me a sample of the laces in his window—he said, "Certainly"—I pulled out one, and showed it to my brother, and took it with me—on Tuesday afternoon I saw Connolly—on Tuesday morning I went to Dennison's, and found that the laces I had seen on the previous day were gone—I met the two Dennisons at the door—I went to the Police-station with them—I then went to the prisoner's shop, and told him I had missed a quantity of thread, and that if he knew anything about receiving it it would be best for him to tell me, as I did not want to put the police on him if he satisfied me he had received goods in a proper way.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can identify these laces because of the tags, and the way they are put on, and the finish of the laces—other firms do not use exactly the same tags as these—the value of the laces stolen from me and found at the prisoner's is between 2s. 6d. and 5s.—I first went to the prisoner's on 25th June; he was arrested on 27th—this parcel, marked "Ainsworth's sewing-machine linen thread," was presumably openly exposed in the prisoner's window from 25th to 27th—the value of a parcel of six balls would be 13s.—you would have to pull the threads out and count them to see if it was six or five thread—you could not tell which it was without closely examining it—Connolly and Winter made an accusation against another man—he was taken into custody—on his premises thread was found—the Alderman discharged him—Connolly and Winter were porters, and would take round and deliver goods—should have accepted an order brought by Connolly from the prisoner; I should not give Connolly any commission—I have had the same stock-keeper for three years, and have every confidence in him—I have only had the thread agency since January—numerous quantities of this thread have been taken away from the place over which the stock-keeper exer<lb/>cises supervision.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took over Ainsworth's business on 1st January, and with it I took over some of the former agent's servants—when I took stock on 25th June I valued the deficiency I found at £50—I made inquiries in consequence of something the stock-keeper told me—the different kinds of thread are kept quite distinct in the store-room, and are doubly checked—the porters had access to it; the carelessness of the stock-keeper had something to do with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public-house broker, of 51, Bedford Row—on Friday, May 25th, I met the prisoner and his brother by appointment at ten a.m. at Spring Gardens; I was acting for him in taking the Victory public-house—he was actually in possession under an agreement from the brewers, Watney and Co., of Pimlico—I was only in his company a few minutes; I left him with his brother—I had acted as his broker for putting him into the Old Drury, Vinegar Lane, and he remained tenant there till the notice expired on June 24th, 1894, but he did not remain till then—it was a six months' notice dated December 21st, 1893; the premises were coming down for the improvement of Drury Lane Theatre—in consequence of the prisoner holding a license in the Newington division the license was put into the name of Mr. Wells, who is a traveller to Lock and Smith, the brewers, it being known that the premises would only be occupied a short time prior to destruction—I have known him eight or nine years; he has borne a very high character for honesty among all who knew him—Lock and Co.'s signboards were up at the Old Drury—the furniture was moved from the Old Drury to the Victory on Monday, the 28th—I know that police inquiries had been made—he never had possession—he opened the same day that the license was transferred, Monday, June 11th—I acted in the transfer, and for Messrs. Watney as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was communicated with on the same day that he was arrested—I had an appointment with him relative to his rates on Mav 25th, but he said, "I don't require you, I can don't myself"—I keep a diary, but it does not appear in it—it was on Friday, and he said I will be back at two o'clock—I went at two o'clock, and saw his wife.</p>

I am a traveller for Lock and Smith, brewers—my name is painted over the door—I have known the prisoner about four years, living at the Old Drury with his wife, up to the time the house was closed, Sunday night, May 27th—I knew he was going to the Victory—some of the furniture was moved on the 25th, and the last of it after the closing of the house—I arrived at the Victory about noon on the 25th—the prisoner and his brother were there, and Mr. Atkinson came in—the prisoner was busy putting the furniture in, and we left about 4.30, and returned and dined—Mr. Atkinson went some little distance with us, and then left us, and we went back to the Victory, and got there about 5.30—I may be mistaken about Mr. Atkinson leaving before six o'clock—I did not notice the time he left—I never met a more straightforward man than the prisoner—I think he is beyond reproach.</p>

I was casualty surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—on 22nd August, about four that afternoon, the prosecutrix was brought there—her clothes were taken off, and I examined her—all her clothes were punctured through, including her stays, and stained with blood—at the outer side of the left breast there was a punctured wound, penetrating about three-quarters of an inch into the wall of the chest, about an inch and a half from the heart—this knife might certainly have produced it; it would require a fair amount of force—she is now out of danger—at first she was in danger—I dressed the wound, and she left the hospital; she was treated as an out-patient.</p>

Last Friday night I received this table knife from the last witnesss—it had been recently sharpened by a file; it was very sharp; it is a powerful knife—about ten minutes to twelve the same night I found the prisoner at 2, Spring Row, and took him into custody, where the prosecutrix lived—she was present when I took him—I said to her, "Will you charge him?"—she said, "Yes"—I told him he was charged with occasioning her actual bodily harm by cutting her with a knife—he said, "All right, governor; I will go quietly with you"—he was certainly not drunk, but he had been drinking very heavily for the last month—I took him to the station with another constable—the prose<lb/>cutrix and her brother followed—on the way we had a struggle, and he threw me—he then turned and saw the prosecutrix, and said, "You b—cow, I will do for you yet"—the charge was read over to him at the station and he was cautioned—he said, "You b—cow, I will knife you yet"—he said that frequently—he was very violent in the dock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon, of 95, Fortress Road, Kentish Town—I attended to the prosecutrix last Friday evening—she was suffering from a cut on the right hand, about an inch and a quarter, on the palm near the thumb, and a slight cut on the opposite side of the same part—it was not deep; it had divided the skin, just a little more than skin deep—it was bleeding slightly—it was not a serious wound; the appearance of it was quite consistent with what she has stated.</p>

I never attempted to cut her throat; all at once I lost my senses, with the drink. She clasped the knife and cut herself very slightly; the knife had not been sharpened. She turned out very sharp, after saying she loved every hair of my head.</p>

I am an inspector of the Mineral Water Bottle Exchange Company, which was formed for the purpose of restoring bottles to mineral water manufacturers—if bottles get into wrong hands they are sent to the Exchange, sorted out and sent back to the original owners—on 29th July I found the prisoner standing with a barrow, on which was gingerbeer, in Acorn Street, Bishopsgate—I bought from him these two bottles of gingerbeer, each bearing the trade mark of R. White—I called the prisoner's attention to the trade mark—he said, "I make my own gingerbeer. I have brought bottles to the Exchange. I am also a dealer"—I examined the rest of the stuff on his barrow and found about seven dozen of gingerbeer, four dozen bearing the trade mark of R. White, and the remainder bearing the names of other well-known makers—two days afterwards I went to 58, Wentworth Street, a private house where the prisoner lives in one room—I saw a tub in the back yard and about ten dozen empty bottles, all bearing the names of different makers—I heard the prisoner before the Magistrate claim to be tried by a jury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Plant cooked for the girls employed by Davis and Co., and she went to this shop every day to buy provisions, which she brought away—I have been in the force sixteen or seventeen years, and I have known the Aanonsons very nearly the whole of that time, with the excep<lb/>tion of five years, when I was absent—I am attached to Moor Lane Police<lb/>station—they have carried on business as provision dealers in the imme<lb/>diate neighbourhood of Moor Lane—I have no cause to think that they bear other than the character of perfectly respectable people, against whom no suggestion could be made—when I went into the room Mrs. Aanonson was unrolling the lace to see how long it was; the greater part of it was still in the bundle—on the table there was another piece of lace about six yards long in a yellow piece of paper—nothing was said as to when that was brought in; I did not see Plant bring it in that morning—the first thing Mrs. Aanonson did on my telling her the facts was to turn to Plant, and say, "You have deceived me, Mrs. Plant"—Plant said nothing—all the rest of the lace I found in the back room of the shop I should not describe as small pieces or remnants—Mrs. Aanon<lb/>son volunteered the information where I should find the things at the private address, and she said her sister would point them out—through their old premises coming down the Aanonsons had lately moved to Milton Street, and having no living accommodation there, they were staying with their parents—at the station Mrs. Aanonson turned to Plant, and accused her of deceiving her; Plant said nothing—Mr. Aanonson said he did not know what his wife had been doing—I saw some of their children at Stepney—I could not say if they were wearing pinafores made of this lace.</p>

C. Fruhling, 58, Warren Street"—I talked the matter over with my principals, and decided to buy a week or ten days later, and I wrote this postcard to Fruhling on 16th July.

I had instructions, and watched 142, Fleet Street, and the Trautzes and Fruhling, from 27th July for some days—on Friday, 27th July, I saw William and Emile Trautz together at Ludgate Circus—they separated—William went to the office at 142, Fleet Street—after two or three minutes he came out and joined Emile, and gave him some letters—after reading them they went to several public-houses, and then separated; Emile went to the Red Lion, Bevis Marks, and after remaining there a short time to 5<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Stoney Lane, which is occupied by Joseph—shortly afterwards Emile came back to the Red Lion, where he joined William—they stayed there a short time; then Emile left William and went again to 5A, Stoney Lane, and from there to the Red Lion and the Spread Eagle, High Street, Whitechapel, where Joseph and his family live—shortly afterwards he rejoined William at the Red Lion, Bevis Marks; Joseph joined them—they were all three together for half an hour, in and out of the Red Lion—William and Emile went to 5A, Stoney Lane, and from there to Ludgate Circus, where they parted—Emile went to 142, Fleet-Street,</p>

               <p>and was followed by William, who also went in—after about a quarter of an hour William left with a large paper parcel—he was afterwards joined by Emile, and they went to the Red Lion, Bevis Marks, and from there to Joseph's public-house—Joseph was not there then, but he joined them, and was in their company for half an hour—I left them there—next day, 28th July, I again saw William go into the office, 142, Fleet Street—after two or three minutes he came out and joined Emile, and handed him letters, which they read—they went to Giltspur Street, where Fruhling joined them, and they were together for about half an hour—Fruhling went to 6, Camden Gardens, a private house—on Monday, 30th July, I saw William go to the office, 142, Fleet Street—after two or three minutes he left and joined Emile, and gave Emile some letters—after reading them, Emile gave one back to William, who put it into his coat-tail pocket—they went to Giltspur Street, and met Fruhling at the same place as the day before—they were together for a few minutes—that afternoon I again saw Emile in Stoney Lane, near No. 5A—I left him at the Red Lion—on 31st July I saw William at the office, 142, Fleet Street; he came at the same time, ten o'clock each morning—he came out after two or three minutes and joined Emile, who used to wait in a back street—they went to the Red Lion, Bevis Marks—William met Emile at Farring<lb/>don Street Station that morning, and after he left him Fruhling joined William—I watched William and Emile up to seven o'clock that evening; they spent the day in the Red Lion and the Spread Eagle—on the 1st August I saw them in Mark Lane—after going to two or three public-houses William went to 142, Fleet Street, and was there for two or three minutes—I watched them for the rest of the day—they were together till four p.m. in public-houses—on the 2nd August I saw Emile in Fen-church Street and followed him to the Red Lion and Spread Eagle—he came out with Joseph after about a quarter of an hour—I was with Bacon—we arrested Joseph, and the warrant was read to him—on the remand I saw Joseph outside the Mansion House; he was on bail—I said, "I am told to tell you that you will now be further charged with conspir<lb/>ing with William and Emile Trautz and Fruhling and obtaining 200 gross of fly-papers from Tunbridge, of Reading"—he said, "I don't know them at all; I am as innocent of them as I am of the other charges."</p>

You are trading in the name of Francks and Co. at 142, Fleet Street. I hold a warrant for your arrest for obtaining a quantity of goods from different people. I will read it to you later on. Where is Alexander? Is he in your house?"—he said, "Yes," and then "No"—I said, "Who is that man inside the house?"—he said, "That is my brother; he has nothing at all to do with this matter"—I left him in charge of Bacon</p>

               <p>and went to 15, Goodall Road, and knocked at the door—it was opened by William Trautz—I said, "I am a police officer. I want to speak to you for a moment"—we walked to the back of the house—I said, "Where is Mr. Francks?"—he said, "He is out"—I said, "Are you Mr. Alex<lb/>ander?"—he said, "No, that is not my name"—I said, "What is your name?" he said, "My name is Trautz"—I said, "You are the party mentioned in this matter; how do you spell your name?"—he wrote it in my book—I read the warrant to him—he said, I "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You have been to Fleet Street for letters"—he said, "Yes, I went up there once for my brother when he was queer"—I said, "You are the party mentioned in this warrant, and you will have to go to the station with me"—after we had searched the house he was taken to the station—I went back to Emile and said he would have to go to the City—he wanted to go back and see his wife first—the Trautzes were taken to Bridewell and detained—the warrant was read to them; they made no reply—when Emile saw his brother in custody he said he had nothing to do with the matter; he merely sent his brother for letters when he was queer—on 9th August I saw Fruhling in custody at Bridewell Police-station between 10 and 11a.m.—I said, "Your name is Fruhling?"—he said, "Yes"—I said., "I am a police officer. I hold a warrant for your arrest for conspiring with Alexander and Emile Trautz and obtaining a quantity of goods in different parts of the country"—he said, "I never obtained any goods. I merely wrote the letters; I did not sign them"—I read the warrant—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You were trading as Krall and Webster in the Minories last year?"—he said, "I was not; I was merely a clerk. I wrote the letters; I did not sign them"—I said, "Who did sign them?"—he said, "Francks. I have known Francks for some years; he was introduced to me by Masters, whom I have known for twenty-five years"—I read the warrant to him—he said he did not know anything about it; he merely wrote letters for these people, who could not write English; he got his living by translating, and that sort of thing—Emile at the Mansion House pointed to Fruhling, and said, "This is Alexander"—Joseph had been taken into custody the day before by Bacon—I afterwards went with Bacon and Austin to 5<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Stoney Lane, a small shop with a basement—there was no name up, but stuck on the door was a piece of paper, "If out, call at Mr. Cohen's, opposite"—in the cellar was a lot of straw and empty bottles, and three or four old account-books, relating to public-houses years before—there were no books relating to business within three or four years—I found there this half gross of fly-papers lying on the counter—the shop was shut up, except on Sunday morning, when a barrow with a board was put up outside, and things put on it, but then the shop was closed to the public—there was nothing in the front of the shop to show what kind of business was being done—on 14th August Joseph was with his solicitor at the Police-office, Old Jewry, where the whole of the goods from the house had been taken—Joseph, pointing to the fly-papers, said, "That is a sample; he asked me whether I could do anything with them; I said I could not"—I believe that Joseph does not hold a license now—I found documents at Joseph's relating to Walden and Co.</p>

On July 20th, about 2.30, I was with Callaghan, another officer, in plain clothes, in Drury Lane, and saw the four prisoners and three other men come through Bedford Street into Drury Lane—an old gentleman, alone, was going up Bedford Street towards Endell Street—we recognised two of them, and determined to watch them—we concealed ourselves in two shops, a beershop and a butter shop, and scarcely before we had time to do so the whole gang surrounded the old gentleman—Crowther and Mason got in front of him—they both put their hands on his waistcoat and clutched at his watch-chain—he put up his hands to protect himself, but the prisoners pushed him down in the road, and his hat fell off—Wright and Hanson were close together—Callaghan and I ran out, but before we could get near them, seeing us, they ran off in all directions—Crowther and Mason shouted out, "If you follow us we will <hi rend="italic">corpse</hi> you"—they were all flourishing very thick sticks—the gentleman scrambled up and ran away in a different direction, and we chased them, but lost sight of them—I have known Crowther and Hanson a long time, and I know Mason, but not for so long—I saw Wright there; I had seen him once before with a similar gang; Crowther's brother, who is now in prison, and Massy and Hanson and another man who I do not know—after going to several other houses, I went with Callaghan at 3.15 on the same afternoon to the Sun public-house, Drury Lane—we looked into the private bar, and saw the four prisoners and three other men and three or four women all in the same compartment—I recognised the other three men as the men I had seen before that day—I got the assistance of two uniform men, and then went in with Callaghan, and said, "We are police officers; you will be charged with attempting to rob a gentleman and violently assaulting him"—two or three of them said, "All right, we will go quietly"—Mason said, "All right, governor, let us drink our beer"—I took hold of Crow<lb/>ther and handed him to Tate; he called out something, and there was immediately a free fight—they still had their sticks with them, and they struck us in all directions—I saw the landlord just as we took them in custody, but not while the tight was taking place—they struck me all over my body; the uniform constables were obliged to use their truncheons, and we were obliged to use our walking-sticks to protect ourselves—they then commenced scrambling over the partition—Mason climbed over, and I went over and dropped on top of him, and while I was securing him Hanson jumped over me into the street—I handed Mason to a constable, and chased Hanson through several streets, and he was stopped by another officer—he struggled violently, and hit us both—we took them to the station—they were all charged, and made no reply, except using filthy language and threats—Crowther said at the station, "That is the black heifer; they looked for us in the Iron House last night," and after a short time, he said, "We will kill you when we get out"—the Iron House is a public-house in Seven Dials—we had been there looking for all four of them the night before—other prisoners used to meet there; no one has objected to the license.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I had only seen Wright once before, and in the evening—I did not know him to be a thief, but I saw him with thieves—I made no note of the conversation at the station, but I believe my brother officer did—I did not hear the other men say that Wright was quite innocent, and had not been at the robbery at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Crowther.</hi> I was in a butter shop—I am sure I saw you snatch the old man's chain—you came up in front of him—there was a great uproar just afterwards—you flourished the sticks in Bottenden Street; you had one—you were fighting with a constable at the door of the public-house, hitting and biting him—one of the men threw a glass—he was on the sick list for some considerable time afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hanson.</hi> The gentleman was going towards Endell Street—the robbery was committed at the corner of Bottenden Street—there were seven or eight men there—Lockhart's coffee-shop is at the corner—you and young Crowther, Crowther's brother, were together, and Mason in front of you—there was no one else in the street but a postman, but when I blew my whistle the neighbourhood was all in an uproar—you ran through three streets to where I arrested you—I struck you once on your knees with the crook of my walking-stick, and a gentle<lb/>man living in Endell Street told me to give you two or three more—you had dropped your stick before you left the public-house—I did not pick it up, because the house was surrounded by nearly a hundred people—when the constable took you you struggled and kicked—I have a mark on my leg from a kick—I was assaulted by you, and you were charged at the Police-court with kicking me—my leg was green and blue, and it after<lb/>wards commenced running; I showed it to the inspector.</p>

On July 20th, about 2.30 p.m., I was with Oxley in Drury Lane, and saw the prisoners and three others surround an old gentleman at the door of Lockhart's coffee-shop—I had seen Crowther and Hanson before on two or three occasion, and Wright and Mason once before—they made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the gentleman's watch-chain, and knocked him into the road; they ran away, I followed them—they said, "You heifers, if you follow us we will <hi rend="italic">corpse</hi> you"—we after<lb/>wards found them in a public-house and told them the charge—they said, "All right, governor, we will go quietly"; but a general fight took place, and pots, glasses, and sticks were used—outside the public-house they called on the crowd to <hi rend="italic">rouse</hi>, which means rescue—there are about seven public-houses within a small radius—about one hundred people surrounded us and attempted to rescue the prisoners, who struggled violently all the while—we got them to the station with further assistance—I got hold of Wright—at the station Mason said, "The first time we meet you we will kill you"—he also said, "We knew it would come to this, working too strong handed"—the others said "Yes"—they were charged, and made no reply—I saw Hanson jump over the partition.</p>

               <p>three others—I saw what took place from a different position to what Oxley was in—I did not see you put your hand on the chain—I was in a public-house—I came out and chased a man and fell, or I should have had him here—he had a dark moustache—you had a stick—we did not set about unmercifully with our sticks till a general fight took place, and then we had to use our sticks to defend ourselves—glasses were thrown about, and some were smashed against the partition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. Wright had one arm held by a detective and the other by a constable; he used the stick and got away from the constable, and I got hold of him; he struck me and I used my stick—there were seven men and three or four women.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Crowther.</hi> I saw you grabbing the chain, and then the man was hustled and thrown into the road—the other men sur<lb/>rounded him—he was thrown into the roadway by two of the gang—you flourished sticks as soon as you saw us; you had a stick—I cannot say whether you assaulted any person besides the constables—you know it is impossible to get witnesses here, because they are afraid to come—it is such a frequent occurrence to have fights and disturbances there that the people in the coffee-house took no notice of it—there were a few people walking in the street—I have known you two years—I saw you on the Dials four or five days before, with Mason and Hanson, and I saw you before that in Long Acre.</p>

On July 20th I was on duty in Drury Lane about 2.40 p.m., at the corner of High Holborn, and saw an old gentleman run<lb/>ning along Drury Lane in a most excited state—he made a complaint to me, in consequence of which I went to Bottenden Street, but did not see either of the prisoners—later in the afternoon I went with Oxley and Callaghan to the Sun public-house—I took hold of Crowther—he struck me a violent blow on my hand with a very large walking-stick—he hurt me, and I was compelled to go on the sick list for three weeks; I had no use of my hand—he also kicked me several times on my legs—I over-powered him, got him outside the house, and took him to the station—he resisted on the way, and I had to strike him several times with my truncheon in self defence—I have not seen the old gentleman since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Crowther.</hi> He told me he had been knocked down by a gang of roughs, pointing down Drury Lane, who attempted to rob him—I asked him if he could give any description—he said, "No"; he had had sufficient of them, and he could not stop—I asked his name and address; he declined to give them—he was glad to get away for fear you should attack him again—he went up Museum Street, and I went down Drury Lane to made inquiries—you made violent resistance—I have the mark on my hand now, and you kicked me—I am positive you had a stick—there was such a conflict that I could not see who threw the glassses—your young woman did not say, "For God's sake, sir, do not hit him about in that manner," nor did I strike her, my truncheon was in my pocket—she did not, to my knowledge, come to the station to give evidence, nor was she refused admission—she struck me on my left ear</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of the firm of Barron and Sons, 55, Lincoln's Inn Fields—we acted as solicitors to the administrator of the estate of Mr. Ramsay, who died intestate in August or September, 1892—a claim on that estate was put forward by the pri<lb/>soner for Mrs. Gregg—the amount was somewhat indefinite—one item was £260, and there was a general claim, which I have here—I had twelve or thirteen letters written to me from time to time down to January, 1893, when I settled the matter on behalf of the administrator by agreeing to pay £280—there was some question as to the amount the family were willing to pay; the first suggestion was £140, but ultimately, after consulting the next-of-kin, the administrator agreed to give £280—I do not know whether this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) ever came into my pos<lb/>session—I never saw it; it is addressed to Mr. Clack, authorising him to receive such sum as he might think proper—I wrote this letter with reference to it on the 14th June; Mr. Clack was a little pressing to get the money. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they were making final arrangements to wind up the estate, and promising an early settlement; the postscript stated that they had seen the adminstrator, who was willing to wind up the estate provided Mrs. Gregg accepted</hi> £140, <hi rend="italic">although they hoped to get her more.</hi>)—I then wrote him another letter of the 15th June, substituting the enclosed for Mrs. Gregg's signature—I thought it a case in which com<lb/>pensation was proper—I produce the two documents; the latter one was sent to me signed and witnessed—I got a cheque for £280 shortly afterwards, and then received from the prisoner this letter, dated 5th July, acknowledging the receipt of my letters, and promising to obtain Mrs. Gregg's receipt, and requesting that the cheque might be drawn in his own name—after that I received a receipt for the £280, and paid the cheque in return—at that time my client had signed the cheque payable to her order, and on 8th June I handed the cheque to a messenger, and received this receipt signed by Mrs. Gregg—it did not come back to me; it was not my cheque—it was endorsed, "St. George Gregg"—I saw Mrs. Gregg in the matter two or three times before that, but never afterwards till these pro<lb/>ceedings were initiated, and she came to my office to tell me what had happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The claim was, in my opinion, one which could not be legally enforced; it was a moral claim rather than a legal one—she enter<lb/>tained the opinion that the deceased had left a will in her favour; it was put in that way by the prisoner—I think she would have got the sum without him, but I think he did the best he could for her—he got £280, when we had offered £140—if she had accepted the £140, I still think she would have got the £280; it was a question whether they should give her £10 or £20 apiece—it was not entirely through the prisoner's efforts that she got the money—I repudiated the claim altogether at first as a legal claim—I think the prisoner told me that the money was proposed to be used in setting Mrs. Gregg up in some business or school—I heard that his wife was a great friend of hers—there is no doubt that this receipt is signed by him—it was written out by my clerk in my office—the £280 is written in words—the receipt is witnessed by Theodore Grabler, clerk to Mr. Clack, and upon that I paid the money on Saturday, July 7th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Morton Terrace, S.W.—I have known the prisoner two or three years—I was acquainted with his wife before and after she was married—about two years ago I had a claim against the estate of a deceased person in respect of which I learned that Mr. Barron was acting—the prisoner spoke to me about it—I used to visit them at their private house, and it was there that he spoke to me—he knew that I had a claim, and he offered to act for me, and I consented—that was a few days after Christmas day, 1892—I saw him several times at his office and elsewhere at the beginning of 1893, chiefly at his office—I did not I then claim any specific sum; I sent in a general claim—early in July he told me that the amount was to have been £160—I knew that he was in communication with Mr. Barron, the family solicitor—I went and saw the prisoner a few days before I received any money from him, at his office in Bow Street—I signed one or two documents without reading them; he put them before me—this is my signature; it purports to be a receipt for £280—the prisoner said, "I wish you to sign a paper waiving all future claim on the estate," and I did so—I did not read it—Grabler was not there when I signed it—I knew him as the clerk—I did not know when I signed it that the sum of £280 appeared on the face of the document—nothing was said about the payment of the money on that occasion, but a few weeks afterwards he wrote to me to come to his office and sign a cheque—I went into his room;" nobody else was there—I sat by the side of his desk, and he asked me to sign a cheque; I put my name to it—this is what I refer to. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to the endorsement.</hi>) It was placed ready for me to sign—before I signed it I turned it over, and found it was for £160—he had mentioned just within the last few days the amount he had got for me—I then left the office—I saw him at his house next day, or the day after, in Charles Street, Rutland Gate, and signed a receipt for £160, and received the money—I then offered him £25 as a fee for his work—he said, "No," he would only accept £15—I also paid him £5, which was owing to Mrs. Clack, and I took away £140—up to that time I had never heard any statement from anybody that £280 had been paid by Mr. Barron—the prisoner said nothing about the £160 being on account of any larger sum—I thought it was a full settlement of my claim—after receiving it, I said I wished to thank Mr. Barron for his kindness—the prisoner objected to my doing so, and said, "The matter has been in my hands"—we then parted—I was at that time in the receipt of £50 a year from my brother—that was all my income—it did not all come from my brother, but from my relatives; it was paid by my brother—I received no further sum after that on account of the estate which Mr. Barron was administering—I never heard £280 mentioned till July, 1894—that was about the time I received a letter from Messrs. Wilson and Wallace—I then went to Mr. Barron and made inquiries, after which I swore an information at Bow Street before Sir John Bridge, and afterwards gave evidence there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on intimate terms with Mrs. Clack fifteen years before she was married; on close affectionate terms—she had been very kind to me and helped me—I wrote this letter to her on the day</p>

               <p>before she was married to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Congratulating her and expressing her gratitude, and hoping that the Good Samaritan would reward her.</hi>) After she was married there was less intimacy, but she was not less kind—she lent me her house, 16, Charles Street, to live in for some weeks—It is her own house there was never any difference between us, and I had no reason to know that she was likely to do me any injury—she never suggested that I was extravagant with money—I have been trying to get a situation all the summer—it was suggested that I should take music pupils, but I never entertained the idea of a school—it was more than once suggested that when I got this money I should invest it so as to bring me in some livelihood—if I had enough I should have taken a house and let it—I spent the £140—I did not carry it all about till it was all spent, I put some of it in the Savings Bank merely to keep it till I spent it—I made no investment of it in any business—my brother went on paying the £1 a week—I was at the Police-court on the first occasion when the prisoner was charged, and heard him say that the money was ready for me and always had been—he complained that he had not even been asked for any explana<lb/>tion before the charge was made—at a later stage of the case Sir J. Bridge said that the money had not even then been paid over; I did not hear the prisoner or his solicitor say that he had been to the Treasury and offered to pay it over—I have heard that the £120 has been paid to my brother without interest—I have received a bankers' draft for £120—I did not authorise my brother to receive it for me; it was done without my knowledge; I do not know why, I think it might as well have been paid to me; I have not got it yet—I first made a charge against the prisoner in consequence of a letter I received from a firm of solicitors in Bow Street, in consequence of which I went to Messrs. Wilson and Wallace—I did not know that Mr. Grabler had been to see them—after that I went to Messrs. Barron, and then wrote to Wilson and Wallace, instructing them not to proceed further in the matter—it was after that that an information was sworn at Bow Street—Grabler was not a party to that—I was not aware when I swore it that Grabler was also swearing to it; I had not the least idea what he was swearing—I knew he was swearing about two cheques, but I had not read his information—I did not know for what purpose this information was being laid before the Magistrate—I did not know that Grabler had given information—I ap<lb/>peared on the second hearing, and stated to the Magistrate that I did not intend to go on or prefer any charge against Mr. Clack—I said, "Sir John, cannot I retire from this case? I have been led into it"—he said that he could not allow it—I know that Mrs. Clack has means of her own—I knew she was quite honest, and that she was a proper person to keep money for me—this is my signature to this document "C."

I then endorsed a cheque, which I turned up and saw it was for £160, I then received the money from the defendant, £160"—it was not at his house, but I suppose I said so—I suppose I said, "I got my money the same day that I endorsed the cheque, that was at the defendant's private house"—I cannot tell how many cheques I endorsed—I signed something one day and Mr. Clack wished me to go again and sign something else—I signed "Jane Gregg" only; St. George was my husband's name—I understand that it is being suggested that when I endorsed the cheque it was for £280—this blue cheque is longer than the other—I went to Mrs. Clack's house to receive the £160—I do not know whether it was on July 12th, but it was very shortly after I signed the receipt; it was four or five days after I endorsed the cheque—I received it in bank notes—I do not re<lb/>member when I endorsed the cheque for £160 drawn by Mrs. Clack, and I did not remember when I was at the Police-court—I did sign my name on a cheque for £160—apart from that endorsement, I do not remember endorsing a cheque for £160 drawn by Mrs. Clack in my favour—I should not refuse to take a crossed cheque, because I do not know anything about crossed cheques—I know that a line is drawn across—I see Mrs. Clack here—I had not discussed with Mrs. Clack before the £160 was paid to me how much of it was to be paid to me and how much was to he retained; nor that £160 would be quite sufficient for my present wants, and that the remainder she could keep for a rainy day; nor did I say, "You know what I am; I should only spend the money foolishly if I had it all," and ask her to keep it for that reason—she suggested my putting some of it bank—I dined with Mrs. Clack after that, and visited her on other occasions—a servant named Annie used to wait at table. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to Annie Cowper.</hi>) After July 12th allusion was never made to the balance of money Mrs. Clack had in hand for me—a few weeks after I had the money she called my attention to the governess agency in Welbeck Street, and advised me to go there—I went to Folkestone soon afterward—I did not take lodgings at live guineas a week; I went to a boarding-house, and paid three and a half guineas for everything—I was there a fortnight—I spent the money entirely—Mr. Clack positively refused my paying him £20—it was he</p>

               <p>who suggested £15, if I wanted to pay him anything—he took up the matter originally as a friend; that is why I did not read the documents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had great confidence in him—there is no truth in the suggestion that I consented to £180 being kept by Mrs. Clack; until I saw Wilson and Wallace I had no idea that I was to receive £280—at the time I wrote that letter to Mrs. Clack I had been in great trouble—Mr. and Mrs. Clack suggested that I should put some of the £180 into a bank—they went to Scotland after the money was paid to me, and were away a few weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Newman Street, Oxford Street, and am clerk to Mr. Pickersgill, the barrister—from September, 1892, to January, 1894, I was the prisoner's clerk at 15, Broad Court, Bow Street—I am a German—there was no other clerk except towards the end of 1893—a letter-book was kept, and a call-book, diary, and petty cash-book—the entries in the diary were made by the prisoner, and I had a diary of my own—he had no banking account while I was there—if any large sums were received, he told me he generally paid them into his wife's account—I know of no account but his wife's that he could pay a cheque into—he kept a cheque-book, and filled in cheques which were already signed by Mrs. Clack, and I sometimes changed them—I knew that he was in communication with Messrs. Barron with reference to Mrs. Gregg's affairs, and she used to come to the office—I remember his receiv<lb/>ing a cheque from Mr. Barron for £280—there is only one office, but the back room is used as a waiting-room—clients come in at the back door—Mr. Clack said, "Don't be long at the Police-court. I want to give you some instructions, Mrs. Gregg is coming to endorse the cheque, and is very talkative; I am very busy, and when I cough you knock at the door, and say that I am required"—Mrs. Gregg came early one morning, and went in, and in ten or fifteen minutes I heard Mr. Clack cough—I looked in at the door and said, "Mr. Clack, you are wanted"—Mrs. Gregg was then sitting at Mr. Clack's desk with a pen in her hand, but she left almost directly—after she left Mr. Clack sent me out—I was away twenty minutes or half an hour, and when I came back he was in rather an excited state—he used the same office as I did—he said, "Mr. Grabler, I want you to help me with this"—he had a paper in his hand, and I put my glasses on, and saw two pieces of paper attached one to the other, but partly separated, and said, "What the devil have you been doing?"—he said, "Never mind what I do; you do what I tell you," and asked me to take hold of the two ends of the green cheque—I did so—he had the white cheque in his hand—I saw at once that they were cheques; one was greenish and the other white—he suffers from rheumatic gout, and can only use the thumb and forefingers of both hands—I took hold of this green cheque, and he pulled the white one from in front of it—I said, "Mr. Clack, you will tear the cheque"—he said, "Well, put some water on the edge; damp it"—I damped the edge of the cheque, and then he pulled the white cheque off, and threw the green one on his desk, and tore the white one in pieces, and took half a sheet of blue draft, and put the pieces in it, and threw it in the grate and set light to it—there was no fire in the grate—the cheque he put on the table was endorsed by Mrs. Gregg, and he said, "I am going to pay this into my wife's bank"—he said, "Mrs. Gregg is a friend of mine, and I</p>

               <p>had to do this to get something for ray costs; she is an old friend of my wife's, and I did not like to ask her for anything"—this letter ("N") is in Clack's writing, "15, Broad Court. Dear Sir,—Please collect the enclosed cheque for £280, and pay the same into Mrs. Clack's account To the Manager of the London Joint Stock Bank, Westminster Branch"—this is a book of counterfoils of that bank; most of them are in Mr. Clack's writing, but some are in a hand which I do not recognise, and which looks rather like a lady's writing—when I left Mr. Clack's employment in June, 1894, I went to Mr. Havelock, a solicitor, and after that to Mr. Pickers<lb/>gill, the barrister—that was eight or nine weeks ago—I was in the service of Messrs. Wilson and Wallace before I went to Mr. Clack—I went and saw Mr. Wilson in July—I made a statement to Mr. Pickers<lb/>gill, and after that I swore an information—Inspector Marshall came to Mr. Wilson's office, and heard what I had to say—I was not present, I am sorry to say, when Mrs. Gregg signed this receipt for £280—it is signed, "Jane St. George Gregg," and my name appears as a witness—Mr. Clack asked me to witness the signature—he said it looked more business like—I did not know that any fraud was intended, and I witnessed it the same day, or the day following, but I was not present when it was signed—he said it would look better to have it witnessed—I remember hearing that he had got the cheque from Mr. Barron, and Mrs. Gregg came to the office the following day, or a day or two after.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I became a barrister's clerk on June 18th—I have not been clerk to any other banister than Mr. Pickeregill—I first went to Messrs. Wilson and Wallace about a week after the prisoner proved an alibi at Bow Street Police-court by false evidence, two or three days before the information was sworn—I have been clerk to five or six solicitors during the last sixteen or seventeen years—I have not been in constant employment all the time—they were mostly gentlemen who practised in the criminal Courts—I left Messrs. Wilson and Wallace at the end of October or November, 1892—they did not discharge me; I had a little difference with Mr. Wilson, and left of my own accord, but after that he found out that I was in the right; he acknowledged it himself—he did not request me to leave; he said I told him a lie—I said, "No, sir, I have not," and took my hat and walked out of the office—I left Mr. Clack because he came back from this Court to the office at eight p.m. not very sober, and commenced to pick a quarrel and said, "You can go"—he had given me in the morning two lists of witnesses to be served with subpoenas, one marked "S" and the other "F," which were to be volun<lb/>tary; and he complained that the subpoena list had not been filled up, and discharged me for alleged neglect of duty—I had certainly not neglected my duty—I was not a bit angry at being discharged—he never complained to me of my having been to his private house drunk on several occasions, and I never heard that he had complained—after I left him I was with Mr. Havelock about eight weeks, and left because there was no business—I knew that £280 was going to be paid for Mrs. Gregg—I did not suspect any fraud was being committed till I saw on the first cheque that there was £160, and I thought Mr. Clack had taken a good slice out for his costs—I thought he wanted to put the difference between £160 and £280 into his own pocket—I thought it was dishonest—I simply carried out his orders—I</p>

               <p>should not have picked anybody's pocket if he had told me to do so—I did not know what he meant, because the whole thing did not take ten minutes—after they were separated I thought I was taking part in a dis<lb/>honest transaction—I took "Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law," and read there that anybody knowing that a felony I has been committed, or assists in the concealment thereof, is guilty of misdemeanor, and the prisoner proved an alibi, and I got frightened, and spoke to Mr. Wilson in con<lb/>fidence—this is the paragraph, section 157—I represent to the Jury that on July 15th, 1894, my eyes were first opened to the transaction by the passage in "Stephen's Digest"—I was then clerk to Mr. Pickersgill—the case in which the alibi was proved was at Bow Street in the week before July 15th; it was after the Court was over; it was the common talk; it was something I heard—I want to remove a wrong impression, I am here as a witness against my own will: as soon as Inspector Marshall heard this he started the case; the prisoner is not in the dock by my revenge; he is there by the police, through the subornation of perjury—I mean that I am not vindictive against the prisoner, but that this is a prosecution by the police, who wished to bring this man to justice in con<lb/>sequence of his having brought forward a false alibi—on my oath I did not communicate with the police before I went to Wilson and Wallace—I spoke to Mr. Wilson in confidence, and he said, "Yes, it is so"—I then gave information to the police, which led to this prosecution—I seriously ask these gentlemen to believe that with fifteen or sixteen years' experience I first learned on July 15th that a man who assists in a felony is himself liable—I did not think I was doing wrong if I carried out the orders of my master in a transaction which I found out afterwards to be dishonest—Mr. Clack had a cheque-book on the Imperial Bank at the commencement—they were of a whitish colour, and some were greenish—I swore more than once at the Police-court that the cheque which I saw in Mr. Clack's hands was on the Imperial Bank—there are two or three cheques on the Imperial Bank, and in one the word "Imperial" is crossed out with a red line, and the words "London Joint Stock" put in—I swore that the other cheque in his hands was on the Imperial Bank—I have got the receipt here—this is my signature, but I never witnessed Mrs. Gregg's signature to anything—I swore at the Police-court that it was not my signature, but was an imitation—I was being cross-examined when I was asked that, and I acknowledged that I had made a mistake—I was under the impression that it was an imitation of my signature—after swearing that I was shown a copy of the receipt, which I had copied myself on the same day after it had been signed—the copy was made to keep, the original was sent to Mr. Barron—it is since that document has been shown to me I have this day given this story about putting the signature after Mrs. Gregg had gone—I ratified my statement at the Police-court, but it was not taken down—I went back to the witness-box after I had signed my deposition, because I was recalled by the Magistrate, and I admitted that I had made a mistake, and what I said was not taken down—I said, "Yes, it is my signature"—what I said when I was recalled was taken down and read over, and signed by me—having stated such an important matter, I did not ask to have it put on the depositions, because I was taken by surprise; I had forgotten all about the transaction—</p>

The balance at the end of 1893 was 5s. 4d—I see a cheque drawn to self for £190—she borrowed £190 of the bank on securities in November, 1893, and this cheque was drawn two days after in one sum—previous to July, £300 was placed to her credit—roughly, the credit balance in November, prior to the loan, was about £30—by the end of the year the £300 and the £190 had been exhausted, and the £280 cheque had been exhausted, and there was a balance of 5s. 4d.—the audit balance in July, 1892, was about £60, and on March 1st this year about £20—we had given her a further loan of £60 in February, 1894—the next loan was £150, on March 20th, before which the account was overdrawn by £50—that was operated on by small cheques, the largest of which was £30—there was another loan of £100 in May—the balance in June was £34, and at the end of July about £17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We held securities for a very much larger sum than Mrs. Clack ever required or borrowed—I should honour her draft up to £150, and not mark it "Not sufficient"—some of her dividends are payable in April and October; the interest on a mortgage is due in January and July—the entry of this £250 is noticeable in her pass-book; one of the securities we held was the lease of the house in Charles Street, Rutland Gate—that is in her own name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, of 59, Holborn Viaduct—I was instructed by the Solicitor to the Treasury to make a microscopical investigation of this cheque for £280, and I find in the top, bottom, and side margins traces of an adhesive snbstance, apparently gum; also in three places traces of paper of a much lighter colour, which has adhered to the cheque, and in other places, traces showing that the fine surface of this cheque had been removed apparently by some other substance, which has been detached from it—the paper which I found adhering to the cheque appears to have been torn from some other paper—I should describe the paper torn away as cream colour, similar to this cheque for £160 of the</p>

               <p>London Joint Stock Bank—one piece is adhering to the left margin, and has a scalloped edge similar to the edge of a cheque torn from the counter<lb/>foil—the size of the cheque is about the same—I have examined the £160 cheque, and the scallops are similar—they are a little larger in some cheques—the writing on the face of counterfoil 350 is apparently the same at that on the cheque for £160, the same coloured ink, and the same kind of pen—I should say that this writing on the back of the counterfoil is Mr. Clack's—it is the same coloured ink, but fainter; it is a lighter shade—the ink will come off if you blot it—I should say it is done with a finer pen; a steel pen, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is not the first time I have given evidence about gum—it does not appear as if some other cheque had stuck to it of its own volition—the appearance was not that of two cheques adhering by accident—if two cheques adhere accidently I should not anticipate their joining with mathematical symmetry—the appearances of this cheque are such as of a piece of paper having been placed on it. (<hi rend="italic">Placing the cheques on each other.</hi>) There is a margin of blue showing—the blue cheque is 1-16th of an inch longer than the other—there are several places in the cheque where there is no gum at all, but there is gum at each corner—the counterfoil, "Cancelled for cash on account of Mrs. G.," is written with the same ink and blotted—if it was blotted it would dry lighter.</p>

I was house and parlour-maid to Mrs. Clack, at 16, Charles Street, Rutland Gate, from January, 1893, to January, 1894,—I have since been parlour-maid at Twickenham—I am now a ladies' maid at Dorking—I remember Mrs. Gregg coming to Charles Street as a visitor when I was there—she frequently dined there with Mrs. Clack—on several occasions I have heard them speak as to money that was coming to Mrs. Gregg—I saw some bank-notes—I was in the house when they were paid to Mrs. Gregg by Mr. Clack—Mrs. Clack had been to the bank to fetch the notes, and she came back that afternoon about five o'clock—after that day I saw Mrs. Gregg at the house on several occa<lb/>sions—she afterwards dined there on several occasions with Mr. and Mrs. Clack, and sometimes with Mrs. Clack alone—when Mrs. Clack was alone with Mrs. Gregg she said, "I have money in reserve for you to the amount of £120"—I do not remember any reply</p>

               <p>—I heard several times after that that notes had been handed over to Mrs. Gregg—on several occasions I heard Mrs. Clack tell Mrs. Gregg she ought to take some little school; a school at Clapham wax spoken of most, to take pupils—Mrs. Clack also spoke to me about the money which Mrs. Gregg was to receive several times—Mrs. Clack managed the money matters in the house, saw to the payment of bills, and so on—I have seen her draw cheques for that purpose.</p>

Police!"—my wife said something; I rushed out—I saw a straw hat lying in the road—I picked it up and went to the corner, and found the prosecutor detaining the prisoner, who was trying to get away—he must have gone about twelve yards from where it occurred—I asked him what was the matter—the prosecutor said he was one of the men—I said, "Are you sure?"—he said, "Yes"—I sent for a constable, who came in about ten minutes—the prosecutor said he had lost his watch and chain—the prisoner threatened us both, and said he would do for me, break my b—face, or something to that effect, and threatened the prosecutor; is well—I could see that he had had a drop of drink; but he seemed worse when he got to the station.</p>

I keep the King's Oak, High Beech, Essex—on the afternoon of the 3rd August I saw the prisoner standing in Brick Lane with about a dozen men—when I got into Han-bury Street, which turns out of Brick Lane, I heard, "Up him now"—I looked sideways and saw the prisoner on my left-hand side in the act of striking me—two other men were about three steps further away; one taller and one shorter than the prisoner—he struck me on the nerves of the arm, and then grasped my watch and chain and pulled them out by force, and then pulled my shirt open to get my studs out—I tried to grasp him, and as I did so the tall man put his foot between mine and I fell—I ran after the prisoner through a brewery, and as soon as I came out of there I lost sight of him—I went directly to the police and gave informa<lb/>tion and told them how the man was dressed—a few days afterwards I received a telegram and went to the station—I was shown into the library, and when I was brought out there were about twelve men—I looked at them all, and the prisoner's eyes would not meet mine—when be tried the second time to get my studs I looked at his eyes and he seemed to squint, or to have something the matter with his eye—I had only that one chance of seeing his face—when at the station the prisoner did not look at me—I saw he had a blotch on his eye, and I told the sergeant to tell him to turn round that I might see his back, because I had more chance to see his back than his face on the day of the robbery—when I saw his back, and saw he had the same coat on, I identified him—I have no doubt he is the man—I did not see his face in Brick Lane—I value my watch at £25.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant manager to Messrs. Lock, Lancaster and Co., silver refiners, owners of the premises of Lock's Wharf, Limehouse—on Friday, 27th July, we had a quantity of silver in a safe on the premises; I think altogether there were ten pieces—the safe was in No. 2 Refinery—it was fastened by a Chubb lock, and a padlock on an iron door—it is a brick chamber—there was also a bar and a padlock—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of the interior of the room, and of the fastenings—there is no window—I saw the silver there just as it was thrown in a heap before it is cold—it was thrown in on the Friday evening, the 27th, about five o'clock—I fastened the door myself at 5.30—there is a small iron ledge, which comes up about three inches from the floor, and the door closes against it, so that nothing can get in or out under the door—there is calcined bone-dust used, to prevent the silver adhering to the iron mould—it is used in the refinery, and there was some on the floor of this room—it adheres to the silver—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the blocks of silver in the rough as they come out of the mould—the dust is not like whitewash—I put the keys in my pocket at 5.30, and kept them there till eight at night—I then received the keys of the outer door of the refinery from the foreman, also the keys of the door leading from the refinery to the engine-house, and I placed them with the other keys and put them all in the pocket of an old coat in a wardrobe in the inner office—I then locked the wardrobe door and left the key in the door, and locked the office door and took the key away with me in my pocket—it was my practice to leave the keys in the coat until the Monday; the office is a place in the yard, not difficult to get at—next morning, Saturday, the 28th, I arrived at the works at 9.30, and remained about the works; about eleven I was in the office and about the works—I went away then and came back at 2.30, and remained till four, when I finally left; everything to all appearance was all right then—I had locked the door at 11.10, and it remained locked till 2.30—when I left at four I locked the office and placed the key in an envelope, sealed it, and addressed it to Elliott, the foreman, and left it with the watchman, Holtoun at the gate in the Bridge Road—he does not live there; he was there twelve hours—he was day watchman, and</p>

               <p>was on duty from six in the morning till six at night; bat on this occasion he came on duty at six, and remained, he had orders to do so—the Saturday was a holiday to the employes, and their beanfeast, and there were only about eight men there up till about 2.30 in the afternoon—they would all leave then, but they would leave three men behind, the gate-man and two firemen, to look after the fires; the furnaces are kept going all night—I was not there at all on Sunday; I came back on Monday morning, the 30th, at 9.30—I then received information, and in con<lb/>sequence I went to No. 2 refinery and to the safe—I found four blocks of silver missing; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of them—the four would repre<lb/>sent about 7,000 or 8,000 ounces of fine silver, worth about £1,200 sterling—the door of the safe was closed, but not locked—the police were communicated with, and officers came and made inquiries—I examined the door and found both the Chubb's lock and the padlock were broken—I did not notice at the time the way in which they had been broken—they were afterwards seen by an expert—I examined the doors of the refinery to see how access had been obtained; I placed my finger between the door-post and the door, and shot the bolt back; I could then get into the refinery—there is a lock on the top of the door, and a bolt at the bottom; the door was in halves—this is a photograph of the outside door of the refinery; it is like a stable door, in two parts—I did not lock that door when I went away on the Saturday; the foreman did. (<hi rend="italic">A plan was put in, and the witness explained on it the position of the doors</hi>)—I do not know any of the Browns—I know "White, as a night watchman employed by Mr. Drew, a lighterman, to watch the craft moored at Lock's wharf—we employ Mr. Drew—he works for other persons as well—White should only pass backwards and forwards to the barges—he had nothing to do with the works, his business would be at the river; he had no business in our yard—when on duty he could come in at Bridge Road and go down to the quay, and he would leave in the same way—there is a slipway on the other side of the coal stores, and from there you can get to the front gate, to Bridge Road, leading out of Limehouse—when I went into the strong room on that morning I saw Sergeant Dicker pick a button off the floor—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I found the keys where I had left them, in the pocket of an old coat—the office door, which had been secured, was open when I got there—the foreman had opened it—the wardrobe key was still there, as I had left it—I think it was unlocked, but I will not be quite positive—I did not examine it—I found the keys of the Chubb lock and the padlock as I had left them, but not the other keys with them, as the watchman had taken them out to unlock the refinery—it would be the watchman's duty to give them to the foreman—this photograph shows the position of the silver and the missing bare—there were ten pieces altogether, thrown in a heap; this shows the position they would be in the moulds, as they are run out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUIR</hi>. I have been in the habit of keeping the keys in the coat pocket when I have had charge of the works from Saturday to Monday—I have done that for three months preceding the robbery, when the manager was ill—there was a robbery from this refinery about eighteen months ago—the manager, Mr. Borden, then had charge of the keys—I don't know where they were kept then; I suppose in his pocket; I don't know for certain—I could not say that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189409100084"/>
               <p>that robbery was effected by means of the keys—I know there was a robbery, but I can't say how it was effected; I was not there at the time—two lads, Davy and Boyne, were employed in the office besides me, and also young Mr. Lancaster, one of the firm—there is only one office, but there is a partition from the front to the back—none of those persons would know where the keys were kept, not even young Mr. Lancaster; the two foremen would know, William Howe and Phillip Elliott—Elliott was the one with whom I left the sealed envelope; it was sealed with the firm's seal, in wax—I did not examine the office door on the Monday; nor did anyone that I am aware of—I could not say who arrived first on the Monday morning—I was there all night on Monday; the office was open all night—I believe it was locked on Tuesday evening; it was my habit to do it—I could not swear that I did—I have locked it many times since—I did not find anything wrong with the lock or any damage to the door—the outer gates are eight or nine feet high; a person could climb over—they are secured by padlock on the inside—the place is never left; a watchman is always supposed to be on the premises—there is a small wicket which is always locked from the outside—from the wicket a person could reach the padlock and undo the gates; there are always furnacemen there—a person on the outside could get over from the water side by climbing the fence—there is a heap of coals on each side of the fence, which they could get over into the works; they would then have to get into the office—as far as I know they must have got in with a key—there is only that one key which I left sealed in the envelope; with that key they could get into the lower door of the refinery; that is the door which could be opened with the finger; the bolt of that door is visible from the outside—then they would have to get into the strong room—I think the person must have known the place—there was one unlocked door between the engine-house and the refinery—it was reported to me that that door was unlocked; it was found open, and the padlock on the ground; that was the one close by the safe—it was Howe's duty to lock that door; the key was not left in the padlock; that door would give access to the strong room, but it was locked inside—Howe had possession of that key; there were two keys to that padlock; the other key would be on the same bunch as the key of the safe, in the old coat pocket—there is a sliding door which leads from the engine-room into the works; that was left open; that engine-room adjoins No. 2 refinery—there are no furnaces in that room; they were not going; they were idle—that door was left open for the men who were repairing, going in for their tools; there would be no one there that night—no unnecessary doors were opened—I think the robbery was effected by someone acquainted with the premises—I do not know any of the Browns or Tagg—about 90 or 100 men are employed on the works; I daresay fifty or sixty of them would know the situation of the silver in this room; it may be more—from what I saw of the premises on the Saturday I think they were safe then—Holtom was the watchman on duty at four on the Saturday afternoon; the man to whom I gave the envelope—he would go off duty at six in the evening; he would be relieved by Bamford, the night watchman, but he was not on duty that night—Holtom was ordered to be there all night—when he came off duty I gave him instructions to remain, as</p>

               <p>Bamford was away on holiday till six on Sunday evening, when he would relieve Holtom—the two furnacemen would be there after four on Saturday, and they would be relieved by two others at six on Sunday evening—I do not remember asking Holtom for any explanation about the key of the office—he was not called as a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SHERWOOD</hi>. I know White as a watchman passing through the works for the past six or seven months—he was not employed by us, but by Mr. Drew—he moors the craft at our wharf for our goods, and for others; he is in a responsible position—he has to watch the craft moored there; that is all I know—he usually arrived at the wharf about two on Saturday, and usually remained there till Monday—he would have a cabin—after the discovery our inquiry went upon the footing that the entry was made by breaking the locks—the expert was called in, I think, on the Monday—I think I heard on the Monday that he was of opinion that keys had been used; I heard it from himself on the Tuesday, and his opinion was taken—until the expert came we thought that the doors had been smashed open—I considered that the keys were in a place of safety, because no one but the two foremen and myself knew where they were kept—I don't remember questioning Howe and Elliott with reference to the keys—the first thing I did was to inquire of Elliott whether he had received the key of the office in the sealed envelope; he said he had—I did not ask Howe for any explanation—I asked the men to account for themselves and they did; they gave me satisfactory answers—Holtom did not know where the keys were—the sealing of the key was not a regular proceeding, it was exceptional—I don't remember doing it before; I had placed it in an envelope, but not sealed it, only with gum; that is, when I have not handed it to the foreman my<lb/>self—I sealed it on this occasion because I had to leave it with the watch<lb/>man overnight, and the foreman would not be there till eight on the Sunday morning—in the meantime the envelope would remain in Holtom's custody.</p>

I came up the yard to the water-pipe near the watch-box, I then spoke to Holtoun. I heard a row outside the gate. Neither Holtoun nor myself went outside, but, looking through the pigeon-hole, I saw that there were three persons—two males, one female. One was the man we call Jerry, a labourer in the firm; the other man and his wife. I could not catch what the quarrel was about. The three went in the direction of Millwall. I returned to the craft, remained there till about three a.m., then came up the yard, went up on the stage, and spoke to both Larkin and Woodcock. We were speaking about them having their work well forward. I stayed with them about forty minutes on and off. I then went back to the craft, pumped the barges out, came back into the yard at 4.55 a.m., spoke to Larkin and Woodcock, went to the gate, spoke to Holtoun, and went out to the coffee-shop in Emmot Street; it was not open. I walked about Three Colt Street till 5.30; then met a lighterman, who told me he had picked up one of Mr. Creed's barges adrift. While we were talking, the man who used to work for the Regent's Canal Company at the little lock came up and joined us. We then went into the coffee-shop; had breakfast They stopped at the coffee-shop. I returned to the yard; was admitted by Holtoun. This was just after six a.m. Larkin and Woodcock were then about to leave the yard. I went to the barges, connected the spelter and bars of lead, came back to the gate, met Speed coming in, returned to the furnaces with Speed, walked round the yard, and about 8.30 a.m. Mr. Elliott and Mr. Tyler came in and Webb. I assisted them to lift the test into the furnace. This brought us on to nine a.m., Sunday. I then left the yard. Holtoun was still at the gate. I went to the Burdett Road, and returned to the yard at 10.45 a.m. I passed through the gate. Holtoun was at the gate. I stopped in the works and the craft till 8.50 p.m., Sunday; left for ten minutes, went to City Arms, had a drink,</p>

               <p>returned to the premises, and stayed till 7 a.m., Monday. I left the gates. Holtoun was then on duty. I heard no unusual noise on any night. Any noise can be easily heard. My wife called and kicked at the gate about 11.30 p.m., Saturday. This could be easily heard. De Hitter's men were working all night in the boiler-house Saturday night. During my employ<lb/>ment at the firm I have not at any time been in this first refinery room, except on one occasion about five or six weeks ago. This was when I assisted Elliott, Bamford, Webb, and Tyler. I don't know where the safe is. I do not know where the silver is kept.—(Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WILLIAM WHITE</hi>.")—from the 30th July I was making inquiries with reference to this robbery, assisted by other members of the force—at the time White made this statement I asked him to take his coat off; he did so, and I have it here—I saw that two buttons were off the coat—I asked him to leave the room, while I and Mr. Hallett examined it—when he was afterwards arrested, on 15th August, I saw that three buttons were off, and only one left—he was not wearing this coat then; I found it in his house—he was wearing it when the statement was made, and it was returned to him without comment—I did not tell him that a button was found in the refinery—on Sunday morning, 5th August, I called at his house and said to him, "I have called respecting the statement you made on Mon<lb/>day; some of the silver has been traced and recovered; you will now be detained, pending inquiries"—he made no reply—he was not charged at that time—I took him to the Police-station—I there examined the coat, and I said, "White, when I took your examination on Monday there were two buttons on it, there is only one now"—he said, "Yes, one came off yesterday"—I said, "When we examined the safe on Monday we found a button inside, and on comparing it with your coat, we found it matched"—he said, "You know there are more buttons than one, sir"—that was all he said—when I first saw the coat, on 30th July, I did not notice any marks of white upon it, nor on his arrest—he was charged about a quarter to seven on that night, with Henry Brown and Tagg, who had been previously arrested and detained in the waiting-room—Henry Brown sent me a message—I went to him—he said he wished to show me where some of the silver was buried, and to make a statement—I took him to 28, Salter Street, Limehouse—that would be between 500 or 600 yards from the prosecutors' premises—it is a dwelling-house in the occupation of the father of the Browns, a builder—adjoining the dwelling-house there is a railway arch, used as a workshop, leased with the house, and forming part of it—the soils live in the house and the father lives somewhere else—going to the house with Henry Brown we passed through it into the railway arch, and he pointed out a place to me; some police officers were already there—on digging at the place pointed out one of these blocks of silver was taken out; it was in about the centre of the arch—one piece had been already found in the same arch, and was then at the Police-station—on finding the second piece I went back with Henry Brown to the Police-station, and he then made a statement which I took down, and he signed it—I witnessed it—this is it.

               <p>workshop; the door is in South Street. Two labouring looking men came up pulling a costermonger's barrow. The tallest tapped me on the shoulder, and said, 'Hi, cock, do you mind putting this under the ground in the shop for a few days, and we will call for it some day next week.' I said, 'What stuff is it?' I lifted a cement sack which was on the barrow, and then saw the two blocks of metal. I said, 'What is this?' he said, 'It is only some lead.' I said, 'It is funny-looking lead.' I felt it, and found that it was too hard for lead. I said, 'It is too brittle for lead.' He said, 'Oh, it is all right, it is only a kind of pewter mixed with it; that's what makes it look so brittle.' Each of the men then carried one of the blocks into the shop, and dropped them on the ground. The tall man then gave me a sovereign, and said, 'Here, cock, take this; give your mate half; we will spare you more next week when we come for it.' I then dug a hole in the ground immediately under the doorway of an inner door, and rolled the block over and over into the hole. Tagg helped me to dig the hole. When I was covering the block over with earth, the tall man said, 'That's not deep enough.' Tagg then went on to the w.c. I then tilted the block out of the hole, and dug it deeper. The hole was then about two feet deep. The tall man said, 'That will do.' I then tilted the block into the hole again, and shovelled the earth over it, and two pieces of stone slabs on top. The man then got some sand that was in the shop; the sand was wet. He got a trowel from the bench, and with it he pressed the sand round the stones, and shook some cement from our bags over the sand and stones, so as to make it set hard, and not look suspicious. He then said, 'Bury this one over in that corner,' pointing to near my father's tool chest. I said, 'No, I won't put it there, it is too near my father's tool chest. If anything is wrong they would blame ray father for it.' The little one said, 'Come to that you can put it inside the chest; there is no harm in it; nobody will come here for it.' I said, 'No, I will put it down here; if you don't like that you can take it away again.' He said, 'Oh, all right, put it there then.' I then dug the second hole nearly in the centre of the shop, and tilted the block into it, covered it over with the earth, and trod it down. The tall man then said, 'Now, mind what I have told you; if you tell any<lb/>body, don't you put your foot outside the door no more, because I know you.' He then said to the other man, 'Come on, Jim let us clear away sharp.' He said to me, 'Good morning, cock; shut the door after us.' They then left the shop, and pushed the barrow down the street. Between the time of digging the first hole and the second I went to the Warrior beer-house, Limehouse Causeway. The man we call Pooley was standing at the door. I asked him for change of the sovereign. He gave me silver. I went back, and gave Tagg ten shillings. He said, 'Do you think it is all right?' 'I said,' I don't know what to think shan't tell father.' I have not seen the men since, but I had seen the tall man previously about Lime house Pier. I first heard of the silver being stolen on Thursday, and then thought that what we had buried in the shop was the silver. When I saw the reward bills on Saturday, I said to Tagg, 'That's right enough, that's them what we have got under there,' speaking of the two blocks. Tagg then said, 'I'll have nothing to do with it.' The police came at 3.30 a.m. this day, and arrested Tagg, my brother-in-law, Andrew Street, my two brothers, Samuel and Alfred, and myself.</p>

               <p>Sergeant Lambert told me I was arrested, concerned in stealing the silver. I made no reply. What I have now said is the truth. I have said this to clear my father and brothers, because they know nothing about it. The description of the men is as follows:—First: Age forty to forty-five; height five feet ten inches; complexion, hair, moustache and side whiskers dark; dress, cord trousers and vest, black diagonal cloth coat turning green, P. and O. peak cap broken in two, heavy boots, dirty appearance. Second: Age, twenty-five; height, five feet seven inches; complexion and small moustache, fair; hair, brown; dress, grey trousers, melton coat and vest, heavy boots, black felt hat, respectable appearance. (Signed) H. Brown.")—This was on the Sunday night—he was not alone when he made it—I think other officers were in the room—on the Monday Tagg desired to make a statement—he did so, and I took it down, and produce it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The statement that I now make is a voluntary one. My name is Walter Tagg. I have been sleeping at 28, Salter Street, for about one week. On Sunday, 29th July, 1894, about 10 a.m., Henry Brown and myself were standing at the gate of the shop in South Street. Two men came up with a barrow, and said, 'Cock, do you want to earn a sovereign?' We said, 'What for?' The tallest man said, "To hide this away for us.' I said to Henry, 'Shall I dig a hole?' Henry said, 'Yes,' and we both helped to dig a hole under the doorway. We then dug another near the grindstone. I went to the w.c. I could just see the corner of one of the blocks of metal under a sack on the barrow. When I returned from the w.c. I saw that the barrow was empty, and that both holes had been filled in. I saw one of the men give Henry the sovereign. He ran up the Causeway to change it, He came back, and gave me half a sovereign in gold. On leaving the yard they both said, 'We will come back next week for the stuff. Keep it quiet; don't tell anyone; we will give you another sovereign when we come for the stuff.' They then went away. I changed my half-sovereign at the Sports public-house when they opened at one p.m.; Henry and I went in together. We each had half a pint of ale. I have not seen the men since. I had never seen them before. I did not know about the robbery of the silver till I saw the reward bill up in Single's window in Limehouse Causeway. I read the bill, and it then came into my head that the stuff that the men brought to the shed was the silver that had been stolen. I went to 28, Salter Street, saw Henry, told him that I had seen the reward bill about some stolen silver, and that I thought that the stuff we had in the shed was the silver. We never said any<lb/>thing to anybody about it. When the men brought it they told us it was lead. We then thought there was no harm in it. When I was arrested I did not tell the police about it. The description of the men is as follows:—First: Age, about thirty; height, five feet eleven inches; complexion, hair and moustache, dark. I cannot say how he was dressed. He had a dirty appearance. Second: Age, about twenty-six; height, five feet six inches; complexion, hair and slight moustache, fair. I did not notice his dress. He had the appearance of a labourer.

What business had he in the Railway Tavern at eleven on Saturday night, when the two furnace<lb/>men had to get over the gate?"—that was all he said—I saw no button similar to the one found in the safe among the workmen at the prosecutors' premises—the father of the Browns was taken into custody on Sunday morning, the 5th, and was detained for some time in the same waiting-room as the three sons and Tagg—he was afterwards taken before the Magistrate and discharged—there was a formal remand for a week—he was on bail, then the case against him was withdrawn.</p>

When in making their statements the prisoners ran on I stopped them, as I wanted it in narrative order—White's statement was a pretty full one, full of details—on the Monday and the following days I took a dozen statements or more—White was arrested on the following Sunday—I had seen him during that interval of a week; the thing was being talked about during that week in that part of the world, and there would be rumours that someone had made a statement, and someone else another statement—I cannot say if it was known that the gateman had been absent from his duty on the Saturday evening—White said he had been when he was charged—White would know it if he had seen him, or if Holtoun had told him—the two furnace-men knew he was away—I called the workmen in separately, and took their statements—I went to the premises at ten a.m. on Monday, and did not leave till I had got all their statements the following morning—when I charged White, the present prisoners and Brown, the father, were under arrest—six people were in the room—White having made a full statement the week previous, said, "Aren't you going to fetch any more in?"—I cannot say if he knew that a good many people had been under sus<lb/>picion, and that some had been arrested; that was all he said—I did not notice the tone in which he said it; the sarcasm did not irritate me—there is now only one button on his coat—on his waistcoat there are a different kind of button; three buttons are missing—there were two buttons on his coat when I arrested him, and when I gave his coat back to him—the top button had gone by the following Sunday—when I arrested him he was wearing a better coat, which he has on now—it was</p>

I know who did so"—Tagg said nothing—the Browns were detained together in the same room at the station—at seven the same Sunday morning I arrested Brown, the father—about eight o'clock that evening Samuel Brown said to me, "Mr. Lambert, you are not going to detain father, are you?"

                  </hi>. I am secretary of the Actors' Benevolent Fund, 8, Adam Street, Strand—I received this letter in May: "Post Office, Northampton. Dear Sir,—Enclosed you will find a short application for assistance from the late Mr. Austin Ainslie, who left us all stranded fifteen miles from here; we walked here, and the ladies pawned their articles to obtain the means of getting away, and ask for assistance; we came here with <hi rend="italic">busking</hi>, but we cannot stoop to that.—<hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT BARTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">busking</hi> means singing in public-houses—I believed that representation, and sent ten shillings to the writer, for which I received a receipt, and forwarded a form of application, which I received back, tilled up, with this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had had a loan from the fund, and just as he hoped to pull himself round, lie was robbed, and promising to repay every farthing.</hi>)—I knew that he had written to Mr. Allen Beaumont—I received the form of application, filled up and signed, "Robert Barton." (<hi rend="italic">This stated: "Married, five children, ages from eight to one; absolutely penni<lb/>less.

(<hi rend="italic">Signed, "Austin Ainslie</hi>")—he wrote it in my presence on the Saturday when I went to pay the money—I paid him three guineas; he wanted more, but he came down to £3 3s.—if I had not believed his statements I would not have let my daughter go, or paid the money—I fetched my daughter in May; he had left her and two more of the com<lb/>pany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I swore an information at the Police-court, and told all the material facts upon which I relied—I afterwards went before a Magistrate, and told my story—Mr. Safford examined me at the Police-court—I have seen a solicitor—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said that his wife always went with him—I paid the £3 3s. because she had never been on the stage before, and he was to give her lessons—another man was sitting at a table, and I guessed that that was his partner, but the prisoner did not say so—I made inquiries, and found he left his partner starving—he is not here, be ought to be; he is the principal one—I asked him if he was genuine—he took my hand and said, "On my oath, Mrs. Taylor; I would not disgrace my father's name."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had performances at Rushton, Hesenborough, and Wellingborough, and several rehearsals at Northampton—I suppose ail the others were amateurs; they did not seem like professionals—I did not act better than they did—I do not know whether Mr. Butler was a professional; he said he was, but he had only been a baggage man—he was to find the scenery, and there was a row because it was not forth<lb/>coming—at the rehearsals the prisoner directed me where I was wrong—we went round till all our money was exhausted; there were no profits—the prisoner walked on to Northampton the day before, and when we got there, he and some others went out and got money to pay our fares back by singing at public-houses—what money there was was given to me, be<lb/>cause I was housekeeper—when there were any meals we all shared them together—as far as I could see, he was as hard up as I was—when the first application was sent up we were all together in a room, and all with<lb/>out a penny in our pockets—we all signed it—I knew nothing about the association, unless he had told me—10s. each was sent to us—I gave up the 10s. to pay the landlady—we gave him the 10s., and he gave us 5s. or 2s. 6d. each, I forget which.</p>

You told me your wife was in London, and she came into the theatre with you to<lb/>night"—he said, "That was not my wife"—I got out of temper with him and said, "You are advertising to take a company round England," referring to an advertisement I had seen: "Wanted, full company, with few exceptions.

I am the wife of William Scotney, a labourer, and live at 77, Cooper Road, Barking Road, near the Custom House—the prisoner is my daughter—she has been married to the deceased nine years—she had four children; two are buried—her husband was a stevedore—he was very slack of work, and was very much in the habit of drinking—they had two rooms in my house—she started work, but had not done any for a long time—he would not let her go to work—they lived on his earnings, with my help—on Monday, 30th July, he came home to dinner about half-past twelve; I was in the kitchen—I saw him go upstairs; the prisoner was with him—he went out about five minutes to one—she was then at home—she went out a little after two—she said she was going to take the children for a little walk—she took them with her—it must have been past three when she came home with the children—she said, "There are fine goings on with Mr.<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> and Mr. Green at the Pea<lb/>cock with some women"—she called her husband Mr.<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—she went and knocked at Mrs. Green's door, which is next to ours; but she said she was out—she stayed on for a little while, and went "upstairs—about four she went out, taking the two children with her—that was the last I saw of her—I was afterwards sent for to the station, where she was locked up—she and her husband lived very unhappily together—he used to say he did not want her; she was to clear out; he had got somebody else to mind his children.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Two knives produced</hi>)—it was neither of these—she put it back in her pocket—I then went away to my husband, who was standing outside the Peacock; he had been in the Albert—I left her standing outside the public-house—her husband was out of sight at the time—I went into the Peacock and had a glass of ale with my husband—while I was there the prisoner came into another compartment, the second from where I was—I had just gone in; it was about ten minutes to seven when I went in—I don't know whether she had her children with her then; I could not see—I drank my beer and went home—my husband and I remained in the first public-house I daresay fifty minutes—I left him there and went home—I saw the prisoner again at five minutes to nine in custody of a constable at the corner of the street—she did not speak to me—she spoke to a woman at the corner, and said, "I have done for my husband.

Re<lb/>venge is sweet"—he never opened his mouth till the last blow—he said, "Oh!"—he put up his right hand and wrenched the knife out of her hand—I saw the knife in his hand after she had done it, and he stag<lb/>gered towards the footpath and fell—I went up to him—his hand was in his right pocket when I lifted him—he fell on his knees and on his face—I opened his waistcoat and saw the blood—the prisoner was standing quite close to us, with the child in her arms—other people came up—I saw two knives found on the deceased—one of the knives produced is like the one the prisoner used.</p>

I am a boiler maker, and reside at the Custom House—I was in company with the last witness on the evening of the 30th July going up Freemasons' Road towards the Custom House—it was a quarter to eight certain by my watch—I saw the prisoner and deceased—they were going towards the public park and we were coming from it, meeting them—I saw her step back and lift her right hand and strike him twice on the left shoulder—he then turned round from towards her and walked backwards out on to the middle of the road—she followed him up and struck him, and said, "I will kill you; I mean it. Revenge is sweet"—she still followed him up and struck him twice on the left breast—she was facing him when she did that; he was going backwards all the time to prevent her from doing damage if he could possibly help it—I saw a knife in her hand—I was sufficiently near to see what kind of knife it was—it was either a dark brown or a black handled knife—this was about it. (<hi rend="italic">One of those produced</hi>)—before the first blow was struck I had just observed them going on the footpath—if there were any words between them, we could not make anything out; they must have been very low—after he was struck he wrenched the knife from her hand and walked down the road a little bit, and then staggered over on to the foot-path and fell—Barclay went and lifted him up—a few children gathered round—Barclay and I were the only two men about at the time it hap<lb/>pened—the prisoner wanted to get into the crowd to her husband; she was kept out of the crowd—whether she was sorry or not I don't know—I don't remember any words she said—Barclay and I followed her down the road until we met a constable, and we spoke to him—she had two children with her, one on her left arm and the other at her side—she had the child in her arms when she inflicted the blows, and when she went away—I did not keep notice of the other child; I wanted to get hold of her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I reckon I was about three or four yards away from them when I first met them—it was exactly after I first saw them that the blows were struck—I could not see what took place before; I can't say whether there was any quarrel—they were going towards the park, and it was just as we were coming off from the middle of the road and were crossing over to the footpath that we saw them—when he fell he fell on his knees as far as I could make out, and then he fell back<lb/>wards; I did not see him fall forwards—the prisoner seemed very much excited—she held the child in this manner, and then struck at once—the child appeared to be about two years old, a good-sized child—when the man fell I did not see him do anything with his hand—the second</p>

               <p>blow was in the middle of the road—he wrenched the knife from her hand, turned his back, and fell as he was getting on the footpath—he took the knife from her, where he put it I could not say—he did not seem to me to be the worse for drink—he was an ordinary sized man—he was walking backwards as she came towards him, trying to save himself—he could see her coming towards him—I saw this going on for two or three minutes—we did not think the thing was serious—if we had thought so, we had time to interfere.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 79, Hooper's Road, next door but one to the deceased—I knew him as a neighbour—I am a boiler's assistant—on 30th July I met the deceased in Freemasons' Road, about half-past two—a man named Hitchcock was with him—we walked together for some time—we met two women, friends of mine, and we all five went into the Peacock and had some drink—I did not see the prisoner there at that time—we then left the public-house and went into the park—that would be about three—I remained with the deceased till about half-past four—I left him at the top of Hooper's Road and Freemasons' Road—I saw him next, about half past eight, at the top of Hooper's Road; that was after he had been stabbed, when the constable was taking him away in a little pony trap—I saw the prisoner about the same time at the corner of Garvery Road, at a milk shop nearly opposite Hooper's Road; she was carrying a child in her arms—I had heard something, and I said to her, "Whatever is the matter?"—she said, "Mr. Green, whatever shall I do?"—I said, "The best thing you can do is to go home"—I took the child from her arms, and with the other hand I took hold of her arm and walked her down Hooper's Road, when I was overtaken by police-constable Kronk, and he said he would have to take her into custody—during the time I was in the deceased's company that afternoon he had not spoken to his wife at all that I am aware of—I had not noticed her or spoken to her at all that afternoon.</p>

On 30th July I was house surgeon at the Seamen's Hospital, when the deceased was brought there about five minutes to nine—he was in a state of extreme collapse—after a time he became perfectly conscious—I found a punctured wound on the left breast, over the region of the heart, half an inch in length—I noticed a small spur on the left side of the wound—on the back of the left side, over the region of the left shoulder-blade, was another stab wound, about the same length, and a very little higher up in the same region was a mere abrasion, of no depth whatever; it might have been a blow, or anything, certainly not a stab wound; merely a superficial abrasion, it did not penetrate beneath the skin—the only other mark was a bruise on the forehead, which might have been caused by falling down—he died on Wednesday 1st August, at 4.50 p.m.—I made a post-mortem on the 2nd—I found that the chest stab had pierced the chest wall and the pericardium, and had also pierced the heart, going right through the right ventricle into the opposite wall—in my opinion the cause of death was the stab that pierced the heart, allowing the effusion of blood into the peritoneum sac—there were marks on the clothes corresponding with the wounds—there must have been a considerable amount of force to go through all the clothing, and to such a depth—that only applies to the two wounds, not to the abrasion—I think the wounds might have been caused by either of the two knives—I saw both of them shortly afterwards, and fitted both into the heart—one is called a scrivener's knife, the other is an ordinary penknife—the scrivener's knife fitted better than the other.</p>

I must do something"—I said, "I cannot help you; if you want to sell anything I will help you"—he said he had no time to sell anything—I said be should go to the dealers in the neighbourhood; he said there was not time, as it was the last day—I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "Some furniture, and some flour, and fittings and tools"—he asked me to buy the flour—I asked him to produce the receipts for it, and he showed them to me—I wrote to the people asking whether they were true—I bought the flour for ten guineas, paying him in notes and gold—I took a man to see the flour, and I asked the prisoner whether that was it, and he said it was—this is the receipt he signed—I said I should move the flour away—he said, "Where are you going to move it?"—I said I should get a room or something to pat it in till I could sell it—he said,</p>

               <p>at first refuse to sign what I had written; he did not say, "I will sign a receipt for ten guineas, but I will not sell that flour"—he talked the matter over—the suggestion of 24s. for six week's rent came from me—I did not come to him two days afterwards and ask him to buy the flour out<lb/>right—two days afterwards he came to my office—I did not ask him to buy it and say I would give him £2; he wanted me to buy the fixtures of his shop.</p>

I lived at 556, Old Kent Road—on 22nd July, at half-past three, I was riding a bicycle along the Eltham Road, and noticed a haystack in flames in a field about 200 yards from the road—I saw the two prisoners in the field running away from the stack towards the road—I got off my bicycle, and got over the hedge into the field—Hope was running behind Marriner, and said, "Stop him, he did it"—I stopped Marriner—Hope came up, and said, "Marriner asked me for a match; I asked him what for, and he said, 'Suppose we set this stack alight?' I said, 'I sha'n't help you,' and he said, 'If you don't, I will'"—Marriner heard him say this; he said nothing, he was very quiet—I noticed that the lining of Hope's coat was smouldering—he said that he had tried to put it out when Marriner started to fire it; he had the coat in his hand—Mills came up, and I got on my bicycle to go for assistance, but another cyclist was before me.</p>

I said, 'No, don't you do that; you will get into a row if you do Hope struck a match and lit some hay on the ground, and then threw the match on to the stack, and in a minute it was in flames.

On August 23rd I went to this lodging-house, and saw Hicks—on the evening of the 7th I took O'Connor; he was very drunk—I found on him a cake of soap, twelve pieces of paper, and some songs—he said, "I have got the b—money, but I cannot find it."</p>

                  </hi>. On August 2nd, O'Connor came upstairs blowing a policeman's whistle, and asked me if I was coming out to have a drink—I was in bed, and the door was open, I can never shut it properly—I do not know Darkey's name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by O'Connor.</hi> On Tuesday morning, August 21st, I saw you washing yourself, and you lent me a piece of brown soap—I should not recognise it—you were not sleeping there on the night the robbery came off—I get my living on the streets.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">O'Connor's defence.</hi> I have got a memorandum of the Dock Company to prove that I am getting an honest living. When I was arrested a piece of soap was found in my pocket, which I always carry for washing myself. The finger marks could be made by anybody. This woman has been living with Hicks, and I ask you not to believe her. She gave her name as Amy Hicks at the Police-court; she has done several terms of im<lb/>prisonment. She had to run away from Notting Hill because she had done a robbery there. Can it be possible that she could see the police<lb/>man's whistle or coat in my coat that morning? Hicks sent her to pawn the coat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say to you, "Stop that man running; he has broken into a house"—I saw you jump from the garden of 32 to the garden of 30—I saw you come from the door ten feet off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 139, Battersea Park Road—on August 1st, about ten p.m., I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Trevick chasing him—I made a rush for him, and he struck at me—he afterwards said, "We are only having a lark, just racing round here; what the hell are you stopping me for?"—the other witness came up, and said it was all right—I misunderstood him, and let go of the prisoner, and he ran away again—Mr. Trevick said he was a burglar, and I gave chase, and caught him again—he struggled very hard—I detained him, and took him towards the station—he tried to slip out of his coat two or three times, but I kept him till he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw no man running in front of you—there were lamps along the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners defence.</hi> If I was in front of him how can he identify me? I daresay he thinks of getting a bit from the man whose house he was taking care of. He may be right in saying he saw two men, because I saw a man running in front of me. When he said, "Stop that man" I gave chase.</p>
