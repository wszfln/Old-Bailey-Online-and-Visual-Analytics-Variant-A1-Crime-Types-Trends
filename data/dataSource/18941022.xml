                  </hi>. I lived at 47, Poland Street, Oxford Street, in the early part of 1887, and was a jeweller—I was then introduced to the prisoner by Mr. Verges—I had a conversation with the prisoner, and as the result of that I produced some articles—the prisoner purchased a diamond necklet from me; I forget the price—the prisoner gave me a</p>

               <p>bill for about £200, and most likely a cheque—I have not got the docu<lb/>ments—my solicitors, Messrs. Collyer, are not going on with this prosecu<lb/>tion because I did not want to spend more money; they sent me this letter—the bill and cheque were dishonoured when I presented them—Messrs. Collyer have the documents—the dishonoured bill and cheque were with reference to the diamond necklet—later in the year I sold the prisoner other articles, among them a pair of links; I don't remember what else—I have not looked at the evidence I gave before the Police-court eight years ago—I alleged that he had stolen about £200 worth of property from me; I don't think it was £570—I might have charged him with getting the diamond necklet by fraud by means of the cheque and bill—I did not charge him with either robbing or defrauding me of goods worth £573 altogether; there were two separate transactions—he obtained a pendant and two pairs of earrings, I believe—I have seen the prisoner three times since; I don't think I have spoken to him—I had an interview with him at his office in Seething Lane—I had previously asked him for payment—I went to Seething Lane most likely to get payment for part of the money he owed me—I did not get it—I most likely asked him for payment—ultimately I gave him a diamond pendant and two pairs of earrings to sell, I think, to Mr. Bellairs, and if not sold to him to be returned to me—the value of those things was about £180—I don't know if the prisoner said anything to me then about Mr. Bellairs, who was a well-known man—I was to get my goods back two or three days afterwards—at the end of that time I called at his office; I got neither goods nor money—I don't remember what he said, it is so long ago—I don't know how the name of Bircham, the solicitors, came to be mentioned—I pressed the prisoner for money, and could not get it—then I gave the jewellery to the prisoner to sell to Mr. Bellairs, as he would get a certain amount of profit out of it—when I called on the prisoner after the two or three days, he said he had had no answer about the goods; he had not been able to see his man, or something similar to that—I saw him again a few days afterwards, but got neither the articles nor the money—I next saw the articles at Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's, in Fleet Street, and at Messrs. Dobree's—when I found they had been pawned, I went to the solicitor's and issued a warrant—I was inquiring at the pawnbroker's for other goods that had been pawned by four or five other people—the prisoner was arrested and brought to the Mansion House, on the charge of obtaining goods by false pretences—the prisoner only had the goods to show to his particular friend—no one else was at his office when I saw him on 18th May, and when I gave him the things—I did not, to my knowledge, authorise him to go to pawnbrokers' shops.</p>

I did not go inside; I was watching outside. I did not see the others come out"—on the charge being read to him he said, "Yes, that is quite right. It was only extreme poverty that compelled me to do it"—Police-constable Baker was there, and the officer who took the charge—I believe Baker heard that.</p>

I have only just walked up the street, and was having a little conversation with the woman"—Seymour said, "I did pass the half-crown, but I did not know it was bad"—Phillips gave a correct address; Seymour gave her name, but refused her address—I called Police-constable 329 to take one of them—I searched Phillips at the station, and found a quarter of a pound of tea, three good florins, four shillings, four sixpences, a threepenny-piece, nineteen pence, and seven halfpence—I took this purse from his hand when I arrested him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy manager of the British Supply Corporation, Limited—on May 10th the prisoner was engaged as one of our canvassers under this agreement (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he was to be paid ten shillings a week salary, and selling commission 2 1/2 per cent., and a collecting commission—his duties were to obtain orders and forward them for the acceptance of his employers—this greyish form is the order form; it would contain a declaration of the customer, and his signature—on the receipt of such an order I cause inquiries to be made, and if they are satisfactory they issue a voucher for the person to come and select the goods—there is a form on the back permitting the delivery to be made to the canvasser, which should be signed by the customer, but not by the agent in any case, or any other person—Mrs. Hunt signed it, and the prisoner brought it to the office, and this voucher was issued; it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220012"/>
               <p>was returned signed on the back, "A. Hunt"—I believed in the genuine<lb/>ness of it, and when the prisoner brought it he said that the customer would like a better article, and she wanted a gold Albert chain value about £2 15s.—I consented to the substitution—he said he might go up to £3 15s., and selected one and took it away, as I supposed for delivery to Mrs. Hunt, and no more has been heard of it—the amount would depend upon the respectability of the customer—the proceedings would be identically the same in Mrs. Carter's case—I believed it had been signed by Mrs. Carter; and a cape for her, value £1, was delivered to the prisoner, and I have heard no more of it—I believe these two signatures to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We wanted a man of good character, and required references—any one who wishes to transfer an article they have pur<lb/>chased must communicate with us in writing first—as long as we were satisfied that the person could continue to pay weekly payments we should be satisfied—I believe this is the chain (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I did not see the cloak—the prisoner was dismissed about August 3rd, for not appearing on two days, and not bringing sufficient business—this letter was written by the authority of the company. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that as the prisoner had failed to appear on two successive Fridays he was discharged, and demanded the delivery of all property of the Corporation in his possession, or they would be compelled to take other steps.</hi>)—we were not thinking of taking any proceedings—I had no conversation with the superin<lb/>tendent before that was written—he is not here—if a canvasser brings a voucher signed by the hirer, he can take the goods, and deliver them to the customer—our servants only sign when the persons cannot write, and have to make their cross—we prosecuted Lloyd Smith, a canvasser, and it was admitted that one person had signed the names of hirers—the Alderman did not point out cases where it had been done—I had not admitted that there were many cases where the collector had signed; it was private prejudice on the part of the Alder<lb/>man—I should not ask the collectors whether they had signed, if the payments were kept up—I did not say at the Police-court that I had received 6s. from Mrs. Hunt, 2s. a week up to July—I did not find that on Friday when the prisoner did not come he had been ill—he received the cloak on the 30th—collectors are allowed to take samples as well as catalogues with illustrations—I do not believe that 17s. commission was owing to him—we have a custom before taking on a man, that he shall serve a fortnight on probation—I do not think he claimed £1 for the fort<lb/>night—I do not think he received anything when we dismissed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner, of 67, Vauxhall Bridge Road—on September 9th I was going home soon after midnight, and was in Vauxhall Bridge Road, within 200 yards of my door—I saw the prisoner and another man at the corner; there was a crowd in the road a little way off—one of the two men asked me to give him something as they were hard up—I said, "I don't know anything about you. Why should I give you anything?"—the other man struck me with his fist on the temple, and gave me a black eye—I almost fell to the ground—as I turned from him the prisoner sprang on my back, and knocked me down in the road, and took my watch and chain—a constable sprang from a doorway—I am sure the prisoner is the man who sprang on me; I had full means of seeing him—I was sober—I have not seen my watch or chain since—this part of the chain was left hanging in my waistcoat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner and the other man came up first and asked for money, and I saw their faces then—I recognise the prisoner as a man I knew about the neighbourhood; I had seen the prisoner's face about a month previous—I said I was determined to charge him, because I felt sure about him—when I told the Magistrate that both men were quite strangers to me I meant that I did not know them to speak to, not that I had not seen them before—I was sober.</p>

               <p>on duty in Regency Street, and I saw the prisoner in the middle of the road, and another man leaning against the lamp-post—I walked a little way, and got into a doorway—soon after I saw the prosecutor step into the road—the two men jumped on him—the prisoner rushed from behind, and struck him on the temple, above the right eye, with his left hand, at the same time snatching at his waistcoat pocket with his right hand—I rushed out; the prisoner was then on the top of the prosecutor—I saw his face—I seized him; the other man came to the prisoner's rescue, and got him away from me—I drew my truncheon, and blew my whistle; a crowd assembled—the prisoner made off—I went after him into Regency Street—he doubled back into Vauxhall Bridge Road, and Dorset Street, and Vauxhall Bridge Road again, where I seized him—I had not lost sight of him—I took him to the station; he said nothing—the prosecutor met us on the way to the station—he said, "That is the man; I never charged a man in my life, but I will this one"—the prisoner gave a correct name and address—the prosecutor seemed, to me, sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was ten or twelve yards from the prosecutor when he was robbed—the man who jumped upon him from behind was the man who got away—he came back to help the prisoner—I am not aware that there was any crowd up to that time—I do not think there could have been any crowd in the road without my seeing them—when I chased the prisoner I turned the corner pretty well at the same time as the prisoner—I said nothing to him when I seized him—when we met the prosecutor I said nothing to him—I would not be quit certain whether I said, "Is this the man?"—this is a very well-lighted spot—I believe all the houses are occupied, and there would be lights in the windows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Lupinsky and Lockyer, cigarette manufacturers, of 56, Carter Lane, City—the prisoner entered our service as town traveller on January 1st—his duties were to canvass for orders and collect accounts—statements of accounts were sent out on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220017"/>
               <p>the 1st or 2nd of the month by post—the prisoner early in August asked me to give him some statements, for which he handed me a list contain<lb/>ing names—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the request and the list—about one day after receiving that statement, I asked him why he wanted the state<lb/>ments—he said if I sent them to the customers, they would say either they had not received them or had mislaid them, and he could not get the money, whereas if he presented the statements, there could be no getting out of it, and he would get the money—I handed him a list of persons who owed me money, and the statements of account—he was supposed to report each day the business done, and send in a statement of all moneys and cheques collected for the firm, and every Wednesday and Saturday to hand over the moneys—this is the daily correspondence (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I have been through every one—I find no account of moneys received from J Skinner and Son, between June 4th and August 14th; Mrs. Sayer, between 6th July and 3rd August; Mr. Bosse, 2nd July; Van Heems, June 19th, July 17th, and August 14th; Mr. Currey, 3, Highgate Hill, 24th July; Miss Kimlin, 31st July; Mr. Reid, 21st August; Mr. Paxton, 10th July; Mr. Weber, 10th August; Mr. Ward, 20th August; Mr. Kirby, 9th July and 8th August—every one of these receipts is in the prisoner's writing—on Saturday, 18th August, I asked the prisoner if he could account for Mrs. Sayer being so much in arrear in her account, and he said she had had two children down with scarlet fever, and owing to the expense of sending them to the seaside she could not pay her account for the present—these two receipts are for £2 17s. on 4th and 6th July, and £5 11s. 9d. on 3rd August, with discount off—that is what Mrs. Sayer owed me at that time—I asked the prisoner about Paxton's account at the same time—he said Paxton had had a dispute with the person from whom he bought the business, and when that dispute was settled the account would be paid, and "You need have no fear, he owes Bard's as well, and your money is all right"—the receipt for that is £4 4s. on 10th July—I asked him about Bosse's account, and he said it was too small to pay; when it was a little larger Mr. Bosse would give us a cheque—that receipt for £3 8s. net is dated July 24th, 1894—Mr. Stackman Bosse owed that amount—when I asked him about Miss Kimlin's account, he said she was away on her holidays, and when, she came back he would endeavour to get her to pay it—that receipt for £2 5s. 7d. net is dated July 31st—our books showed she owed that amount—Skinner and Co. appeared on 18th August to owe us upwards of £21—when asked the prisoner said they were temporarily embarrassed, in a short time they would be out of their difficulties, and pay their account—the receipts are June 4th, £4 18s. 4d.; July 2nd, £2 19s. 3d.; 16th, £4 2s.; 18th, £3 6s. 5d; 30th, £2 8s. 8d., and August 13th, £3 14s. 11d.—Currey's was a small account, which perhaps accounts for my not speaking to him about it—the receipt is for £1 15s. 2d., received 24th July—I did not speak to him about Kirby's account—those receipts are dated 9th July for £1 19s. 3d., and 18th August, £2 5s. 3d.—those amounts appeared to be owing on 18th August in our books—none of these amounts have been accounted for—I have never received a penny of them—I had no conversation with the prisoner on 18th August about Bance's receipt of 14th August for £2 18s. 6d. in the prisoner's writing—as appears from the books and receipts produced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220018"/>
               <p>in the prisoner's writing, the prisoner also received from Van Heems on July 17th £1 13s. 8d.; 19th, 15s. 10d., and on August 14th, £1 0s. 3d. from Reid Bros; from Weber on 10th August, £3 3s. 5d.—Woodhead's was the first case gone into before the Magistrate—on Wednesday, 22nd August, I sent for the police—Sergeant Egan came—I also gent for the prisoner to my office—I was present when the prisoner had a conversation with the officer, who said, "Mr. Miller, I am here for the purpose of arresting you; I have a bundle of papers here, are these your receipts?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, my God! what a pity when I had such a splendid chance!"—he made some reference to my giving him another chance—I said, "The matter is out of my hands, "meaning that I had placed it in the hands of the solicitor—he said, "For the sake of my wife and children I plead for mercy"—he was taken to the station—there was a remand before Sir Stuart Knill—I was cross-examined by the solicitor as to the commission book and so on—the learned Alderman dismissed the charge—I spoke to my solicitor, and, acting on his advice, I applied for a warrant to Sir Stuart Knill, which was granted, and the prisoner was arrested on 7th September—he was committed for trial by the Lord Mayor—the prisoner's commission was not paid for the last three months before his arrest—his salary was paid regularly, £3 a week—he asked for his commission several times; he was paid in every case—I did not know how much he had earned, because the commission book had not been posted up; it was his duty to post it up—I have a suit pending in Chancery with my partner—I have been appointed sole manager of the business since 20th July—before he was taken by the constable on 22nd August the prisoner did not nay anything about claiming to keep the amounts, in view of his commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not do £60 of business a week—about £40 was the average, certainly not more—I was several times before the Alderman—I do not think that question was put to me—five or six casern may have been gone into, but I think only two—there were hearings on 22nd and 30th August—the Alderman did not say the accounts were badly kept, he said he considered it a matter of account—the accounts had not been badly kept—my partner kept the portion of the accounts that had reference to the prisoner—he is my brother-in-law, and the man against whom I commenced an action in Chancery—I charged him with gross drunkenness—the prisoner had not to deal with him mostly—I swore in July, "In consequence of the disgraceful way in which the books had been kept by the defendant"—they were not books of account which were posted up to date—my partner arranged with the defendant when he entered our employ—I know now that directly after the prisoner was dismissed by the Alderman he entered the service of another firm of cigarette people—he was there when he surrendered, so far as I know—it is not a rival firm, but they deal in a different class of goods—he was so employed when arrested the second time—I heard of it on the day of the arrest—the day of his discharge I consulted the solicitor about his re-arrest, or the same evening—he was not arrested till a week after—Skinner's receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) do not represent the whole of my transactions with Skinner—there are receipts for about £60 here—they were handed me by Mr. Skinner—£21 9s. 5d. has not</p>

               <p>been handed over—the bulk has been paid to the firm—the money should have been paid to me, or to my partner in my absence if he was there—he was not usually there—the amounts were paid in on Wednesdays and Saturdays, never once did it differ; the rule was rigidly adhered to in every instance—I did not consult my partner before giving the prisoner in charge, because I was appointed sole manager—my partner said, "What is this about Miller?" and I said, "You will know later on"—I sent circulars to my customers; not 250, not more than 125 to 130—the prisoner did not secure 100 customers; only about fifty or sixty—my partner is here—the prisoner's commission was 5 per cent, on some portion of goods less than half, and 2 1/2 per cent, on the portion—the last time I paid his commission the prisoner asked for £5, and I gave him £3; that was about three months before proceedings were taken—I had only £3 10s. in the petty cash box—I told him that was the reason, and he said that would do—he received £28 commission—I have not accounts with me to show how much—I will swear it was £20—I have not the dates—I did not take receipts for all the sums I paid—I made memoranda in a book—when I sent for the officer the prisoner came in the ordinary way, but rather later; about two o'clock—I had made up my mind to give him in custody about two days before I sent for the con<lb/>stable when I found the discrepancies in the accounts—I was quite clear in my mind that he was a thief, because I went and saw the customers—the officer has said that the prisoner shook hands with me when he came in; it was customary; he tendered his hand, and I took it; there was no meaning in it—I could have written to him for an explanation—I did not think it worth my while—the Chancery proceedings have been going on since about the middle of the year, or earlier—the prisoner's terms of ser<lb/>vice were arranged with my partner in a letter sent to Miller, of which we have a guess copy, and we have the acknowledgment that he received it, "I hereby agree to the agreement drawn up by you in every respect"—it is from "I, Clyde Cottages, Bridge Road, January 1st, 1894"—the original agreement is with Miller—I am sure my partner has not got it unless it was handed to him by Miller; it was sent by post, and we have the entry in the post-book—I cannot tell you the proportions of commis<lb/>sion due to the prisoner—I should say not more than one-third was 5 per cent.—there was this verbal agreement between the prisoner and my<lb/>self, and I have witnesses to prove it that, owing to his selling goods at cost price, I said, "It is impossible to give you a com<lb/>mission, and allow so much to the customers as well; if you insist on selling the goods at this price, I will not execute the orders"—he said, "Well, I am a sensible man, and I will forego my commission on cigarettes of 6d. a pound"—the agreement was never altered in writing—I suggest that he gave up his commission alto<lb/>gether on certain goods—if things had gone on regularly, the commission was to have been paid monthly—he was not paid for three months because he had not asked for it, or I should have been only too pleased to have given him something on account, as I had done previously.</p>

I replied, 'No; cash will be posted on Monday morning.' When I came, the corporal said, 'Have you posted Adamson's money?' I said, 'No; I will do it at once.' I went out straight, and put it in the pillar-box, without registering it"—I said, "Did you take any other letter to the post at that time?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You went specially to post that letter?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "The word 'Registered' is written on it: why did you put it in the pillar-box?"—he said, "Because I made a mistake"—I asked him how he got it—he said, "It came in £5 notes; Mr. Adamson asked me some time ago to send as much cash as possible; that is why I did not send all notes"—I said, "Did you go to the post-office, and ask them if they had the receipt?"—he said, "Yes, because I was not sure whether I had registered it or riot"—I said, "But you told me that you went direct to the letter-box, and put it in"—he said, "Well, I must have done, because I got no receipt"—I made my report to the secretary—the post-office is less than a minute's walk from the engineer's office.</p>

I live at 138, York Road, and am a cab pro<lb/>prietor and driver—on 22nd September I was in Shaftesbury Avenue at one a. m.—three men, of whom the prosecutor was one, hailed me, and got into my cab and told me to drive to Smith Street, King's Road, Chelsea—it seemed as if the three men were acquainted, and had just come out of a music hall—I went in the direction of Sloane Street—my fare stopped me, the prosecutor and prisoner got out, and walked about thirty yards, and wished good-night, and then the prisoner came back and got into my cab, and ordered me to drive to Knightsbridge—the third man remained in the cab—I drove to Knightsbridge—then I was ordered to drive to Westminster, and as I thought they were going to <hi rend="italic">bilk</hi> me I asked for my fare—the prisoner gave me this watch, and said, "This is a security, don't be frightened of your money; I will pay you when I get to West-minster"—I drove to Westminster, and was stopped at a coffee-stall by Westminster Bridge—the prisoner and the other man got out, and called for three cups of coffee, which we drank—I then asked for my fare—the prisoner said, "I have got no money, but the watch I gave you I pinched off the man at Knightsbridge, and if you will give it to me, I will give it to the coffee-stall man"—I said, "I don't do business like</p>

I am a tailor, of 4, Surface Place, City—the prisoner was in my employ as trimmer for some time—he left two months previous to 25th August—on 27th August, from information received from Mr. Seabrook, I examined my stock—I missed a blue serge suit, an overcoat, twenty yards of silk velvet, twelve yards of Italian cloth, and other articles—I gave information to the police—I saw the prisoner on 13th September, and gave him into custody—I charged him with stealing the articles I missed—at the time I missed a black bag containing papers, which were not mine, and about twenty sheets of my stationery, and £5 in gold in an envelope—after the prisoner was taken to the station I went with Sergeant Palmer to his residence at Hamilton Buildings, Great Eastern Street—I found this black bag and some silesia, which is used for pockets, some cloth, buttons, and a dictionary belonging to me, and which I had missed; the large things on 27th August—these tickets were shown to me by the police—the counterfoils contain, in the prisoner's writing, receipts for parcels—the contents of one parcel, marked "A," were shown to me by the police—I identified the collars, silk facings, frock and dress coats, and Italian cloth as things I had missed—I opened the bag at my office, when I found the contents named.</p>

I am a carver and gilder, of 27, Park Road, Crouch End—on October 1st, about 7.30, I was in Old Street, St. Luke's—I turned down Middle Row, which is very narrow—six men were dancing there in front of a public-house, and when I got to the middle of them they closed round me, and I was seized on each side by my arms by two of them and the others turned my pockets out—I lost 1s. 6d. in silver, and some coppers and magnifying glasses—I said, "Now you have taken all I possess you had better let me go," and if they had I should have taken no notice of it, but Jerome deliberately struck me on my face, which was swollen for more than a week—Evens is one of the men who held me—I went into Old Street, and got a constable immediately, and gave Evens in charge—they all ran away when they struck me, but when I came back with a constable Evens was there—the inspector took me into a private room at the station before I charged Evens.</p>

I was wearing glasses that evening Middle Row is very narrow and very dark—it is a thoroughfare for vehicles—the interval between my being seized and the men running off was very short—I found a policeman in about a minute and a half—he immediately went back to the spot where I was robbed, and I saw Evens talking to a woman—we both went up to him together; he did not say in my hearing that it was a mistake—we all three walked to the station—I was somewhat dazed—the constable or sergeant did not say, "Is this one of them?" nor did I say, "I don't think he is"—the inspector asked me if I charged the man; I thought it would be a waste of time, and said that I would not; that is why he asked me to go out of the charge-room—there was some hesitation on my part, due to my unwillingness to under-go the trouble of the prosecution—the inspector said that I must do my duty, and I came out of his room, and charged the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and a commissioner to administer oaths, at 33, Argyle Street, Regent Street—on 10th April the prisoner called and said he wanted a loan of £100; had I any client who would advance it—I told him to call next day—I communicated with Mr. Hann, who called next day; the prisoner came in—I laid the matter before Mr. Hann—the prisoner explained that he wanted the money for the purposes of his business—he was then asked to go outside—I had a conversation with Mr. Hann, and then the prisoner was called back, and Mr. Hann said he should not lend the money—the prisoner said he was very disappointed; that he could pay it back; that he did not owe more than £100 or £120; that all the stock and plant at his place was his own and paid for; that he was a stationer and was worth £800, and that he had a life policy just taken out on his life, which he would charge to Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220040"/>
               <p>Hann—the prosecutor said to him, "If you will make a declaration to that effect, I will let you have the money"—the prisoner said, "I want it to-day," and that he would make the declaration—this declaration was drawn up by one of my clerks—the prisoner repeated the statement as to his indebtedness, and I instructed my clerk to embody it in the statutory declaration—I read it over to the prisoner—he said it was correct and signed it. (<hi rend="italic">In it the prisoner declared that the whole of the plant, machinery, stock-in-trade, fixtures, at</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">Hill's Place used in his business were his own absolute property, and free from incumbrance, and had been paid for, and that he estimated their value at about</hi> £800; <hi rend="italic">that he had never been bankrupt or insolvent; that the utmost extent of his liabilities and debts of every sort did not exceed</hi> £ 120, <hi rend="italic">and that upon the faith of this declaration Mr. William Hann was lending him</hi> £100)—the same afternoon Mr. Hann brought me £100 in bank notes, which I afterwards handed to the prisoner—the prisoner gave to Mr. Hann a charge on his life policy and three promissory notes for £38 6s. 8d. each, payable on 4th July, 4th August, and 4th September, 1894—the prisoner offered to pay £115 for the loan—on 7th July, when the first promissory note became due, it was dishonoured—I sued the prisoner for it; I got judgment in default of his appearance—I issued execution, but a claim was made under this absolute bill of sale, dated 22nd May, 1894, which states that the consideration is for past indebtedness £311, and £69 for a present advance—I had to take the sheriff out—on 8th August I saw the prisoner at my office—on 1st August he called a meeting of his creditors; he sent me a circular—at the meeting he disclosed that his liabilities were £911 unsecured, and also the bill of sale and Mr. Harm's debt, and his assets were £40—on 8th August I saw the prisoner at my office in Mr. Hann's presence by appointment—he said to Mr. Hann, "I know I have done wrong, but I am a young man only twenty-five years of age; for heaven's sake don't ruin me. I will let you have your money to-morrow afternoon"—Mr. Hann said, "Then you did owe more than that £120 at the time of my advance"—the prisoner said, "I did"—on 3rd September I received information, in consequence of which a summons was applied for at the Police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a solicitor for twelve years—I have two clerks; my office is one room partitioned off into two—I first acted as solicitor for the prisoner eighteen months ago—I have acted in about six matters for him—to my knowledge three other firms of solicitors were acting for him—in March he instructed me to act for him in two writs issued against him for trade debts, amounting to about £50—there was a Mayor's Court action against him at that time for £40, but it was settled, I think, before this advance—I acted for him in that—I have no recollection of any other matter in which he was being pressed for money in 1894 in which I acted for him; I cannot swear—I did not know on 11th April that he was involved to any further extent—the Mayor's Court action was settled by the prisoner paying half the amount down, and undertaking to pay the balance by £5 a week—the prisoner and Mr. Hann was strangers till they met on 11th April; I brought them together—the prisoner brought me the two writs issued by Spalding and Hodge and Fourdrinier, Hunt and Co., amounting to about £50 together—I pointed out that registered judgments would</p>

               <p>affect his credit—he asked me if I had a client from whom he could borrow, and I communicated with Mr. Hann—I told Mr. Hann of those two writs and the Mayor's Court action, and that I had acted as solicitor for the prisoner the year before—Mr. Hann refused to advance the money at first—the prisoner urged him to do so—I did not urge him—I was not acting for the prisoner, but only for Mr. Hann in this matter—it was a day or two before, about 6th April, that the prisoner had brought me the two writs—the only liabilities of the prisoner that I knew were £75—I asked him in Mr. Harm's presence if he had any other debts—I knew of no matters in the preceding year in which he was defendant, only of some in which he was plaintiff—I did not suggest a bill of sale, because it is ruin to a trader; it stops all credit—Mr. Hann wanted to confer with me whether on the first statement made by the prisoner about his debts he would advance the money; he made up his mind without any pressure from me—I don't think there was a draft of any promissory note—my clerk was called into the room, and the state<lb/>ments made by the prisoner I told the clerk to embody in the declaration—I told the prisoner it was a statutory declaration—he made it in the presence of myself, the clerk, and Mr. Hann, I think—when Mr. Hann brought the £100 the notes were handed to the prisoner, and then he directed me to pay off the two writs; Mr. Hann said that part of the money was to be applied in that way—the writs came to £50 and the costs to £6—the prisoner paid me £3 3s. for the loan, as borrower—Mr. Hann paid me nothing; the lender never does—I was paid £2 2s., I believe, for my costs in those two actions, but not out of this advance, or on that day—I paid myself out of debts I collected—the life policy for £500 was deposited—I believe it has since lapsed—I did not inform Mr. Hann that the sheriff had been withdrawn a week after I put him in, after the first promissory note was not met, because he was in Norway—on his return I told him—on 1st of August Mr. Hann was still in Norway—Mr. Hann keeps a coffee-house in the Hampstead Road—on 9th August I received this letter from Mr. Abrahams, and I went and saw him on the 10th—he said the prisoner had instructed him, and that the prisoner's brother-in-law would give security for Mr. Hann's debt, and pay it by instalments of £10 a month—I said I would see Mr. Hann, and I saw him the same evening—he said he would take the £115 in instalments of £10 a month if the security was forthcoming—I did not write to that effect to Mr. Abrahams; the security was never given, and there was no arrangement—£7 was sent on 13th August, and £3 on 5th September—I was away in Normandy when the cheque for £7 came, and it was forwarded to me—I returned it with instructions to my clerk, and it was kept in my office for about three weeks while I was away, and then returned; Mr. Hann knew of its receipt directly I returned from Normandy—I did not afterwards undertake to take a promissory note from the defendant—no promissory note was prepared.</p>

About 3.20 a.m. on 20th September I went to Ingestre Buildings, and placed two constables there, and then I went to 51, Beak Street—I found the shop door open, and the shop in great disorder—a marble slab was on the floor; a marble counter was raised; the till was forced—on the marble slab were marks of this chisel—the slab had been raised, and sardine tins placed underneath, so that the money could be taken from the till—money was gone from desk and till—I went back to Ingestre Buildings, and sent six con<lb/>stables to search—we could not find the prisoner for some time—I went round to Hopkins Street, and saw the prisoner lying on a ledge, a kind of portico, about twelve feet from the ground—he must have gone up a flight of stairs, and got through an iron grating and on to this ledge—he refused to come back till I threatened him with my truncheon, and then he got up and came downstairs and was arrested—we found this five shilling piece, shilling, and farthing, and this knife and a small handle.</p>

I live at 4, Rothesay Place, Cemetery Place, Old Beck, Leeds—at 12.30 a.m. on 7th September I was in Spital<lb/>fields with a young lady, with whom I had one or two glasses of beer—I was sober—I was coining along a court, and I was knocked down from behind with a violent blow on the head and robbed—I was senseless for a moment—I hurt myself a little in falling; I had a big black mark on my arm, where I was stamped on or something—when I was on the ground a man was on the top of me ravishing my right-hand trousers pocket—before</p>

I live at St. Neots—in July, 1892, I was desirous of placing my son, Hugh Cameron Chadwick, on a ranche in California, to learn farming—I had heard of Scott and Jackson, Limited, as agents for such a purpose—I came to town in July or August, 1892, and went to their office in Cockspur Street—I saw the prisoner, and discussed the matter with him, and eventually this agree<lb/>ment was entered into between me and the company, that I should pay the company £75 as a premium for placing my son on Mr. Varden's ranche in California—I paid to Scott and Jackson that day £110 19s., which was £75 premium and £35 19s. for the passage money and ex<lb/>penses—this is the receipt I got. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed, "W. H. B. Scott, Managing Director</hi>,")—subsequently I heard of certain matters relating to the payment of the premium, and wrote to Messrs. Scott and Jackson this letter of 22nd January, 1893, asking for an explanation—I received this answer of 25th January. (<hi rend="italic">Explaining, among other matters, that the premium had not been paid in one sum to Mr. Varden, as it was thought advisable to pay it in quarterly instalments.</hi>)</p>

               <p>in making these arrangements, and getting a profit for themselves out of it—they explained in their letter that £15 was their commission on the transaction—three instalments, amounting to £45, were paid to Mr. Varden, I understood—that would represent nine months—they also paid my son's expenses going out—the only money that could be owing to anybody would be the £15 owing to Varden—at the end of nine months, in midsummer, 1893, my son left Varden, and went to someone else close by—Mr. Varden wished that he should leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in partnership with my father, Edward John Harvey, at Portsea—my brother Edwin John is in Florida—since 1889 my father and I had sent him £13 a quarter, through Scott, Jackson and Co.—on July 1st, 1893, I sent them this cheque for £13, payable to Scott Jackson, and Co., with this letter of instructions—that cheque has since been returned paid through my bankers, endorsed "Scott and Jackson, Limited, W. H. B. Scott, Managing Director," and with the stamp of Barclay, Bevan and Tritton, Pall Mall East, and a stamp of the National Provincial Bank—the cheque was acknowledged by this letter of July 4th, 1893—I had certain information from Florida between July and September, and in consequence, on September 21st I wrote this letter to Messrs. Scott and Jackson. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for an explana<lb/>tion of the non-receipt of the July remittance.</hi>)—I received this letter of September 23rd in reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Scott and Jackson had instructed their agents to pay Mr. Harvey</hi> £1 <hi rend="italic">a week, and that they believed their agents were doing so, but that they would make inquiries.</hi>)—I paid £13 in a lump sum, but £1 per week was to be paid in New Zealand—on October 3rd or 4th I was in London on business, and I called at Scott and Jackson's—I saw a clerk, and explained my business to him—on October 5th or 6th I received a letter, and on October 9th I sent this letter to Scott and Jackson. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had another cheque to send, and would do so on receiving an explanation.</hi>)—on October 11th I received this. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had communicated with their agents, and that if the cheque was sent they would forward it on.</hi>)—I sent a further cheque for £13—that £13 for the October quarter was paid properly, but the £13 sent in July was never paid—I did not know that £13 had been drawn by the prisoner from the company's bank on 18th July, 1893, by a cheque signed by him, and applied to his own purposes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I simply sent the money for them to remit—I had sent out this money through Scott and Jackson since 1889—I paid no attention to whether it was not a company till 1891—I understood the money was paid weekly by the Leysburg and County State National Bank in Florida—we paid Scott and Jackson no commission; I don't know whether they deducted anything out there; I don't think they made anything out of it—we only paid £13 a quarter—I understood that the Leysburg Bank had a running account with Scott and Jackson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Holy Orders; I live at 49, Gunterstown Road, West Kensington—in October, 1892, I saw the prisoner as representing Scott and Jackson, Limited, as to placing two of my sons on fruit ranches in California—on 22nd October, 1892, these two agreements were drawn up and executed—under the first I undertook to pay £65 for suitable board, lodging, and instruction as a farm pupil to be provided to Arthur George Turner on Captain John McCann's fruit farm near Auburn; by the second I undertook to pay £50 for board, lodging, and instruction as a farm pupil for Chas. Kenyon Turner on a fruit ranche—beyond those sums I was to pay the expenses, £78. for first-class passage out for the two boys—the same day I gave a cheque for £193, and received this receipt, signed by the prisoner—after my sons had got out there I received more than one communication from Captain McCann—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220062"/>
               <p>about April, 1893, I went to see the prisoner, and told him Captain McCann was uneasy at not receiving the premiums—he explained that the affairs of the company were in disorder in consequence of Mr. Karslake's misconduct, Mr. Karslake having been formerly agent out there, but he gave me to understand that things would be set right and the premiums paid—I had two or three other interviews between then and the end of July, 1893—very much the same thing occurred at those—Captain McCann went on writing to me—the last letter I received from him on that subject was in September, 1893—about 30th October I saw the prisoner—I said I thought there must be some balance of premium not paid over by him, and I thought perhaps it would be as well that I should have it back—I asked him for an exact statement first—he said he would send it to me—I never received it—I went to the office once or twice after 30th October, but the prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid £5 for premiums—Captain McCann was trying to make Scott and Jackson pay £65 and £50 premiums for the two boys, which would have absorbed the whole premium, and would apparently have left Scott and Jackson with no profit at all—I under<lb/>stood there was a dispute between the company and Captain McCann upon that account—the prisoner mentioned to me the fact of the dispute as partly explaining the master—I wrote this letter of 31st July to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that one of his sons teas going from Captain McCann's to Mr. Logan's house, and as he did not mention on what terms he was leaving, or what his brother was doing, it would be well not to authorise any further payment on account of either of them till something definite was heard</hi>,)—I received this answer, enclosing letters from Captain McCann and Mr. Logan.

I live at 8, St. Alban's Place, S.W.—I am now managing director of the firm of William Innes and Co., at 107, Piccadilly—in July, 1892, I was at Auburn, California, as the representa<lb/>tive of Scott, Jackson and Co.—I received Karslake's communication, and in that month came to England and accepted an appointment in the office here—on 31st December, 1892, I returned to Auburn under an agreement with Scott, Jackson and Co. to act as their representative in California at £260 a year—I arrived at Auburn on 31st January and remained there till 11th September, 1893—during that time I was in constant communication with my employers, by letter up to 3rd May, and after that by cable—I had no letter from them after 3rd May—it was my duty to send them during that time accounts of my receipts and expendi<lb/>ture—these are some of my accounts—I knew when I was there a lad, named Chadwick, who was apprenticed to Mr. Varden, residing near Auburn—in February and April, 1893, I paid Mr. Varden on account of Chadwick's premium, seventy<lb/>two dollars on February 18th and seventy<lb/>two dollars on 20th April; I also paid Chadwick seventy-three dollars apart from premium—those sums were remitted by cable from London—on 29th June I did not receive any money for Mr. Varden, and I think none for Mr. Wren—I received a remittance of 492 dollars, or about £98, on that date; 100 dollars for my own salary, 176 dollars for Totten<lb/>ham, and 216 dollars for Captain McCann; that was the way I distributed that money—beyond that I received no money by cable, on or about that date, or between 29th June and 4th August—I did not receive on or about 25th July a sum of £20 on account of the two Turners—I received no salary after 29th June—I did not receive a further sum of 100 dols. for salary on 21st July—I left the company's service in Septem<lb/>ber, and returned to this country.</p>

Harvey, £13"—I kept the petty cash-book—from time to time as I wanted it I received sums for petty cash from the prisoner—he would give me a cheque for £5 or so, and when that was used up I would have another; the cheques were signed by the prisoner and another—some two years or so before the company was wound up the prisoner began to borrow money from me on the petty cash account—that was almost as soon as the company was formed—he would acknowledge with <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi>, the petty cash I lent him; he had a half-crown, ten shillings, all kind of amounts—he would redeem the I O U's by cash payments to me, or once by having the amount debited to his account in the cash-book—the amount he owed had reached £8, I think, when I debited it in the cash-book—in October, 1893, he owed £31 10s. to the petty cash—that had been accumulating for a year or more, probably—he had made no payment within that time to my recollection—when the last amount was lent he gave me an I O U for the whole amount—I was always mentioning it to him—I kept an account of the petty cash in the books, which went to the auditor, and which were always open to the Board for inspection—the books would show that the prisoner had this money; there was no concealment about it whatever—Mr. Warner, the auditor, who saw the book, was also a director—I believe the books were audited quarterly, and after the quarterly and it must have been apparent to the auditor that there was a deficiency—I told the auditor that I had I O U's from the prisoner for the amount—I should put that to the auditor's assistant, Mr. Waller; but I told Mr. Warner, who always came there to see the accounts—he is an accountant—I called his attention to it.</p>

I am a cabman, and live at 91, William Street, Hampstead Road—about half-past one on the morning of 30th September I was going along Montague Street, and saw the prisoner on the doorstep of No. 15 or 16—he was pretending to try and unlock the door—I had just put my cab up, and was walking by—from his appearance I thought he was there for a wrongful purpose—I went by, taking no notice—on getting into Russell Square I saw Sergeant Gurnet, and spoke to him, and brought him back to the house; I saw no one on the doorstep then—</p>

About half-past one on the morning of 30th September Cook spoke to me, and I commenced to watch the street—failing to see anyone about, I stood still for a few minutes, when I saw a light moving about inside No. 16—I went to the door—it was secured—on looking through the letter-box I saw the prisoner standing in the hall, with a match in his right hand, examining several small parcels of letters—I secured the assistance of another constable and rang the bell, and the door was opened by an inmate—on going into the dining-room on the ground floor front I saw the prisoner crouching down on the floor at the end of the sofa, pretending to be asleep—I took hold of him—then he pretended to be very drunk—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he replied, "Having a sleep. A lady wearing a cloak brought me in, and told me to sleep here for the night"—he said he had accom<lb/>panied her from Gray's Inn Road—the whole of the ladies of the house afterwards came down and saw the prisoner, and denied all knowledge of him—Mr. O'Flaherty, one of the persons in the house, came and gave the prisoner in charge—I took him to the station, where he was charged with burglariously entering the house, apparently by means of a false key—he replied, "A false key? All right"—he gave me an address, "38, Arthur Street, Old Rent Road," which I found to be false—I searched him and found a pair of spectacles and a box of matches; no money and no key—on going to the Police-court on Monday morning this key was given to me by a boy—I tried it to the door, and it opened it easily.</p>

He handed me a parcel; it seemed a carpet. He handed my missus another parcel, which she took home. In the morning he sent a big man for them; he said he wanted the things his brother had left. The police came and asked me if I knew of any clocks that had been stolen. I said, "No "; my missus had carried a parcel, but what it was I did not know.</p>

At 2.45 a.m. on 19th September I was with Brown, and I saw five men, three of whom were the prisoners, coming from the direction of Norland Road—about 8.55 the same morning I saw the three prisoners and another man about to enter a public-house at the corner of St. Catherine and St. Ann's Roads.</p>

I received information of this burglary on the morning of 19th September—I made inquiries, and as the result, on the morning of 24th September I went with Badcock and Brown to Reardon's house, 38, St. Clement's Road, Netting Dale—he was in bed—I told him I should take him into custody for being con<lb/>cerned in committing a burglary on 19th September, at 77, Edith Road, West Kensington—he said nothing then—I took him to Latimer Road railway station—on the way there he made a statement, which I took down in writing as soon as I got on the railway station platform—he said, "Five of us done the job, Sailor" (a name by which the prisoner Hillier is known), "Jack Kelly, Mitchell, Boxer, and me. We were all drinking in the Bell and Anchor, and then went to the Rising Sun, in Berners Street. We had two pots of beer. We all agreed to do a job. Drainy came in, but we would not take him with us. We went to the North End Road, down the first turning on the right, got over a wall, and went to a house in Edith Road; we all got in. Sailor cut a pane of glass out of the door. We took two silver dishes and laid them on the lawn. We went back into the house, and had some supper. Sailor, Mitchell, and me went into a bedroom. A girl woke up and and something; we all ran away. Sailor took one of</p>

               <p>the dishes, and I took the other. We went across a field at the back and came out into Hammersmith Road, and through Holland Road, where we met a policeman. Boxer sold the stuff for £3; Kelly and him kept the money"—Hillier was arrested by Badcock and Brown in my presence—he made no reply to the charge then—when all three prisoners were in the charge-room at the station I read this statement over to them—Reardon said nothing—Kelly and Hillier made statements, which Badcock took down—they were placed among other men and identified by Swainson—Reardon was also identified by Adams.</p>

I have not been out of Acton at night since I came out of prison"—Hillier said, "I will own I went into the pub with them, as he says, and we had two pots of beer there, but I did not do the job"—they were charged; they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, and live in Wellclose Square—on 3rd October, about three in the afternoon, I was walking through Chambers Street, close to Leman Street, when suddenly a young fellow ran past me very quickly, and, in passing, he snatched part of my watch<lb/>chain, leaving the rest in my pocket—he only gave one pull—I turned round and ran after him—I saw him, and to the best of my belief, Cartwright is the man—whilst I was running I got a violent push from behind in my back, which sent me forward, and caused me to fall—the right leg of my trousers was split right through, and a piece of skin was taken off my knees, and also my left elbow—I was not thrown quite on my face—the other man made away—I only got a very imperfect glance at him—he was like Donohue, but I could not swear to him—I got up very quickly—I have not recovered my chain.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—on Sunday, Sep<lb/>tember 16th the prisoner came home about 10.45, and went to bed—I bolted the front door—about two o'clock I heard a knock, and heard the prisoner get out of bed, and pull the Venetian blind—he was the only person who occupied the room—in the morning he told me what he looked out at the window for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was quite a quarter of an hour in the bar altogether—he spoke to Miss Thompson first—she then served him with a glass of bitter, and stood talking to him for a few minutes—if he had liked he could have shot her then, and if the pistol had been loaded he could have shot her more than once—there was time for him to fire again—it was not done in a hurry or stumble—if the bullet had gone over her head it would have struck a glass door in the mahogany board—there was an open door behind her, leading into the street—the glass door leads into the sitting-room at the back—at the time he fired his arm was slightly bent, not straight out—he had the pistol in his left hand—if he had been so disposed he could have got inside to where she was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He put the pistol into his breast pocket—he had a dark coat on—the door behind was shut—the bar is a very large one, very long—I showed the inspector the position in which they were standing.</p>

               <p>quarter past twelve, the prisoner came to my house—I have a shop—I said, "Well, Jim, what has brought you here?"—he said, "I have shot your daughter"—I said, "What have you done that for?"—he said, "True love and jealousy"—I said, "Have you killed her?"—he said "No"—I said, "Have you disfigured her?"—he said, "No; if I could have got the pistol into her mouth I would have blown her brains out, and mine afterwards"—I said, "You did not have much feeling for me, Jim, considering I have just lost two children"—he said, "No, it is a wonder you have not lost a third"—he said, "If it is for years to come I will blow her brains out"—he said a great deal more; that is pretty well all I remember—I saw the revolver; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I had it in my hand; it was on the counter—I kept saying, "Jim, put it in your pocket, I don't like the look of it" and I took it in my hand, and he took it from me—he said, "Has Mr. Thompson gone for a policeman?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Has the little girl gone for one?"—I said, "No"—I saw my husband go out for a policeman, who came shortly afterwards—the prisoner said, "The first that comes through the door I will shoot his brains out"—a policeman came and took him away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was with me about half an hour; I did not stay in the shop—he rambled on a good deal—he kept on talking about what he had done, and what he would have done if he could—I don't think he had been drinking; he was very much upset, confused and excited, but he talked very sensibly—he knew what he had done, and what he in<lb/>tended to do to anyone who took her part—he did not attempt to shoot me—I don't think he would hurt me.</p>

On 28th August the prisoner was brought to the station and was formally charged—Ebbage read the charge to him and said, "You need not say anything, but if you do it will be used in evidence against you"—he said, "Is the girl hurt?"—I said, "She has a slight graze on the neck"—he said, "I did it, I admit it; it is the first time I have ever been a prisoner in my life. Who charges me?"—I said, "I charge you for the present"—he said, "Then I have to be charged again?"—I said, "No"—I then left the room—the sergeant afterwards said in his presence, "He has just told he wished he had killed her"—he made no reply to that—as far as I could see he was sober—Sergeant Gummer examined the revolver—I afterwards went to the Ship, and Miss Champion showed me the position in which they were standing, from</p>

On the 31st August the revolver was given to me—I examined it—it does not work easily; the revolving gear is worn out; so, as a matter of fact, it is not a revolver; you can only fire it once, without altering the gear—you would have to take out the pin and readjust it; it will not revolve at all—I went to the Ship—I could find no trace of the bullet—I made experiments with the revolver in my office; I fired a shot through a board three-eighths of an inch thick, five feet away from it, and the bullet went into a wall seven feet beyond, and buried itself in the plaster half an inch, and rebounded—I produce the bullet I fired and the piece of board it went through.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a trace on it where the bullet had been, and the plaster showed where it struck; in fact, it nearly hit someone—it would not be a safe thing to carry in your coat pocket; there would be danger if it knocked against anything that it would go off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Ashley Mineral Water Works—I am twenty-nine years of age—I was married to the prisoner in 1886—one child was born; it is dead—the prisoner was employed from time to time at Lockhart's Coffee-rooms—I lived with him at various places—we always lived very comfortably—we had two quarrels in the eight years; net serious—in May this year he lost his work—I said to him, "Well, you will have to look out and get some work; this is an expensive house; if you don't get work I shall have to give up the house and leave you"—I took a room at 54, Great Dover Street in the name of Mrs. Jackson, the prisoner's second name, and he asked me to take one for him—I did so at 18, Warner Street, in the name of Mr. Jackson—I paid the first week's rent—on 21st July we moved there; he helped to move the furniture; the furniture was mine—on the nights of 23rd and 26th July I slept with him at 52, Trinity Square—on the other nights from the 23rd July to the 28th I slept at the new room in Dover Street—on the Saturday morning at half-past eight I went to 52, Trinity Square, and stayed there till about one—the prisoner then came in with an old gentleman and his daughter to buy up such things as I did not want to take with me to Warner Street—I said, "Have you got any money to give me?"—he said, "Eighteen pence; that is all I have"—he gave that to me—he went out first, as he said he was going after a berth somewhere—then I went out and had some dinner—when I came back he got a mattress from the top of the house to the back parlour, and was sitting on it—he asked me to sit, down with him; I did—he said, "I am sorry about your leaving me, I feel it very much; if I get into work will you come and live with me again?"—I said, "Yes, if you can keep me"—he said, "I am after a job at Horseferry Road gasworks; there is only my character to get up"—I said, "I don't think that will be much, for you are only slovenly and dirty"—he put his left arm round my shoulder; I thought he was going to kiss me; and then he drew his right arm directly across my throat—I felt something wet; I put up my hand and saw it was blood—I said, "You have cut my throat"—I was frightened and ran out—he said nothing, he was feeling his neck, standing in front of the fireplace—I went to Dr. Alexander's surgery, lie attended to dip, and I was afterwards taken to Guy's Hospital—I remained there till the 24th September—I was shown a knife at the Police-court and recognised it as the prisoner's—this is it; it is an ordinary pocket-knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had often seen it in his possession—I said before the Magistrate, "I tolerated my husband," and that I felt too much in<lb/>difference to quarrel—we were married on 27th June, 1886—it was not a marriage of affection—I kept a house and took in lodgers, and I made an income out of them—I only had three friends; not friends in an im<lb/>proper sense—I was friendly with Constable Millage, in 1887; he was my lover, my husband knew all about that—that connection was not renewed in 1893—that was why we quarrelled and why I could not let him stay in the house—seven years ago I was suffering from illness, that continued for about three months—my husband has had intercourse with me up to the very last week—Dr. Payne, of New Kent Road, treated me in my illness; I don't know what he called it; I think it was something like syphilis—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police sergeant stationed at Reigate—on 21st June, in consequence of information, I went to Worcester Cottages; I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner—I told her who I was, and asked her if she had been delivered of a female child within the last two months—she replied, "Yes"—I asked her if I might be allowed to see it—she said, "You can't do that; Mrs. Brown, 113, Battersea Road, Chelsea, has adopted it, and taken it off my hands altogether"—I asked her how she came to know Mrs. Brown—she said, "By advertisement, but I could not say in what paper"—I asked her where she had been confined—she said, "In the lying-in ward at Lambeth, on the 26th of May last"—she then told me that she handed the baby to Mrs. Brown at Charing Cross Railway Station on the 18th June—she said she had not seen the baby since—I told her she would have to go to the Police-station with me, where I should detain her until I had made further inquiries—next day, Friday, I tried to find 113, Battersea Road, Chelsea, but could find no such place—I went to 113, Battersea Park Road; that was not occupied</p>

               <p>by Mrs. Brown, but by a gentleman who had lived there eleven years—I then went to the Lambeth Union, and after making inquiries there I came back and saw the prisoner at the Police-station, where she was detained; that was on the Friday evening—I told her that I had been to London, and found that the statements she had made to me were false—she said she wished she had told the truth in the first place—finding that she was about to make a statement, I cautioned her in the usual way. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>

The other child was in the pond by Waterloo Park; I drowned that the same night. I can't give the time, but it was before I drowned the one in the moat. The one you found in the moat was Minnie May, and the other one in Waterloo Park was Lilly Mary."—On the following morning, Saturday, about half-past seven. I went to the pond in Waterloo Park—I saw the body of Lilly Mary floating in the water, head downwards, about two feet and a half from the road, and in about three feet of water, floating, head downwards—the current was just above it—the legs were drawn up above the water and bent—there was a small piece of flannel round the body—with that excep<lb/>tion there were no other clothes whatever—I noticed mud on the child; it was dirty—the colour of it was a bluey clay—I charged the prisoner on Friday, the 22nd, as to Minnie Mary—I read the charge to her; she made no answer—on the following morning I charged her with the murder of the other child; she made no answer—I have made search for any clothes belonging to the children, but have found none—I have made every possible inquiry, but have not succeeded in finding them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner at Redhill—on the 21st of June last, the body of a female child was handed to me by Inspector King—it had a wart in front of the right ear; the child was a few weeks old; six or seven—I made a post-mortem examination—it was very wet when handed to me—death was due to drowning—I have no doubt, that it was alive at the time it was put into the water—on Saturday, the 23rd of June, the body of another female child was handed to me by head constable Moran at the Police-station—that body had a piece of flannel round the stomach—I made a post-mortem examination of the body, and was satisfied that it had died from suffocation caused by drowning—the first child had been in the water from a day to two or three days, it was quite fresh—the second child had been in the water longer—the ap<lb/>pearances were consistent with both the bodies having been put into the water on the 18th.</p>

               <p>listened to the evidence given by Dr. Loarne this morning with regard to puerperal mania—I agree with him that it may suddenly arise and very suddenly cease—women who have recently been confined are very fre<lb/>quently disposed to that form of misfortune—I generally agree with what Dr. Loarne has stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is only women who have been confined who can have puerperal mania—in most cases there would be other symptoms than killing observable—as a rule, when it is coming on there is great depress<lb/>sion of spirits and dulness; those are the chief symptoms; of course, it can show itself in so many different ways—puerperal mania and puerperal fever are two distinct things—by puerperal mania I understand a condi<lb/>tion of the mind contrary to the normal condition, and which may come on at any time, from a few hours after confinement to several weeks—it is not merely a desire to kill your own children; it very often takes the form of a wish to kill the husband—it sometimes passes off very quickly—it is very difficult to draw distinctions—the only way would be by watching the actions, and seeing whether they are sane or insane; if the actions before and after were rational, that would guide one to the con<lb/>clusion that she was not suffering from puerperal mania—she might or might not remember immediately after the act that she had killed her children; there is no distinction to be drawn from that as to whether the person was rational or not—a sane woman who had killed her children would not be likely to forget it in a few hours; if insane she might forget it in twenty-four hours. Q. Supposing you found that a person who had done such an act remembered that she had done it, and remembered where she had drowned the two children in different places, would not that be evidence that she was sane at the time? A. It would cer<lb/>tainly. If a woman really insane was under the impression that she had left the child in charge of somebody, whereas she had drowned it, that would be a delusion, and I should not expect her to throw off that delu<lb/>nion in a few days, and then remember that she had drowned it, and where; I should expect the delusion to continue.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Recalled by the Court</hi>). In my view a woman suffer<lb/>ing from puerperal mania, and in that state of mania committing a crime, would not remember all the details of it an hour afterwards—as to results, there is really no difference between puerperal mania and any other form of mania—if she could not remember one act done in a state of mania, she would not remember other acts.</p>

I agree with Dr. Palmer that she might or might not remember; I think she probably would remember—that would not necessarily be a ground for thinking she was suffering from mania at the time—that fact alone would not afford any ground for drawing an infer<lb/>ence; you would have to enter into other circumstances; if she did remember, it would not necessarily give an inference one way or the other—I have been speaking rather from cases I have read than from personal experience.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer of Holloway Prison—I saw the prisoner on her reception into the prison on 22nd June, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220099"/>
               <p>on the following day, and from that time up to the present she has been more or less under my observation—when she first came in I did not observe the slightest symptoms of insanity about her, nor have I since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I agree generally with the evidence given by Dr. Lerne—it is possible that puerperal mania may arise without being preceded with any perceptible symptoms—I would not say that it would be absolutely impossible for it to cease suddenly without any symptons—I think I have only attended one case of puerperal mania, a case tried in this Court—I have only been at Holloway since last January—I should expect previous symptoms to have been seen in cases of puerperal mania.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In order to distinguish between sane and insane persons I should always look to their conduct before and after the act which is the subject of inquiry—if the conduct immediately before and after the act is that of a sane person, I should, as a rule, form the opinion that the person was sane at the time of the commission of the act—the absence of motive is a strong evidence of insanity when you can find no other ex<lb/>planation of the act—if a woman with legitimate children, and in ample and comfortable circumstances, suddenly murders them, I should certainly have a very strong suspicion of insanity.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodbine, Swanage Road, Wands worth, and am a solicitor—on September 1st I went for a holiday, leaving my house securely fastened all over—I left the key of the garden entrance with Mr. Hobbs, my neighbour, and on the day after I left I sent by registered post the front door key to him—on Tuesday evening, 11th September, I received a telegram, and returned to town—I found several of the rooms in great disorder, particularly the front bed-room—I missed four scarf pins, a neck chain and locket, a watchchain, three lady's rings, other jewellery, and some plate, of the value altogether of over £30, I should think—I had in the top back bedroom two small cardboard boxes full of ball programmes—this is one of them with my name on it, written by myself.</p>

I am a clerk; I live at Homestead, Swanage Road, Wands worth, next door to Mr. Appleton—I had his keys when he went away in September—on Saturday, 8th September, soon after seven p.m., I was walking along a plot of land, and I saw Rodford alone—as soon as he saw me he walked away—I thought I knew him; I had once seen him to speak to before that day—I also saw Naylor by a fence in Killarney Road; I never saw him to speak to before—I returned about eleven, and then I saw Rodford in Crieff Road, just by Killarney Road; I am almost positive it was him; it was very dark at the time—about twelve I was just going up to bed, and I heard a noise as of something falling next door—I picked out the prisoners from about a dozen others at the Police-court—that Saturday evening, when I went out, I looked at Mr. Appleton's house particularly—on the Tuesday, in consequence of in<lb/>formation, I went into the house about seven with Inspector Bradbury—all these dance programmes were on the servant's bed, as if they had been pitched out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-dealer, of Woolwich—I have seen Plummer at sale-rooms—on 2nd October I was at Croydon Fair—I saw Plummer with Taylor about 5.30 p.m.—Plummer had a donkey and barrow—Williams came in about five minutes afterwards—he said to me, "I have got a good donkey for sale; will you buy it for £3?"—I agreed to pay him £2, all but a shilling, for luck—then Taylor said, "You will have to go to Streatham to get the donkey, to leave the barrow"—I agreed to that—between 5.30 and 6.30 I sold a horse—we left Croydon about 6.30 in the donkey cart—Ott was present, and another one I did not know, who jumped out in the Croydon Road—on the way the trace came undone, and Williams said, "Get down and do up the trace"—I said, "No," but I got down, and when I got to the trace Williams struck me with his whip handle on the top of the head, and knocked me down—he took it from Plummer—there was a wound which bled—Ott then took out of my trousers pocket £6 10s. in gold and two half-crowns, and two or three coppers—I tried to get my donkey out when Plummer knocked me down again, and a tall gentleman, the witness Johnson, came And picked me up—Plummer was gone to the donkey's head—I do not remember where Taylor was—three men were on the top of me—Williams and Ott; I could not say who the third man was—they would have killed me but for Johnson—the prisoners got away—I followed Johnson to the Police-station—the donkey was gone when I looked for it—I picked out Plummer and Taylor at the station about half an hour after<lb/>wards—I next saw Williams and Ott in Kennington Lane, near to the Police-station, when Plummer and Taylor were brought up—I said to Williams and Ott, "Will you come into Court along with me?"—they walked along, and when they got in they said they knew nothing about it—I gave information to the police and they were arrested—I have not seen the donkey since.</p>

I live at 13, Heythorne Road, West Croydon—on 2nd October I was at Croydon Fair, when I heard a noise of scuffling and beating of something—I went in that direction about forty yards—turning the corner of the Glen Eldon Road I saw three men on the ground and one or two others standing around—I moved towards them, and heard one man say, "Have you his money?"—the other said, "Yes"—they were twenty-five yards away, and there was a lamp giving an extra light between us, which made it seem darker, but I imagine it was a man who was standing asked the question—the man's head was towards the lamp-post—one man appeared to be holding him by the shoulder, another a biggish man (I could not tell by their faces, simply by their figures) was holding his legs, another was behind his back holding him, and another looking on—another man, who appeared to be shorter, was holding the head of the donkey—there was a fifth man besides the prosecutor—I believe Taylor was the man standing, by his general cut and figure—immediately I approached them I heard the words mentioned, and "Let us be off," and they went off in the donkey cart—the prosecutor was struggling to get up, half senseless—he was very much knocked about and covered with blood—I endeavoured to rouse him—I went on at once after the men, and to the Police-station—on the right was a field leading to Leigham Court, and on the left a garden fence, and a house at the corner of Glen Eldon Road, and another house at the corner of the road—the prisoners went off in the donkey cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of 91, George Street, Croydon—on 18th August the prisoner came to my shop with a cheque, and asked me if I would oblige my neighbour, Mr. Pollard (who was dead, and whose business was being carried on by a representative) with change for a cheque for £4 10s.—it was endorsed William Pollard—I took the cheque from his hand, and said, "This is not Mr. Pollard's cheque?"—he said, "No, it is a customer's cheque; he gave it to Mr. Pollard in payment for goods, and he wants the money"—I said, "I don't know you"—he said, "I always draw cheques like that; it will be all right"—I paid it into my bank, and it came back, marked "No account"—he was dressed in his shirt sleeves, and represented himself to come from the timber yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners defence.</hi> I first became acquainted with a man named Smith, now awaiting trial for uttering forged cheques (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 1223), by living at the same lodging-house, 75, Blackfriars Road, S.E. About the beginning of August, 1894, being out of work at the time, I was sitting in the kitchen one afternoon when the man Smith spoke to me, and asked me if I would like to go to work with him. I asked what work it was, but he did not tell me then, but said that it would put shillings into my pocket. I consented to go with him. There was a friend of his sitting by him at the time, but he did not take any part in the conversation. The next day we went to Lavender Hill, and on the way he told me that he had some cheques which had been given him for services rendered, which he wanted me to take to shops which he would tell me and ask them to kindly cash them for the man's name on the body of the cheque, at present not remembered. He left me on lavender Hill for a short time; then he returned, and gave me the cheque, which I took to a baker's shop, and obtained the amount, £3 10s. with which I returned and gave the other man, in the presence of the man Smith, who told me to go straight up the road till, they overtook me. They followed on a tram going to Clapham Junction, which, on coming up to me, I got inside. We all got down at Clapham Junction, and had a drink, after which we all went back to Lambeth, where the man Smith and his friend, after giving me ten shillings and telling me not to say anything to any of the other lodgers that I was in his employ<lb/>ment, they left me. I went on to St. George's Circus. The next day we went to Clapham Junction by tram, where we got down and had a drink at the Falcon Tavern, where the other man and Smith left me to wait till they returned. After about twenty minutes the other man came and called me outside. After giving me a few directions, he gave me a cheque to take to a baker's shop in the road, facing the Falcon Hotel, and ask them to kindly oblige the governor, Mr. Preston, veterinary surgeon, of East Hill, with cash of a cheque, the amount being £3 15s., which I obtained, and gave it to the other man. Smith following behind me, I went on to the top of East Hill, where I got into a tram going to Westminster. The man Smith got on at Clapham Junction. We went on to Lambeth, where we all got down, and the other man gave me 10s. by Smith's direction. This went on for two or three days. I passed one cheque per day, £3 10s.—and each time I was successful. I then became unwell, and did not go with.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220116"/>
               <p>them for several days. The Saturday before Brighton Race Meeting they asked me if I would go with them to act as bookmaker's clerk; also, if I did not go, they told me to be sure and not get into any drunken squabbles, or tell anybody that I was employed by him. I went, how<lb/>ever, on the Monday with Smith's friend, and had to pay all my own expenses. Smith came down later on in the day. I stayed till Saturday. I left Smith's friend to return on Sunday, but Smith had left us on Thurs<lb/>day. I again rested for two or three days, after which I again went with them for a short time, but was not always successful in getting them cashed. I then began to get a little alarmed, and asked Smith where he got the cheques from, but he told me that it was no business of mine; that they were got lawfully. I asked him why he wanted the other man. He replied that it was not safe for him to carry cheques on his person, as he was too well known. I still continued with them, not for what I got, but I determined to try, if possible, to find out where he obtained the cheques, and then give information to the police, but in this I was not successful. I met Smith one Thursday in the Blackfriars Road, when we had a drink. While in the bar, he showed me some eighteen or twenty blank cheque forms. I again asked him where he got them, but he used a foul remark, and said that they cost a sovereign each. These were on the National Provincial Bank of England. I am sure the man Smith must have got the book that was stolen, as the forms have been recognised by Mr. Fitch as some contained in the book that was taken from his office, but I do not know how Smith got them. I did not know they were stolen till after I was arrested. I also know Smith had cheque forms on the London and Provincial and the National Provincial—I also heard him say that he could get some on the South-Western, but I first saw two cheques on this bank for the first time at Dalston when I gave evidence against Smith. Smith and his friend had a quarrel, and had separated. I was with his friend at the time of my arrest, on which he decamped with £10 of mine that he was minding for me, which I have lost, together with an overcoat. When I saw that I had been made a dupe of, I at once gave a description of the man Smith, who was arrested three weeks after me. I believe he is the man the police wanted, as the one who obtained these cheques and writing them out and giving them to children to take to shops to get cashed. I am very sorry to have been connected with such a wicked transaction, but I have not kept any<lb/>thing back, but have given the detectives every information that I knew might lead to the discovery of the leader of these forgeries, and I believe that it can be proved without a doubt but what Smith is that man. They have not obtained the other man, but I believe by what I saw all through these transactions that, although we had passed several cheques, that he had, like myself, no clue of where they were obtained; in fact, I recollect Smith telling him he could not get any if he wanted them, as the party from whom he got them would not do any business with a third party. The man Smith, whom I saw while I was at Holloway, asked me, out at exercise, to make it easy for him and to <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> on the other man; but it was Smith that gave him the directions always in the first place to give to me, also it was by Smith's advice that I entrusted my money to his friend, which I have lost, and he told me at Holloway that I ought to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220117"/>
               <p>have known better. I thought all the way through that I was in an honest transaction, but I now find out that I have been made the dupe of a swindler. I do not give evidence or write this statement hoping to take the blame off myself, but I must say that at the time of my pre senting these cheques I was not aware that they were forged and worth<lb/>less. I beg you to give me mercy, and deal leniently with me.</p>

You make a mistake in saying it was my handwriting, for I made this agreement with Charley that I would not sign any, as I felt sure I should soon fall. After he divided, he used to write them and get some boys to sign, so that is why I have said I was not aware when I went to cash them that they were forged. I shall plead not guilty at my trial, so I tell you that you may know what to do. I do hope you won't get so long, although things look black. Do you know that, although I said nothing, they seem to know all about you? If I had turned copper, as it was said, they would both have been caught long ago, even the same night. How is it I let Charley get away? Because he had over £70 to £80 and some paper at the time on him. I lost my coat, jacket, and hat and cap, and £10 4s. 8d., minus about two shillings expenses. I am sure I don't know where to find him when I get out. Do you know Mrs. Stone's address? That is the only one I might find out from. If you can write to me, I shall be pleased if you will tell me. I have gained nothing by it; in fact, I am as bad off as before, except a change of clothes. I had two witnesses at Croydon to come and give me a personal character, who came to see me here, and write to me. I am expecting a visit from the <hi rend="italic">tart</hi> and my aunt on Mon<lb/>day afternoon. Are you writing to anyone? It appears Knobby got the sack from <hi rend="italic">Jim's</hi> for coming out with us, but I never saw, and did not know anything about it till the tec. told me he had my coat and jacket. If ever I do see Charley I will tell him something."—(<hi rend="italic">No signature</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Southwark Police-court—I produce the original summons against Mr. Cash, which was granted by Mr. Fenwick, one of the Magistrates of that division—it was heard by Mr. Slade on 22nd September last—the defendant was the first and principal witness called—I saw him duly sworn—I took notes of the evidence he gave—I produce them. (<hi rend="italic">The note was read in part, it com<lb/>menced thus:</hi> "James Crabb, secretary to the Wesleyan Temperance Society," and stated that on the 6th April he went into the Flower of the Forest and there saw a police-constable, who was on duty, served with beer in a pewter pot; that he saw the constable take it up and drink the contents and replace the pot on the bar—<hi rend="italic">other portions of the note were read by Counsel.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The summons against Mr. Cash was what is known as a police summons—the police were represented on the return of the summons—the constable gave evidence, of which I took a careful note—to the best of my belief I took all that was said by the different witnesses, Mr. Crabb and the constable for the prosecution, and for the defence Johnson the barman, Borland the potman, Cherry, Firmin, and Mr. Cash—the summons was dismissed—Mr. Maitland, who appeared for the defendant, said, "As the summons is dismissed, I shall ask for a summons for perjury, not making any names at that moment—the secretary's name appeared as complainant; he was called as a witness, and he was bound over to prosecute—I said at the Police-court, "I think we have a proportion of one per cent, of publicans convicted as compared with the number of persons convicted of drunkenness; I said I thought it might possibly amount to that—I should be surprised if it was one in 500 as regards Southwark Police-court; I think it would be higher than that—taking the Metropolis generally, I would have thought it was more than one in 500—I have no knowledge of the convictions for drunkenness in the Metropolis for one year—about 30,000; I should think that would be possible—I do not know the number of licensed houses that there are—I do not know the "Licensed Victuallers' Official Annual"—I am surprised to hear that there are only forty convictions out of 30,000 within the whole Metropolitan area—I have not studied this book at all—Mr. Crabb was cross-examined at con<lb/>siderable length on this police summons by Mr. Maitland, who appeared for Mr. Cash.</p>

                  </hi>. On September 6th last I was barman at the Flower of the Forest public-house—I had been in that employment about three months—about half-past ten on that morning there was no person besides myself serving in the bar—Mr. Firmin came in—before he came in nobody else had been in—he came into the saloon bar—some man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220122"/>
               <p>came in who was not sober—he was sitting down before Mr. Firmin came in; I forgot that for a moment—he came into the private bar—I noticed he staggered a bit—he never asked for anything—directly he came in I said to him, "Would you kindly go outside, as you cannot be served here?"—I did not know the man at all—he sat down on a form at the side—I asked him again to go outside, and he mumbled something—I then called the potman, James Borland, from down in the cellar—he came up—I said, "This is the man I want ejected; will you fetch a policeman, please?"—Borland went out—before he returned Mr. Firmin came into the saloon bar—Mr. Cherry also came in—I knew both Mr. Firmin and Mr. Cherry—Mr. Cherry came into the private bar—I served him with a half of bitter—that was before the police-constable came in—I did not serve him with any beer that morning before that half-pint—I served him with that just after I served Mr. Firmin—that was before the potman returned—I served Mr. Cherry before the policeman came in—it was in a metal tankard—then the policeman came in the private bar—I said to him, "The man has gone out; we shall not want you now"—he was just going to turn when Mr. Crabb came in—he looked at the policeman, and said, "I am going to take your number for drinking on duty; I see you have your cuff on"—the policeman then turned and walked out—Mr. Crabb had ordered a small lemon for himself—that was while the policeman was in the bar—Mr. Cash came up to Mr. Crabb and asked him if he was serious—he told Mr. Crabb that Mr. Cherry had ordered the half of bitter—Mr. Crabb, in the policeman's presence, picked up Mr. Cherry's pot and smelt it, and wrote something down in his book—he asked him for my name, and Mr. Cash said, "Take Mr. Cherry's, as it is he who ordered the bitter"—Mr. Crabb then went out—there were one or two glasses on the counter, but no metal pot—the constable did not have any drink at all while he was there—he did not take up the pot that had been given to Mr. Cherry—I had served Mr. Firmin with a glass of ginger-beer, with a dash of bitter, in the saloon bar. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here explained, with the aid of a model, the manner in which he served at the different bars, the public, private, and saloon bars of the house.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I had been at this time about two months in this house—I said that Mr. Firmin was the first person who came in, but I corrected it; that was a mistake—I remember that Mr. Firmin made the same mistake originally, by saying he had been a quarter of an hour in the house before the police-constable came in—the man who came in I had never seen before or since—except that he was a man with a hard felt hat, I could not give any further description; I didn't take any notice of the man—I said at the Police-court I thought he might be a man who came from the Salvation Army Shelter, because we had so many people who came there of that class—the private bar is a bar where the customers of the house generally come to—the public bar would be the bar that the ordinary passer-by would go into; they come to the private bar as well—they could go to all three—there are two large swing doors giving access to the public bar—this man who came in was in the house about a minute; it might be a little less or a little longer—imme<lb/>diately he came in I spoke to him—he did not ask to be served—he was not in any way violent, or quarrelsome, or disorderly, or anything of that kind—he did not ask to be served; and, of course, I did not refuse him—as soon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220123"/>
               <p>as the man came in I told him he was unfit to be served, and told him to go out—he sat down on the loose form in the private bar, and I shook him and asked him to go out—that was immediately he sat down, and then I called the potman, down the stairs just behind the beer pull—when the potman came into the bar I was standing in the bar—he came at once—nobody had seen the man but me until Mr. Firmin came in—Mr. Crabb was not in the house when Mr. Firmin came—no one else saw him, only when the potman went through, of course, he saw him—I remember saying, "I am not aware anyone but myself saw this drunken man"—he staggered a bit, and looked very drowsy—at the time I said that, the potman had not been examined—I shook him—I went back into the bar—the potman came up and went out for the policeman at once through the public bar—I again shook the man—he got up and walked out—in the large public bar there was a man serving—a man I could speak to from where I was—I believe there were customers in the public bar—a man was employed there—I did not turn the man out myself, because it is against the law—it is against the law to turn a man out of a public-house—I did not know that a publican may turn a man out—I did not call the barman from the other bar because I did not think it was necessary—I have never seen our potman turn anybody out of the house—we always send for a constable if we want him out—the potman did not go into the private bar at all or speak to the man in any way—he went through the public bar, and out through the Blackfriars door, which would be the nearest way—the man went out a few seconds after the potman went out—when I sent the potman for the policeman I told him what he was to say to the policeman—I said, "Will you fetch a policeman, because we want this man turned out?"—that was all I said—the man had been in the house about half a minute; something like that—Mr. Cash was close by if I had wished to call him—there was no one in the saloon bar that I know of—I could not say where Mr. Nye was—I have heard he was in the house—very likely in the saloon bar; he was round the corner—I would not see him unless I leant over the counter—there was no one to serve in the private bar except this man, assuming that he was there—I have no doubt that Mr. Nye was in the saloon bar—I have heard the "governor" say so, and I do not believe he would tell a lie—I believe Mr. Nye was there when Mr. Firmin came into the saloon bar—I served him—he was eating his lunch at the bar half-way round the corner—he brought his lunch in with him—he always brings his lunch there—he was in the habit of eating his lunch there—he is an intimate personal friend of Mr. Cash's, and a great deal in the house—I believe I gave him ginger beer, or something of that kind—he paid me—I went to the till—in going to the till I should have my back to the bar—I might have served Mr. Firmin before Mr. Cherry came in—I might have served him just as Mr. Cherry came in, or before, I could not say which, it is some time ago—I am perfectly sure Mr. Firmin came in before Mr. Cherry—Mr. Cherry came in and called for half a pint of bitter—he then proceeded to read the paper—I saw the pot in his hand—I think I saw him drinking the beer, or saw the pot in his hand, any<lb/>how—I saw the potman come in—I could not say exactly whether Mr. Cash was then in the bar or not—the potman spoke to me—I spoke to the potman after he spoke to me; could not say while Mr. Cash wa</p>

               <p>there; that is I did not know whether Mr. Cash was in the bar or not—I could not say for certain—when the potman came in he went downstairs—when I served Mr. Cherry he paid for the beer—I took the money and put it into the till, for that purpose I had hardly to turn my back, because I took coppers from Mr. Cherry—when Mr. Cash came in he went to take the till, and then he would have his back to the bar—the constable came in just after Mr. Cherry came in, I could not say how long—to get into the private bar you would have to come round the partition—I was drawing the beer, I think, for Mr. Cherry when the policeman came in—I was putting the beer on the counter—if the policeman looked at me he could not well help seeing the beer—it was when I was putting the beer on the counter that Mr. Crabb came in—the beer had been drawn before Mr. Crabb came in, and I put it down as he came in—the constable was facing me at the time, about a yard or two from the counter—when Mr. Crabb came into the private bar he came up to the counter, right in the corner; that would be the left-hand corner of the counter—in the other side, leaning against the partition, was Mr. Cherry reading a paper—when Mr. Crabb went up to the counter he asked to be served with a small lemon—I got it for him, and served him—he gave me sixpence or a shilling, I could not say which—I went to the till to get change; I had turned my back then to the counter—I put the shilling there, got the change, and brought it back to him—the first thing I heard Mr. Crabb say after that was, "I will take your number for drinking in a public-house"; I think those were the words—it was, "I will report you for drinking in a public-house while you are on duty"—it was something like that—Mr. Cash thereupon turned round from the till and asked me why the constable was there Mr. Crabb wrote something down in a book—he called my Attention to the fact that he was taking this man's number—he asked my name—the landlord then said it was Mr. Cherry who had been served, and asked Mr. Crabb to take Cherry's name—Mr. Crabb asked Mr. Cherry for his name—I could not say if Cherry refused to give it—I was partly attending to what was going on; only partly, and partly to ray business—the business was the more important—I heard Cherry say, "He has not been served"—that was quite true; it was Cherry that had been served—I heard Mr. Crabb draw the attention of the constable to the fact that he had his armlet on—the policeman said, "I know I have," and then walked out of the bar—there was myself, Mr. Cherry, the landlord, and Mr. Firmin there—I did not say a word to Mr. Crabb as to why the constable was there—I did not think it was my business—Mr. Crabb had asked me for my name, you know—if Mr. Cherry said anything as to why the constable was there I never heard him—the constable never said a word, only, "I know I have"—the landlord did not say a word as to why the constable was there that I know of—Mr. Firmin said nothing—Crabb having made the entry of the constable's number in his book walked out of the place—I did not see the constable waiting outside after he had been in the public-house; not that morning—I think I have told you all that was said in the public-house; the com<lb/>plaint of Mr. Crabb was that the constable was drinking—until the constable came into the private bar I had not seen him looking into the other bars—I afterwards heard that the police had taken out a summons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220125"/>
               <p>against Mr. Cash—I was present at the Police-court and gave evidence—Mr. Cherry is a very regular attendant at the house about two or three times a day—this policeman had been in the house before to turn anybody out—I think he had turned out a man before, some time before this occurred, I could not say how long before, I do not remember—I had not seen him as a customer in the bar—I only serve at the private bar half-an-hour in the morning—I do not serve there in the evenings—I had not seen the constable in the house while off duty—I had seen him there while on duty, not as a customer—I did not know when he came to the house—a statement was taken from me by the police one evening; I do not know whether it was the next day, or the day after that—Mr. Cash was there when I gave my statement—that was before any summons was taken out, immediately after this, I believe—I knew that Mr. Crabb had made a complaint against the constable that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There is a difference of level between the private bar and the public bar—when Theobald was serving at the public bar he could not see what was going on in the private bar—Theobald is the name of the other barman—I have come here to-day to give you, to the best of my ability, an honest and truthful account of what took place that morning—I had two steps to go down—I should like to say that I can prove to you I did not put the pot in front of the policeman—he was standing by the side of Mr. Crabb; Mr. Cherry was standing there, and I placed the beer in front of Mr. Cherry, and not in front of the policeman.</p>

You have got your cuff on, you are on duty"—I said, "I know I have," and went out—I drank nothing while there—it is not true that any pewter measure was placed before me upon counter, or that I took up any pewter measure from the counter—I drank nothing whatever, beer or spirits or anything—I have told you all that happened in my presence in the public-house—I came out then, and I remained at the point past the "Surrey," and Mr. Crabb came out—he looked at this watch, and was taking the name and sign of the house outside—I went up towards him and asked him for his name and address, and he walked away, got into a pony and trap, and drove away up the London Road—it is my duty to report any circumstance which had called me away from fixed point; and when I went off duty at one o'clock I made a report as to my having been called to this public-house—at 6.30 p.m. I was called upon by the inspector, a complaint having been made against me—I met Mr. Crabb before the inspector then—he had made a written statement out, and signed it—I denied it then—the matter being re<lb/>ported, and a summons taken out, I was called as a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

I went up the side steps; a man was reading a newspaper, and Mr. Crabb rushed in and said, 'I will report you for drinking in a public-house'"—I think he ran in at the iron gate there—he ran in behind me through the iron gate—there is a mirror there at the top of the steps—I saw him in the mirror, but I did not know he was running after me—as I turned to the door on the left, I saw him running—I did not look back; I saw the mirror right in front of me—I said, "I went up the side steps. The man was reading a news-paper, and Mr. Crabb rushed in and said, 'I will report you for drinking in a public-house'"—Mr. Cherry was reading the newspaper—he said, "Good morning," and I returned it, and Mr. Crabb rushed in—I do not think he went up to the bar and ordered the lemonade—he took my number—I am quite positive he did not go up to the bar and order the lemonade—he took my number first—I saw no pot on the counter at all—I did not see the pot placed on the counter as Crabb came in—I did not see anybody drink from the pot—I saw no beer drunk in my presence.</p>

You are drinking on duty"—the constable said, "I know I am on duty," and walked out—I did not say anything to Mr. Crabb—I treated the matter as a joke, and laughed—Mr. Crabb had a note-book in his hand—he said he should take the number of the constable, and he was writing in it—I asked him if he was serious, in what he was doing—he said, "Yes, certainly"—I said, "If you are taking the policeman's number, you had better take this man's name, he bought the beer;" that was Mr. Cherry—he said, "I have got the constable's name; that is enough for me"—I said it was not sufficient for me, and I demanded him to take the name and address of Mr. Cherry—I did not actually say demand; I asked him to do so—I would rather he asked Mr. Cherry for his name—he said, "Very well; I will do so," and he said to Cherry, "Give me your name and address"—he did not give it; he refused to do so—I think that was all the con<lb/>versation that took place, as far as I recollect—at that time there was one pewter pot on the counter—I saw the barman put it on the counter, just in front of the beer-engine, about three feet from the beer-engine; there was no one but Cherry there—I did not see Cherry drink from that measure—no one could have drank from it without my noticing them—after that I did not see beer supplied to anyone else—if beer had been supplied to anyone else after Cherry was served I must have known it—Cherry was in the private bar, Mr. Firmin was in the saloon bar, leaning against it, having his lunch—Nye was in that saloon bar—I think he had one knee on the seat next the window reading the paper—from where Nye was he could not see what was taking place in the private bar—I have two other barmen—at this particular time in the public bar there was Frank Theobald—he could not see what was taking place in the private bar—I do not recollect when I was served with the summons—I did appear at the Police-court, and the case was heard against me and dismissed.</p>

I am a glass embosser—I come to business at half-past seven a.m.—I am in the habit of going for an early lunch between half-past ten and eleven every day at Mr. Cash's house, the Flower of the Forest—on September 6th, about half-past ten, I went there—the private bar is led to by some steps—I usually enter the saloon bar, approached by a flight of steps leading up to a lobby and then turning again—as I was coming up those steps I saw a man coming down—I did not take much notice of him; he was a middle-aged man, I should think, shabbily dressed—he had a hard felt hat on—he was leaving the house—we passed each other—I know Nye—when I entered the house I went into the saloon bar—Nye was there—from there I could see into the private bar—there was no person on the public side of the private bar at the time I went into the saloon bar—Johnson was serving behind the private bar—Nye, when I went in the saloon bar, was by the window—he could not see anything that took place in the private bar—I am quite sure directly I went in I asked for refreshment; I always have a glass of ginger-beer with a dash of bitter in it—I carry my own lunch with me—I began to eat it—the first person of the public who came into the private bar after I went into the saloon bar was Mr. Cherry—I saw Mr. Cherry served with some beer in a tankard—I noticed a police-constable come in—before the police-constable came in Cherry drank from the tankard—as far as I could see, with the exception of Cherry's tankard, there was no other pewter measure upon the counter—when the constable came in, Johnson said that he was not wanted, "The man is gone," or words to that effect—Crabb came in, and he pulled out his book, and said he would report him—that is all I heard him say—Crabb took up and smelt the tankard out of which Cherry had drunk—I saw the constable leave the house—from the time I entered until the time the constable left the house I did not see the constable drink out of any pewter measure whatsoever—he did not lift any pewter measure off the counter, or handle it in any way—if he had done so, I must have seen it—I do not know the constable, only by sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Cash for two years very inti<lb/>mately—I am on friendly terms with him—if I said before I was on intimate terms, no doubt it is correct—I knew that a summons had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220135"/>
               <p>taken out against him with regard to this matter and I knew that it might be a serious thing allowing a constable to drink on licensed pre<lb/>mises—his licence might be endorsed, or something of that kind, I believe—I gave evidence before the Magistrate—I cannot remember what I said before the Magistrate—I cannot say whether I said then that I saw Cherry drink the beer—when Cherry came in on that morning there was no reason why I should notice him—I was only in the habit of seeing him come in—there was nothing remarkable about his coming in, or being in the house, or having beer, or drinking it—there was no reason this morn<lb/>ing why I should notice him, only that I was sitting right opposite to him—I was eating my lunch, and had my own drink—I might have said, "Good morning," or something of that sort to Mr. Cherry—I was not in conver<lb/>sation with him—Mr. Nye was in the same bar as I was—I was sitting sideways to Mr. Nye, and my face was to Mr. Cherry—I was not watch<lb/>ing Mr. Cherry or the barman—I was sitting there eating my lunch, as I usually do at half-past ten—all I noticed Mr. Crabb do was that he took out his pocket-book, and said to the constable that he would report him, or words to that effect—I will not say that they are the exact words—I have told you all that took place when Mr. Crabb came into the house—I do not desire to add to it in any way—I did not hear anything more—that is all I remember—I saw Mr. Crabb come up to the bar, and ask to be served with a bottle of lemonade—I saw him served—I did not notice him pay for the lemonade—I did not notice the barman go away to get change and bring it back—I did not hear him ask the bar<lb/>man for his name—I was paying attention; I was sitting there—it is possible he might have asked the barman for his name, but I do not remember everything—my attention was directed to the matter, when I heard Mr. Crabb say that he would report the constable—I cannot remember that he did ask the barman for his name—I heard Mr. Cash say, "That was Cherry's beer," or something of that sort—I do not re<lb/>member the landlord asking Mr. Crabb to take Cherry's name—I did not ear Cherry refuse to give him the name—I do not remember it all in detail—when Mr. Cherry came in there was no reason why I should watch him at all, only that I was sitting opposite to him—when my attention was attracted, I do not know that I listened to what was said—I do not think the constable said a syllable as to being brought there to turn a man out—I was in the other bar; I was not close to him—I was lose enough to hear something—I saw Mr. Crabb in the bar—Cherry was leaning against the partition—I did not want to look round the corner to see him; I was facing him—I sat in the opposite corner, and I could see the constable—I did not listen to what was said—I noticed something—I did not hear any such excuse at all as having been called to that house to turn anyone out—I did not know that he had been chal<lb/>lenged that he had been drinking—I heard Mr. Crabb say he would report him—I did not know what it was for—I thought it was a joke at the time—it took me unawares, by surprise—I paid attention—I do not remember the constable being sent for—I might have heard it, but I do not remember it—I said I had been a quarter of an hour in the house before the constable came—that was a mistake—I misunderstood the question that was put to me—I could not tell you whether I went out at the same time as Cherry did, or not—I will not be certain as to that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220136"/>
               <p>I think I left Mr. Nye there—I will not be certain if he was there when I went in, and when I left—I should say the beer was placed on the counter before Mr. Crabb came into the bar; I will not swear it was—the beer was placed on the counter when Cherry called for it—Crabb did call for lemonade—he spoke to the constable before he called for the lemonade; but I would not be positive about that—I am not prepared to swear to it—very likely I said before the Magistrate, "There was no reason why I should or should not notice whether Cherry drank from the pot. When Crabb came in he went to the bar and called for some lemonade"—I am not quite certain what was the first thing I heard or what words he used—I do not remember whether Crabb asked the constable for his number or not—I did not hear Crabb ask the barman for his name—I would not be certain whether he asked Cherry for his name—I did not hear Cherry refuse to give his name—I knew of Mr. Cash being summoned, and I often saw him about that time; more than once a day—the only descrip<lb/>tion of the man I saw come from the house was that he was shabbily dressed—I do not think I had ever seen him before in my life—I cer<lb/>tainly have not seen him since—I made a statement to the police in writing—I saw nothing of the man; I did not see him come in, or any<lb/>thing that took place with regard to him—the statement I made was a perfectly true one; and it was made at the time the thing was being inquired into with regard to the complaints against the constable: "I was in the Flower of the Forest, Blackfriars Road, about half-past ten on the 6th; I heard the barman send the potman for a policeman to put a man out"; that is not true—I signed it, and it was read to me—I did not say, "The pot<lb/>man was some time gone, and when he returned with the policeman the man had left"—I do not know who drew up my statement for me—this statement was read over to me, and I signed it as being correct in the presence of Newman, the inspector—I do not know that I did say I heard the barman send the potman for a policeman—this is my signature; I signed it for some reason—I did not follow it in the way it was read over to me—when it was read over to me "the pot<lb/>man was some time gone, and when he returned with the policeman the man had left," I suppose it was read over as the facts of the case, not what I really saw—I do not mean that the inspector invented this—I mean that it was read over to me, and I signed it—I signed it as my account of the matter, I think—"I was in the place and I heard the barman send the potman for a policeman" is wrong—I did not hear the barman send the potman for a policeman—may have seen the man afterwards, but not at the time.<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "The pot<lb/>man was some time gone, and when he returned with the policeman, the man had left. A gentleman followed them in, and he at once said to the policeman, 'I shall report you for drinking on duty. You have your cuff on. 'The policeman said, 'I am on duty,' and left the house. He was not in the house above five or six seconds. Is that so?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is about the time, I should say. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "The gentleman was served with a small lemon, and he then picked up a pot off the counter and put it to his nose, and said to the landlord, 'I shall report you.' The landlord said, 'You are not serious?' He said, 'I am.' The landlord pointed to another man, and said, 'The ale belongs to him.'" Did you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not say that. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this your account of it—"The land-lord</p>

               <p>pointed to another man, and said, 'The ale belongs to him; you had better take his name and address.' The gentleman then left the house I was not in the same compartment. He was in a position to see and hear all that took place. The policeman was not served." Was that your statement to the inspector who was inquiring into this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Inspector Newman was making inquiries into the complaints of the constable which might possibly result in a charge against Mr. Cash; I understood that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I said I had been a quarter of an hour in the place before Cherry or the constable came in, I thought I was asked as to the time I was in the house—the whole time I was in the house was a quarter of an hour—when Johnson said, "He has gone now," that was the first thing I heard mentioned—I could see and hear from the point where I sat all that took place—I heard Johnson say that he had gone—the constable did not at any time take up a pewter<lb/>pot and drink from it—he was not near the counter; I am certain upon that point—I have no interest in this matter at all beyond that of telling the truth in a court of justice.</p>

He then directed the potman to fetch a constable. The potman went out, and the man left immediately. The potman arrived in about three minutes with the constable, who was not wanted, as the man had left. A gentleman followed the constable into the house, and at once said, 'I shall report you for drinking on duty you have your cuff on.' The constable said, 'I am on duty,' and left the house. The gentleman was then served with a small lemon. He then took up my pot and smelt the contents, and said to the landlord, 'I shall report it.' The landlord said, 'You are not serious.' He replied, 'I am; I shall report it.' The landlord asked him to take my name and address,</p>

The constable was not served"—that is my signature—Newman I knew to be an inspector of the Division—I knew that a complaint had been made about this constable, and that Newman was inquiring into it—I made the statement verbally to Mr. Newman, and he wrote the statement out and brought it to me later on—I said, "The principal statements are there, but I did not say all that"—Mr. Newman did not write it on this paper; neither did I write—the principal facts are all there, but it is not exactly the words that I said—I said nothing about the man fetching the constable or anything else to Mr. Newman—the principal facts are there to a certain extent—if I had said this it would not be true; not exactly the words—perhaps Mr. Newman might have misunderstood me about the passage: "I was served, and picked up the newspaper, and commenced to read. Shortly afterwards the barman requested the man to leave"—I would not say for certain that Newman invented that—I read part of it—my sight is not very clear, and when I read I have to use glasses—I could not read the whole of it—I signed it—Newman might have misunderstood me—he took it verbally—he did not write it out while I was there—my eyesight is very bad—I did not see every word, and Mr. Newman did not read it over to me—I did not read every word—I am going by what you say about the principal facts being in it—I did not say the first part of it in that way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I have been engaged in temperance work for the past thirty years, and lately have directed my attention to the action of the police in reference to licensed houses. I have reported in the present year several constables for drinking in public-houses while on duty in and around London. My business as a traveller takes me into all parts of London, and I have the opportunities of making this observation. On the 5th of last September I had an inter<lb/>view by appointment with the Chief Commissioner of Police, when I mentioned to him some cases I had reported, especially the case of two constables observed on August 22nd drinking in a public-house in Cow<lb/>cross Street, and the Commissioner said that the constables in that case had acknowledged that they had been served whilst on duty, but that they had removed their armlets, and told the landlord a lie, saying they were off duty, and they had been dealt with by the Commissioner of Police accordingly. The Commissioner also reminded me of the great difficulty of obtaining a conviction of a publican. After that interview the landlord of another house in Marylebone was summoned by the Commissioner, but the summons was dismissed, as my evidence was not corroborated, and the constables denied that they had taken drink on the premises, and swore that they had been sent for to eject two dis<lb/>orderly persons who left the house as the constables entered. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189410220139"/>
               <p>reported the constable in the of the Flower of the Forest at the station and also at Scotland Yard. The police obtained the summons against Mr. Cash without further communication with me. The evidence I gave as a witness was absolutely true, and what actually took place I now repeat. On September 6th last, at 10.35 a.m., I was driving down Blackfriars Road in a trap which I use for my business. As I was passing the Flower of the Forest public-house I noticed a police-constable loitering about outside the house and looking up and down. I drove a short distance, about forty feet, and got down I pretended to look in a shop window, but I kept the constable under observation. I saw the constable go up the passage leading to the private bar. I followed him. I went up the steps and into the private bar, and saw the constable standing there. He was standing about the middle of the bar with his arm wearing the armlet behind him; he was facing the counter. I went up to the counter, and asked the barman for a bottle of lemonade. The barman then placed a pewter measure containing liquor on the counter in front of the constable. The constable was standing close to me. I saw him take up the measure and drink from it. He replaced the measure on the counter, and I took it up and smelt it. It had contained malt liquor. I told the constable I should report him for drinking on licensed premises. I took his number, saying to him, 'You see I am taking your number. I drew the barman's attention to the fact, and ask him for his name he made no answer. I said also to the constable, 'You are on duty, you have your armlet on. 'The constable said, 'I know I have. The landlord came forward and said the constable did not pay for the liquor, but that man there, pointing to a stout man standing on the other side of the constable. I said, 'I don't know who paid for it, but he has drunk it on your premises.' I left the house, and went to the front and took the name of the house and of the landlord. I saw the constable outside; he came up and made an observation, but I did not reply. I then got into my trap and drove away. I went to the police-station about six o'clock in the evening, after my day's work. I made a written report at the request of the inspector, which was read over in the presence of the constable. He denied the charge of drinking, said he was called to the hose to turn someone out. I sent a copy of my report to Scotland and, and I heard no more of the case until I received through the police a notification that I was to attend as a witness on the hearing of the sum<lb/>mons against the landlord, Mr. Cash. In what I have done I have acted, as I believed, in the discharge of my duty as a citizen, and in order to call attention to the extraordinary difference between the number of persons convicted of drunkenness and the very few cases of proceedings against the licensed houses in which convictions are obtained, and what I believe to be the laxity of the police in dealing with licensed houses."</p>

I live with my uncle, Henry Green, a clothier, at Hawthorne Cottage, Oxtead, Surrey—on 18th August I went to bed about nine o'clock—my uncle closes the house after I go to bed—the next morning I came down at seven and noticed that the front door was open, and the right hand sit<lb/>ting-room window was down as far, as it would go, and the writing table drawers were pulled out—those things had not been like that when I went to bed—I went to the left hand sitting-room and found the blind turned up, and I missed a tankard and spoon off the table, which had been left from dinner overnight—I went down the passage—the door was open into the store-room—I went into the shop, it was all in confusion—I missed some boots out of a glass case, and some trousers—I was shown boots at the Police-court which I iden<lb/>tified; they were in the house on the 18th August, and were gone when I came down on the 19th—two pairs have our private mark; the third pair has a red medallion with a beehive—I had only two pairs with that mark in the shop—these two pairs and the pair worn by one of the prisoners were in a glass case—my uncle missed some money.</p>

William Gordon—I always fasten the sitting-room window, and it was fastened—the following morning my niece called me, and I went over the house with her, and found it had been ransacked and things taken from it—I identify these boots as such as we keep, but my niece has the management of the shop—I can tell them by these marks—I also missed a saltspoon and a tankard; and 2s., 1s., 6d., and 2d. off the kitchen mantelpiece—I sent for the police.</p>

I have not got any to give you, but I will get yours if you will tell me where to get them"—he had been wearing the stolen trousers, and I had taken them off—he replied, "My trousers are with the others on the stack"—on the following morning I went to the stack; I moved a quantity of hay, and on the top I found a pair of trousers and an old pair of boots—I took the trousers to the police station, and showed them to Langworthy, and he said, "Yes, those are my trousers"—Wilson said nothing—I charged each of them with burglary, and each replied, "No, I know nothing about it"—I cannot say which pair each of the prisoners was wearing.</p>
