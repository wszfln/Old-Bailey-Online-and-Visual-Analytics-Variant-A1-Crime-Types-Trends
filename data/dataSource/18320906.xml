            . I am a Policeman. On the 21st of August, about a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner coming out of Three Cups-alley into George-street, with this coat on, over his own clothes; another young man was with him - I saw them running very fast, and stopped the prisoner; he made great resistance: as I took him to the station, I asked him where he got the coat from - he said he picked it up, he lid not say where; I have had it ever since: I returned to Davies' house, and found the rest of the property - I first saw the prisoner about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house, coming in a direction from it; I had been watching three or four of them for half an hour, and had seen him near the place about six o'clock, in company with three others - he had not got this coat on then; when I took him he had it on over his own black coat: I searched, and found only a knife on him - I cannot say whether the others had any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he putting the coat on when you saw him? A. No, he had got it on; he had been out of my sight about twenty minutes - the things would make a middling size bundle, such as he could carry; there was no mark of violence on the prosecutor's lock - I found nothing on the prisoner to pick it with.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How could the door be opened? A. By a skeleton-key very easily.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Fisher's mother lodged with you? A. Yes; she had no key - she went out about half-past three o'clock; I went out between five and six o'clock, and left nobody in the house; I have no servant - it was on Sunday; the shop door was shut, and fastened inside - Mrs. Fisher had no servant; I believe the prisoner is her son - I did not go into her room to see if any body remained there; it was not likely - she did not have many visiters; Fisher did not live there - he was there on Sunday morning; there are two keys to the private door, one for the lock and another for the latch; I have them both - I was at the public-house opposite all the while, taking tea with Orchard, the landlord, and had told Mrs. Fisher the keys would be there if she wanted to get in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any inner door unlocked? A. The door between the staircase and shop was opened, I suppose - I had left it locked, and found it locked when I returned; nobody could get at the property without unlocking that door, unless they got in at the window which was not open - if any body had got in at it I should have seen some traces, and it could not be opened from the outside - I lost a necklace, a pair of bracelets, two half-sovereigns, and about 2l. 17s. in silver.</p>

On Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060007"/>morning, the 2nd of August, about twenty minutes past two o'clock, I was alarmed by the last witness; I collected other Policemen - I did not go into the house myself; I went into Seymour-mews, at the back of the house, to prevent an escape - when I got there I heard a cry of "Stop them! look out in the mews!" and shortly after that a cracking of glass - shortly after there was a cry "They are getting out of No. 9," and then I heard it said, "They are getting through No. 8," and I found they were taken; I afterwards examined the house, and found they had got in through a small window - the door was open at the time I got there; I found a crow-bar - it was about three feet inside the area door - by breaking the glass in a small high window near the area door, a person could get in; I have every reason to believe they got in there.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of Police. I was called to Mrs. Casamaijor's, and went into the house with another - we went down stairs, and as we went down I heard a rushing noise, as if the windows were breaking; when we got down we found the persons had got away up a ladder against the wall, communicating with the back leads of the house, over the out-houses; I found the kitchen window leading to the back area broken; it appeared as if persons were getting away in a hurry; I saw two men, and pursued them up the ladder - I followed them along the leads to the leads of No. 9, and then saw them descend into the back premises of No. 8; two or three voices called out "They are gone down to No. 8" - I went through the front door of No. 10, and entered the front door of No. 8, being let in by the butler, and saw a door in the hall gently move - I went into the room, and found the two prisoners, one against the wall, and the other under the bed of the butler, who had got up to let us in at the door; I secured Grigg, alias Hurley - he had no hat on.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went into Mrs. Casamaijor's house with Goodwin, and at the back part I saw Field distinctly, having a lantern with me - the other man, who I believe was Hurley, was rather forward - we followed them on the leads from No. 10, till it was said they had gone down at No. 8; we went in at the front door of No. 8, and found them in the butler's room; Field was laying under the bed - I got him out; we handcuffed and took them to the station-house, and on Field I found two knives, a nail, a piece of iron, and a piece of cord; his feet were muffled with worsted stockings, which would prevent any body hearing him walk; as we went along he slipped his hand from the handcuffs, and tried to make his escape; I found two handkerchiefs on the leads - Hurley had no neck handkerchief on, and this was folded up as a neck handkerchief; here are three keys - I then went down to the prosecutrix's house, and found the plate strewed about outside the wine-cellar in the pantry, some of it in a green baize bag; a bottle of wine had been opened, and partly drank; the lock of the pantry was broken open, and nearly off, and the lock of the cellar where the plate had been was broken open; there was a silver fruit basket, thirty-eight spoons, eighteen forks, one pair of tongs, two ladles, six waiters, a pair of nut-crackers, a fork, two ice-pails, and one tea-urn.</p>

            . I am butler at No. 8, Manchestersquare. On the night in question I was sleeping in the pantry, and heard a great noise, and presently heard a great running over the leads of my pantry; I got up, opened the pantry window, and saw two men jump down off the leads on the passage; they came over from No. 9; I lifted up the window, called out "Halloo, you thieves! what do you want here?" they retreated a little, but I shut down my window, went to the street door, called in the Policemen, and on returning with the Policemen, I found them in my pantry; Field was under the bed, and the other by the door; I afterwards saw a hat in the back area of our house - that is the way they had come; they jumped down off the passage, broke two squares, and tumbled down into the kitchen.</p>

            . I am butler to Mrs. Casamaijor. -I had packed up the plate safe about a fortnight before, and placed it in the wine-cellar, locked up: I was not in the house at the time of the robbery. I know the prisoner Hurley, or Grigg; he was in was in Mrs. Casamaijor's service about four years ago, in the same house; I was in the country that night, and did not come to town till the Saturday.</p>

               <p>Field's Defence. On the 1st of August I had been to Astley's theatre - I stopped loitering on the road on returning; it was rather late in coming back - I had two or three dogs to take care of for noblemen till the 1st of September, and had some taken from me; I had information one of the dogs was down this mews - I had been down the mews four or five times; the Policeman came down two or three times; he saw us once down the mews, and took no notice; as we were going by I heard a dog barking, and the stockings I put on my feet was to prevent the dog making a noise, so that I might find out where it was - the Policeman took no notice, and three men came running along by me, and in about ten minutes the Policeman and two others came down with lights; I said to Hurley "The Policemen are coming down, I dare say they will take us;" I got over the wall to the leads of No. 11, and over a wall - there was a springing of rattles before and behind me, and to prevent being taken to the watch-house, seeing a window open, we got in at No. 8 - as to making my escape, the handcuffs are large enough for a hand twice as big as mine; if he had told us to leave the mews when he came down the first time we should certainly have done it.</p>

I lost my poultry some time in March that year; I discovered the loss in the morning, about seven o'clock - I saw it all safe overnight, when I locked the door, and took the key - I missed a goose, a gander, eleven fowls, a duck, and I think twenty-four eggs; the out-house door was not broken open; there is a window to it, and part of the glass had fallen out of the frame - the persons appeared to have got over the wall, knocked off some of the tiles, and then brlken the window frame, and so got in -I had a dog to guard my premises, and that dog was killed; I found it had been beaten - he died in two or three days after; I saw the marks where they had got down by the windows - there were the marks of the nails of shoes, and I think they were the marks of more than one person, but whether it was more than two I cannot say; I found all my poultry the same evening, in the possession of an officer, and found Joseph Wren in custody - he was tried afterwards; I am quite certain the poultry was mine.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 17th of March, 1830, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along the Lea-cut, about a quarter of a mile from Tickner's - Prendergrass was with me, and we met three men approaching us; I have every reason to believe the prisoner was one of them - I have no doubt of it; one of them, named McEwin, had a sack across his shoulder - I stopped him, and the other two,(Wren and the prisoner) walked on: I sent Prendergrass after them, and they both ran away as hard as they could run; I found in the sack a goose, a gander, seven or eight fowls, and a duck - some of them had been recently killed, and were warm; I laid hold of McEwin - he knocked me down, and got away - Prendergrass did not succeed in taking either of the others; then he and I went to a house on Bow-common, kept by a man named Wilson - it is rather more than a quarter of a mile from the place; I saw a woman in the house - I remained there about fifteen minutes, when two men entered; I was in the kitchen - they ran into the parlour: I have no doubt the prisoner was one of the men, they ran away; he had a green jacket on - that was the prisoner, and the same man appeared in the parlour with Wren; he said,"Oh, my God, here are officers here," and both ran out as hard as they could - I pursued, but did not catch them- they got into the fields; I went to various places after the prisoner, but could not find him - Wren was taken the following morning; I searched the house, and found two hens in a cupboard in an up stairs room, sitting on some eggs - there were about twenty-four eggs, which had a cross on them in ink; I showed the hens and eggs to Tickner the same day, and he claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you positively swear the prisoner was one of the men? A. I have no doubt of it from the recollection I have - it is so long since I would not positively swear it; I found a rent-book in the house with an account of some rent which had been paid.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you leave the house yourself immediately after the officers had been there? A. I was not there - I did not live there at all; the date in the book is not 1820. but 1830; it is a figure of three - that is the way I write; I let the prisoner the house, but how much he occupied himself I do not know - I went there once to receive my rent; there were people there: I cannot say whether they were lodgers - there are two rooms and a kitchen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined against Wren? A. No; I gave evidence at Lambeth-street about two months ago - that was the first time I told any thing about it - I think I had told Lea or the prosecutor what I had seen, but am not sure.</p>

I searched the prisoner's house on the 17th of March, 1830, and found the top of a mahogany table under the bed, on the floor, and two more pieces belonging to it- I also found a gardener's knife with a silver ferrel on it. which I have not here, also a quantity of seeds, and about a peek of scarlet beans, part of a Latin dictionary, and Johnson's dictionary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found these things with the rest? A. Yes; I saw a woman at the house, who I have since seen at the office, when the prisoner was taken - she passed for his wife; I saw two men come up to the house, and run away, on the 17th of March.</p>

When I met him at the City Arms he looked at me, and said he thought he knew me - I said I thought I had some knowledge of his features; he said it was not in this country; I said No - he asked where I came from; I said from the North; he said he came from some other part, and asked me to drink - I drank with him - he took me to a public-house; I had a glass of rum, and he had rum and shrub - we then went to the Cooper's Arms; he called for half-and-half; several sweeps came in - he asked them to drink, and after the second pot he asked them to sing - he offered his watch to pay for the third pot; she refused, and he was some time before he would give her the money; he then put his watch on the table; the men in the house told him to be quiet - he threw his hat up, and said he would toss any man for a pot of beer; a sweep tossed with him, and he said that man, Littles, cheated him; he struck him, and Littles went out; he then said he would fight anybody - nobody took notice of him - some sweeps came in; he struck them, and said they were the men he had been tossing with; Towers came to light his pipe, and he said he was the man who had tossed with him; he denied it - he said he would knock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060011"/>his head off, and they began to fight; I went out, as I had some work at the canal tunnel.</p>

               <p>Towers' Defence. I took the young man out who he was tossing with, as he struck him: I went in again directly, and he said I was the man who had lossed with him - I said I was not; he said he would knock my head off; he struck me, and I struck him again - he then said he had lost his watch, and he would fight any man in the room.</p>

Stop thief! I pursued myself, and endeavoured to take him, but did not succeed - I saw him about two o'clock the same day, in custody; he was then in quite a different dress, but his countenance had struck me, as the light shone as brilliant as the day almost - I gave a description of his dress to Bolton, at the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What description did you give? A. That he was a man about my own stature, with a round face, but stouter; I had been on duty, but had nothing to drink more than my usual beer - I was quite sober; I know Mr. Ainsley; he is a stout man, about five feet high - he is the man who came forward to make a compromise on behalf of those who robbed me - I had not seen Ainaley that evening.</p>

I said I had lost my watch; he said, "Are you positive of it?" I said Yes - he said, "It is a sad thing, but your watch is quite sufficient, if you are positive, but would not another watch and money satisfy you?" I said,"Is it my own watch?" he said, "No; your own watch is not comeatable, but you shall have a watch and money to satisfy you" - I said,"No, I decline it, the law shall have its course;" the prisoner was then in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Police. I saw Doyle at the station-house on Thursday morning, the 31st of August, about ten o'clock - he gave me an account of his having been robbed, and described the person who robbed him; he described his dress, and said he was a man about his own stature, with broad shoulders, and wore a fustain jacket - I acted on his information, and took the prisoner in Angel-alley, Whitechapel, close to Whitechapel-church; I said, "Bill, I want you" - (I had seen him before in the habit of wearing the dress described, but he then had a different dress on) - he said, "I am wanted for every b - y thing;" I took him to the watch-house, and fetched the prosecutor there before I told him what he was taken for - the prosecutor immediately said, "That's the man, I will swear to him from one hundred men."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You received information about ten o'clock? A. Yes, on Thursday morning, and took him about two - I had seen him between ten and two, but did not take him; he could not help coming with me - there were two examinations before the Magistrate on the Thursday and Saturday - when I took him he was dressed as he is now; I believe he had the same coat on; I am not unacquainted with his person - I do not know that I ever saw him in that coat before; I have seen him in a fustain jacket five nights out of a week - I have seen him in a black coat before, but am pretty certain I never saw him in the coat he has on; I have seen him in one of the same shape - there are a great many had characters on my beat, and I am in the habit of looking at them: when I saw him in a different coat to the jacket he usually wore, I always suspected there was something wrong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen him in the fustain jacket lately before? A. I am quite certain I saw him in it the night before this occurred; when I saw him he was generally in company with others.</p>

            . I live at No. 31, George-yard, High-street, Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner about three months; he rents an apartment in my house - I saw him on Wednesday, the 29th of August, and on Tuesday night, the 28th - it was last Wednesday week; I saw him three times on Wednesday, about five o'clock in the evening - at about nine, a few minutes before or after, he went in with his pint of beer - he had on a brown coat, but the other part of his dress I cannot tell, but think it was light trousers; this was at nine o'clock or a few minutes after - he slept there on Wednesday night, the 29th of August, I will take my solemn oath; he called me up stairs, and paid me 6s. 6d. about half an hour after he took the beer in - my wife was up in the room with me; that was between nine and ten o'clock - I saw him up stairs after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How late? A. Between nine and ten o'clock; the latest time I heard him was when I called up to ask if all the lodgers were in; I then fastened the door, and am thoroughly convinced no individual could get out without my knowledge that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten the door? A. I bolted it, and turned the handle right down to the plate; I found it so in the morning - I did not lock the door, but am thoroughly convinced the door was as I had left it; nobody could get in or out.</p>

            , nor any person going by that name; I know nothing of any body going from my house to the prosecutor - I am married; my wife is outside - the couple, who lodged with me, are not here; I went to bed about half-past eleven, and shut the door up - I am sure it was never opened till I opened it; the prisoner slept in the top room - I sleep below; my head is underneath the staircase - I was not awake all night; we supped before we went to bed - I know it was Wednesday by my repairing a wheel for a gentleman, which I booked; I have seen the prisoner wear a fustain coatee or jacket with pockets, but he had not it on on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were not asked that question - how came you to know that it was material? A. I did not know it was material at all, only I was asked about the coat.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Why did you say, in answer to my question, that he had not got the fustain jacket on on Wednesday evening? A. Because I before told you he had a brown coat on, which is the truth, so help me God, the man had no other - I did not see the fustain jacket that night at all; I do not know Walton by name - (looking at him) I have seen that gentleman about my place, but not oftener about my place than in any other neighbourhood: I do not often change my lodgers while they keep peace and soberness in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife see the prisoner at five o'clock? A. I do not know - I was at work in the yard at a wheel: my wife was in the kitchen - the prisoner passed through the yard to go in: he had a fish or something with him: it was something moist in a handkerchief - he went up to his own apartment: I lost sight of him till nine o'clock when he passed me with the beer in his hand - I did not see him in the fustain jacket about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him change his dress in the course of the day? A. Not particularly change his dress - I never in my life saw him change his dress in the day, nor have I seen him with it changed; I never saw him with two dresses on in the course of one day - he did not, to my knowledge leave a fustain jacket in his lodging when he was taken; the Policeman must know that best, I went to the Magistrate's when he was taken, but was not called in; my wife went with me: Thompsons did not go - they had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were going to tell your story yourself - tell it your own way? A. My name is Williams; I reside in George-yard - I am a coach and cart wheelwright by trade; Mr. Palmer, of Bartholomew-close, is my landlord - I have lived in the house twenty years, about ten years on my own hands, and before that under my father's direction; the prisoner passed me in my own yard about five o'clock in the evening, as I was at work, and I saw him at the door again about nine, as I stood by an old coach-carriage - he went up stairs with his pint of beer, and about half an hour after, or it might be a few minutes before, he called me up, paid me 6s. 6d. for rent, and I saw no more of him that night, but when I shut my door that night, I called up to know if he was in, and Mr. Adams himself answered Yes; I bolted the door, and went to bed, and found the door so in the morning, when I got up, and between eight and nine o'clock that morning he passed me in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Just repeat that? The witness did so almost verbatim.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got your story very perfect indeed - how often have you said it over? A. Never before I came here; I never had any talk with my wife about it - we had muscles for supper that night, and bread and cheese for dinner; I had nothing but bread and cheese; I will not be sure what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell what you had next day? A. If I must tell you, I had no dinner; I had bread and cheese for supper; the prisoner would not have lived in my house if he had gone out and in at irregular hours - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060013"/>went in and out at meal times; I took him to be a labouring man - I do not know where he worked he had lodged about three months with me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did Louisa Adams sleep there that night? A. Yes; she was up in the room that night when I received the money.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIAMS. I am the wife of the last witness -I saw the prisoner last in the house on the 29th of last month, which was last Wednesday week; I saw him last about eleven o'clock in the evening, when I went up stairs to return a pair of seissors I horrowed of the young woman he lives with, and he was then in bed; I saw him there - that was the last time I saw him; my husband caled up to know if all was in before he fastened the door, and the prisoner answered Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your husband then do? A. He called my husband up stairs, to pay him 6s. 6d., which he owed him - my husband then came down, locked the door, and we went to bed; I saw the door locked.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How many lodgers had you? A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the woman who lived with the prisoner the sister of a man they call Bobby odd legs? A. I do not know; I do not know a man who is called by that name - I have heard the name, but not in my house; I do not know what has become of him - I am sure he never lodged with me; I have seen the prisoner in a fustain jacket - he wore it sometimes, not very often: he sometimes wore that and sometimes a brown coat - I do not think he wore the fustain jacket four or five times a week; I did not see it that Wednesday - I saw him about nine o'clock that evening, between nine and ten o'clock, going up stairs; I did not see him any more till I went up stairs - he had a coat on, and a pint of beer in his hand; he generally takes a pint up at supper time - I am confident this was Wednesday week, I know it very well - he generally slept at home: he slept at home every night as far as I know - we always call up to know if all are in; I cannot swear he slept at home every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have slept out sometimes? A. Sometimes the door is shut, and I do not see who comes down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not people go in and out late at night? A. When my door is shut the staircase is in the passage, and I do not open the door - people go in and out: our street door has got a bolt and a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person wished to go out, one could let the other out and bolt the door? A. Not when the door is all fastened; the passage door has a lock to it, and that locks the staircase in - the gate has a bolt to it; we take the key of the door inside the room where we live every night; we always call up to know if the lodgers are in; I will not swear that is the invariable practice - I do not know Thomas Ainsley; I never in my life heard the name, and never saw such a person at my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what had you for dinner that day? A. That day I and my husband had some rump tails for dinner - that was on Wednesday, and we both had the same for supper - we both dined off beef-steaks next day.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two comfortable dinners then on Wednesday and Thursday? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What had you on Tuesday? A. On Tuesday we did not have any thing; if I have not the money I do not have any thing. We were married at Whitechapel three years ago; I have had no talk with my husband about this story, nor he with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you went up stairs, when the money was paid to your husband? A. About eleven o'clock, I went up, and my husband went up after that, about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. What, when he received the money? A. Yes - the prisoner went in and out very regularly, like a lahouring man - I do not know where he worked; he was a labouring man, but I do not know what sort of labour he followed; he used to go out regularly at six o'clock in the morning, come home about nine to breakfast, and again at twelve and four - those were his regular hours.</p>
               <p>HENRY BOLTON. I have known the prisoner since last February; he was constantly standing in Wentworth-street - I never saw him employed as a labourer; I have seen him for hours together in Wentworth-street, at two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared to have been drinking a good deal? A. He seemed greatly excited, and his mind being under the influence of much liquor, I should hardly suppose he knew what he was doing.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. Allpress came to my house between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening of the 28th of August; he had three wounds, each of them laid the bone or covering of it bare; the skin was broken in all the wounds - great violence it appeared had been used; I did not consider his life in any degree of danger- he had fever to a slight extent: I could not judge what instrument had inflicted the wounds, but should think a weapon of this description very likely to have inflicted them - his eye, I fear, is entirely lost - that is the only injury which still continues; he has got well in other respects - he cannot see at all with his eye now, nor has he since I first attended him.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker. I saw a blow struck by the prisoner - I saw no provocation given - I was eighty yards off; the blow was given with this bit of wood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you agree with the witness that the prisoner seemed intoxicated? A. He seemed in liquor; I cannot say whether he knew what he was doing - he knew his daughter, who he met about two minutes after, as I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you took him to the station-house he met his daughter, did he? A. Yes, she spoke to him first - she said, "What have you done, father?" he said he had done what he intended to do, and he hoped he had killed him - that is all I heard him say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, - I deeply lament the injury the prosecutor has received at my hands, but which was solely occasioned by his own outrageous and unprovoked violence and abuse; and when I explain to your Lordship and the Jury the circumstances under which I experienced that violence and abuse, I humbly trust that your Lordship and the Jury will think my case deserving merciful and lenient consideration. I had done some work for the prosecutor, for which he was to pay me 1l. 10s., but when he had paid me 25s., he said if I expected to get any more, I must summon him; I did summon him to the Court of Conscience, in Orange-street, but in consequence of some evidence produced by him as to the work done by me, the Commissioner refused to make any order enforcing payment of my demand. I left the Court, but immediately on getting into the street I was assailed by the prosecutor, and persons in his company, with oprobious epithets, and with such violence and abuse, that I was compelled to seek refuge in a public-house called the Two Bells, where I remained drinking with a friend until the prosecutor, and those who were with him, were gone away; I then left the house with my friend, and went to my own home to fetch a tool, or piece of wood, used by me in my trade, which my friend much wished to see, and borrow (he is in the same trade as me;) I was then a good deal intoxicated. We both then went forward to a public-house, called the King's Arms, to have some more beer; we remained there some time drinking I had occasion to go outside the door, into the street; I happened to have the piece of wood in my hand; at that instant the prosecutor was passing, and seeing me, pointed me out to a man who was with him, and seemed to wish to annoy me: I felt greatly irritated, and at the instant, and on the impulse of the moment I struck him, and inflicted the injury he has sustained. I was very much intoxicated, or even under the provocation I received I should not, I think, have raised my hand against him; but I was irritated at his having a short time before exposed and abused me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060015"/>street, in addition to refusing payment of what I conceived to be a just demand. I sincerely lament the occurrence - I am in a very infirm state of health, and throw myself on the mercy of my prosecutor and the Court.</p>

            . In May, 1831, I lived at No. 8, King-square, near the back of Mr. Kent's premises - I and my mother were sitting up on the night of the 6th of May, at work; I remember, at an early hour in the morning, going to draw the curtains of the window - I looked out of the window, and saw two men, who were the two prisoners; they were close against the dust-bin; I observed their faces particularly - the tallest (Anderson) had his face towards me; they both stood there - I saw Cross' face, but not then; when he turned away from the dust-bin, I saw his face - it was day-light, just before four o'clock in the morning, and I saw two females standing at a distance from the dust-bin: one of the females had two baskets in her hand; each of the prisoners took a parcel from the dust-bin, and put it into the woman's baskets - they were wrapped in brown paper; the woman's bonnet came off, and the other female put her hand to her head, and put her bonnet on; Cross said,"Never mind your bonnet, come along without it" - she said, "Harry, I must have my bonnet, it looks so to go without it, but you cut" - that woman was convicted this time last year; her name was Sarah Hooker - they all went away, the men rather before the women; the two men had occasion to pass our window as they went away; my mother and I opened the door, and went out; when the women said to the men, "You cut;" my mother said she thought it was time - we followed, and watched them into Long-alley; I gave information there to a private watchman - the dustbin is near the wall, at the back of the prosecutor's premises; I saw Cross at the time the female was having her examination at Worship-street, and recognized him as the man I had seen in the morning, and pointed him out - he saw me and my mother noticed him, and went away; my mother pointed him out to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long ago was that examination? A. This time twelvemonths - I have never seen Cross since till I saw him in the House of Correction, in August - I had not seen him before that occasion; it was quite day-light - my mother had the same opportunity of seeing as I had; I am quite positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Anderson. Q. Did you know me before? A. No; I have not seen you since, till you were at Worship-street last month - the dust-bin is about three yards from the window, which was shut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you point them out to the watchman? A. Yes; the two men and the two women - he pursued them directly.</p>

             the curtain aside, and called me to the window; I went, and saw two men at the dust-hole; one with his hand in the dust-hole, taking the parcel out, with his face rather towards me; when he saw me, he rather put the parcel back again, and took away his hand from the dust-hole - the other man, who stood with his back towards me, took the parcel out, and then the one who had his face towards me, took a parcel out also - Auderson is the one who had his face towards me; Cross stood with his back towards me; I saw both their faces that morning, for I opened the door, and followed them down the court - I am certain of them both; I saw Cross at Worship-street when Hooker had her second hearing; my daughter also saw him - he observed us looking at him, and went away as fast as he could.</p>

On Friday, the 10th of August, between five and six o'clock, I was at the back yard door, leading into the yard, and heard my wife speaking to the prisoner; I heard her say, "Oh, you nasty spiteful fellow, to go to our employer to take the bread out of our months;" he said, "Yes, you d - d wh - g b - h, I did;" I then advanced towards him, saying, at the same time, "Will you dare to call my wife a wh - e?" he laid down a trowel, which he had in his hand doing something with some bricks, and took up a hammer - he met me as I was repeating those words, and hit me a most tremendous blow with it on the head; the blow did not stun me - I endeavoured to take the hammer from him, but he parried me off with one hand, and my wife, to save me or prevent a repetition of it, came forward - he directly turned his eyes to her, and gave her a blow with it on the forehead; I endeavoured to get the hammer from him, but failed, and he then made a deadly blow at the infant which she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060017"/>in her arms - he hit me several more blows; I desired my wife to go out and call Murder! she went out immediately, and called Murder! several times - he gave me one or two more blows, and I should have had more, but I prevented him - I did not get hold of the hammer till one or two persons came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive more than one blow on the head? A. Several - there was one here, and two wounds were dressed by the surgeon; when the persons came in he had me round the neck with his left arm, and as he was inflicting the last blow I put my hand up just in time to catch the hammer - a witness rushed forward, and with assistance we got the hammer from him; I had two wounds, which bled most profusely - I went to a surgeon immediately, taking the hammer with me; I was under his care about ten days.</p>

            ; he came in on Sunday evening or morning with Mr. Arueson, my doctor; it was the Sunday after I received the injury, which was on Friday - it was a very severe blow indeed: I should not like to meet with a similar punishment - I was not confined to my bed, but was so weak I could not go to the office to give evidence; I could not attend to my work for ten days after - I was weak; I did not go to work till the Tuesday week following; I went to the Policeoffice the next morning, and went to the surgeon the same evening, with the hammer in my hand - he lives there hundred or four hundred yards from me; he plastered and dressed my head, and I had medicine to take - I believe it was only a bottle; I neither struck the prisoner, nor attempted to do so; he was building an oven in his back kitchen at the time - he was using the trowel; I did not see the hammer near him till he took it up; it was within his reach - when I overheard the conversation between him and my wife I was at the yards door, about two yards from the kitchen and about four yards from where the prisoner was - the place where he was working was open, so that I could see him from the yard door; when I heard him use this language to my wife I did not rush forward, I advanced slowly - I had not been at all troublesome to the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had consulted his attorney to get you out of the house? A. Not that I know of - he gave me notice to quit; I think it was on the Monday before.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean respecting a bastard child? A. Yes - the other was a robbery of a chapel.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. And likewise for a rape, I believe? A. That was the same person - the child; I was charged with rape in that case.</p>
               <p>Q. On an infant eleven years old? A. No, a person twenty-three.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by calling it illegitimacy? A. Because the person, who swore the rape against me, swore the child to me afterwards; I was then about twenty-one years old - I am now twenty-five; I think it was about four years ago - I can almost take on myself to swear it was in 1828 - I was not charged more than once with a rape, that I will swear; I have been a potato-dealer - the affair of the chapel was in November last: I have not been in the habit of singing ballads about the streets; I swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Among other persons that came to the spot, was there a Mr. Patteson? A. I do not know a person of that name, nor Susan Smith - Mrs. Heaps was there, and a Policeman's son, named Cook - I did not see any body else; I went to the surgeon as soon as Heaps and the boy came in and rescued the hammer from him - several persons came to the office to give an account of the transaction; there was a woman named Abbott - I do not know Mrs. Smith or Everard by name - two females came up stairs where they took the evidence down, but they said there was sufficient evidence then, but if they found it necessary they would let them know - they were witnesses on my side; I did not advance to the prisoner with my fist doubled; my fist was down at my side - I felt hurt at my wife being called that name; I advanced to him slowly, not in anger or hostility - I was not in the constant habit of quarrelling with him; I never insulted him - I never had any words but on one occasion, that was a disputation on tea and camomile - that was after I was charged with the chapel robbery; it was after that I went to reside with him - he occupied the back parlour and the back room up stairs;

             On the afternoon of Friday, the 10th of August, I went into the yard for some water, and saw the prisoner doing something to an oven with a trowel - I called him a nasty spiteful fellow, to try to go and take the bread out of our months - he called me a d - d w - g b - h; my husband went into the kitchen, and demanded an explanation why he called me a w - e; he then laid down a trowel which he was working with, took up a hammer and struck my husband on the head; I then went to prevent him striking my husband again - he turned round, and struck me on the forehead with the hammer, and then said he would murder us both - he aimed another blow at the child in my arms; I put up my arm and received the blow on it - my husband then told me to go and call murder; I went to the door, and called Murder! when I came back he still had the hammer in his hand; I brought Mrs. Heaps in, and the hammer was taken from him by her and my husband - my husband had not struck him, nor offered to do it, nor had I.</p>

            . I live at No. 85, Philip-street, Kingsland-road. I went to the house on this occasion, and saw the prosecutor with his head all over blood; the prisoner ran up stairs - the hammer was in the prosecutor's hand when I went in; he showed it to me - I did not hear the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ARNESON. I am a surgeon, and live near Philip-street, about three or four hundred yards from this house. On Friday afternoon, the 10th of August, the prosecutor came to my house, accompanied by Moore; his head was considerably stained with blood, and on the left side of the forehead there was a wound, and another towards the back part of the head, and a slight scratch on the nose - the wound on the forehead was, I should think, such as would be inflicted by a blow from a hammer; it was about an inch long, and penetrated to the immediate covering of the bone of the head, and owing to the swelling of the scalp, was about half an inch deep - the cut on the head was towards the left side, on the upper part, throught the hair, and penetrated to the scull, or its immediate covering; there had been a considerable effusion of blocd - I dressed it; it healed favourably - I did not consider the external wounds dangerous, but could not say that dangerous consequences might not result.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a blow on the head, producing that sort of laceration, a dangerous thing? A. If it is given with considerable force.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it - would a blow producing such consequences be dangerous? A. It might; I was desired at the office to say whether I could pronounce him out of danger a day or two after, and was not then able to pronounce him out of danger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? A. No, I am a licenciate of the Apothecaries' Company; I put some adhesive-plaster on the wounds after washing them with water - I put plaster on each of them; there were three wounds, including the scratch on the nose; Mr. Heath, a friend of mine, saw the prosecutor on the Sunday morning - when I considered the manner in which the wounds had been inficted, I certainly considered dangerous consequences might result.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard what was done? A. No, from what I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of the scalp being divided, you mean the skin? A. The integumeuts.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a man with a hammer in his hand, intending to murder another, split his skull with the greatest case? A. If his arm was quite at liberty, I suppose he might; I should not consider the wounds slight, except the one on the nose; I did nothing to the wounds but putting sticking-plaster on his head - I dressed them afterwards; I gave him physic: if there had been symptoms of fever, I should have bled him; there was no fever - there was a little degree of excitability.</p>
               <p>Q. Much the same as might be produced by hearing his wife called ill names? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you anticipated the slightest injury to the brain, would you not have bled him? A. I should not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060019"/>bled him from apprehension, but if I saw fever approach I should do it; I did not order him to keep his bed, but to keep himself quiet, and abstain from any thing of a stimulating nature, and enjoined spare diet.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there the slightest reason why he should not have gone to work the next day? A. Yes, I think there was; I am sure there was - I coutinued to attend him perhaps eight or ten days, and removed the plaster perhaps five or six times; I called at his lodging the following morning, but heard he had gone to Worship-street office; he called on me in the course of the day - I did not think it necessary to confine him to the house; I saw Mrs. Langford - she was not very bad: her scalp was divided; I mean the skin and integuments.</p>
               <p>Q. What a nail or a pin would do, if drawn across the forehead? A. No, a penknife would; the scalp is perhaps a quarter of an inch thick.</p>
               <p>Q. I am speaking of Mrs. Langford's wound? A. Her wound was not so serious; I did not think it serious at all- I gave her no medicine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. For a blow with a hammer, through the man's hair, to divide the scalp, must it be given with some force? A. Yes, I should say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor and his wife both rushed on me at one time, in a hostile manner, which he admitted in his examination, and then retracted it after being examined - I was at work with the hammer in my hand, and had not time to lay it down, in a little place where I had not an opportunity of getting away from him- from his general conduct, and the manner he rushed upon me, I considered my life in imminent danger, and drove him off with the hammer - I held him in my hands, to prevent his returning on me, and had no hostile intention towards him whatever - I did nothing more than I considered I was justified in doing in defending myself, when I considered I was in danger; I desired that he should leave my house peaceabley, which he would not do; I have evidence to prove his intention was to do me bodily harm before he would leave the house; as to swearing and calling his wife a wh - e, I have never sworn a profane oath for twenty-five years: as to calling her a wh - e, I never did, in the presence of your Lordship and God; I am a sober, steady man - I do not drink a pint of beer a day, nor spirits; I mind my own business, and nobody else, but he is a very violent person, and continues in no place long - he was determined not to leave me without doing me some injury; after this he continued in my house, and the Magistrate was obliged to order him out; and from what I have been informed my locks have been picked.</p>
               <p>MR. ARNESON re-examined. Q. In wounds where no vessels are divided, is the mode in which you treat them merely closing it, and putting on adhesive-plaster? A. It is the most approved method, and if it heals without inflammation, that is all that is done.</p>

            . On Friday, the 10th of August, I lived at the prisoner's house, in Philip-street - I am his housekeeper; Langford and his wife were lodgers. The prisoner was building an oven in his back kitchen - I was up stairs, in the back room, between five and six o'clock; the window was open, and commands a view of the kitchen, where he was - the oven was building by the kitchen wall; the wall was down, and open - the prosecutor occupied the parlour floor.</p>

               <p>Q. If Mr. Langford had any thing to say to the prisoner, could he see him from the yard door very well, without going into the kitchen? A. Yes; the yard door commands a view of where he was, and was within a yard or a yard and a half of him - I heard some words pass between the prisoner and Mrs. Langford, but could not make out what it was; I was coming down stairs, in consequence of a knock at the door, and could see the yard door - Mrs. Langford was then in the yard, and Mr. Langford in the parlour; I heard Mr. Fuller say, "You good-for-nothing muck," and with that Mr. Langford came out, and said,"How dare you call my wife a wh - e?" he came out of the parlour, and ran furiously towards the back door - (he did not walk slowly, with his arms down) when he got to the back door, he rushed violently into the back kitchen; the prisoner was at that time working at the oven - there was a hammer there; I did not see him use it, and there was a trowel - when the prosecutor rushed into the kitchen, the prisoner was at the oven, which stands in the corner, and it was impossible for him to defend himself.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, till Mr. Langford rushed violently into the kitchen, did he come from the oven? A. I never saw him; he could not rush from the oven without my seeing him; when Langford rushed in, it appeared to be with his fist clenched - I saw Langford strike the prisoner in the forehead immediately he came into the kitchen - the prisoner did not strike any blow with a hammer, or any thing, till he received the blow from Langford; I saw one blow, and do not know whether Langford struck more - he appeared to be in a very violent passion indeed, and Mrs. Langford appeared very ill-natured and spiteful; immediately as the blood came she ran to the door; she first of all fell upon the prisoner, to disengage her husband - the prisoner had not seized Langford when he struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to Langford when Langford struck him? A. I do not know, but I saw the blood come; there was no blood till after Langford struck the prisoner - I distinctly saw him strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mrs. Langford rush upon the prisoner? A. The moment the blood came - he had done nothing to her at that time; he appeared to me to strike her in the scuffle, not on purpose; I am sure no blow was struck at her or the baby - he was very fond of the child; the prosecutor's conduct to the prisoner since he has been in the house was very insolent indeed, and very abusive.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner strike any blow? A. No; but I saw the blood come from the prosecutor over his face, but saw no blow struck; I have been the prisoner's housekeeper about five years; he is a widower, I believe; we have three rooms; the back kitchen, the parlour, and the room over it; we have only one chamber - there are two beds, both in the same room.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I made the best of my way towards the spot, and two gentlemen came running down my beat; I stopped one, who made a complaint to me; I stopped him, thinking he might be an offender- at that moment three girls came up, and struck him violently, and as soon as I got them from him he ran off, and four men and the three women came and attacked me, knocked me down, kicked me about as long as they pleased, and robbed me of my handkerchief, which I had in my hand - they kicked me about, and left me all on a sudden; both the prisoners were among those persons, I can swear; the prisoner Austin kicked me violently several times while I was down, and struck me while I was falling - Newman tore my face; I cannot say who took my handkerchief; they searched me all over, and particularly the outside of my watch-pocket; they knocked me about as much as they pleased - I called Murder! till I was exhausted, but no assistance came - they left me altogether, and in the road began singing and dancing; I got up as soon as I could, sprung my rattle, and hallooed Murder! some of my brother officers came up, and went to look for them, and at that time found only three men; they were under Haggerstone-bridge - they were armed with a pailing each; Austin was one of them; they run from under the bridge into the field - Austin was taken, with the assistance of my brother officers, that night; that was not the prisoner at the bar, but his brother - the prisoner was not taken that night; only two were taken that night, and I swore to one at the office on the Friday - in consequence of information, I accompanied my serjeant, on the 28th of August, to the prisoner Newman's house, at Haggerstone; her mother kept the house - as soon as we went in, the serjeant asked me which was the one, and I immediately pointed her out; he charged her with taking the handkerchief, which she denied; he afterwards charged her with having the ticket of the handkerchief in her possession - she denied that, and said she did not know any thing of it; the serjeant searched, and in a drawer in the house found the duplicate of the handkerchief - (handkerchief produced) - this is mine, and what I lost that night; I have had it two years; we took her into custody, and as we took her to the station-house she said she hoped we would not make one girl suffer for all, and that Sam Austin gave her the ticket; she told us where he lived - after securing her, we went and secured him; I knew him again directly, and had not the least doubt of him - we afterwards went to the pawnbroker's with the duplicate - I saw my handkerchief, and swore to it.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 21, Harford-street, Heggerstone. The prisoner Newman, was with me at Camberwell Fair on the night in question - we arrived at Haggerstone about eleven o'clock at night; she was in my cart, and rode home with me - we then went to the George the Fourth at Haggerstone bridge; after we came out of the house, which was about half-past twelve o'clock - we were coming home, and heard a cry of Murder! there were two or three young men and a Policeman down on the ground - they were beating him about; when he got up, my wife said to him, "Good God! I thought they were going to murder you;" he said nothing, but went across the bridge, and brought two more Policeman - they took two young men, and took them to the watch-house; I, my wife, Newman, and her mother went to the watch-house to see what was done with them - he said he had lost a handkerchief and half-a-crown, that there were several women outside, and he should like to have them searched - the women were called in - my wife, Newman, and her mother; the Policeman said, "Is this one?" (meaning my wife); she said, "Do you mean to say I touched you?" he said No, she said, "All I said was, 'are they going to murder you?" Newman was present, but he said nothing to her - I can take my oath she was twenty yards from him; she remained at large till the day her mother was buried, and coming from the church-yard she was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was she to the Policeman? A. About thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You said twenty before? A. Twenty or thirty - I was about thirty yards from the spot.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Seeing him ill-treated, and his life in danger, I suppose you assisted him? A. I said,"If he would be quiet, I would point out the person to him;" I had a child in my arms at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife could hold the child I suppose? A. She was going on about thirty yards ahead - both my wife and the prisoner's mother were going towards Haggerstone - they were ahead.</p>
               <p>Q. Towards the robbery, or away from it? A. Away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060021"/>from it; the moment the Policeman was attacked, I gave my wife the child, and said I would tell the Policeman who had attacked him in that manner - I knew them by sight, not further; I am not acquainted with the prisoners; I only know Newman by where she works - the female prisoner, my wife, and her mother went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other people in the watch-house? A. Nobody but the Policeman - I am positively sure the female prisoner went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she in your company again, having got thirty yards ahead? A. It was my wife and mother that went on; the prisoner was by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Why could not the prisoner hold the child? A. She went to her mother, because a gentleman came up, and said she was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that, after the Policeman got up? A. It was before the Policeman was knocked down at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it was before his handkerchief was taken, or when they came up, and attacked him with sticks? A. A young man came up, and said, "Did you hear the cry of murder?" - I said, Yes; he said, "Well, come along with me to search;" we went down to the side of the canal, and met a Policeman with two or three young men - my wife is not here, nor my mother - it was Newman's mother who is dead; I declare Sarah Newman was not near the spot.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you came up before the Policeman was knocked down. A. I was coming across the bridge when the cry of murder was; when I got up to him, he was down - Sarah Newman, my wife, and her mother all went up the watch-house to see what it was.</p>

When I took the men to the watch-house, three women came up; I did not desire to have them called in - they crushed in; they all pushed in - they were all very much in liquor at the time; the prisoner Newman was not one of those three - I am sure of that; I only knew one of them, and that was Newman's mother - she was very much in liquor.</p>

             re-examined. Q. At what time did you go to the fair? A. About one o'clock in the afternoon; I came away about nine, and got to Haggerstone about eleven, in a donkey cart - we were all sober I declare; we had but one pot of beer the whole day till we arrived at Haggerstone.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you been employed at the fair from one o'clock till nine? A. We took some fruit down to sell; a young man who I took down did - I stood by his stall all the time; I did not sell fruit - I merely went with him; he is not here - he did not come home with us; the prisoner's mother did not go with us.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she in your company? A. When we came home, she said she would go and have a pint of beer with us, and we went to the George the Fourth; we left that house about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve o'clock - my wife is at home; the Policeman says I was not there, now, he gave me an answer in the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a printer and stationer, and live in Aldersgate-street. I was acquainted with the deceased, Mr. Wilkinson; he was in the employ of a gentleman in the City. On Tuesday, the 17th of July, I accompanied him on the river; we started at nine o'clock precisely from Bull-stairs, Blackfriars - we were in a funny, and had no waterman, but rowed overselves; when we got near <placeName id="t18320906-16-crimeloc104">Vauxhall-bridge</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320906-16-crimeloc104" type="placeName" value="Vauxhall-bridge"/>

                        targets="t18320906-16-off103 t18320906-16-crimeloc104"/>, I observed two boats, one a little ahead of us, and the other by the side of us - at the suggestion of Mr. Wilkinson, I made some exertion to prevent the boats getting a-head of us, and we got through the bridge as far as the Spread Eagle - one boat had then got by us, and I saw no more of it; it had shot ahead - when we got to the Spread Eagle we rested on our oars, the other boat being astern of us; we were about fourteen or fifteen yards from the shore on the Middlesex side - I pulled out my watch, and it wanted two minutes to ten o'clock; we remained there, and the boat which was astern shot past us, between us and the shore - I had observed two men in that boat; we remained there till the clock struck - we then went about forty yards further; the boat which had shot ahead between us and the shore ran foul of us - it had turned round and met us; it ran foul of us by rowing the head of their boat against ours - the head of their boat was outside the shore, more from the shore than our boat was; Mr. Wilkinson said, "We are foul of a boat, Smales, lend me a hand to shove off" - I got up in the boat, and at that moment their boat's head had advanced to the centre of ours, side by side, we being nearest to the shore; one of the men in the boat locked the two boats together with his hand, by taking hold of our boat, and holding them together - the other man darted his hand into our boat, and snatched two coats which laid at Mr. Wilkinson's feet; they were mine and Mr. Wilkinson's - he took them out of our boat into his own; I raised the oar out of the water as fast as I could, and endeavoured to strike them - that was the oar nearest to the shore; I was rowing one oar, and Mr. Wilkinson the other - I endeavoured to strike, and at that moment the strange boat was going off; Mr. Wilkinson jumped up in our boat, and endeavoured to jump into the strange boat - the two boats were at that time about six feet apart; I was looking at him when he made the jump, and he jumped into the water - he did not get close to their boat; he caught the gunnel of it with his left hand - he jumped into the water, but his head did not go under water; he caught the gunnel so as to keep his head above water all the time - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether he did or did not strike his head, or any part of his person against the boat? A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060022"/>am certain he did not strike any part of his person against the boat when he jumped from ours; he could barely reach it with his left hand - after he had got hold of the boat with his left hand, the men that were in the strange boat began to strike him with their sculls; he was endeavouring to get his coat - he still kept hold of the boat with his left hand only, and was struggling with them with his right hand at the time they were striking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then closer to the boat than when he first jumped? A. He was holding on with his left hand; his body was close to the gunnel of the boat then, and his head came just above the gunnel; I saw both the men in the boat strike him on the head - I cannot say how many blows they struck; one seemed to strike, and then the other, as if they struck in turns - several blows were given- they appeared to be given with force; he had no hat on- I did not observe them strike him any where but on the head; the blows I saw struck were given with the sculls - I cannot say that I saw any thing else used to strike with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men hold them in one hand, or two? A. I was so much alarmed, I did not notice - he held by the gunnel of the boat for three or four minutes, I suppose; I saw him quit the boat - he appeared to have received a blow, or something then, which sent him back on the water.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he fall from the boat? A. He seemed to leave go his hold, and fall back with his head on the surface of the water; I had seen blows struck the moment before.</p>
               <p>Q. Observing him in this state, what did you do? A. I threw him out a scull or oar from our boat, and called to him to take hold of it; he did not do so, but made again for their boat - he was nearest to their boat then, considerably; he did not quite reach their boat again - he got within about a yard of it; he had gone four or five yards when I called to him to take hold of the oar - he was thrown back on the water, and appeared to recover himself again, and make towards the strange boat; he was swimming in the water - he was considerably out of his depth; when he got within about a yard of their boat again, he was either pushed or struck away from it by some means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the scull or any thing belonging to the boat used on that occasion? A. I could not see the article; it appeared to me to be something, but I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the effect it produced on Mr. Wilkinson? A. He left the boat immediately, and commenced plunging.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that? A. Different from swimming - he was going down, and struggling with his legs; he was up and down five or six times, and then finally sunk, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You endeavoured to strike the men in the boat when the coats were taken - can you say with certainly whether, in that attempt, you struck Mr. Wilkinson or not? A. Most assuredly I did not; he jumped from the boat after I made the blow at them - he was in the boat at the time; the tide was running down at the time - it was in favour of their boat; their boat then made across the river, in a sloping direction - Wilkinson was between our boat and theirs when he struggled and went down, rather nearer to our boat, I think, as the other was then going across; they began to go across at the moment they pushed him, or struck him, when what I name happened; I called Murder! and brought assistance from the shore - the river was searched, and the body found twenty-eight hours after: I recognize Kennedy as one of the men in the boat - I saw the body next day; it was the body of Mr. Wilkinson - it was the body Mr. Davis examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the tide running down when you rowed from Vauxhall-bridge? A. It was; we were rowing against the tide, in order that we might come down with it - we were not very near the shore before we saw the strange boat; I am not much accustomed to the water - I know how to manage a boat; I am not particularly acquainted with the currents of the river - I know when a man is going against tide; the further he is from shore the greater labour - Mr. Wilkinson was desirous of not being overtaken by the boat which was astern, but it ultimately got by.</p>
               <p>Q. When if afterwards run foul of you, did it not drift on you? A. I cannot tell; it struck us in a moment - it was a very nice night indeed; the moon was rising on the other side - I swear it was a light night; I never said it was dark, that I recollect; I do not know that I ever said so - I told Mr. Wilkinson the time by my watch, two minutes before ten, and if it had been very dark, I could not have done that - I will not swear I have not said it was dark, because in the state I was in after the accident, I possibly might have said many things, for I was obliged to be rowed ashore; I believe I did say that I struck once or twice; I said I did not know whether I hit the prisoners or not; I do not know whether the blow took effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you might have struck more than once or twice? A. No, I am quite sure of that - to the best of my knowledge I never said I struck more than once or twice; I will swear I never said I struck more than twice; and swear that I did not do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not strike after your friend was out of the boat? A. I will positively, nor did I strike at any body - the light was as nights generally are, at that time of the year; I could see the boats very near half across the river - I swear that: I recollect the moon was rising on the other side - it was just showing itself; their boat was as near as possible six feet from ours when my friend jumped at it - I was about the middle of the boat then, with an oar in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not more than six feet? A. When he took a spring out of our boat, it drove our boat down the stream - he had not told me he was going to jump; he jumped from the head of the boat - I had an oar in my hand, which I had been attempting to strike the prisoners with, and I had been rowing with it; I was standing when Mr. Wilkinson jumped; the prisoners' boat at that moment was somewhere about even with ours, and about six feet from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not, with your oar, have secured the boat, and brought it alongside yours? A. I was thunderstruck at his jumping out of the boat - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060023"/>jumped towards the side of their boat; his hand caught hold of the rullock, the place where the oars go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinctly see that his face was not struck with the rullock? A. I could not see between his face and their boat, but his left hand caught hold of the rullock; as far as I could possibly distinguish, his head did not go near the boat till he pulled himself to it - his face was sideways at first, and his left hand caught hold of the boat; I am sure he did not strike himself as he jumped out - I thought you meant, could I say his face did not strike while he held to the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, at the very time he jumped, did you not strike at the prisoners' boat? A. I did not, I had just given a blow - I may have given two blows, but it was while the boat was alongside; I did not give any blow after he jumped - he wished to jump into the boat; he was five feet ten inches high.</p>
               <p>Q. His length would come within two inches of the boat then? A. The boat he was in gave way with his jumping, and he got just near enough to catch hold of the boat with his left hand - his body did not touch the boat at that moment; I do not know whether he could swim - I never saw him swim; when he made the second effort to get to the boat, I was about twenty or thirty yards from it - I saw the prisoners strike him.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but the second time? A. He was either struck or pushed with something - I was looking at the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What better means had you of seeing what passed at first, than then? A. Why, I got more frightened, and was screaming Murder! and for help - I cannot say whether he was pushed from the boat, or whether he was struck; if he had been struck with a scull then, I should have seen that - I swear I saw two sculls in their boat when they were striking, sculls or oars; we had both sculls and oars in our boat - I threw my friend out an oar, to catch hold of, when he fell back; thinking he was coming towards my boat - he did not take that, but got towards the prisoners boat again; my oar did not go near him - the boats were twenty or thirty yards distant at that time; I threw the oar as far as I could - I was a good deal agitated and alarmed, but I am sure I did not strike him with it, for he did not come near it; I threw one oar and one scull overboard - I cannot tell which went nearest to him; I do not know which I threw first - I threw them towards him; I cannot tell whether they went to the right or left of him - I know they did not go near him; it would go with the tide - I appeared to have got them out about half way between him and my boat, which was twenty or thirty yards from him at the time - he was nearer their boat; it was a very awkward thing to throw - I threw it into the water as near to him as I could - I did not look at the oar to ascertain if it was bruised any where; I saw the prisoners skiff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the mark of your oar on the gunnel of their skiff? A. Decidedly not.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean that night? A. I have not examined it, only the general appearance of it - I have not ascertained whether there is a mark or not on it; my friend never went down till he was pushed away from the boat - the prisoners attempted to row across the river, immediately on their shoving or striking him away; he went up and down five or six times - I sat down, and endeavoured to row towards him, but having one scull and one oar, the oar overpowered the scull, and sent it back again; I cannot row with an oar and scull, nor can one man in ten.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You are not quite clear whether you struck one blow or two? A. No; nor whether they took effect on the persons in the boat; I struck towards the boat - I am quite certain Mr. Wilkinson was in the boat at the time I struck the blow or blows - I struck no blow after he was out; the moment the boats separated, he jumped, seeing them going off - I am certain the oar and scull I threw out, went considerably short of Mr. Wilkinson's person.</p>

            . I am what is called jack-in-the-water, at the Spread Eagle, Millbank. On the night of the 17th of July I was on the causeway till ten minutes before ten o'clock, when the last boat went away; I was then standing at the water edge, about forty yards from the house; I took my stool to the house; and about five minutes past ten I heard cries of Murder! - I got out of a boat's head, in which I was laying, but did not attend to the cry, till I heard it a second time - I heard a guggling; I knew then it was somebody drowning; I ran to the house, and as I ascended the stairs, I heard the guggling a second time - I called the waiter - he came instantly with me to the causeway, got into a gentleman's boat, and before we took twenty strokes, we came alongside of a boat, with Mr. Smales standing up in it - he put his hands together, and said,"My friend is gone!"</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a night was it? A. A dark night; the moon had not risen.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was there a moon that night. A. There was; it might be rising, but not to throw any light on the river - it was very dark at the time; Mr. Smales pointed the direction the boat had gone in, but I did not see it - the funny was about forty yards from shore, when I heard the guggling noise; I could not discern any boats.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a picturedealer. On Tuesday night, the 17th of July, about five minutes after ten o'clock, I was at Millbank - about forty yards from the Spread Eagle, I saw two boats; I did not see the funny which the gentlemen were in - when I first saw the two boats, they were about four yards apart; two persons were in each boat - I could see that from the shore; the moon was just coming over the houses; I saw one boat come to the other, and saw one leave the other, and go right over.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it left the other, and went over, did you see what was done? A. I observed a pole go up by the shadow of the moon; I could not see in which boat it went up - I do not know what was done with it; it was not light enough to see - it went down again towards the boat which was going away; there was two men in each boat at that time - I afterwards heard a cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it at the same time as you saw the pole go up, that you heard the cry of murder? A. No, I saw the pole after murder was called; I saw the shadow of the pole about two minutes after I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060024"/>the cry of murder - the pole was going towards the boat, which was rowing away.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Fore-street, Lambeth. On the evening of the 17th of July I saw the prisoner Brown; I do not know the time, as I had been asleep - I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and it was after that time; I cannot tell how long I had been asleep - Brown came and knocked at my door; I asked who was there - he said, Me! I got up, and when I opened the door, he asked me if I would be so good as to let him leave his coat there till morning; he said nothing else - I said, "Very well," and he put the coat down; he gave me no reason for leaving it - I knew him before; I did not observe any thing particular about him - he did not appear to have been walking in a hurry; I heard he was taken up next morning, and took the coat to Jane Spicer, my mother.</p>

            . I am a waterman's apprentice. On Tuesday, the 17th of July, I was employed in the barge, Hieron, which was under repair at Lambeth; I know both the prisoners - Kennedy had been sleeping on board that barge for some time before the 17th; on Tuesday, the 17th, about ten o'clock, I think, but cannot tell, as I never looked at the clock, Kennedy came to me for the key - my barge laid about a mile and a quarter from the Spread Eagle; he appeared to me to be in a muck sweat I told him I was going myself directly, but he pressed me to give him the key - I did, and he went towards the barge by himself - I went myself in less than half an hour, and slept on board that night, and a person named Flack; I did not see Kennedy when I went into the cabin, but he must have been there, for he got up with me and Flack in the morning, and he, Flack, and I, went to a beer-shop kept by Bean; I asked Bean's son for a light - he said they had no fire; Kennedy pulled out some papers and a book out of his pocket - he tore some of the papers, saying he wanted to burn them, and I tore some of them, not knowing what they were; the pieces were thrown into the grate of the room we were in - a light was brought in at last - Flack lighted his pipe, and threw the paper which he lighted it with into the grate, and the papers caught fire; I cannot say whether they were partly or entirely burnt - I was going out in about an hour, when the officers came and took Kennedy into custody; they afterwards called me - I went to them, and went before the Magistrate with them, and after we had been before the Magistrate, Kennedy told me, that he and Brown were guilty, but he would turn up me, Lyons, and Flack; we were all in custody under suspicion at the time, but he said we need not fear, for he would turn us up - he told me he had put one of the coats in a barge at the back of a barge-buileder's place, but the barge-builder had moved away; I informed a gentleman at the office of it; Evans, was present, and I described where the barge was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You informed nobody of it till you was taken up? A. No, I did not know of it - I did not know whether he might have picked the papers up; I took one paper in my hand, and said, "Let us read this," and he snatched it out of my hand - I went into the house to have some beer, and knew nothing of the papers till I got in there; I asked for the light, as Kennedy asked me to ask for one - he did not tell me that night that he had stolen the coats; I do not recollect seeing him in the barge - I had been out drinking with some young men that night; I do not think he can read, but cannot swear he cannot - he told me after the examination, that he and Brown were guilty; he did not say of what - we were then in custody at the Thames Police office; he told me where he had put the coat - that is what he was speaking of when he said he was guilty, and he said, "When I get cast I shall pray;" I said, "My good! Bill, if you are guilty, now is the time to pray."</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Upper Belgrave-place, Pimlico. On the 19th of July I examined the body of the deceased in an out-house at the Spread Eagle; it was afterwards opened, in my presence, at a house in Jewin-street; there was a wound on the bridge of the nose, about an inch long - the bone was bare, and slightly broken; there were marks of a considerable bruise on the forehead - and on nearly the whole forehead there was extravasation of blood under the skin; there was the mark of a bruise behind the right ear to a slight extent, and also behind the left ear; the wounds behind each ear were slight, and about the size of a half-crown; there was a slight bruise on the back of one hand, and I think it was the left hand; I observed no other appearance of external violence - the body was afterwards opened in my presence, and on the surface of the brain there was an extravasation of blood on the upper part, as large as my hand; it was quite at the top of the head, and external to a certain degree backwards - there was no external mark there at all; there was no further appearance of injury within the head - the injury on the forehead did not extend beyond the bone; I observed no appearances in any other part of the body.</p>

               <p>Q. To what do you attribute his death? A. My opinion is, that the blow on the nose or forehead produced stunning, and he was incapable of supporting himself in the water; I attribute the extravasation of blood on the top of the head to the blows on the forehead and nose - those injuries were sufficient to cause death ultimately; I consider the immediate cause of his death to be, that he was stunned by the blow, and being incapable of exerting himself in the water, the drowning completed his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He died by drowning? A. I consider he would not have drowned if it had not been from the blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had reeled from the boat by a blow or shove, and afterwards recovered himself so as to make towards the boat again, should you consider that man stunned? A. There are different sorts of stunning - a blow over the nose might stun him; it is very common for a blow on the nose or forehead to cause blood on the head - the extravasation of blood was on the surface of the brain, not on the top of the head; and that certainly might have been the effect of a blow on the forehead - it very commonly produces extravasation in front of the forehead, and the internal injury on the brain also; if the body had struck against any thing in the water after death there would be external appearances probably, and extravasted blood - I state that as my experience; a dead body receiving a blow would not exhibit a mark of a bruise to the same extent, but there would be the appearance of it something similar to blows inflicted during life; there would be a difference between blood coagulated and not - the appearances depend on the blood under the surface; there would be a slight difference in the colour, and a certain degree of redness - I do not say it is necessarily so - I have known instances of blows after death where there have been no appearances, it depends on the degree of violence, and how long after death - the appearances I found on the brain could not be the effect of a blow after death; this injury would have caused inflammation, which is frequently fatal - I swear the blow on the forehead was a mortal wound, but the cause of death was drowning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could extravasation of blood on the brain be produced by suffocation in drowning? A. I am not aware that drowning ever occasioned such appearances.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at the Thames Police-office, and produce the examination of the prisoners. The first examination was on the 18th of July - I have my book containing the original examination - the examinations returned to the Court are fairly copied from the book, and read over to the witnesses, in the prisoners' presence; this statement is my hand-writing, and is signed by Captain Richbell, the Magistrate - I think it was read over to the prisoners, but am not sure; I took it in my book from their own lips, sentence by sentence, and think I read it over to them - they have not signed it; they were under examination on this charge; nothing was said to induce them to make the statement -I think what they stated on the 18th was not read to them; here is the entry made by me in the book from their months on the 18th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Magistrate sign that book? A. No - he was present when it was taken; I am quite positive every word that occurred was taken down accurately - I think the subsequent statement was read over to them; the copies which are verified by the Magistrate were not made in their presence.</p>
               <p>COURT. He may use his book to refresh his memory as to what passed.</p>
               <p>Witness. On the 18th Kennedy said "I was at Mr. Bean's beer-shop all day, and went on board the barge just after the clock struck ten - Kitley and Flack went with me; I turned out this morning a few minutes before six o'clock, or after I cannot tell to a minute, and went to Mr. Bean's - I walked afterwards down High-street, and coming back again Kitley said to me "The officer has been here, inquiring after you;" I said, "Which way is he gone? I will go after him;" directly, the officer came and said, 'Kitley, I want you.'" Brown said, "Last night I was standing at the corner of Princes-street, about a quarter to nine o'clock, and some young chaps asked me whether I would go and have some beer at the Feathers - I said' No, I have no money - I mean to take a walk;" a young chap who works in a Dartford barge came up, and asked me to take a walk - we went down Bishop's-walk, round the Westminster-road, and down the Newcut - we went up as far as Blackfriars-bridge and back,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060026"/>then we went down Union-street, and round the Borough, along by the Elephant and Castle, and there I left him - then we came down by Bethlem, and along High-street, home; directly I got in doors I went to bed, and as soon as I got to bed the clock struck eleven." - They were remanded for further examination, and brought up again on the 26th of July, and at the close of the examination were asked if they had any thing to say - Kennedy said, "I have nothing more to say than what I said before - that is that I am not guilty of drowning the man; I was in the boat at the time, but neither one nor the other did not strike him - his own friend made a stroke at me, and instead of striking me he struck his friend; that is all I have got to say." - Brown said, "I never touched no coat, nor never got off my seat where I sat on, nor never struck no blow, nor lifted any thing to strike with - I have nothing more to say." Kennedy then said, "Can I speak again - when Mr. Wilkinson struck me he went along the boat with one hand over the other, till he got to the stern of the boat; he made three or four attempts to leave go, and he left go at the stern of the boat; with taking the spring out of his own boat, and leaping over into ours, just as though he was coming head first into our boat - the answer he made, says he, 'Oh, I have hurt myself,' but very lowly spoke; I should suppose he must have come with his face first against the boat, for he only just caught hold with his hands - that is all."</p>
               <p>Kennedy's Defence (written). My Lord, and Gentleman of the Jury, - Placed as I am this day before you, upon so solemn and grave a charge, my feelings, as you must naturally suppose, are most powerfully worked upon; and indeed so overcome am I at this time, that I hardly know how to address you; if, therefore, I should be censured for saying so little upon so serious a charge, I trust that it may not be construed into a supposed indifference as to my truly awful situation. My Lords and Gentlemen, as there have appeared in the daily papers various reports relative to the unfortunate affair which now engrosses your solemn and serious attention, and as many of those reports are erroneous, and have reflected (and severely so too) upon the character and disposition of myself and my unfortunate companion, I do most earnestly entreat that you will at once divest your minds of any undue impression that those reports may have made, and which I am sure you will do. My Lords and Gentlemen, - as regards the evidence which you have this day heard, there is little remark I have to make thereon; but trust you will allow me to assure you (and in this trying and awful moment I would not deceive), that neither I nor my companion went out with a premeditation to do the slightest personal violence. I was distressed to the utmost at the time, as my witnesses will prove to you; but I accompanied my fellow prisoner, and started out on the fatal evening, under different intentions. We went out to obtain a few coals - we saw the deceased's boat - we arranged to approach them, to see who they were; we observed the deceased and his friend had their coats off - we agreed to try and get their coats - we succeeded; to recover them the deceased jumped overboard, towards our boat: he jumped with his face against the boat; he said, "Oh! I have hurt myself." While in the water the deceased's friend, Mr. Smales, struck at me three times with his oar - Mr. Smales' blows fell on deceased's head. After the third blow with Mr. Smales' oar, deceased left go his hold of our boat; my fellowprisoner began to row away - I had no scull, having lost mine overboard at the time I took the two coats out of their boat: we succeeded in getting away; I had no idea that the deceased was in any peril or danger of his life, for he was close to his friend's boat, and made a splashing noise, as if swimming; I was unconscious that harm had ensued; and, Gentlemen, I can assure you that no one more than myself can more deeply lament and deplore the melancholy catastrophe. Depending, Gentlemen, upon your discrimination, intelligence, and impartiality, I trust and repose my unfortunate case to your hands, and look forward to a favourable result.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence (written). My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, - The defence which my unfortunate fellow-prisoner has addressed to you, has embraced every circumstance connected with the melancholy occurrence which now demands your most solemn and serious attention; little, therefore, remains for me to say, but I trust you will pardon me while I intrude a short time upon your patience. The allusions which have been made by my fellow-prisoner, relative to the public prints, will not, I am sure, be unattended to, consequently I have little to apprehend on that head. My Lords and Gentlemen - I was legitimately born, but lost a kind and indulgent father when I was only eleven years of age; I was then sent to a parochial charity-school, at which I made small progress in education, and which, I am sorry to observe, was soon totally forgotten by me: I remained at school three years, and was then removed, since which period I have endeavoured to obtain an honest livelihood. I never was before in custody upon a criminal charge. My Lords and Gentlemen - allow me to say, that in conjuction with my fellow-prisoner, our intentions on that fatal evening were very opposite to personal injury or violence; and with him I deeply lament and deplore the melancholy catastrophe. Gentlemen - trusting to your calm and dispassionate view of the evidence which has been adduced, I submit my fate to your discriminating consideration, looking forward to a favourable result.</p>

On the 24th of July I had been to a wedding, and returned home about eleven o'clock; I saw my purse about six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060028"/>and did not miss it till next morning; I was the worse for liquor, but was more tired than in liquor - I had been to Hackney, and was brought home in a glass coach; Mrs. Collman and other friends were with me; I had been there in the morning, and returned home to see some patients; I then went there to dinner, and with the toasts "Three times three" I was exhausted and unconscious.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? A. You may call me drunk, if you like, I do not think I was - I believe it was more fatigue and exhaustion; I do not know whether my purse was in my possession when I came home; I saw it lost at six o'clock - it then contained the bill and money stated in the indictment; I found next morning, about half-past seven o'clock, that I had lost it - the prisoner was the only servant who slept in the house; my friends undressed me in my bed-room, and threw my trousers in the corner of the room - the purse was in the trousers pocket; my clothes were afterwards removed to my dressing-room, which joins my bed-room; I had no suspicion of the prisoner at first; I stopped payment of the notes at the Bank - she remained with me till the 3rd of August, when she was taken up; my brother-in-law and his brother undressed me - I got the notes from the Bank, and have them here; I have not found the bill of exchange.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He sent me to Hackney next morning to look for his watch, and his mother-in-law brought it to town. Witness. I sent her to Hackney for my watch, as my wife told me it was left there; a friend had taken it to take care of, but I did not know it; the lady of the house brought it while the prisoner was gone for it; I was never drunk before in my life.</p>

            . I was shopman to a linendraper. I heard of the prosecutor's loss in August, and about four days before that (I now forget the date) the prisoner came to our shop and bought a shawl and goods amounting to 2l. 12s., for which she paid me a 5l. note - she then bought goods which came to less than 1l., and paid me another 5l. note; I am quite certain of her person - I wrote on the notes the name of Mrs. Alley, Waltham-stow, who, she said, was her mistress; I went to my employer's house - he took me to the prosecutor's, where I saw the prisoner, and was confident she was the person -I paid the notes to our cashier - (looking at two) these are them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Collman's shopmen can prove I did not leave the house that night till after seven o'clock, but Mr. Collman has put them out of the way to prevent their coming. Witness. She paid me the notes between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; she said one note was her mistress's, and the other she received for her wages, which was her reason for changing both.</p>


               <p>MR. COLLMAN. These are the notes which I had in my purse - I got the numbers from Esdaile's bank, where I received them; I did not know the numbers when I lost them - I have no writing on them; on my oath they are the notes, for I asked Esdaile's the numbers.</p>

On the 20th of July I was on duty in front of the Postoffice, and saw the two prisoners, and another, in company, walking up and down on the opposite side several times; I observed them look into Mr. Payne's shop, and watched them - the one not in custody went into Mr. Payne's shop, and brought out two hats - the prisoners were outside, and could see him come out: he ran across the road, and went in at the south gate of the Post-Office - I went through the principal entrance, and met Smith at the back of the office; I took the two hats from him - I asked him where he was going with them; he said some boy had given them to him to carry - I took him into Mr. Payne's shop; I saw Moore there, and asked what he had been inquiring for - I took them both, having seen them all three together in company.</p>
               <p>Moore. Q. Where was I when the man brought the hats out? A. You stood at a post about two doors from the shop.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was walking down the back of the Post-office; a lad came and asked me to direct him to Moorfields, and asked me to hold the hats, while he tied his shoe - directly I got them, an officer came up.</p>
               <p>Moore's Defence. I was going to meet a young man, named Hendon; I did not exactly know Castle-street, where I was to meet him - I met two young men in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and asked them to direct me; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060029"/>said they did not know it - I went into this shop, and the officer detained me.</p>

On the 1st of August, Mrs. Bamfield charged the prisoner with taking these sashes; I was at the corner of Red Lion-market, and had seen him with them, but as he dealt in old materials, I took no notice, till she gave me information; he had then gone through a court, into the house where he works - I went, and said, "Bill, I want those windows;" he took them up - I told him to carry them back to where he took them from; he put them down, and would not take them further - I took him into custody; his employ is cutting up fire-wood.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

We do; the clickers write on the inner leathers - we sell shoes with the mark on them, but do not sell by retail; I might accommodate a friend - such a thing may happen eight or nine times a year, and my brother might do so - we never allow our work-people to sell to their friends; the prisoner's daughter is sixteen or eighteen years old - he came to me with a good character; the leather had been decreasing some time - he had 22s. a week; ours is entirely shipping and country trade - his wife or daughter bound for us, and would come into our passage for goods, but not where the goods are deposited - I knew where he lived before.</p>

I took him to the station, showed him the bundle, and said, "You are charged with stealing this;" he said, "I know it;" it was in a handkerchief, which he said was his; I said he should have it at the trial - I had seen the bundle thrown over the fence of the vacant space where it had been dropped on the 17th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening - Shepherd got over the fence, and threw it over; Davis took it up, and walked away with it - the lowest part of the fence is about six feet high; no one could look over it, but there were vacancies through which persons might have looked; I took Davis with the bundle - I said, "What is this?" he said, "I don't know; I picked it up - if I had looked at it I should have taken it to the coachman;" I did not see Brennan then.</p>

I had been five months out of employ - I took the articles through distress; I did not take them off the premises - I threw them into a place where I was sure the coachman's wife would find them; I meant to pawn them for a shilling or two for support, and when I got employ I would have returned them; the Earl of Clarendon has been a kind friend to me for ten years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there many persons about? A. Yes, a great many - I cannot tell whether the prisoner's back was towards me when I saw the bag in his hand, he was at some distance; a person named Ford came to the Police-office, and said he was a constable - Ford had said that he saw the prisoner snatch the bag from my hand, but he denied it then; I had not been there the day before.</p>

            . I am a servant out of place.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not running yourself? A. No, the prisoner was running towards me; the last place I had was in the service of a clergyman in Grosvenor-street - I have been out of place three months; I was not dismissed for dishonesty - he did not give me a character, but I dare say he would.</p>

             (Police-constable T 4.) I took the prisoner - he said he did not know what I took him for; he then said would I take a sovereign and say nothing about it - I said No; he then said he had a wife and family, and would I take two sovereigns, as it would injure him - I said No; he then went on a little further, and said if he were to give me 5l. would I let him go - I said No, not if he were to give me 50l., as I had a wife and family too; I then took him to Paddington station - a man, who false swore himself, gave him to me.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And I believe, in consequence of his swearing what the Magistrate knew could not be true, he was not heard? A. I believe so - he told me he was a special constable; the prisoner said he did not know what he was taken for, and I said I could not tell him, for I did not know then - this is the bag and property.</p>
               <p>LADY ST. GERMAIN's. This is my property - I am sure the prisoner is the man who had something in his hand, but I could not see that it was my bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see his face? A. I cannot say that I did, but I know the man from the whole of his appearance - I can be positive of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Though you do not know whether his face was towards you, had you an opportunity of seeing his face? A. I saw rather his side face, but I saw his figure altogether - I saw enough to be quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was talking to two gentlemen, and this Ford came and said"I want you" - he took me to the carriage, as the soldiers were going the other way; Ford said, "I will have a job now," and he afterwards told my wife if she would let him have 5l. he would be out of the way - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060032"/>swore I snatched the reticule from the lady's arm, and made two attempts at it; he said so on the Monday, and on the Tuesday, and the Magistrate said his evidence would not do at all.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Whetstone; there was a mob of twenty or thirty hay-makers - I went up and found the prisoner, who had knocked a woman down; I took him and found these shoes across his arm in Black Horse-lane, two hundred yards from the hay-stack.</p>

            . I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner with the shoes; there was no man near him at the time, but I saw a man soon afterwards - the prisoner was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man by the side of me. Witness. No, there was not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was intoxicated and had quarrelled with a woman, that on going down the lane, a man, who was assisting him home, gave him the shoes to hold while he took some tobacco from his pocket, and he was apprehended by Crabb, who had followed him, to prevent his illusing the woman.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CRABB re-examined. Q. Did you go there in consequence of his ill-treatment of a woman? A. Yes, a respectable gentleman called me as he had ill-used a woman - the people had got her away; he said she was his wife, and he threatened to murder her - he was not drunk, but had been drinking; I had seen him go up the lane before, and he had no shoes then but those on his feet.</p>

I had been to my sister's to get my clean shirt to go to Mr. Jackson, in Smithfield, my employer - my sister was not at home; and as I was coming back down Regent-street, the officer took me - I asked him what for; he said he had got me; I saw some one run and throw the handkerchief down - the officer pulled me up against the shutters, took up the handkerchief, and said I stole it, which is false - I had never seen Smith before; I was on the curb-stone, making room for people to pass.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. Akers dropped the handkerchief from his hand when I put my hand on his shoulders - itwas near the shutters.</p>

             (Police-constable C 88). I saw the prisoner and the witness scuffling, at about twenty minutes past nine o'clock; I went up and saw the bundle; the prisoner struck the witness - he ran off; I pursued and took him - I am sure he is the person; I took him to the shop, and got this paper from Mr. Brown.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Oxford-street; I heard an alarm, and ran in to Bond-street, where I was stopped; the boy said I had taken the paper; I was on an errand, and had been playing in the park.</p>

On the morning of the 14th of July I saw the prisoner without a bundle - I afterwards saw him with one, about five yards from the entrance of the yard where the carriage was; I followed, and stopped him in Oxford-street - I found these two cushions on him in a butcher's apron; I asked what he had got - he said Nothing; I said, "Do you call this nothing?" he then said they were his own, and he had found them in Oxford-street - I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was waiting in Oxford-street for a man to come to pay me a little money; I was to meet him between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - I was walking about and found these cushions, which I tied in my apron.</p>

On the 7th of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and desired to look at some prints; I showed her some dresses, and she desired to look at some off the piece - I brought some down to her, but they would not suit, and she desired to look at others; as I was getting another piece off the shelf I turned my face, and saw her put a dress into her basket, which she had brought in with her; I cut her seven yards off one piece which she had chosen; she then looked at some lining muslin, and while I was getting that I named the circumstance to Mr. Driver, one of the partners, and he desired me to follow her out, which I did, for about twenty yards; I then accused her of having a piece of print, and desired her to let me look in her basket; she gave it to me directly, and I saw the print the goods which she had bought were on the top of it; Mr. Cranch followed me out, and brought her back to the shop - she said she was very sorry for it, but she had taken it; and she said, in going to the station, that she would give me a sovereign if I would let her go; she was taken to the station, and given to the officer; I had seen her repeatedly in the shop buying goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do all the three partners take an active part in the business? A. Yes, and all their names are over the door; there were no other customers in the shop; I am quite sure the prisoner took the print - I served her afterwards, because I heard it was a regular plan to let persons go out of the shop with what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060034"/>they had taken; I am sure she took the cotton - there are twenty-eight hands in the shop altogether; I had seen her come in with the basket, here is a mark on this cotton - it is a gown-piece - she did not say it must have got in by mistake; I gave the basket to Cranch.</p>

The prisoner was eight days in my service, and in consequence of her being tipsy she was discharged, and on the day stated she was intoxicated; I told her she must leave - she was very impertinent, and said she would not go till she had had her tea; I said, "Get your tea" - she did not seem to do that, but was very saucy; I then said I should look through her boxes - she said, "You may look, you have nothing to lose;" I then looked into a bundle of hers, and found a loaf of bread quite new - she said it was her own, and she had bought it; I sent for an officer, who found the other things.</p>

               <p>MR. EVANS. This handkerchief and spoon are mine, and I believe the bread was; she gave us a reference to a Clergyman at Bath; she did not say she had lived in town, but we find she has; property worth 20l. or 30l. was found in her box.</p>

On the 11th of July the prisoner came there for a night's lodging; he slept in the same room with me, but in a separate bed - I got up about six o'clock the next morning, and left my trousers, waistcoat, and braces on the top of my bed; I left him in bed - I went to the room in an hour and a half, and missed the property; he was then gone; I overtook him in the layers in the Liverpoolroad - I said, "You have got my clothes;" he pulled them out of his hat, threw them down, and asked me to let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this a kind of lodging-house? A. Yes; I cannot exactly swear the prisoner is the person I saw in bed - I cannot swear to these clothes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You missed your trousers, waistcoat, and braces? A. Yes; and they were found in the prisoner's hat - I believe them to be mine, but I cannot swear to them, nor say that the prisoner is the man; I have not seen him since; I was cleaning the parlour when he went out, and I took him between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

On the 19th of July Francis came home between eleven and twelve o'clock, before the prisoner; I saw him - he did not appear to me at all intoxicated nor elevated with liquor; he appeared to me ruffled in his temper - he knocked at my door, and asked for a light; I gave him one, and while I was getting it, he put his hands together, and said to me, "You would have been frightened to hear the expressions she has been calling me up in Shoreditch;" he said she had said she would not let him come in that night, and he would not let her in; the prisoner came up stairs in about a quarter of an hourshe opened the room door and went in; I heard him tell her to go out - I did not hear whether she made any answer; I then heard basins, plates, and things being broken - I could not tell whether they were striking each other, but there was a great rustle between them, which continued a very few minutes; whether any blows were given I cannot possibly tell, but I heard her say, "I will stab you with a knife;" she had been in the room a very few mintes when I heard that - it was altogether a very few minutes; they had been rustling together before I heard her say that; she almost immediately called Nancy! Nancy! meaning Leonard, who lived in the room underneath; she seemed frightened - Leonard went up immediately; I was partly undressed, and did not go into the room till the Policeman took the prisoner away; I then went and asked for a light; I had heard no words between them but what I have stated - there were words between them, but what I could not understand; it was before she said she would stab him - but they were both in a passion, and I could not understand what was said, nor tell whether any blows were given; there might or might not be blows - I heard the crockery breaking before I heard her say she would stab him; the deceased was about fifty years old, or more - he was a very powerful man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He was a black, I believe? A. A tawney - he appeared a foreigner; I had not seen the prisoner the early part of the day, and did not see her come in that night - I was in my room with the door closed; I knew her by her voice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many minutes do you think she had been in the room before she said she would stab him? A. I suppose five or six - they had been quarrelling all that time.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house - Francis had been there six days; I knew the prisoner before she came to that house; she had only lived with Francis about a week the last time - she had lived with him before, and they parted when he went to sea; he had returned about a week - I was not at home on the 19th when he came in, but was at home when the prisoner came in, and heard her go into her room; I had not heard Francis say any thing before that - when she had been there about five minutes, she called out Nancy two or three times pretty quick; she did not seem much flurried - if she had not called I should not have known any thing had happened; I had heard the crockery breaking, but how it was broken, or by whom, I cannot tell - the prisoner said, when I went up stairs, that she had broken it; when I went up stairs I found the prisoner laying on the floor, and Francis had his foot on part of her body, and her hair in his hand, and he was aiming to strike her - she had her cap off; I said, "Francis, what are you doing?" he put his hand to his breast, and said,"See what Kitty has done!" his breast was streaming with blood - it was all over blood; I thought he had a red flannel waistcoat on - I asked Catherine how she had done it; she said she had thrown the bason at him - nothing more passed: the prisoner was very much in liquor - whether he had beat her when she came home I cannot tell; I have known him beat her - his temper was violent; I do not know whether he was in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she been in the habit of calling you before? A. No; she used to get out of his way when they quarrelled; she has often got out of his way because she was afraid of him - I live in the room under them; she called loud enough for me to hear; a struggle might happen in the room without my hearing it - they so often quarrelled, I did not notice whether there was struggling or not; the breaking of the crockery sounded loud, as if it was dashed about the room; when I went up, he was making an aim to strike her with his fist, and had hold of her hair to beat her; she could not get away from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen her that evening before? A. Yes, at the George and Dragon, about half-past eleven o'clock, and desired her to come home; she came home in a few minutes - I told her to come home, as I knew how he used to beat her, and I was afraid he would beat her for being out late; she did not express any unwillingness to go home, nor ill-will against him - she went directly; he was very jealous of her.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as Francis. I was in bed, and heard him come home alone, and in about a quarter of an hour I heard the prisoner come home - she went up stairs - I did not hear her go into her room; as soon as she got up stairs I heard him say, "You shan't come in," and heard her say she would come in; I heard no quarrelling or scuffling - I heard the crockery break-I heard a rustling, as if he was endeavouring to keep her out, and she was endeavouring to get in; it appeared as if only one person was throwing crockery about; by whom it was thrown I cannot tell - I heard the prisoner call Nancy three times quickly, as if she wished her to come up as soon as she could; I should not have known any thing had happened if she had not called - I went up stairs; the man was then laying under the window, and the prisoner sitting on a chest.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 19th of July, about five minutes before I went up to the room, I was in the street and heard the prisoner call out Little Ann! Little Ann! very lond a great many times, as if she was anxious for her to come - I heard nothing more till I was called up; the first thing I then saw was the deceased in an inclining position over the back of the chair - the prisoner was going about the room backwards and forwards, as if in distress; I noticed the blood spurting from a wound in the deceased's right breast - I then said he had been stabbed; the prisoner replied, "No, he has not been stabbed - I have only set his nose bleeding by throwing a basin at him;" I then looked at him and saw another wound bleeding fresh over his left eye - I said again to the prisoner; "This man has been stabbed:" she said, No, he had not - I looked about, and just on the other side of the room, by a chair, I picked up this knife; there are marks of blood on it, particularly on the lower part, and high up it is greasy; the other knives in the room were not of the same kind as this - they were all round points; when I picked the knife up, the prisoner said, "That is not the knife, it was little Ann's knife" - I turned round to little Ann, and asked where her knife was; Tucker said she had taken little Ann's knife down stairs - I went down to little Ann's room, and on a table found a knife, which I now produce; there are no marks of blood on that - the knife was damp; I took the prisoner to the station-house: when I told her I must take her into custody, she immediately rushed to the table, and took another knife out of a drawer, which I took from her; and as we were going to the station-house, she said, "This is through my speaking to another man" - she afterwards said he had no business to leave his money in Old-street as he had, and that he had left 20l. odd, with somebody else in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the house when you heard the cry for little Ann? A. I stood in the street opposite to the house; the window was shut - I had been there before, on account of hearing them talk loud; I had heard a noise about ten minutes before from the same room, from the prisoner only; I did not see her, but knew her voice - she had been released from the deceased's grasp when I got up, and was pacing the room; the knife is a table knife - the deceased was cook on board ship; I found the room in confusion, broken crockery laid about, and some was outside; there was no cloth on the table, the crockery was dinner articles.</p>

            . I am landlady of the house - the prisoner took the lodgings for herself and Francis - I heard him come in on the night of the 19th; I was in bed, and heard the prisoner come in about half an hour after him - I heard the crockery breaking, and heard her call Nancy two or three times; I went into the room almostly directly, and saw the deceased with his foot on the prisoner's body, her hair in his hand, and his hand was rising as if he was about to strike her, but he seemed very faint - he gave me a round pointed knife out of his hand - it was Ann Leonard's; he turned round when I saw the blood on his breast, and said, "See what Kitty has done" - he did not say what had been done with that knife; that was all he could say - the knife he gave me was not bloody, when he turned round I saw a great cut over his left eye - when I saw the blood on his shirt; I said, "What have you been doing?" the prisoner said, "I threw the basin at him:" when he said, "See what Kitty has done" - he staggered and fell; I saw him die in a very short time - he was in the habit of beating her violently; he was passionate - he would scarcely speak while he was beating her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe this is also a table knife? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. Perfectly so; I put my pocket-book into my inside coat pocket behind - I am certain of that; I consider it a very safe pocket - I felt nobody at it; my handkerchief was not in my pocket, but in my hat; I called at a house in Clement's-lane, but seeing a person of the same business there, I did not wish him to know I dealt there, and left - I stopped no where else till I came to Bucklersbury; my pocket is a very deep one, and the book was not large - I have no idea of the distance of Bucklersbury from Fenchurch-street; I suppose it is about half a mile - my pocket was not cut; the book contained papers and a card; I am certain I put it into my pocket.</p>

            . I am a dealer and salesman, and live at No. 10, Field-lane, Holborn. On the 24th of August, about two o'clock, the prisoners came to me to purchase some clothes - they looked out two waistcoats and a pair of trousers, which came to 18s., and offered me this 10l. note; I said I had no cash in the house to give change, and immediately ran to the Bank to get change for it - it was stopped; Mr. Dyte was there - I returned with him; we met an officer on the road, and he went with us to my house; the prisoners were waiting there - I had told them I was going to change the note at the Bank, and found them waiting; they were immediately given into custody - I had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Yours is a clothes shop? A. Yes; I looked at the note, and told them to wait while I went to the Bank to see if it was right - I was gone about a quarter of an hour; I had told them I was going to investigate about the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any suspicion of it? A. No, but if I have a large note, I always make inquiry to see if it is a good one - I took it to the Bank, because if it was a bad note I should lose my money.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you told them you went not only to get change, but to investigate? A. I did- I left them in my back parlour; my wife was with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that when you first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060043"/>gave an account of this transaction, you stated that you told them you were going to the Bank to investigate about the note? A. I might not have said so at first, but perhaps the question was not put to me - I presented it at the Bank for change; I believe I asked the gentleman if it was a good note.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell the exact words you made use of to the prisoners? A. I told them I should go to the Bank to get it changed, and see if it was good.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dyte was present when they said said they had picked it up? A. I think so; the prisoners were in Alexander's parlour waiting his arrival - he told them it was all wrong.</p>

             (Police-constable C 141). I saw the prosecutor on a step in Oxford-buildings, on the night of the 16th of July; the prisoner was sitting on the same step- about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner alone in Woodstock-street, not more than ten yards from Oxford-buildings; he then had a hat on (he had had a cap on before) - I suspected he had stolen the hat; he was running, but when he saw me he stopped - I went up, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060044"/>this hat off his head; I found in it his own cap, this handkerchief, and boots.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to have a game at skittles; I saw the prosecutor there, who asked me to be his partner, but he played so bad, that he said he would pay for what I lost, and himself too; he gave me liquor, which made me insensible, and if I did take it, I did not know what I did.</p>

            . I am called Charley. I was at the Eyre Arms; I saw the prosecutor come in with his bundle about ten o'clock in the evening - there was no soldier there but Mitchell; I left the prisoner and prosecutor there when I went away. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was at the Eyre Arms, and saw the prosecutor - he went to sleep, and in about five minutes I saw the soldier and the other man take the bundle out; I thought all was not right - I went out, and saw them going towards Portland-town; I returned, and told the prosecutor - we went down towards Portland-town, but not seeing them, he left me for about ten minutes - I then met the men, and told them the prosecutor wanted his bundle and they gave it to me.</p>

On the 2nd of August I had some necklaces and trinkets, and money in a small box; I saw the box safe on the drawers in the parlour at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; the drawers were within a few yards of the window, but not near enough for any one to put his arm in and reach the box - the window was open and the blinds down; on going into the room at a quarter before two o'clock I missed the box; it was shown to me by the officer about half-past two or three, broken to pieces - I found in it a pair of pearl ear-rings, which were under the part of the box which drew up; among other articles which I lost from the box, was one pearl necklace and one cornelian - I have seen the pearl necklace since and part of the cornelian.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the parlour on the ground floor? A. 
Yes, there is a railing before the window.</p>

             (Police-constable S 92). On the 2nd of August I saw the prisoner by the tap-room window of the Southampton Arms public house at Camden-town; three or four miles from Hendon, between nine and ten o'clock, in company with a boy named Gray and another girl - in consequence of suspicion I took the prisoner's address out of the bail-book at the station, and went to her lodgings in Jeffry's-buildings Westminster, on the 11th of August - I found her there; I searched and found this cornelian necklace, a gold watch, a silver thimble, and a china thimble: Warren, who was with me, found eight sovereigns - I told her I apprehended her on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery; she said she had nothing to do with it - I asked if she had seen Gray; she said No, she had not; I then asked whose the necklace was: she said it was hers, and had been given her by a cousin - we then took her to the station-house, and on the same day, the 11th of August, we took her before the Magistrate at Hendon - I told her in going along, it would be better for her to tell the truth to the Magistrate, but not to tell me any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you find these articles? A. In her box in the lodging; it was not locked, there was a quantity of women's clothes in it - there was only one bed in the room, she was in bed with a yound man named Chapple; he was taken, but discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found her in company with this man? A. Yes; he lived with her; I had known her some time - I saw her on the night of the 2nd of August, at Camden-town, which is in the road from Hendon to London, with Gray, which she denied.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker in the Westminster-bridge-road. I know the prisoner; on the 4th of August she came to my employer's, and pawned this necklace for 9s.; there was another female with her; I asked the prisoner how much it cost; she said a gentleman purchased it, and I believe she said in the Strand, and made her a present of it - this is the counterpart of the duplicate I gave, it is in the name of Charlotte Clark, lodger, No. 4, Charlton-street, Somers'-town - this is a pearl necklace; I did not apprize her of the value of it; if she had asked 2l. I should have lent it; it might have cost 6l.; she was dressed quite in a fashionable manner, in a silk hat and silk dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not take her for an unfortunate woman? A. Yes, and they frequently take gold watches and other things to pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am in the service of a pawnbroker, in Tothill-street. The prisoner pawned this large brooch with me; I have the counterpart of the duplicate I gave, it was on the 4th of August, in the name of John Edwards, Grove-street, Camden-town - I lent him 16s. on it; it is worth from 30s. to 35s.; the diamonds are not worth 6d. a piece; they are all roses; small sparks - he asked me 1l. for it, and I lent him 16s.; I asked how he came by it, and he said it was his own - he was dress respectably.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean, Sir, that this could be made for five guineas? A. I do not suppose it could be made for that; the workmanship is very valuable - I really do not know what the pearls that are in it are worth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to swear that these are rose diamonds? A. I should take them to be such -I had not the curiosity to count that there are sixty-five of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That is the only thing I pawned; Gray came to me, and said he had a present from his uncle- I did not see the other things, but he asked me to pawn that brooch; he assured me it was his own; I did not know it was stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you always been as confident as to the identity of the prisoner as you are now? A. I have no doubt on my mind - after I saw the <rs id="t18320906-84-viclabel488" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you clearly recollect her as the person who was married to this man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. How long did the marriage ceremony last? A. Perhaps a quarter of an hour, and I had then an opportunity of seeing the prisoner.</p>

I have known the prisoner since 1828 - he then lived with a friend of mine, and in 1829 he came to live with me - there was an application from his wife in Liverpool, I believe, to have some money from him; I asked him if he had been married, and why he had been married in the name of Machenery: I think this must have been in the early part of 1830; he said it was his mother's name, and he had frequently gone by that name in his youth, and that he was married in that name - I only knew him by the name of

            . I am a licensed victualler. I brought these letters from Liverpool; I received them from Mrs. Machenery, at the Neptune hotel, in the presence of her master and mistress - (letters were here read).(No. 1.) 91, Cheapside, London, January 26, 1829.</p>
               <p>MRS. MACHENERY, - I received your letter this morning, and, in return, have to inform you, that I have resolved that no alteration shall take place in my first intention respecting the settlement of the money I possess; I am much surprised that you should have employed an attorney to endeavour to obtain the money from me, as you must be perfectly aware that there is no existing law which can compel me to part with it - when I promised the person, who called a few days ago, to forward the money, it was upon the understanding, that I should be totally free from all demands from you in future; but I find, upon reference to competent authority, that that cannot be the case - you seem to insinuate that I possessed myself of the money, and then left you; but you know perfectly well that I never received it until a long period after my marriage with you, and consequently the free act was your own, although, as your husband, the law saw in me the rightful possessor of it - I disclaim all intention of wronging or injuring you, but I cannot allow myself to become the dupe of any one whom you may choose to employ against me; the money is quite safe in the hands of the person who at present holds it for me, and there I am firmly resolved it shall remain - but if, at any future period, you should be in want of money or assistance, you may depend that I will withhold neither from you; I am charged with having changed my name from Machenery to Lillis - but although Lillis was the name in which I was brought up, Machenery was my father's, and consequently the name in which I was compelled to be married; and do not think that because I withhold the money from you now, that it is my intention to squander it away without your having any prospect of deriving any ultimate advantage from it, as it will be my first care to save up all my earnings to increase it, with the hope, after a short lapse of time, of being comfortabley settled with you; the reason I have not more money now is, that when I was in Scotland I was taken ill, which compelled me to part with a great deal of it - I shall always he happy to hear from you, and will answer all your letters: until I see you again. I remain your affectionate husband,</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Foley, in Berkeley-square. On the afternoon of the 7th of July I was near the bottom of Hay-hill - I saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor, and then I saw his hand in one of his pockets - he drew out the purse; he then turned round, and ran towards me - he saw that I saw him, and he turned down a turning; I called out "He has picked your pocket," and ran after him; I lost sight of him, but I saw his person and face, and am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many turning did he turn? A. Three, but I saw him between the corner; I lost sight of him as he turned - I cannot tell which of the gentlemen's pockets, he had his hand in, when I first saw him I thought he belonged to the gentlemen, but as I kept looking at him, I saw him draw the purse out momentarily - I did not take particular notice in what pocket he had his hand in; I first thought he was pushing in the gentleman's handkerchief - I had not seen him before, I cannot tell whether he had boots or shoes on; he had a black cravat.</p>

On the 7th of July I was at the top of Hay-hill; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running - he was calling Stop thief! but there was no one in front of him but me; I followed him, and he took something from his girdle and threw it away down an area - I followed him; I did not see the article which he threw picked up - he turned towards Albemarle-street; I did not see him taken, but I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was he to the corner of Hay-hill, when you saw him? A. About ten yards; I was in front of him on the other side, with my back to the corner - I was not far enough up for any one to have turned the corner.</p>

            . I am a drover, and attend Smithfield-market; I remember seeing the ewe between four and five o'clock in the morning in the pens with other sheep; I did not see it any more till twelve o'clock in the day, when we were taking it home with some other sheep which she came with in the morning, belonging to a person named Wilkinson; the prisoner came and took that sheep away from the others - he carried it off; I knew he had no right to it, and asked why he took it; he said it was a sheep he had put into the pens in the morning - it has never been found since.</p>
               <p>EDWARD JENKINS. I am a drover. I was standing with the sheep from the first thing in the morning till they were taken out at dinner time - Goss came and laid hold of this sheep; I asked what he was going to do with it - he said to put into the pens, where he had put it before; I told him it was ours - he called me a liar, and would not let me have it; it was my master's, and I had charge of it all the morning - it was a Kent ewe; the prisoner said it was a little half-bred sheep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I caught the sheep at half-past ten in the morning, running round the market, with three dogs after it; it is a regular thing to take a sheep or bullock that runs loose, to take care of - Smith asked me for it afterwards; I showed it to him, and he took it.</p>

Frodsham and Co. had the key of that and all the clocks in our house, as they wound them up for five guineas a year. On the 14th of July, in consequence of information I went to Ship-alley, Wellclose-square - I think it was past nine o'clock in the evening; it was dark; I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner - there appeared to be counters on each side, but the shutters were closed; I did not see any business going on; I asked the prisoner if his name was Samuels, which I understood was his name; he said Yes, it was - I said I wanted to speak to him relative to a clock that had been stolen from our house; he asked what clock- I then described it, and told him from what part of the house it had been stolen - I think I told him from the two pair of stairs, and the right hand room, and that the maker's name was Lloyd, of Aldgate; he said he knew nothing of the clock whatever, and asked if I supposed he would do such a thing, as he had a family of eight children, and he often assisted the officers to take thieves; I told him it was needless to make those observations, as I knew all about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060051"/>it, and stated to him that he had pawned the clock for 2l. 10s. or 2l. 5s., I do not know which, and that I knew he had afterwards sold it to a gentleman in the neighbourhood of Doctors'-commons for 4l. 10s.; he still declared he knew nothing of it, and asked me my name - I told him the name was of no consequence, that I came from Garraway's coffee-house, and I was going to a furniture broker in Ratcliff-highway, named Solomons, and he might make inquiries there who I was - I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Worship-street; this is the clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know Mr. Warner? A. Yes, he is my attorney in this case - I believe four bills have been thrown out against the prisoner; I told the prisoner he had pawned the clock for 2l. 10s.; I do not know that that was untrue - on my oath I believed he had pawned it; I have not seen the pawnbroker - I received my information from a person in Horsemonger-lane prisone - the name on the letter is David James; he was tried and convicted here, and transported; I do not know when it was, but he himself told me he was a transport at the time I received the information.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live in Addle-hill, Doctor's-commons. I have known the prisoner about eight months; he came to me at a public-house in May last, about the middle of the month; it was before the 16th - he said he had a bracket clock, which he thought would suit me; I asked what the figure would be - he said one of his people had got it in pawn, but he thought it would be about 5l.; the prisoner is an umbrella-maker, and has been in that neighbourhood for these twenty years, as a general dealer - he said he would get the clock in a few days, and show it to me, and he brought it about the 20th; I know the dates, because my daughter went into the country on the 16th, and I had mentioned to her that Samuels had spoken about bringing me a clock, and he brought it a few days after she was gone - he asked 5l. for it; I offered him 4l. 10s. - he said it was a very good one, for the person who pawned it knew its value very well- I said I would not give any more than 4l. 10s., which he agreed to take; I then said, "Samuels, set it going" - he said, "I can't, the key is lost," but he went out, and was gone an hour or two; he brought a key, and with it he readily wound up one side of the clock, and tried it to the other, but the key would not go in - he then went out and filed the key, I believe; he then brought it back, and wound up the clock - when he was going out for the key, he said, "I wish you would let me have 3l., as we have been obliged to borrow some money;" I let him have it, and when he brought the key, I paid him the rest of the money - I gave the same clock to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him at a public-house? A. Yes, I am in the habit of going to that house every day about eleven o'clock, to read the paper; I have known the prisoner eighteen months or longer - he had the name of honest Samuel, or the honest Jew; I did not know the clock was stolen - I should have brought any thing of him; I have lived thirty years in the parish, and served all the parish offices.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. They breed acute men in Staffordshire, do they not? A. Yes - I do not know whether they call me acute; I am speaking the truth - I had come to London at that time to bring salt; I had three 5l. notes in a yellow purse, and twenty sovereigns and one half-sovereign - I mean I saw the prisoner a fortnight ago, not a fortnight after the time; it was five months after I lost my money that he was taken - I had seen a man once in the mean time, who I thought had taken my money, but I had a load on my back, and could not follow him; it was a gentleman farmer who asked me to go in - I drank once or twice of the ale, and had some tobacco; I was there an hour - the other man did not touch my money at all, I believe: I kept my eye on the prisoner, but he deceived me, or some what else did - I felt the same bulk in my pokcet, as I went along; I am not mistaken in the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner running away - I pursued him; he turned up Dock-street - I followed him: he turned to the left, and went into a Jew's, who sells old clothes, the second door on the left-hand; he hid himself behind the door, and I went in and took him - he said, "You must not take me -I have done nothing:' I took him to the station - I found on him this watch, a duplicate, a Bath note for 5l., and two flash notes for 100l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say you know that persons who are not thieves, carry flash notes? A. I have seen them - I cannot find that there is such a bank at Bath as his other note refers to.</p>

I said, "I dare say it is, from that to 25l." he said, "Well, will you buy it?" I said I was not in want of one then - he said he wanted to sell it - I said, "What is the lowest you will take, perhaps I may meet with somebody who will buy it?" he said the lowest would be under 14l.; Mr. Dawkins' son came into the yard while he was there - I had told the prisoner Mr. Dawkins, over the way, bought horses at times, but whether he offered it to Dawkins' son I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had not the outside of the Spanish vessel been newly painted? A. I cannot tell; the top of my fender laid against his paint work, but I did not observe its being wet; my fender was made of wood - I do not recollect the prisoner puting out a canvas one; when his men came on board, I said they had no right to remove the fender, but I cannot tell what their intention was; if the fender did him any damage, I should have wished him to have put another on - he made the blow at me about a minute after he struck at the lashing; I had said nothing to provoke him, nor made any action or geature: my head was about three feet from the lashing - he made the second blow at my head; it could not be made at the lashing - I was below him, and stooped with my head downwards to get it from the blow; I received the blow on the back part of the top of my head; the surgeon ordered me to keep still, but I was about my duty as usual - I went to Mr. Barry's counting-house an hour after it occurred: that was about a mile, and I went before the Justice directly; I charged him with cutting my head with the hatchet, and the officer had a warrant when I went to Mr. Barry's; I did not state there that it was only a scratch, and if I had 40s., I did not wish to go further with it - I have not brought my hat here; the mate was on board and saw the transaction - I have not brought him here; I had three men in the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You was close to the side of the vessel when the blow was made? A. Yes, I stooped to get out of the way of it: my head was then over the rail of the fender.</p>

            . I was on board the Deborah. I put the fender down by Palmer's order; my master pushed the Spanish vessel off with a handspike, to make way for the fender, and then it was put down - the prisoner came in a minute or two, and saw the fender laying there; he spoke to some of his people - I could not understand what he said, and they came on board our vessel; he spoke to somebody - they fetched an axe or hatchet from the cabin; the prisoner took it, and made a blow at the fender-lashing, or the fender; master prevented that blow with a handspike - the prisoner then rose the axe with both hands, and cut him on the back of his head; I cannot say how long this was after he cut at the lashing; it was a very short time -I stood alongside Palmer, and saw that he aimed the blow at his head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did your master's ship go up to the Spanish ship? A. The Spanish vessel was moored, and ours came up, to her; I did not see the prisoner wave his hand for us to move the fender - the bulwarks of his ship were over ours; she laid higher in the water, being lighter.</p>

             (through an interpreter). I was mate on board the prisoner's ship. I remember a wooden fender being put out by Palmer; the prisoner's vessel was newly painted - the paint was still wet; the fender would have injured it if left - the prisoner said the fender was too high, and requested him to lower it, as it would damage our bulwarks; he spoke in broken English, and by signs - Palmer did not remove it, and the prisoner called for an axe to cut the lashings of the fender; he was in the act of cutting at the lashing when the prosecutor stepped over, and the prisoner withdrew the axe, and rested it on the bulwarks - the prosecutor remained in that position for a little while, then lifted up his head, and must then have cut his head against the axe; the prisoner remained on board, without any alteration in his conduct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near were you to the prisoner? A. Close to him; he did not strike any blow at the fender at all, nor at Palmer - when Palmer stooped over his vessel, he took his hat off; it was not on when his head came in contact with the axe - the prisoner did not aim a blow at any body, or any thing; he held the axe up, and told Palmer he would cut the lashing off, if he did not move it - he did not strike at all.</p>

On the 21st of August, after twelve o'clock at night, I heard the deceased call Murder! and then the prisoner ran out of the gateway of the house which the deceased lived in; the deceased threw a handful of mud into the prisoner's face - the prisoner then struck her with her hands two or three times; the blows brought her to the ground - while she was on the ground the prisoner stamped on her breast two or three times violently; Sheehy was taken up stairs, and I did not see her afterwards - I had seen a strange woman strike her between the eyes about ten minutes to nine o'clock that night, but only once; she struck her violently - I saw her receive no other injury that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you get your living? A. I am a dress-maker; I did not observe what the quarrel was about at nine o'clock - Sheehy was not sober then; she was about twenty-eight years old- she did not seem so much intoxicated at twelve; she said her sister had beaten her and her mother; I had heard her making a noise and fighting with other people that night, but do not know who they were; I heard the noise under the gateway - it did not appear as if she had been beaten; they had been quarrelling about the death of their brother; the deceased lived in Duggan's house - I heard the noise under the gateway from nine to twelve o'clock; she had been at home from nine to twelve - I only saw her go out once; that was when she got the blow on the face - the noise was in the house under the gateway - I could not discover her voice among the persons quarrelling, till I heard her out in the street.</p>

            . I live at No. 16, Great St. Andrew-street- Sheehy lived at No. 15; there is a gateway between her house and mine. On the 21st of August, about twelve o'clock, I heard cries of Murder! at the back of the house - I had heard nothing before; I went out, and saw the deceased take a handful of mud and throw at the prisoner, who had given her no provocation that I saw or heard; the prisoner then seized her by the throat, dashed her down on the stones, stamped on her breast once or twice, and kicked her on the breast once or twice - she was in a violent passion; Sheehy was carried up stairs - I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at home between nine and twelve o'clock? A. Yes, and heard noises proceeding from the house; it appeared like persons quarrelling - I could not tell whether there were any blows; I heard Sheehy's voice several times, as if she was quarrelling, but did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060055"/>hear the prisoner's voice; I believe the deceased to have been a violent tempered woman; I saw her about eight o'clock, she was not sober then; she stood at the corner of the court driving and tearing at every body almost; they were people who had given her no provocation.</p>

I did not know the deceased, but between seven and eight o'clock I stood at my door and saw two women scolding each other; one ran after the other - whether the deceased was one I cannot tell; they only went two or three houses from the gateway, then returned peaceably, and went in doors - about twelve o'clock or a quarter-past, I heard an old lady's voice cry,"Don't, don't;" I lifted up my window, and saw a woman on the ground; she was carried into the gateway.</p>

            . I lived in the same house as Margaret Sheehy; I did not notice her that evening till between eleven and twelve o'clock, when I was disturbed; I put my head out of window, and saw her laying on the pavement; I saw no body beating her; after that she came up stairs and kicked my door open - I lodge in the front room second floor; she afterwards went down stairs - I heard a person tumble down stairs, and saw her brought up as the woman who had fallen down - I know it was her kicked my door open, for I turned her out, as she used very bad expressions; and almost directly I heard the person fall down stairs, and am almost sure it was her - there was nobody else on the stairs that I heard; she appeared to fall down very heavily - she appeared in liquor; she had not time to go out into the street before she was brought up, and she never went out of the house after that; my opinion is that this was between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When she was carried up stairs, did she appear able to go out again? A. No; she was a troublesome little body, and in the habit of getting drunk; I do not know why she kicked my door open; she appeared in a violent passion, and used very bad expressions - she fell down stairs directly after I put her out; Anthony Daley was one who was carrying her up stairs after the fall; she appeared very much hurt and worked in fits like, and was knocking her arms against the stairs as they carried her up - I was not at home in the evening.</p>

I examined the body of the decased on the morning of the 23rd - she died on the 22nd; I impute her death to a fracture of the bones of the neck - a kick must have been very heavy to produce that; she might have walked after receiving that injury; falling down stairs would be very likely to produce such a fracture, more so than a common kick - Mr. Buss had attended her, and was present at the examination: a person intoxicated would fall down stairs more heavily then another.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did she fall backwards, or how? A. She fell head foremost every time, and once she came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060056"/>the first landing, which was nine or ten stairs - she was very helpless, from liquor; I had not seen her at Ryan's door - Ryan met me; the last time I brought her up stairs I took her to her room - I slept in the room that night; she lodged with me - I went out for a candle, and was gone about twenty-five minutes, and when I returned her mother told me she had jumped up and said she would go to look for her ring, and had fallen down stairs again.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. On Wednesday, the 8th of August, between five and six o'clock in the morning, the deceased was brought to the hospital, labouring under symptoms of having received some injury in the head; he lived till the 16th; I opened his head afterwards, and found an effusion of blood on the brain, owing to the rupture of a vessel of the brain; in my judgment the rupture of the vessel of the brain caused his death - it was likely to arise from a fall off a ladder into a dray.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many horses were there to the prisoner's dray? A. I am confident there were two, but cannot say whether there were three; the prisoner might have meant what he said about sending his servant as a joke - my back was towards him; I did not see him take off his leading horse, nor whether it had the nose-bag on; I saw the wheel of the dray against the ladder.</p>

I was at work at the brewhouse; the prisoner came to the gate with his dray - I said he must not go forward at present, because there was a man up the ladder; he said, with a laugh, that he would send his footman next time he came into the yard; no doubt he said that in a joke - Marks was at that time on the ladder; I saw the dray going forward; it had been there but a short time, and I saw Marks fall the dray shook the ladder on which he stood, and I saw him fall; I cannot say whether I had seen the leading horse taken off - I was not particularly looking at the time.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and was at work in the brewhouse yard. I did not see the dray come in; I saw it after it was in - only the shaft-horse was in it then; I heard the dray move on - I turned round, and saw it come in contact with the ladder; I should not imagine that there was proper room for it to pass without touching the ladder; when I turned round, the prisoner was at the horse's head, with the bridle of the horse in his right hand - it appeared to me, that when he took the horse by the rein it moved on; I said, "Stop a moment," and I do not think it went four or five steps before the man stopped, but the dray had touched the ladder, and the man pitched off, and his head pitched on one of the planks of the dray - the dray was standing still when I came up, which was not half a minute before it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you are foreman to Mr. Cubit's men, who were at work there? A. Yes; I was not there when the dray arrived - horses sometimes will go on after others; I saw no other horse - whether the prisoner's taking hold of the rein was to stop the horse I cannot tell; I have known him four years - he bore a good character for humanity; I went to the hospital, and saw the prisoner there on the Friday, sitting down by the deceased's bed - I do not know whether he had been there more than once.</p>

            . I was at the brew house, and saw the dray come in - there were two horses to it; after it came into the yard it stopped, and the prisoner took one horse off, took the bit out of its mouth, and went down to the water with it; he then came back to take the nose-bag off the dray and his whip, and just put them inside the stable; while he did that, the horse drew on - he caught hold of the horse's head as soon as he could - the stable was close by; the horse stood very still then.</p>
               <p>Q. When the horse moved on, there was a cry to take care? A. I did not hear that; when the horse moved on, he came and caught hold of its head directly and stopped him, but was not able to stop it before it touched the ladder - he did all he could to stop it; the dray turned the ladder aside, and threw the man down; the prisoner had only gone two or three yards from the horse, and turned himself round, just to put his bags inside, he came back again, and the horse went on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he turned round, how far had he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060057"/>got from the horse's head before the horse moved? A. It might be two or three yards; the ladder was before the dray, and almost in the middle of the carriage way - it could not go on without striking the ladder.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he appear to you to use all the care and caution he should do? A. Yes; he was very sober and steady; the dray stood quite still while he took off the nose-bag - he might be two yards from the ladder. I am certain it was an accident; I have known him some years - he bore a good character for steadiness and care.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had stood with his horse instead of turning his back, could he have prevented it going on? A. Yes, I should think so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner was at his horse's head when the dray moved on? A. Very near it, and had his hand on the rein; whether he led the horse on, or whether it moved of its own accord, I do not know.</p>

            . I am a drayman. I was in the yard standing against the counting-house door, about twenty yards from the dray, sideways - I did not see the prisoner take off the leading horse, but it was taken off; and the next I saw was, he went, took his nose-bags, put them into the stable, and while his back was turned the horse rode on - as soon as he got hold of him he caught him by the head and endeavoured to stop him, but could not before the ladder moved; it moved before he could catch the horse by the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stable door was close to where the horse stood, was not it? A. Within about three yards- the nose-bags hung on the fore part of the dray; he was close to the horse when he came for the bag, and had not turned his head half a minute when the horse moved on; in my judgment it was purely accidental; he used every diligence to prevent it, when he saw what was about to happen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the stable from the dray? A. The pin for the nose-bags is close to the stable door - he had hardly turned round before the accident happened; the dray was too far in before, and the moment the horse moved the dray caught the ladder; he then ran, and caught the horse by the head and the man fell into the dray - I do not think he had any control over the horse at the time; the only fault was his coming too near at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If he had not left the horse could not he have stopped it? A. Not in time, for it was close to the ladder before it moved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I shut the spare horse outside the gate, and took them by the ladder; when I came back I put the other horse nearer up - I stopped the horse in the gateway, and while I took the nose-bags to the stable he moved on again.</p>

On the 3rd of July I was present in the banking-house when the prisoner came, and produced a bill of exchange for payment; he was asked how he came by it, and said he had it in a letter from France that morning; I do not know whether he said from Calais or not - we detained him; he told us where he lodged - we sent an officer to the place, and he brought two letters; (looking at the bill) - I believe this to be an imitation of the signature of Sir William Pole, who has kept cash at our house eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time did he come? A. Between three and four o'clock; he presented the draft to another clerk, who handed it to me for examination, and the prisoner was desired to walk into another room, which he did; he was then told, in my presence that we suspected it to be a forgery, and that he must account for the way he came in possession of it - he said he had it in a letter which he received that morning from France, and may have mentioned the town for what I know- he wrote a letter himself to desire the letters might be given up to the officer, who came back within two hours, or it might be but one hour, but I went home within two hours of the transaction; he remained in our counting-house waiting the officer's return, and gave us the information without the least hesitation - this erasure was on the draft when I received it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could he have got away? A. Not very well; there was an officer in the adjoining room - he said he received the draft from a person named Emerson; that he had received that letter from him, that he was acquainted with Emerson, but what else I do not recollect; the draft was presented between three and four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060058"/>o'clock; I dined at the banking-house at four - I came from dinner soon after five o'clock, and left at half-past.</p>

            , BART. Previous to the discovery of this forgery, I always drew drafts in the name of William only - not a letter of this draft is in my writing; it very much resembles it, certainly, but I have not the least hesitation in swearing not a letter of it is my writing, nor do I know the person in whose favour it is drawn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did a female, in the name of Emerson, apply to you for charity? A. Many years ago a woman, describing herself as the wife of a clerk in the Custom-house, applied to me, and begged as a matter of charity that I would take some drawings of her, and I gave her what I considered more than the value of them; I frequently relieved her, till at last I found her applications troublesome - I never saw her, and do not know her age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not send her a cheque for 3l.? A. She sent me a letter previous to the 23rd of April this year, and I sent a respectable tradesman to inquire if she was a fit object of charity; I sent her a cheque for 3l. 1s. - the 1s. was to cover the expences of postage; that was this year.</p>

               <p>Q. So that if she happened to have a son, he had an opportunity of seeing your hand-writing? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you empower her or any body else to draw in your name? A. Never - I know nothing of the prisoner - (the draft was here put in and read).</p>

            ; that he was quite innocent of knowing it to be forged, and was very sorry he had had any thing to do with it - he did not, in my presence, say how he became acquainted with Emerson; I remained there while Edwards went to his lodging; he was gone about an hour, or an hour and three-quarters, and brought two letters with him - while he was gone, the prisoner said nothing to me about Emerson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you remain in the same room with the prisoner? A. I did not all the time - he wished to write a letter; I was absent from the room all the time Edwards was gone - I did not tell him I was going to wait.</p>
               <p>Q. For what he knew, you might be gone? A. Yes; I am sure he told Mr. Wormald he was quite innocent of knowing any thing of the forgery - he manifested no inclination to escape; when asked how he came by the draft, I believe he gave an answer without hesitation - while Edwards was gone, he wrote a letter, which I took from him; he gave it to me to send to France, but I told him I should take possession of it, and keep it; it was not sealed; I had my officer's uniform on.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was undirected as well as unsealed? A. Yes; I took it from him; he did not give it to me - there were several people in the banking-house, backwards and forwards, and five or six clerks, quite sufficient to detain him, if he attempted to escape.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came the letter not directed? A. Because I took it from him; he said he wanted it to go to Emerson, in France - he did not say to what part - I took it from him before he had an opportunity of directing it; I took it from him because I thought it would be the means of enabling other persons to escape.</p>

When the prisoner was taken into custody I was fetched to the banking-house, and saw him there - he said he had been for some time living about the town, that he was formerly clerk to Richards, Clark, and Co., of Lincoln's Inn-fields, but not liking the profession of the law, he had quitted it, and that he been entirely dependent since he left their office on the charity of his aunt, Mrs. or Miss Langton - I think he said she was unable to support him, being in very indifferent circumstances herself, and that she had been without any occupation for some time; with regard to his knowledge of Emerson, he said he had met him but a short time before this at a billiard-table; that his acquaintance with Emerson was very slight - I remarked on his making an acquaintance at a billiard-room, and asked how he could undertake to tender that bill for payment, received under such suspicious circumstances (meaning the slight acquaintance he had, and meeting him only at a billiard-room) - he said Emerson had left London to go to Calais only about three days before; I asked if he had any idea or notion why Emerson went over to Calais - he said he did not know why he went, and that the circumstance of his sending the bill had excited his surprise, and made him suspect there was something wrong about it; the rest of our conversation related principally to a letter he wrote to his aunt, enclosing the letter he had received from Emerson - he said he had enclosed the letter he received from Emerson to his aunt; the letter he spoke of was then in my hands(looking at two letters) - these are them; I asked him if this letter was his writing; he said it was - I expressed my regret at the production of that letter, and stated to him that letter showed a guilty knowledge - he was a good deal confused at that, and said he certainly had some suspicion about the transaction when he wrote that letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he confine his acquaintance with this young man, to the billiard-room? A. Entirely - he said he first became acquainted with him in a billiard room, and that he had a short acquaintance with him since- I did not ask him the precise time that the acquaintance began; I asked how long he had known him, and he said a short time - I did not press that inquiry further; I did not ask if he had visited Emerson at the Clarence hotel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060059"/>nor whether he had gone to Bath with him - he admitted at once that the letter was his hand-writing; he told me he was to receive from Emerson a sum of money when he delivered the proceeds of the bill; I cannot tell the precise sum; I certainly asked him - I think it was about 15l., but am not sure about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask how it happened that he was to receive 15l.? A. I did - his answer was that it was for his trouble; I have been an attorney about fifteen years: I made these inquiries with a view of seeing whether I could with propriety advise his discharge - I had not the slightest notion of giving evidence when I came into Court, and I reluctantly give it; I did not expect to be called - I did not tell our agent what had passed between me and the prisoner - a note was sent up to me, to know if I could confirm Mr. Wormald's evidence, and I have confirmed it - I believe it is stated in the brief that Mr. Wormald would prove the prisoner's stating his acquaintance with Emerson commenced in a billiard-room, as I thought he was present - I believe I stated in the brief (the heads of which I drew up myself) the conversation I had with the prisoner, and that the acquaintance began in a billiard-room; but I have had no conversation with the agent about it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Mr. Harrison, who sits by me. instructing me in the case, your partner? A. Yes - I drew out general instructions for the brief, but have never seen the brief itself; I drew up what was necessary for it: I cautioned the prisoner all along against making commucation to me, and when I saw this letter I told him not to say another word, as the law must take its course. - (Letters read.)</p>

               <p>DEAR HARRY, - We arrived here on Saturday morning, at one o'clock, so you see, we came over here in sixteen hours - I have enclosed in this, a draft on Messrs. Childs, and Co., for 99l. 10s., which you must go and get, and then meet me in Paris, at the Poste-restant, or office, as quick as possible; you will have to sign your name at the back of the draft, when you get it, and come to me immediately - you may spend between you and Carley, 9l. 10s. in coming over, but pray do not be extravagant - Paris is seventy-five leagnes from Calais, so you will be thirty-six hours going to Paris from Calais - do not let any one know that you or Carley are coming to Paris, and for fear of mistake tear this letter up. I must now conclude, - Your's sincerely,

               <p>You may bring Carley with you or not, as you like; do not let him see this - get me a 50l. note, a 20l., and 29l. in gold.</p>
               <p>Dear Harry, - do not betray my trust; I have always thought well of you, and will reward you when you get to Paris - I shall expect you on Friday at Paris; as the cheque is made in Mr. Murdy's name, you must say you came from him -

             (Police-constable S 50). I met the prosecutor on the 1st of August, and went with him to the house in Chapel-street, No. 55; I found both the prisoners in a little back parlour at the rag-shop - I told them he had complained of losing a scarf and two handkerchief pins; they said they had not seen any thing of the kind -I staid some time, and they gave me leave to search the house; the prisoner Tewkesbury said to the landlady,"You know right well that neither of us went out of the house;" she said, "Yes, you did go out for ten minutes for some tea;" she pushed her arm, and said Hush! I sent them to the watch-house, and then asked the landlady again if they had been sent out - she said Yes, and told me the way; I went that way, and found a pawnbroker's, where the articles were pledged.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a pawnbroker in Clarendon-square. On the 31st of July, at five o'clock, both the prisoners came to our shop - Stiffin pawned the scarf for 3s., in the name of Ann Smith, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060062"/>lodger, No. 19, Ossulton-street; she asked me 8s. for it; I offered her 3s. - Tewkesbury handed it to her, and said,"That won't do, will it;" she said, "Can't you make it 4s.?" I said No - she said, "Then give me 3s.;" I asked Stiffin if it was hers - she said Yes; she had two pins - she asked me if they were worth more than 1s.; I said No - she then said to Tewkesbury, "He wants half a crown for them;" they were two gold pins, with coral heads.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. I said the property was mine; Stiffin said nothing, but asked the value of the pins. Witness. I asked Stiffin if it was hers, and she said Yes, and gave me the address.</p>

            . These are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, did Stiffin go out for a short time and come back? A. No; I will swear they were both in the room the whole time, except when Tewkesbury went out to pawn something to pay me the 3s., but while she was out, I did not say or do any thing to the other.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. Whilst Stiffin went out with a friend he took improper liberties with me - I told him I would call a Policeman; he said, "Don't do that, I will give you this scarf, and two pins."</p>
               <p>GABRIEL SOUZA re-examined. Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you take any liberties with Tewkesbury? A. No, I did not touch her, upon my oath - I did nothing of the kind; she did not complain of any thing - I always fetch beer for ladies where I go to sell goods; the door was open, and the mistress was in the shop - she was not out at all; I swear the mistress remained in the house all the time - I opened my bundle and showed my finery, but I did not show this scarf; my bundle was done up when I went for the beer, and when I took it away I did not notice that it was altered - I swear I did nothing improper to either of them; I had not seen them before that day; I was quite sober; we only had that beer between the four of us, the mistress of the house, the two prisoners, and I; as I passed the door to go into the parlour I gave the mistress some beer; I had only had a cup of coffee and some bread for dinner, and no meat, beer, nor spirits.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. While he was there the mistress went out with another woman, and then he took liberties with me, and solicited me to meet him in Lancaster-street, and promised the next day to give me a gold chain. Witness. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Stiffin. I was sitting at work in the back parlour when he came; the person of the shop was not at home; he asked leave to wait for her, and he waited half an hour. Witness. It was not a quarter of an hour - Tewkesbury staid with me, not Stiffins - she was behind the counter and I in front; the mistress then came and said, "Gabriel, show your goods to this young lady."</p>
               <p>Stiffin's Defence. A female friend, who had left her situation, came and asked me to go out - I went, and was gone nearly an hour - when I came back the prosecutor was sitting on the sofa with Tewkesbury; the mistress was out, and the door was shut and locked - I asked Tewkesbury what was the matter; she made no reply, and when the prosecutor was gone, she asked me to go with her to the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to No. 11, Rose-street, Soho, where the prisoner lodged, and while I was there, she came in; I told her she was suspected of robbing Mr. Lovegrove, at Fladong's hotel - she said I was welcome to search; I searched, and found the napkin which has the prosecutor's name and address, in full, on it- she said that had been brought there by a young man, and neglected to be sent home; I searched further, and found the mattress, bed-furniture, plates, and some other things - I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found some others; she said the mattress had been put into the dusthole by Eliza, and the bed-furniture was to make dusters of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I did it through distress - I had not a penny, and my daughter was dying in a decline; I know I have done wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. LOVEGROVE. I employed her for two months; she had 1s. 6d. a day, and her food - when I had not work for her. I have got her work at another person's house; I think she has been employed five days out of seven on the average - she has been there for a whole week together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you were both pretty far gone in liquor? A. No; it was about half-past twelve o'clock - the first public-house we went to was Wilson's, where we had half a pint of gin amongst five of us - there was a third girl with the prisoners then; I had been with Drewitt to the Crown and Anchor, and had two pots of halfand-half with two or three friends; I cannot say how many - I suppose eight or nine; we had no gin there - we did not leave till twelve o'clock, and then went to Drury-lane - we then went to the public-house in Little Russell-street, and had a pot of half-and-half among the five of us; I was sober - it was Curle put the light out in my room; I had not been in bed more than two minutes - I saw Curle move the chair; the other woman had gone up stairs with Drewitt - I know Clark came twice to the room for a light, but I cannot tell who came when the candle was out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prosecutor a little tipsy? A.

I met two men who threw out their arms, and one of them kicked me on the leg, and made a bruise - the prisoner had then made her escape, but I pursued after the other person; I went to the station, gave information, and on going back, I met a Policeman, whom I informed of it; he took the prisoner from my description the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons did you have taken up upon this business? A. Two men and two women; I had seen the prisoner before that night at some place, but I cannot say where - it was a pleasant night, not so dark but I could observe any one who come near me; I told the Magistrate that I felt her fingers about me in rather a cuddling manner, and he asked me why I did not seize her hand; I said I felt myself almost stunned; I bought the seal at a watchmaker's shop at the corner of Brown's-lane; I had worn it three years - it is a plain seal, but I am positive it is mine, for on the 16th I had cleaned it, and my wife told me I had not cleaned the whitening out; I never said if the duplicate were given me I would stop the proceeding.</p>

            . I am the storehouse clerk. I saw the papers of halfpence which had been marked, put into the cupboard in the evening; the prisoner came at four o'clock in the morning, and had to clean out the counting-house in which the cupboard was - I unlocked the cupboard when he had cleaned out the counting-house, and missed one paper of copper; they had been marked from No. 1 to 28, and No. 24 was missing - I was present when he was searched, and that identical paper was found in his trousers pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; I am always there at the beginning of business - there was nobody but him employed that morning in the counting-house - when he came out, and shut the door, no one could go in but myself; there were, perhaps, fifty persons in the yard.</p>

The prosecutor resides near me; the prisoner came to live with him, and he came for my wife to make some inquiries of her, as he spoke very indifferent English; I know he was robbed at the time he states, and am quite positive the prisoner is the person who lived with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she was servant at the house at which the prosecutor lodged, and being unwell had left and sent another woman to do her work; that she had never seen the watch, which might have been taken by others, as several emigrants were in the habit of calling there.</p>

             LEWIS.

On the 9th of August the prisoner came, and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I showed her a large number, but she could not find any to please her - we had some more in another part of the shop; I went for them, and on coming back I missed one piece, containing three handkerchiefs; I went for the officer - he took her to the back of the shop; she 
made a stumble, and dropped these three handkerchiefs from her person.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were they not placed on the counter? A. Yes; she had been looking at them - she had set her child down on the counter, and took it up to go to the back part of the shop - there was no rat-hole in our floor that I am aware of, but she stumbled in going along, or stooped, and these things fell; she went readily - she appeared to be confused; there was a boy in the shop; I did not see her take them.</p>

               <p>JOHN THOMAS GRAVES, ESQ. I live at No. 2, Fig-tree-court, Inner Temple, and am a barrister. On the 18th of June, when I returned to my chambers in the evening, I found the door broken open, my furniture scattered about the room, my chest was broken open, and I missed some 5l. Bank notes; I do not know the numbers, but I received them at Paget's - I had no other notes - I afterwards got from a clerk in the Bank of England, this 5l. note, No. 11,191, dated 28th April, 1832; the prisoner was taken into custody - I asked her if an account which she gave at her own residence when she was taken, was true; she said it was in substance true, that she received the note, not from a man she met in the street, but from a man named Sanders, whom she knew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have traced all the notes you lost to different persons? A. Yes, one of them was at Chertsey, and two at Hampton; I lost four.</p>

            . I live in Fenchurch-street, and am a boot and shoe-maker. On Monday or Tuesday, in the first week in July, which was the 2nd or 3rd, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of shoes for 6s.; she gave me this 5l. note, and the name of Sanders, 15, Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate, which is on it in my writing - she only said, "Sanders," and I put the word, "Mrs." - my man then told me that her name was not Sanders; she said,"What he says is very true, my name is not Sanders, but Solomons; if you don't like to take it, you need not, but Sanders is the name of the person I took the note of" - I gave her change, and sent the note to the Bank the next morning, and while my man was gone, the prisoner came to my shop; she said, "Have you inquired about the note;" I said, "No, I have passed it" - she said, "I called to pay the money for it," and then said she would tell me all about it; that it was a note which laid on the counter, belonging to her husband, that she was going to a wedding, and wanted some things, which she did not want him to know of; she again asked if I had put the name of Solomons on it - I said, "No, Sanders," she said, "I am obliged to you," and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person named Publet in your service? A. Yes, and he knew her, as he had lived in her house; but she did not see him when she was at my shop, as he was in another shop at the time; I had my information from another man named Horne, but Publet confirmed it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the Rosemary-branch, near Rosemary-lane, on the 6th of July; I saw her and her husband there - I had a warrant to search the house; they wanted to know what it was for - I did not satisfy them, but asked the prisoner, when her husband was not very near her, to account for the 5l. note; she then said it was a note belonging to her husband, which she took off the counter - I did not appear satisfied with that, and she called me aside, and said she would tell me all about it; she then went up stairs with me, and said she was not Mr. Solomon's wife, and that she had had the note from a gentleman, to go with him, and she would not have Mr. Solomons know it on any account; I asked if she knew the person - she said she had seen him once before, but did not know where he resided.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she received the note from Sanders, who accompanied her to Fenchurch-street, and waited outside while she purchased the shoes.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. GRAVES. Q. Have you made any inquiry as to the address of a person named Sanders? A. I enquired at Liverpool-street, and the woman who resided there, said she did not know such a person; but I heard that a person named Sanders was apprehended at Bow-street, and in consequence of a note I received from the prisoner, I let her know of it - she did not mention the name to me, but I did to her.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I was at her house on the 2nd of July; I remember a gentleman coming there while I was there - he appeared respectably dressed; he asked her if she was quite well - she said, "Quite well, thank you Sanders;" he then asked if she had any thing in the house to drink - she said, "No, Sanders, I have not, but I will take the liberty of asking this young woman to get 1s. worth of brandy;" I went for it, and I had my share of it - she then said to him, "Sanders, I am going to a wedding, will you treat me with a pair of shoes;" he said, "I have no change, but I have a 5l. note, if you will go with me I will treat you with a pair" - they then went out together, and as she was going, she asked me to mind her place, which I did - she returned alone, and brought a parcel with her, wrapped up in paper, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060071"/>she, showed me a pair of shoes, which seemed to be new; she might have been gone about an hour.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of man was he? A. A tallish gentleman - I had not seen him before; I called to see the prisoner, and show her my baby, after I came out of my confinement - there was no servant there; it was on Monday, the 2nd of July - I returned home to George-street, Minories; had been churched on the 1st of July - I did not take particular notice of Sanders; to the best of my knowledge, he had a brown coat and a black hat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You do not know whether your master had sold him the carpet? A. He had not; it had been purchased by a Mr. Nutt, in Hertfordshire, but was not to be sent home till he wrote for it; when the prisoner was taken he said a gentleman sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060072"/>him for it, but he did not say who he was nor where he lived - it was not paid for, and was not to be sent home till next March, or till we heard from him; I asked who sent him for it - he said a gentleman told him to go in and take it; there were several other pieces of carpeting with it - it is worth 7l.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Regent-street - a gentleman asked if I wanted a job, and asked me to carry the carpeting to No. 17, Vine-street; he took me to the step of the door, and pointed it out - I was following him.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a partner in Coutts'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060073"/>banking-house, and was there on the 2nd of August - my attention was drawn to this cheque, purporting to be drawn by Mr. Paxton; I went to the prisoner after the cheque was shown to me, and told him a difficulty had occurred respecting payment of the draft, and begged he would sit down till it was cleared up - he followed me immediately to a chair, which I pointed out inside the counter; I do not recollect his making any answer - I then desired Mr. Partride to send for Mr. Paxton; the porter was sent for him, but Mr. Robinson, his clerk, came, and made a communication to me: after remaining on his seat about twenty minutes, the prisoner was taken into another room; the door between that and the room I was in was always open; I happened to look into the room, and saw him emptying a small phial into his mouth, the contents of which he had almost drank before I saw him; I do not think he had had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Robinson - it was about half an hour after he presented the cheque; I sent him to an apothecary close by, who gave him an emetic, which proved effectual; the cheque was placed in my hands by Mr. Partridge: I believe that produced to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he sitting for the first twenty minutes? A. In a room within the office, not in the banking-house; there were two clerks in that room; I took the cheque in my hand when I asked him to sit down: I then gave it back to Mr. Partridge; I believe he parted with it afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you compare it with other cheques? A. Yes, with five or six - it was under my notice about five minutes; I have no doubt in my mind that this is the cheque.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the Police. On the 2nd of August the prisoner was brought to the station-house, Covent-garden, on this charge - I received the cheque the following morning from Mr. Colthurst, one of the firm, in Mr. Partridge's presence; Mr. Paxton marked it at the time - I had a conversation with the prisoner; I cautioned him that I was about to put a question to him, and that he had no occasion to answer it unless he thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he not at that time in an extreme state of suffering, both in body and mind? A. He was - my opinion is that he was in that state of mind I could not depend on his evidence in any case; I had a second conversation with him about three-quarters of an hour after he was in my custody - I think he was then considerably excited; I told him he was not obliged to answer any questions affecting his case - he said, "Then I suppose I am not obliged to answer at all?" I said, "Certainly not."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When this took place, was he in his senses, so as to know what he was saying? A. I conceive he knew what he was saying, but was certainly considerably excited; he spoke as if he knew what he was about - I told him whatever he said would be used against him on his trial, and that he was charged with uttering a forged bill for payment of 200l., on Messrs. Coutt's; he said, "Oh yes, oh, yes, I did;" I said, "Was it a good cheque?" he said "Yes, it was" - he was at that time crying very much; I searched him, and found this note on him, enclosed in this I envelope - I marked them at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The cheque was brought to you next day, and then Mr. Partridge put his name on it? A. Yes; there was no mark on it before, that I am aware of - the prisoner was in a back room at the station-house when I put these questions; they were put within an hour after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. He was under the operation of posion and counterpoison at the time the conversation took place? A. He was - his answers were quick and sharp, but at the same time he was under so much excitement, I could not depend on what he said; the room was full of officers, and one or two surgeons - I asked the questions, because I had the previous assurance of the surgeon that he was in danger, and I thought it my duty to put them; I had no idea of giving evidence at the time; I certainly considered if he survived I should have to give evidence; I put them from a sense of duty, considering him in danger, and that crime might attach to other persons.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he make any statement to you before you cautioned him? A. No; he answered as if he understood my questions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you had a very good opinion of the prisoner, and recommended him to a situation? A. I spoke to a person to give him one, in consequence of Mr. Watts speaking well of him.</p>

            . I am a stockbroker, and live in Tokenhouse-yard. The prisoner came into my service the middle of March, 1830, and remained till the time in question - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his handwriting; this note, and the envelope, appear to be in his writing; I believe them to be so - the body of the cheque seems to be the same hand-writing; the signature and all the written part of the cheque, I believe to be his writing; I saw him at the station-house about six o'clock on the evening he was taken - I held out no inducement or promise to induce him to say any thing to me - the first question I put to him was, where he had got the cheque, it being a printed one; he told me it was one remaining cheque in an old cheque-book, which was put away with my old books in my office - I asked where he had written it; he said he wrote it at his desk while I was washing my hands in an inner room - I had not sent him that day to Messrs. Coutts'; I beg to add, he was not my clerk, but my office boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he not been above two years with you? A. Yes, he bore a very excellent character - he was about fifteen years old when he came to me.(The note produced was here read).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember going to Hollingshead, an engineer? A. Yes; I went to him before I went to get the cannons from the prisoner - I did not insist on the cannons being cast with a bore; I made no remark whether they were to be cast hollow or solid - I asked Hollingshead what the boring would come to; he did not tell me they must be bored to render them safe - I had the order for the guns from a young man, named Smith, and after the rejoicing was over, they were all to be put on board a pleasure-boat; I never told the prisoner that some of them were for ornament, and never to be fired, nor did I even tell his son so.</p>

            . I am a labouring man, and live at Brentford. John Webb was out with me on the 28th of August, when these guns were fired - he took the command of the guns, and loaded them; they were fired in Mr. Nichols' brick-fields at first, to be proved - three were proved; Webb then came to me, and said "There is no cause to prove any more of them, we will take them down to the water and fire them;" I had fired three by way of proof; and at Webb's suggestion, we took them down by Kew-bridge, under the wall, on the Middlesex side - Webb loaded one; I gave him the cartridges.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are proving guns, do you charge them beavier than usual? A. Some people do, but I did not; I did not load them to prove them on the river, but in the ordinary way - I fired them; the first I fired by the river side, burst, but not knowing it would cause an accident, I fired two afterwards, before I knew Webb was hurt - he stood as near eighteen yards from me as possible; I did not know the first gun had burst - after I had fired the third, I was called to to cease, and saw Webb laying on his back on the ground - I went up to him; he laid all in a gore of blood, and a piece of the cannon laid close to him; he never spoke in my hearing - he was taken to the Star and Garter; I had known him from a child - his name was John Webb; Mr. Bonny attended him - I was not with him when he died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the gun which burst been proved, to your knowledge? A. Not to my knowledge; Webb said, "We need not prove more."</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not prudent and usual to prove guns before they are brought into common use? A. Yes, but I did not know how many had been proved; I have fired a good many guns - it was fine powder, but of what strength I cannot tell; it came from Mr. Hughes; I did not know whether any of the guns were for ornament.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Brentford. I was present when this occurred, but not near at the moment - I picked up part of the cannon; this is the part, but it has since been broken - it is a white metal - there is some lead in this piece of iron; that must have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060075"/>done to stop up the part of the cannon that had burst - it matches the former aperture in the cannon; I have it here, and the pieces match it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you apprehend the lead to have been? A. At the under side of the cannon, and being placed on the carriage, it was not very visible.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 29th of August I was called in to attend John Webb, who laid in an outhouse at the Star and Garter, Kew-bridge - he lived till six o'clock in the morning; he had a wound on the right side of his head, about three inches long, penetrating to the bone; there was a great appearance of contusion on the whole of the right side of his head; I examined the body next morning, and found a quantity of extravasated blood on the outer covering of the brain, (the dura mater,) and am full convinced that injury was the cause of his death; it was such an injury as a blow from a piece of cannon would inflict.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Hughes came to me, and wanted me to make him six cannons; I refused more than once or twice - he then went to Hollingshead, as I understood, to know what he could get them bored for out of the solid - he came back to me, and said it was too much money, would I make them hollow for him; my answer was,"Hughes, it is no use my pretending to make them, do you mean to kill yourself? if I make them I cannot warrant any one of them sound;" well, he repeatedly talked to me about it, and I made him four - my son took them to Brentford, and I gave him a caution; I said, "Hughes, be very particular how you use these things, or else you will get hurt;" he told me he would try them in a field, would cover them with dirt, and put wet rangs and lay a fusee to them; I said, "If you don't mind what you are about you will be killed;" he wanted me to do it, but I would not - he said they were for a sailing-boat, two to put on each side; then he came to me, and wanted me to make it up a dozen, and said they were to be sham ones, not to fire at all; I owed him a little money, and he sent me a letter, saying if I did not do them he would put me to trouble - he sent the iron to make them with.</p>

            . I am an engineer, and have been so for ten years - I carry on business in King-street, Long-acre. Hughes came to me about three months ago, and asked what the boring of cannons would come to, and whether it was requisite to have them bored; I told him they must be bored to render them safe - it is quite impossible to make them safe without boring; he said he had got an order from a gentleman, he did not mention how many guns he wanted, he merely asked me the expense; I said it was impossible to say without knowing the quality of the metal, and seeing them; he said he had been speaking to Carr about casting them - he said Carr had not, at that time, cast them; it is not safe or usual to use guns without first proving them; I always understood there was a penalty for so doing.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your judgment, could a person, who founds cannons, tell whether they are honeycombed unless they are proved? A. Not without breaking them to pieces; an engineer, with the greatest care in founding them, could not prevent their being honey combed, provided they are cored - if cast solid and bored they stand a great deal better chance of being sound, and then they are always proved - it is not the founder's business to prove them; he has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You understand that business very well? A. I do; cannon is cast in either case, but no prudent man would order one to he made hollow; I have been acquainted with Carr some time, and always considered him a good workman, and a man who knew his business; any body, who knew the trade, would know the proper way was to cast them solid, and bore them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say it is the only safe way? A. Yes- casting them hollow is unsafe.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say the purchaser and not the founder is to prove them? A. The person, who orders them, should prove them; founders cast them for manufacturers, but do not finish them - if a private person ordered them the private person should prove them; this cannon is not made from the best pig-iron; there may be some pig-iron in it, and the rest what is technically called plate - I should consider there is some pig-iron in it; this lead is, most undoubtedly, put in to fill up what we technically call a blow in it, which is a flaw, a defect caused by the air in the process of casting; it is the common practice of founders to do so.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it safe to send out cannon with that lead in it? A. According to the strength of it, I do not think it would affect it; but I should not think it a safe cannon to be sent out at all, even for proving; on account of its being cored out instead of being cast solid.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you consider it safe to send out a cannon even for proving, which had such a blow in it? A. I should not conceive the blow would materially affect the strength of it where it is; if there was nothing but this lead in it, I should certainly think it unsafe - I should think the proving would discover whether the defect extended farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you let them take the risk of that? A. We let them take the risk of that.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When cannons are cast hollow, they undergo a process, called smoothing? A. Certainly - the hole cast is not of sufficient capacity for the bore required; it is cut out afterwards, and that would discover any defect in casting - this has never been smoothed; that is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060076"/>duty of the person who orders them of the founder - the founder has nothing to do but to give you a cast from your pattern; I was never present at the process of proving; there appears to me a very slight blow on the under part of this cannon, not where the strength is required - I know what caution should be used to prevent mischief in proving guns; they should be loaded with double or treble the usual quantity of powder, and embanked round with sand or clay, to prevent the fragments flying about, if it burst.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If an oil and colour man orders cannons, should you consider it his duty to smooth them? A. The founder considers he has nothing to do with it - it is his business to cast the wheels, but not to send them home mounted; these are mounted - I have known them sent home on a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. If these are sent home on a carriage, do you mean the oilman was to expect he was to smooth them after their coming home in this way? A. I do not consider a founder should take orders from an oilman; they are smoothed with a lathe, which is an engineer's business - oilmen do not keep such tools.</p>

            . I have been an iron-founder between fifty and sixty years - I have carried on business in King-street, Long-acre, forty-two years. It is not a founder's business to prove or smooth cannon; he has no tools to do it - it requires an engineer, with a very expensive apparatus; cannon cast hollow should be smoothed - it should be bored, which would prove the imperfection; smoothing would detect it; it is impossible for a founder to tell whether cannon is sound till it has been proved - it might get honey combed with the greatest care in casting; I never heard before of casting them hollow - I cast a great many for different people; they send me the carriages and wheels - I send them home in that state, and hear no more of them - I am in an extensive business; it was the custom many years ago to cast them hollow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It has ceased to be the custom to cast them hollow? A. It has; I would not cast them hollow for any body - I consider it unsafe, and dangerous.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is boring more expensive? A. Certainly; it would cost more to bore them than is charged for these.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it perfectly known among founders that it is dangerous to cast hollow? A. Yes, if a founders knows his business he must know it, but many founders do not cast cannon; we usually supply gunmakers, who carry on the finishing part of the trade - it is the duty of the person ordering them to get them finished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever known a case of a person out of the trade ordering them? A. Never.</p>

I remember Hughes coming about these cannons; he ordered them to be cast with cores; my father said he could not make them with cores as they would blow, he would make them solid for him, if cast with cores they would have air holes; he sent my father a letter, which was burnt or torn up - we are not in the habit of preserving letters; my father at last said he would make them - Hughes told him to come down, and he would give him some iron to make them; and before we began them, Hughes said he would take them out into the middle of a field, and have them proved there - there were four sent first; he returned one - three had stood the proof but that one had not; he said they were for a sailing-boat - that there were three good ones, and one, which was his pattern, would make four good ones, which were two for each side of the boat, and the others were for ornament; I am quite sure he said that.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Tell me the difference there is between those you made for ornament and for use? A. I showed them to Hughes when I took them down, and he said he would put a private mark on them; there was no difference in the manufacture - we charged them all the same price.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were for ornament there was no occasion to have a hole in them? A. They were as he ordered them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you do with the one which was sent back? A. I do not know what became of it more than Adam.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that it with the hole plugged up with lead? A. That is it; the hole was filled and sent back to him, because he said they were not for firing - he said, "Send it back if you have it by you;" we sent them home on carriages.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the neighbourhood of Guildford, which is the high road to London, from Liphook. On the 15th of January, 1831, about a quarter to four o'clock in the morning, I saw four horses, one of them in a cart, drawing it - they were in the High-street, Guildford; three men were with them - the prisoner was one; I recollect him well - the church clock projects over the hill; I had a good opportunity of seeing his face - he was right under the gas-lamp, looking up at the clock; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060077"/>was doing nothing to the horses, but walking up the hill by the side of them - he said, "Good morning" to me, and asked what it was a clock, but whether he spoke to me I do not know; he looked up himself, and said it was a quarter to four - I saw his face then; there was a gaslamp close to him - the horses stopped at the corner of Chertsey-street, and then the prisoner got up into the cart; the grey mare was tied alongside the cart - one horse was in the cart; one man was riding a third, and leading a fourth- I do not know who that man was; I looked at the horses - I saw the three horses in March, that year, in the prosecutor's possession, and am certain of them; I saw no more of the prisoner after he got into the cart - I did not know the prosecutor before, but as he was coming home through Guildford, with the horses; I stopped him, and told him they were the three horses I had seen in January.</p>

            . I keep the Industry, public-house, at Hayes, Middlesex, about three miles and a half from Uxbridge; I know the prisoner perfectly well. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, 1831, between nine and ten o'clock, I met him about half-way between Arlington and our house, with a cart, and three ponies; one horse was drawing the cart, one tied by the side of the cart, and one black pony behind it - the other; they were little ponies - the ther lighter than the other; they were little ponies - the prisoner at that time lived on Hayes-common, about two hundred yards from my house; he was coming in a direction from the Bath-road, towards our house - I spoke to him, and went on; I returned about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and when my boy put my horse into the stable, he said, "There is a pony, father" - I went into the stable, and saw the black pony which I had seen the prisoner with; next morning when I got up, it was still there -Charles Haynes lodged there, and was there; I saw the prisoner reading the newspaper in my bar, about ten o'clock that morning, or between ten and eleven, and shortly after Pople came, and Haynes was apprehended - the prisoner was then gone; he went about twenty minutes before the officer came - I went to Union-hall four or five days after, and saw the black pony, and two brown ones; they were the very same as I had seen when I spoke to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he was gone before the officers came? A. Yes, when they came - he was in the bar when they first went by; I thought it was somebody coming to take notice of me - I was drawing beer in the bar it was Sunday); I saw the prisoner look out after them, and said to him, "I think they are informers or something" - and while I was drawing the beer the prisoner went away; I never saw him again, till he was apprehended a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I believe I drank with you on the Sunday evening. Witness. Yes, between six and seven o'clock; the officers had then gone, and taken the horses with them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When he came to you that Sunday night, did he owe you a score? A. Yes, it has never been paid; his wife came to me that evening, and by her desire I took his cart, my mare, and his wife over to Hillingdon, to a public-house there, and drank with him, between eight and nine o'clock, at a public-house - it was not at my own house I drank with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You let the house to Douglas? A. Yes; I know nothing of his selling the fixtures to a man named Wilson - I never heard of it; I do not know the name of Wilson in this transaction; I let the premises by an agreement in writing, which I have; the book-cases and property form part of the fixtures demised in the agreement; the house is in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman-street.</p>

            . I am a working-man, and live in St. Luke's. I moved these book cases on a Saturday; I do not know the date, as I can neither read nor write; the prisoner came to my master's stable for a horse and cart to remove the goods - there were two of them together; I received them into the cart at No. 75, Coleman-street - two book cases were put into the cart - I should know the men who helped them in, the prisoner was one of them; the things were taken to Mr. Wilcox's, Moor-lane, and the prisoner helped to take them out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the name of Wilson or Douglas in the course of conversation? A. No; I am servant to Murphy, whom the cart was hired of; the prisoner had a person with him when he hired it; I cannot tell whether he appeared the servant of that person.</p>

            . I am a box-maker. The prisoner and another came with a truck with two book-cases to Mr. Wilcox's, in Moor-lane - Wilcox is a box-maker; the prisoner first came and asked Wilcox if he could spare me to put some goods in, for about a quarter of an hour, and said he came from Mr. Saul's, which is three doors off; Wilcox said he could not spare the room for more than a quarter of an hour - neither of them mentioned their names; two book cases and one stove were brought to Wilcox's - I saw them taken away by three men in a truck - the prisoner was one of those men; they had came in Murphy's cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the name of the person who accompanied the prisoner? A. No; I saw two doors of book cases - they were similar to those produced.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 5, Rose and Crown-court, Moorefields. On Saturday morning, the 14th of July, about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner and another came and asked if I would buy two book-cases; I asked where they were - they said in Moor-lane, and if I went with them, they would show them to me; I went and found them at Wilcox's, laying by some boxes, all in pieces; they are enclosures for recesses - nothing but the fronts; I said No, they could not suit me; they said I should have them cheap - I said they were destroyed in being got down, and would never come together again; I was going away - the prisoners came after me, and said I should have them cheap- I asked what he wanted for them, and will not be certain whether he said 30s. or 3l. - I offered a sovereign; he said that would not do, and went back - he then ran after me, and said I might have them for the sovereign - I got a truck, and brought them away; the prisoner and the other man came home with me - I changed a 5l. note, paid them, and I do not think it was a minute before Mr. Griffiths and Wilcox came together to my house; the book cases were at the door - Mr. Griffiths claimed them; I should know the other man again - he was a thin man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The things were made of deal? A. Yes, except the fronts; if taken to a sale, I do not know that they would fetch what I gave for them - if I fitted them up to a recess, they might cost 12l. - I afterwards heard that it was Wilson who was with the prisoner; I believe I had that information from the gentleman at your side (the prisoner's solicitor) - I did not suppose the prisoner to be the other's servant; I gave him the money - I could not get change without 5s. worth of halfpence, and the prisoner came over and asked me to give him 5s. for the halfpence - what was done, was with the consent of the other party.</p>

            . I carry on business in Moor-lane. On the 14th of July, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and another came to my shop, and asked if they might put some recesses into my shop, as it rained very hard - I said I could not spare my shop; they pressed it, and said they were coming from Mr. Saul's with the recesses, and under that impression, I gave them leave; in about twenty minutes, as I was going to breakfast, I saw Murphy's cart loaded at my door - I told the other man I could not have them in my shop; they said they would take them away immediately - I said I should expect to see them moved before I came from breakfast; when I returned the truck was there, loaded with them - the prisoner and the other man was helping Adams to load; I was fetched away, and when I returned the truck was gone - we found it being unloaded at Adams'; Griffiths came there, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you are not sure the goods are the same? A. I never looked at them - the other man asked me to let them be on my premises; he was a tall thin man - the prisoner seemed to act under his direction, from what I saw.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Easley gave me information, and pointed out Mr. Pritchard; I went and told him he was robbed, and that I would find the thieves, as I had seen the prisoners pass me - I went down to where I thought they resided, and met them coming from Black Bear-alley, Seacoal-lane, towards Field-lane; Brannon had the handkerchief in his hand, and was just giving it to Cunningham: some palls in the street hallooed out "Go it, here is the patrol" - Cunningham started off; I pursued, saw him take the handkerchief out of his pocket, and throw it into a stable; I got it from there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 10th of July I told her I should want her the next day - while she was there my husband, James Donnelly, counted a half-sovereign, three half-crowns, one sixpence, and twelve shillings; he put it into a tea-caddy on the shelf, and said, "I think there is a shilling more than we want;" the prisoner was then laying her head on the table, and appeared asleep; I said to her soon after, "I want to go out;" she said, "Is there any thing I can do, if there is, I would rather do it to-night than come in the morning;" I said, "Here are some bed-curtains I want unpicked;" I then went out, and said I should be back in a quarter of an hour, but I staid for an hour - when I came back I missed her; Dwyer afterwards gave me this money in a piece of bed-furniture which I had left the prisoner at work at - my husband has lost his speech, and the use of his limbs.</p>

On the 18th of July Mary Clark was brought to me with this copper; I said, "Mother Clark, where did you get that; have you brought it from your son's shop?" - she said Yes, but that her son knew nothing about it, as he was out bathing, and it had been brought last night (her son keeps a marinestore shop in Cable-street); I asked if she knew the man that brought it - she said No, but he was a dark man, and looked respectable; I went to her son, and said to him -"I suppose you know your mother is in custody;" he said Yes - I said, "It is for some metal" - he said Yes; I said,"Did you send her with it" - he said, "Yes, I did, it is mine, and it is all right;" I said, "Where did you get it?" - he said, "I bought it last night of a very respectable man, I have seen several times, and I believe his name is Watson"- he said he did not know where he lived, but he was to meet him at one o'clock, in Whitechapel; I said, "We will go and see for him" - as we were going, he said, "I am sure it is all right, for I have a bill of parcels;" I said,"Did you get it last night, or to-day" - he said, "Last night when I got the metal;" I said, "This is one of Mr. Glasscott's bills, it is in two hand-writings, and here has been an erasure of a name" - I went to Mr. Glasscott, and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to Mr. Norbury's, and in going along, Clarks said to me, "I did not get the bill last night, but after you had stopped my mother, I went to Mr. Norbury's clerk, and told him my mother was stopped, and he must give me a bill to satisfy the officer; he took this bill, and erased the name, and gave it to me" - I went to Mr. Norbury's, and saw Woodeson there (I had left Clark with a friend of mine, but not an officer, and he made no attempt to run away) - I said to Woodeson, "I want you for stealing some metal;" he said, "Me, I know nothing of it" - I said, "Do you know a man named Clark;" he said No - I then fetched Clark in, and said, "Do you know this man?" he said, Yes, I said, "Do you know this bill of parcels?" he said "Yes, I gave it to him" - I said, "Did you alter it?" he said, "Yes, I did" - Mr. Norbury was present, and Woodeson said to him,"I hope you will forgive me, Sir; if you knew what I did it for, you would;" I asked Woodeson how he got them off the premises - he said he put the two flanges under his waistcoat, and the other articles in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure that neither you nor Mr. Norbury told him it would be better or worse for him to tell you? A. Yes; he never gave any account of any person who had brought these articles in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is this letter Woodeson's writing? A. Yes - (letter read).</p>
               <p>"SIR, - I will lay the whole truth before you that relates to my present horible situation, with all the circumstances attendng my guilt, and then if you still withhold your pardon, I shall indeed despair. I, a short time since, received a summons from Moore, the shoe-maker, which I did not at the time attend to, and fearful of it coming to your hearing, I, on Saturday last, paid him for a pair of shoes out of my week's salary; and on Sunday I lent my mother 7s., which she promised to return me on the Tuesday, but which she was unable to do; the master of the house at which I boarded, from my not having paid him the full amount of my week's bill, declined giving me credit this week; and thus, by a mere act of carelessness, I was placed in a situation of vexatious unpleasantness, and without the means actually of procuring my regular meals. I, on Tuesday, considered what was to be done; I knew my mother would send me that money on Friday, at the farthest, but a few shillings untill that time, I could not do without. On a sudden, the wicked idea came across me to take a few pounds of copper, which could I dispose of, it would not, I thought, be ever missed, and would relieve me from the only chance I had left, to ask yourself for a few shillings. I recollected this shop in Cable-street, from my having inquired my way to Stone's, the carman the other day. I went at teatime, and representing myself as an engineer, inquired whether a small quantity of copper bolts, which I wanted to sell at a sacrifice, being pressed for money, could be purchased; after considerable hesitation, I was told to bring them, and he would consider. Before I left in the evening, I hastily seized on the first light things that lay in the way, and tremblingly, and in a guilty manner, I left the shop, and took them to Cable-street; the man was out, and I received no money. - I was desired to call in the morning, but so frightened was I at what I had done, that nothing on earth could have induced me again to go there. I had resolved to pawn my silk handkerchief at dinner-time, and was happy to think I would no longer continue in the course I had so wickedly thought of the night before. What was my horror then to see the man enter the counting-house, and hurriedly inform me that I was found out; that nothing could save me but giving him a printed bill of parcels, I did so, and the rest I need not relate. WILLIAM FANE WOODESON.</p>

               <p>Clerkenwell Prison, Thursday.</p>
               <p>Woodeson's Defence. It would be almost impossible to convince the Court that I did not take them with a felonious intention, though I certainly did not; I wrote that letter at Clerkenwell-prison, thinking that if Mr. Norbury knew the whole truth he would forgive me; I did not even offer to obtain money on the property - it was left for them to tell me the price of it.</p>

             - we keep a marine-store shop in Portpool-lane. On the evening of the 8th of February the prisoner came and brought a little pocket-globe for sale - he asked 8s. for it; I said I would not buy it - he then asked if I would oblige him with the loan of a shilling on it till the next morning; he said it was for another young man - I lent him 1s.; he left it, and went away; the Policeman came in about ten minutes, and I gave the globe to him - the prisoner never called again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was this? A. It was in February, about the 8th, I think; it was on a Tuesday; I had not seen the prisoner before; it was by his dress I knew him - he had at the Police-office the same dress.</p>

             (Police-constable G 67). On the evening of the 8th of February I was near Tannam's shop- I saw the prisoner and two others near the shop; I did not see any one enter the shop; after they were gone I went in - I received this globe; and took the prisoner on the 19th of July; I had seen him once before in Cold Bath-square, but I had a prisoner in custody, and could not take him; I knew the prisoner by sight and by name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say he went into the shop? A. No; I had been looking for him at different times - I had had him in custody before, I think a little before Christmas - I had been looking for him at different times in the neighbourhood of Old-street; I went into the Jolly Butchers, in Old-street, where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHILD. I believe this globe to be mine; there is a mark on it, under the maker's name; I had such a one, and lost it on the 8th of February from my shop, in <placeName id="t18320906-175-crimeloc977">Amwell-street, Pentonville</placeName>

               <p>ANN TANNAM re-examined. Q. What dress had the prisoner on at the Police-office? A. A long coat, and I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he the same dress on now? A. I cannot say; I believe I said at the office that it was a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he had an old blue coat on, with the pockets outside, a black waistcoat, blue trousers, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060083"/>round cap? A. No, only the blue coat and black waistcoat; he had the same sort of dress on before the Magistrate, but I could not tell the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light? A. Yes; I looked at him before the Magistrate, and knew him immediately - I know he had the same sort of dress, but I do not know the colour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The clothes I now have on my master gave me the money to buy; I had not one thing then that I have now.</p>

            . I keep the Three Jolly Butchers, in Old-street-road - the prisoner was in my service for some time - he came in January or February, but I paid him weekly, and cannot say exactly when he came to me - I think it was in February; I think he had been with me three or four months when he was taken - I gave him money to buy some clothes, and he has them on now, excepting, I believe, a dark waistcoat, which is now with me - he had been three or four months with me before he purchased them; he used to go publicly about the street - he did not conceal himself; he used to take my children about.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What clothes did he come in? A. I cannot exactly say - he had a dark coat on; it might be blue or black; I believe he had a dark blue coat - he had several pairs of trousers - I cannot say whether any of them were corderoy; I never saw any - he had a brown pair, and an old green pair; he had a dark waistcoat and a light one; I do not know whether his coat had pockets - there was no pocket outside; there might be the cape of it.</p>

I went on the 9th of August to the Camden-head, Camden-town; I saw the prisoner Jackson there - he is pot-boy there: I took him into the parlour, and asked how he had become possessed of a silver hunting-watch which he had pawned - he said a young man had met him in the course of the afternoon, and taken him to Somers'-town, and while there he had asked him to pawn the watch, which he did, in the name of Mr. Hughes, No. 6, Chapel-grove; he gave me this duplicate of it, and 1l. 10s. 9 1/2d. - I took him to the station, and on the way he spoke to

               <p>Jackson's Defence. Poulett asked me to pawn a watch for him when I was out with the one o'clock beer - I could not, but I asked Franklyn to take it, which he did; I said I did not care in what name, as it was for this young man; I then delivered my beer, and when I came back Franklyn and he were there, and Franklyn gave him the money; I had my dinner, and at three o'clock I went out again -Poulett then asked me to pawn another watch; he said a friend of his had given them to him the night before, and he did not like to take them himself - I said I did not like it, but I did not mind; I took it, and said it was for Mr. Hughes, as I thought I should get the more; I got 35s. for it, and gave all the money to Poulett; we then went to the African, and had a quartern of gin and cloves- we then went to the Cheshire Cheese, and had some more - he then gave me four watches, and said they belonged to a friend of his, whom he could not find that morning, two duplicates, and 1l. 2s. 6d. in cash; I put three of the watches into my box, and had the other in my pocket.</p>

I had a quantity of iron on my premises; in consequence of information, on the 1st of August, I went and found Hitch in custody; I found Grove under the manager in the next stable; I had seen all my iron safe at seven o'clock that night, and in the morning I missed half a ton - part of it was found in the basin in front of my premises, about six yards from the stack - I know it was mine; there was one layer gone, and we put half a ton in each layer - I had seen Hitch there.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOX.

Last night, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I was in my bed-room, which has a full command of the wharfs; I heard footsteps in the yard, and looked out at the window - I saw the prisoner Grove in the yard talking to the prisoner Hitch, who was standing outside the gates, which were locked; Grove then went down the yard, and took four pieces of pig-iron from a quantity at the bottom of the yard; he brought them up the yard from the gates, put one pieces under the gates, and said to the prisoner Hitch, "Bill, take hold" some person appeared to be taking it under the gates, and Grove was pushing it under, but it was too large and would not go through; upon which Grove said,"Bill, let it go," and pulled the piece into the yard again, and tried to put it under another part of the gates, and called out,"Bill, pull it" - upon which a voice answered, from outside the gates, saying he could not; Grove replied, "You must, now I've got it;" and then threw it into the ditch - he also said he had thrown some pieces in the cut, and could get them out afterwards with a fork - he then asked if any one was there; at that moment the bell rang - I went down stairs to the door, and a neighbour gave me information; I saw the prisoner Hitch walking towards the bridge - I waited at the door about five minutes, watched the prisoner Hitch, and saw him return towards my door - I then went up to him, collared him, and told him I wanted to speak a word with him: he asked what about; I told him to look under the gate, and he would see - at that time one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060085"/>of the pieces of iron was half-way under the gate; he looked at the door, and said he knew nothing about it - I sent for a Policeman, who took Hitch into custody; my husband came home, and went into the yard with a Policeman in search of Grove - I afterwards saw Grove in their custody; I can positively swear to both the prisoners - when I went to the door to answer the bell I saw three pieces of iron placed against the wall, within about a yard of the gates - the other piece was still under the gates; I saw the Policeman take possession of them - they are the same now produced.

             (Police-constable B 67.) On the morning of the 21st of July I received the prisoner - I found 10s. in pence and halfpence on him, some in each pocket- he had some silver, which I believe was his own.</p>
               <p>JAMES ETHERINGTON. The copper was counted up in shillings worths, but not in paper; two 5s. lots were gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house with two other persons; on leaving the house I called for half a pints of gin; I returned in half an hour, saw three persons behind the bar, and two in front, and one who was behind the bar was giving something to another person in front; I called to this witness "Charles!" which is the name he goes by, and one of them struck me a blow on the back of the head, and ran off - I ran round, and awoke the witness and his fellow-servant, who were both asleep.</p>

I lost the articles stated on the 28th of July - the prisoner had come there the day before, and he came again that day: he asked me if I would allow him to have some rings and plated goods to show to a captain of a ship, from whom he was likely to get extensive orders, and he was to meet him at the Crown and Anchor, in Storey-street; he asked if I would allow my apprentice to go with him; I said Yes, and I gave the articles stated to the apprentice, telling him not to leave them with him, nor to allow him to take them into an adjoining room - he was to bring back the goods or the money; the prisoner was to have paid 1l. 5s. 6d. for them.</p>

I went with the prisoner on the 28th of July, and was ordered not to leave the prisoner, but to bring back the goods or the money - when we got to the Crown and Anchor, he asked me to let him have them to take in to the captain, for if I went in the captain would think he did not make them himself; I let him have them, and in about two minutes a young man came, and asked if he belonged to me, as he had run away.</p>

On the 30th of June, Pedley, whom I had known for some years, employed at the Carron-wharf, called about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; as I had often sent goods by him before - I went to the door, and I believe, before he asked me, I told him I should have two boxes containing goods, and three empty boxes, to send that day; I expected he would send a cart for them, but they were not ready then - I said they would be ready between eleven and twelve o'clock; they were to go down to Glasgow - I told him not to be later in sending than five or six; he said very well, if he did not come himself he would tell some one else to call; the boxes contained the four hundred and seventy-nine shawls, and I intended to entrust him with them; about twelve o'clock, or a little before, two strange men called - I was in the countinghouse; I thought they asked if the goods were ready for the Carron-wharf - I think Smith was one, but he did not ask for the goods; I asked my young man if they were ready - he said they were, and I told them they might have them; the three empty boxes were outside the door, addressed for the Carron Company; they might have read the directions - while my young man gave them the goods I was engaged with a customer; I fully believed they came from the Carron-wharf - as soon as I was disengaged from my customer, the man whom we have not found was waiting for the return-note from the Carron-wharf; my young man said he was waiting for beer, and I gave him 2d.; I then looked narrowly at him, and told him his face was not so familiar to me as some of the others - he said he had been seven years at the Carron-wharf, and he had been sent by the little man, who had been there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Pedley you knew had been employed by the wharf? A. Yes, I had every confidence in him; he had called in the usual manner, but I thought he called rather earlier than usual - I believe he is what is called a trouncer; he comes with the carman, and has brought the cart himself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. I suppose you were placed there for the purpose of watching? Yes; I had known the persons who work there by going there occasionally, I have seen Porratt there - I did not say the reason I knew Rush took them, was because he had a cap on - I said he had a cap; I said to him, "This is the cap you had on," and he said he had no cap - I have been twelve years an officer; I think Rush told me that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060088"/>Porratt wore a smock-frock, but I do not know that I ever saw him in one - I looked through some rails, and saw him before he took the brushes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure Rush took the brushes? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman in the prosecutors' employ. On the 28th of June the officer marked some brushes and I marked some, but these are two the officer marked; they were found on Porratt - the officer came and said some property had been taken; I called the men back, when they had been out about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they were found about two minutes after they had gone out? A. Yes; Porratt could get to where the brushes were, but he had no business there - I had not suspected Porratt of going to the brush room for improper purposes, nor cautioned him not to go; I have asked him and others what they went up stairs for, when I have seen them coming down.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Walbrook. I know the prosecutrix's house; a few minutes before six o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner and another man come out of her shop door; I thought they had no business there - I stepped up, and saw the door ajar; I then followed them up to Cornhill, where they separated - I followed the prisoner, who ran as fast as he could; I called, Stop thief! and he was stopped by Tokenhouse-yard - he was taken to the watch-house, and seven skeleton-keys were found on him, a phosphorus-box, and a lantern, and this crowbar - one of the keys opens the shop door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the prisoner say to Mr. Hogard? A. He said, "There is a great deal of property in the other room, some of which is mine, and some yours; I have two boxes of lace in the other room;" I asked him to point them out - we went into the room - he produced two boxes, and said, "I hope you will forgive me, Mr. Hogard, they have been in my possession two months," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he had received them, being made the dupe of a villian? A. No - about a quarter of an hour after, he said he did not bring them there; and when I was locking the door to bring him away, he said he had been made the dupe of another person, but should not mention his name, and asked me to speak to Mr. Hogard to be favourable to him; he did not say he had received them from another person, but that he did not bring them there - he said he should not have touched them for a thousand years; I found other things at his lodgings next day: he was in Newgate then - I did not search the room the first day, but locked it up, bringing away what property was identified; and on going again, I found the door had been broken open, a great many things removed and other things left; I brought away some invoices: the Magistrate did not positively direct him to have them - it was to be with the consent of the other party, but they did not seem to consent; I was applied to for them by his attorney, and refused, by the prosecutor's desire - they are here.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Miss Charlton, a milliner and dress-maker. The prisoner was in the habit of bringing articles there for sale; I have received silks and satins from him - (looking at some silk goods) I do not know who brought these goods to Miss Charlton's, nor who they were purchased of - I have known the prisoner several years, and think this invoice is in this writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that bill relate to this property? A. I do not know; I have been intimate with the prisoner - here is plum coloured silk, also pink, drab, black, sage, and peagreen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You must know whether that invoice relates to those goods? A. I do not - I was not present when the goods were brought; I think I have received silk from the prisoner myself at Miss Charlton's, but am not certain.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whose hand-writing are the figures? A. Those in the invoice are the prisoner's; those on the goods do not appear the same hand-writing - the property which came from Bristol is my mother's; I cannot say it had not been sold.</p>

            . My attention was directed to this property, and on Tuesday, the 3rd of July, the prisoner came to the shop - I said I was busy, and would attend to him presently; I sent for a Policeman, and gave him in charge; I said to the prisoner, "You recollect pawning a gold watch and other things here last Tuesday"- he hesitated a moment, and then said he did; I told him it was taken from Burlington hotel - I do not recollect his making any remark.</p>

I received the watch from a young man who was transported last Surrey Session; I told Cassell's man I did not pawn it for myself - he did not ask what name, but put it in the name he knew me by; is it likely if I had stolen it that I should have gone to the shop a week after?</p>

               <p>MARGARET PRESTON. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the night of the 12th of August, he was very drunk - he was in company with the prisoner and more of his friends - the prisoner was also drunk; my husband was sick - the prisoner helped him up stairs to bed, and helped all his clothes off except his trousers; I was putting my baby to bed at this time - my husband was laying on the bed; the prisoner assisted to take off my husband's trousers, but he would not let him, and the prisoner went down stairs - my husband followed him with all his clothes off but his trousers; they were not gone many minutes - I followed them down, and when I got down, I saw them wrangling together and fighting - they had hold of each other; I went between them to part them, and received a scar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060093"/>on my left hand; I then observed some blood on my husband - I called Murder! I found he was hurt on the head and body - a surgeon attended him afterwards; when my husband went out of the room after the prisoner, he ran down following him - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you one of the party at Greenwich? A. Yes; I was confused; my sister is married to the prisoner - we had been happy and comfortable; I suppose I was two or three minutes in the room before I followed them down, and when I got down they were struggling.</p>
               <p>PATRICK PRESTON re-examined. I do not remember the prisoner putting me to bed, or pulling my clothes off; I remember his trying to take my trousers off; I told him I would not let any body take them off; he gave me some saucy answer, and them went down stairs - I went after him, but how it began, or how I got on after I got down I do not know; I do not know what passed till I found my neck bleeding, and he said, "Now I have you;" who first struck I do not know, but I was cut - I do not know whether supper was going on then.</p>
               <p>MRS. PRESTON. Supper was over; nobody is here who was present when they got down stairs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ask who desired him to get it shod? A. No; he said it was Mr. Cox's.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner on the 20th of August, and told him it was on suspicion of robbing his master of a 10l. note and some sovereigns; he said he was willing to go with me; I said I must search him - he said "Well, you may search me, I have some money about me;" I found six sovereigns and 13s. on his person, and in his box in a room at Mrs. Ginard's, I found two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns screwed up in this paper; he said there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in it, and that he had taken half a sovereign from it from that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find on him any of the articles he had purchased? A. Yes; I asked where he bought them - he said he had them from his aunt; I asked where she lived, he refused to tell me; when he got to the station-house, he said a woman had purchased them for him, and before the Magistrate he said he had bought them at a shop in Middle-row, Holborn (this was not taken down) I went to several shops there, but could find no person who had sold them; I afterwards found out Harris.</p>
               <p>THOMAS REEVE. This is the waistcoat and shirt I sold him.</p>
               <p>MRS. KENT. These sovereigns and half sovereigns were wrapped in paper of this kind, and in this manner; I had just taken the note, and did not know the number -I know it had no writing on the back.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PEARSON. I have never found the box - I employed him several times; he was recommended to me as particularly honest - he moved from his lodging the next morning, and could not be found: I found it was not delivered, about an hour after - I had told him to call on me at the Bell, in Aldgate, to be paid; he was to wait there for me - he came, and was informed I was gone to the docks; I returned there in a quarter of an hour; he did not come again - I never heard he had lost it till he was apprehended.</p>

On the 28th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came into my shop, and were talking to each other about watches; Jones said to me, "Let us look at your watch" - I gave it him from my waistcoat pocket; he took the case off, and pretended to look at the works - he gave Sargent the watch to look at, keeping the case himself; he then pretended to look out of doors, and whipped round the corner - I did not see him go away; Sargent gave me the inside of the watch, and said he would go and look after him, and they both whipped round the corner, and never returned; directly I looked out of doors, they were gone - I received information between ten and eleven o'clock that night, and went to the Queen's-head, Queen-street, Holborn; I found them there with a party, and charged them with taking my case, which they denied - I have not found it; it was silver, and worth 10s.</p>
               <p>Sargent. Q. How long had we been in your shop before a person came to be shaved? A. They were there about seven minutes altogether; I cannot recollect any body coming to be shaved - I had summoned a person to Guildhall about an image he had broken; I did not say I was in debt 18s. - I said nothing about pawning my watch for 1l.; I was once in the House of Correction for an assault, but was never charged with felony, or a dishonest act - I never threatened to cut my mother's throat; I never told you I had stolen a hone - I knew Jones by sight, having seen him about nine months ago, with a neighbour's son; you kept talking to me about the weather, while Jones went off with the case.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not at first say you had lost three half-sovereigns? A. Yes, but I afterwards recollected I had given out two at the time I counted the money; there had been ten, before I gave out the two, and I left eight - there had been no customers in - the till was not locked; there was another person there who attended to the shop, but she had not been to the till - Phillips was laying across the counter, and I saw his hand in the till.</p>

             (Police-constable C 171). I was in the Strand, and observed the two prisoners on the other side of the way, not far from Mr. Warren's; I followed them - they were in company; they went, I suppose, into twenty different shops, and when they came out, I or my brother officer went and inquired what they had been for; when they came to Mr. Poland's, I saw Phillips go in, and Reardon stood at the window, and make several motions with his head and his fingers; Phillips then came out, and Reardon went in - he then came out, and went a little way off; a woman then went in, and we crossed - Phillips was just coming out, and Stone took him - I went and took Reardon, who was then running.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STONE. I was with Kent, and saw Phillips go into the shop - Reardon waited outside, and made motions to him; then Reardon went in, and came out again - a woman then went in; Phillips came out - I stopped him, and found a half-sovereign in his right hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you caught Phillips by the throat? A. No; we were both in plain clothes.</p>
               <p>Phillips' Defence. The young lady said she missed three half-sovereigns, and the officer seized my throat, put his fingers into my mouth, and nearly strangled me.</p>

             (Police-constable H 59). I was passing near Tottenham-street. Onslow called me, and pointed out the prisoner; I went and took hold of him - he asked what was the matter: I said I would soon tell him- I took him to the sugar, and told him he was charged with stealing that; he said he was innocent, that he had only been standing in company with the man who took it- he had a dark green cap on.</p>

On the 7th of July he applied for two stoves: I delivered him one - he said he would bring the order for them in a few days; on the 10th he brought this paper, and had the other stove - I think it was sixteen inches; he said they were for Mr. Ferguson, who had taken a house at Walham-green, and he should want these stoves, and a variety of other articles, to furnish it - I think I could not have stated before that he had the first on the 5th or 6th; this deposition has my signature to it - I think what I say now is true, within a day or two.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH TANSLEY. I was at my shop on the 10th of July, when the prisoner produced this paper; I did not see it to read it - he came for a stove then, and he had had one the day before, when I was out - when I saw him on the 10th, my young man let him have a stove in my presence; I did not give the order for it - I was busy at the time; I think the stove the prisoner had then was a twenty-two inch one, and the one he had before was a twentyfour inch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not take particular notice of what was passing? A. Yes, I did; I was serving another customer at the time - my son, who is thirteen years old, was at the end of the shop; the prisoner took a recess eliptic stove, and, to the best of my recollection, it was a twenty-four inch; it was twenty-two or twenty-four - I have not looked at the book; the first was entered on the 7th of July, by my clerk - I know Mr. Ferguson, and know his hand-writing; I do not think my clerk did - he has been with me since November; in the beginning of this year, Mr. Ferguson has sent orders.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LABRUM re-examined. Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that the two stoves were delivered in consequence of this paper? A. Yes, they would not have been delivered without.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on your oath at the Police-office? A. Yes; I did not say at the office that the paper was delivered the first time - my deposition was read, and I signed it, but there might be a few words I did not hear - there were a great many people there, and there might be a mistake; I heard the greater part of it - the prisoner had brought genuine orders on former occasions, and when he came for the first of these stoves I asked if he had brought an order; he said No, but he would bring it when he came again: if he had come without an order the second time, I should have suspected him.</p>

I ran up; Clark was given to me, and I took him to the station - Turner was loitering about there, and Clark said to him, "I am pinned for them boots," and from the description I had received I took Turner - I found this knife on him, which the little boy says he thinks is the knife.</p>

               <p>ESQUIRE DUKE. I know this goose to be mine; I had seen it safe the morning before, in a little paddock at the back of my house - I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man on Highgate-hill with some geese in a cart - his trace broke, and he asked me if I had a bit of string; I lent him a bit - a man came and asked if the geese were for sale; he said Yes, they were 3s. each: I said I would have one for half a crown and bought it.</p>

I stopped the prisoner near Russell-square on the 24th of July, at halfpast six o'clock in the morning; she had these articles on her - I asked what she had got: she said various articles which she had brought from Charlton-street, Somers'-town where she lived - that she was going to Mr. Ardin's, in Staples Inn, and she was laundress there; I then looked at the things, and asked her if he had said she was to carry a set of boot-trees there - she said she had heard of them, but she did not know whether she was to carry them that morning or not; I said, "I will go there with you:" we went a few steps, and then she said, "I am going to my daughter" - I then took her; this was about five hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I know the prisoner; about the beginning of March this year I went to the Cock, in Leadenhall-street, and saw Thomas Fallen, Andrew Morgan, and John Dalton there; I went out with Dalton, and when I came back the prisoner was in the tap-room -Dalton and Fallen said to me, "How did you get on?" and I told them what Norrington's clothes sold for; I said his clothes sold for 7l. odd, and that his wages were 7l. odd - I said nothing more in the prisoner's presence, and do not think she said any thing; we drank together, and I left them; nothing more was said while I was there- I did not stay two minutes; none of them made any answer when I stated what the clothes sold for; Morgan and Fallen lived in the same house as I did - the ycame to me one evening, but the prisoner was not there; next morning Dalton and she were at Fallen's house, where I lived - they worked there; all that was said before the prisoner was, that the will was made out, and they were to give me a sovereign, and 5s. for my trouble in going up; I was to have that if she got the money - this was said on Saturday night; it was for going to the owners about the money, which I had done - I was to do nothing more for the sovereign; the prisoner said she did not mind; they seemed all agreeable to it; a few days after that I asked her how she got on with Benjamin Norrington's will; she said she was obliged to take it to a lawyer, as she could not get it, for the ship was put into the Commons', and she did not think she should get it at all; but Morgan was to pay 1l. to fetch the will away from the lawyer who she had employed to try to get the money - I afterwards asked her how she got on; she said she did not think she should get the money, for there was another will made on board the ship - I do not recollect ever seeing this paper before (looking at one.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you ever married? A. Yes; my husband's name was Thomas Pringle - I have not lived with him for several years - I do not know whether he is alive; my maiden name was Pettit - I have gone by the name of Francis, who I lived with; and by the name of Carnel, who I lived with nine years, and buried - I swore by the name of Mary Elliot, at Doctor'scommons, by Mrs. Dalton's request, as she had a will at Mr. Clarkson's, and could not go up herself; I was in the House of Correction for a month, for unlawfully pawning a cloak which I had borrowed - I forget whether I ever swore in this Court that I was single; I did not swear I could not read - I said I could not read writing well - I do not recollect mentioning I could not read at all; I said I could not write the alphabet - I can read a little - I do not recollect whether I swore I could not read; I can write the different names I have gone by, but nothing else.</p>

            . I was Dalton's landlord. The prisoner called on me with a letter from Dalton, who was then a prisoner in Newgate; it was two or three days after he was committed, and about two months ago she wished to remove some clothes, but did not have them.</p>
               <p>The five letters found in the prisoner's pocket were all directed to Mrs. James, or Phoebe James; four of them were signed Andrew Morgan, and one John Dalton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I must confess that I have been too credulous in yielding to the false and impious persuasions of a young man named Pavel, whose name I have for some time assumed, and by whom I was, about six years ago, seduced from my parents and friends, and having brought me from my native city (Worcester) to London, was soon afterwards deserted by him, leaving me without any means of obtaining a livelihood otherwise than at the expence of chastity; on which I, in the first instance, am sorry to say, set too slight a value - in the course of these dissolute pursuits, it was my province to become acquainted with various seafaring men, one of whom was Norrington, the testator of the will in question, and who, in the course of a long intimacy, always gave me to understand that he had no relatives or friends to whom he was under any obligation, alleging, that although he had a step-mother, he did not consider her any relative - on the 8th of February, 1831, after informing me of his intention of going to sea, he left me the will, and told me, that in the course of a day or two the ship would be at Gravesend, from whence he would send me a monthly note;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060110"/>and on condition that I would mend my course of life, promised that we should get married on his return from sea; on the ship's arrival from India, I naturally made inquiry respecting him, and on discovering his decease, applied at Mr. Read's countinghouse, where I was instructed to administer to his wages and effects; I shall not further trespass on you with the details of intimate friendship that subsisted between the deceased and myself, but will suffice it to remark, that there could be no necessity for making a second will in favour of the step-mother, had the testator not revoked the first will to her by the will made in my favour. for which I am now prosecuted, and the date of which is evidently between the two wills in the step-mothers possession.</p>

I was at Mr. Arnold's paper-manufactory with him some days before he died; I was there a week and two days - on a Thursday, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners there; Bowery leaned my brother over the valve of the steam-boiler, and Hartley let it off on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say why they did this? A. Because he took some grapes out of Mr. Arnold's garden the day before; he and some other <rs id="t18320906-257-viclabel1446" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>Q. Did it hurt him? A. No, only the fright; he became ill two or three minutes afterwards - he did not go home till about an hour after; when the steaming was going on he called out Murder! and tried to get away - he did not try to kick either of them; I think I have said he was trying to kick them - he died on the Sunday week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This happened on a Thursday? A. Yes; I had seen my brother eating the grapes on Wednesday night - I did not eat any, they were not very ripe; I think he had a bunch - he eat some of them; I am not sure that he did not eat the whole bunch - it was as large as my first; they were green grapes - I saw him on the Friday, laying on the cellar flap; he could not play about, he could walk about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not walk about the place where the steamengine is, all day? A. Yes; he was taken to Mr. Wilson, the doctor.</p>

            . I am the last witness' mother - he is twelve years old next February; my son, who is dead, was seven years and seven months old; he came home to me about an hour after the steaming, and looked very ill; he was playing about on Friday and Saturday, and was taken ill in the middle of Saturday night - I called in Mr. Wilson on Sunday morning; he voided a worm on the Thursday or Friday after he was steamed - he vomited it upwards, when I gave him a cup of beef tea; I gave the worm to one of the Coroner's Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was he taken ill on Saturday night? -A. With violent purging and vomiting, and that continued till his death; he died on the Sunday following, the 2nd of September - I observed that his eyes never closed from the Sunday he was taken ill till he died.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I was first consulted about this child on Sunday; he was attacked with violent vomiting and purging - I administered medicine adapted to that complaint; I saw him but twice - the second time was on Thursday; the mother did not show me the worm, nor apprise me of it - I did not attend the opening of the body; the disease appeared likely to terminate in death.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge of any other cause for death than the disease? A. My opinion is, there was something in the bowels and stomach causing continued irritation - a boy of his temperament and age eating unripe grapes I should think very likely to produce that; it was as likely to produce that complaint as any thing - it did not strike me at the time that he had worms; his mother did not inform me of his having been steamed till after the Thursday - as far as my opinion goes, I should think that could not have caused his death; I saw the worm before the inquest (looking at it) - there are generally a number of worms in the stomach where one is found; they are often produced by eating unripe fruit, that is the exciting cause, but they are produced by a morbid secretion of the canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not a severe complaint of the stomach produce some complaint on the brain? A. That is generally consecutive; the brain and stomach act on each other - there is great sympathy between them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We have heard of his eyes being continually open from the Friday till he died, does that indicate any thing the matter with the brain? A. It often does.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I opened the head and body of the child after death; the approximate cause of death was inflammation of the surface of the brain; there was a predisposing cause in the system, which was a very firm adhesion of the membrane lining the chest - that must have proceeded 
from inflammation; it was a predisposing cause providing an existing cause applied - I think it extremely probable that the steam being let off in his face 
was the cause.</p>


               <p>Q. Are you able to say that with any certainty? A. There was a great deal of probability to come to that conclusion - any powerful stimulant on the mind may produce inflammation of the brain; it might be caused by other means; we are very often unable to account for inflammation: of the brain; and this may have been produced by causes which I could not observe - I found no worms on opening the body,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard he was playing about for two days after the steaming? A. Yes - I did not attend him till I was called in to open the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with the opinion of the gentleman who attended him? A. With regard to the irritation of the stomach, I consider that a symptom of inflammation of the brain: unripe grapes might disorder his stomach - there is a great sympathy between the stomach and brain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The boy had been vomiting and purging all the week - might not that be the consequence of eating unripe grapes? A. Very probably it might.</p>

I attended the opening of the body - my opinion is that the child died from inflammation of the brain; from the representation given, I should naturally conclude that arose from a certain exciting cause - that is the steam which was let off while he was held over it - vomiting and purging for a week would undoubtedly cause death; there was no inflammation of the chest; but there was the result of a prior inflammation in the thorax on the left side - that was a previous inflammation, not within the last ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Inflammation there sometimes produces some disorder in the brain? A. It is not usual - I have not witnessed it; there is certainly a sympathy between the stomach and brain; when the surface of the brain is inflamed we cannot sometimes ascertain the cause; it is very often so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When there is a disordered state of the stomach, would you not expect some consecutive disorder of the brain? A. Not permanent; I should certainly expect the brain would be affected by a disordered stomach - vomiting and purging would irritate the stomach- I should not think the quantity of unripe grapes he eat would disorder his stomach; there may be constitutions where eating a single unripe grape would cause vomiting and purging - a child eating a dozen might be likely to produce it.</p>

            , JUN. I am seven years old. I remember Charles Willis being steamed; I saw him on the Wednesday before that, in Mr. Wade's yard, eating green grapes - he had a bunch; there was a good many on it - I saw him nearly finish the bunch: I eat some - they were sour; they were off a wall.</p>

I apprehended Carmozie on the 28th of August, at No. 2, Saffron-hill; I found his door fastened inside, and threatened twice to break it open - it was then opened; I found him and two women there - I asked his name; he said Johnson; I said I did not believe that, and that I wanted him for a robbery, in Albany-street - I said, "What was done with the plate?" he said, "So help me God, I know nothing about it;" I searched him: he said if I would not handcuff him, he would go with me quietly; and when we got on the landing, I said, "Come, come, Carmozie it won't do;" he said, "Oh! then you know me, do you?" I said, "Yes, I know you very well," and took him to the station.</p>

Before April, this year, application was made by a woman calling herself Langford, for relief on behalf of two children; she said they were at Birmingham - the officers advanced her a trifle to go down and see them - it was afterwards reported that she was dead, and in June, application was made by a female, who I do not know, representing that Langford's two children were at Westminster; she summoned the parish-officers to show cause why they had not relieved the children - I attended the summons before Alderman Wilson, and the first person I saw at Guildhall, was Mrs. Langford, who had been represented as dead; I also saw the woman who had summoned me, and at Guildhall, the woman said her name was not Langford, but I am sure she is the woman who had applied by that name; the children not living in our parish, the Magistrate said they must be removed by the parish of Westminster - on the 3rd of July, they were removed into our parish from Westminster, by an order which I have; it describes them as Ann Langford, aged eight, and George Langford, aged four - another person came with them, as their relative; and on or about the 11th of July, the woman who had received the money to go to Birmingham, and who I knew as Langford, came, and Mr. Thomas, one of the overseers, offered to take them into the workhouse, as they were orphans; but she said their uncle, who was going to Edinburgh, or Glasgow, would take them, if the parish would give him money to enable him to take them, and they would be no further expence to the parish - she was desired to bring the uncle the next morning, when the overseers would very likely comply; she took the children away, and next morning the prisoner came, accompanied by Langford, and the prisoner stated to Mr. Thomas, that if the parish officers would give him 30s., he would take them to Scotland, and they should be no further expense - he described himself as their uncle, and in consequence of that, 30s. were given him; he was brought to Guildhall by the name of Brown - he would not acknowledge to that name at first, but did afterwards; he was asked if the receipt, which I had seen him sign for the 30s., in the name of Dixon, was his hand-writing, and denied it, but the following week, when he was under examination, he admitted that it was his writing.</p>

            . In July last I was one of the overseers of St. Dunstan in the west. On the 11th of July the children were removed to our parish, by this order; we offered to take the children into the workhouse; the woman objected, as she said their uncle would take them to Edinburgh, if we advanced the money; that he was a linendraper, and was well off - she wished to have the money that evening - we told her to call next morning; I was in attendance next morning, and saw the prisoner - he said he was the uncle of the children, and a shoemaker, at Westminster; we put some questions to him, as to the propriety of their going, and asked what money was necessary; he said 30s. or 2l. - 30s. was advanced to him, and he signed this receipt; the woman, who had been the night before, and called herself Leech, said the children's parents were both dead, and died at Birmingham; that woman had before called herself Langford; when the prisoner was apprehended, he said the receipt was not his writing, but in the following week he said it was his writing, that his name was Brown and not Dixon; the woman who has pleaded guilty, by the name of Lane, is the woman I have been speaking of.</p>

            . I am a vestry-clerk of St. Andrew, Holborn. Lane, who has pleaded guilty, applied to our parish by the name of Elizabeth Palmer, for relief, on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060115"/>27th of July, 1832, for two children, whom she represented as the children of Langford, deceased, and stated herself to be their aunt; one of them, Mary, was nine years old, and John four - she said the parents were dead, and she was their maternal aunt; from her statement, we believed the children were legally settled on our parish - she wanted 30s. to send them to Exeter, representing that they had an uncle there, who would take care of them, and free the parish from any further burthen; our parish made some inquiries before we advanced the money, and discovered a woman, named Catherine Lane; we got her to the office when Farmer came again - she had represented to me that the child's parents were married at Bermondsey; I had the certificate of the marriage with me, in the name of Lane, and not Langford, in consequence of what she had stated to our beadle - when she came, she represented herself as Elizabeth Farmer, and that Sarah Lane, mentioned in the certificate, was her sister - she had at first referred me to the church for the certificate, in the name of Langford; after she made this statement, I introduced her to Catherine Lane, who said,"Ah, Sarah, how do you do?" she said, "I am not Sarah, I am Sarah's twin sister;" Catherine Lane said,"You know, Sarah, you never had a sister;" she then admitted she was the Sarah Lane mentioned in the marriage certificate.</p>

            . I remember Lane taking my children out three times; I am not positive of more - I was not always at home - she said she was going to see about some private property which was left her, and took the children while my wife washed; she said she had a boy in some school in the City, as his father was a citizen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I must say several witnesses have been examined on my trial, who have nothing to do with the case; they are more against the female than against me - the acts I admit some of, but I am in other respects innocent; I was the bearer of the letter, but I expressed no anxiety to obtain the money.</p>

             (Police-constable K 177). On the morning of the 9th of August, about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner by the side of Limehouse-cut, which is a branch of the river Lee - I observed a bundle under his arm; he walked rather quickly - I asked what his bundle contained; he said twine and biscuit, which he had brought from Gravesend; I called another Policeman, and the prisoner sprang into the water - the other Policeman found this quantity of canvas, about twelve yards from the spot, but the prisoner had not that when I saw him - in about two hours after I saw the prisoner again near the same spot, wholly immersed in the water, except his head - seeing he was discovered he endeavoured to escape, but I leaped into the water, swam across, and took him getting up the bank on the other side; when I saw him he was about two hundred yards from the prosecutors' warehouse.</p>

On the 27th of July I was on the Pavement, near Finsbury - I saw Farley lift up the gentleman's coat, take out the handkerchief, and give it to Hay, who went down a street, across the road - Hay put it into his hat; the prisoners then met together again - Farley had been a school-fellow of mine; I had seen Hay in Milton-street.</p>
               <p>Farley. He said at the office he could not see what was taken out. Witness. I could not see at the time, but when he got across the road I saw it was a handkerchief; he held it up in his hand.</p>

On last Friday five weeks the prisoner was at home at eight o'clock in the evening, and did not go out till the next morning - I recollect the time perfectly well, for I was going out myself, and I was at Mile-end by nine; I went out a little after eight, and was at home after nine o'clock - he had not been out, I am sure- I was in the kitchen, with my mother, when he came home; the candle was lighted about dusk, about seven -I had noticed the time, as I had an appointment at eight, and was waiting for my brother to come home, to stop with my youngest sister, and he came in at eight, or two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060117"/>three minutes after - I had gone up to see the time by a dial in one of the offices on the ground floor; there is no clock on the first floor; it is on the ground floor, in one of the offices.</p>

            . I am now living with my friends; I have left the course of life I was in - I was an unfortunate girl; I was acquainted with the prisoner Austin - he was a clerk in the East India-house; I heard him say he had been a clerk before, but I do not know to what - he came to live with me at my lodging in York-square; he came there the beginning of June, a little before Greenwich fair - I afterwards lived with him at Harrison-street, Gray's Inn-lane, and at Easton-street, Clerkenwell; when we lived at Harrison-street, I pawned a coat for him with a velvet collar, at Mr. Loveday's in Gray's Inn-lane - I knew Davis while I lived in Harrison-street; I had never seen him before - he gave me a coat to pawn at the same time that Austin did; that had not a velvet collar - the prisoners were together when they gave me the coats; they took them out of the house, and gave them to me in the street - they had brought them into the house: one of the coats was tied up in a green silk handkerchief, but I do not know which - I received a mourning-ring about three weeks afterwards, at the Cheshire Cheese, publichouse, to pawn; I looked at the name on it, but could not tell what it was - it was after that that Davis and two other men went with me to the public-house, and the officer came and took us; when I went to Hatton-garden, I told what I have stated now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But you never said any thing about it till the pawnbroker had identified you as the person? A. I did not know they had been stolen - I did not make the statement to save myself; Mr. Newton taxed me with it, and said I had better tell what I had done - I was frightened; I never was in trouble before, but I stated what was true - I have gone by the name of Jager, and Austin told me that his name was Copeland, and authorized me to go by that name; Mr. Jager has been transported - I have gone by the name of Bouverie and Knapp; I lived with a tradesman of that name - some people have called me James; I never went by the name of Briant - people have called me Sidworth, but I never gave my name as that; I went by that name when I lived in Lancaster-street - I never went by the name of Bland: my sister has gone by that name - I have not had another friend of mine transported; I was taken once for being out late, but I positively swear I never was taken on a charge of felony - I have worked at dress-making; I have been in town ten years - I was getting my living in the street when I lived in Lancaster-street; I was there four or six months - I had before that worked for my living, but when I had no work, I was obliged to go in the street: when I went to Easton-street, Austin told me to take a lodging, and he would pay for it - I went by the name of Bouverie when I lived in York-square; I used then to work when I had it to do, but I had not been there long before Austin spoke to me; when I first came to London I lived with my aunt, who was a dressmaker: I did not live with her long - Hollman, Smith, and Davis were with me when I was taken; I was not at home when the coats were brought to Harrison-street; I did not see them brought; Smith and a female he lived with lived in that house, and I believe no one else but the landlady - I know it was in July that the prisoner took the coats from the house, but I cannot say what time, only I know I was not there in June, and these coats were brought about a week before I left, but I cannot say when I left; the coats were wrapped up when I received them, and it was candle-light - Austin told me that the coat he gave me had a velvet collar, and I was to ask 30s. for that; I did not see them till they were opened at the pawnbroker's- I had never pawned any coats before.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Neither of the coats had been in wear to your knowledge, in Harrison-street? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had you been out before they were given to you? A. Two or three hours -Austin came to me, and asked if I would go and pawn his coat for him, as he wanted some money, and Davis said,"Perhaps you will take mine at the same time;" I do not recollect when it was, but I was only there a fortnight altogether - I never lived but with three men; I sometimes took their names - Mr. Jager was a boot and shoemaker, a respectable tradesman; I believe he was transported because a parcel was taken from a cart, and found on him - I was not taken up for that.</p>

Maria Bouverie (Kampton) lived with me three months; Austin used to call on her - I do not know Davis: I believe Austin has staid all night - Maria used to pay the rent; she told me Austin gave her the money to pay - she left the latter end of June, but I was not at home then.</p>

No, she never had many persons there - my husband has been a gentleman's servant -Maria came to me as a young person who took in needle-work; I know one young man used to come to see her - I never knew her out late: there were two other young men used to call, but no one staid all night but Austin, and I cannot swear that he did.</p>

             (Police-constable E 123.) I went with the inspector, and took these boots from Smith's legs - I was in Gray's Inn on the 2nd of July, and saw Hollman against the door opposite No. 14, which are the prosecutors' chambers; I had seen him in the square three or four times before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to fix on the 2nd of July? A. Because it is the day the robbery was committed - I saw him there about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and I heard of the robbery about twenty minutes before nine; I am quite sure I saw him that evening, but I did not know that I had seen him till I took him up - I had seen him lurking about on the 19th; I recollect the date by the Hue and Cry, in which all robberies are inserted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him on the 2nd? A. Yes, and on the 19th he was lurking about the square; I saw the Hue and Cry after we had taken him, about the 23rd or 24th; I know the date by the Hue and Cry; I was called up into the chambers on the night of the robbery, about half-past eight o'clock, and I had seen Hollman that night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these chambers held from the society of Gray's Inn? A. No, we hold them of Adlington and Co. - I was not the last person in before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live at Notting-dale, Kensington. I know Hollman's father; he has worked as a carpenter for me; on the 2nd of July, the prisoner Hollman came there with him, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, as near as I can say - I am sure it was not later than seven; I know it was the 2nd of July, because I paid his father on the 3rd., 10s. for his labour, and here is his receipt - they stopped all night on the 2nd of July, and left me about ten o'clock on the 3rd.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Where does Hollman's father live? A. I think about Kentish-town; I do not know exactly - I have a wife and four children; my wife is not here, she is ill -I have two rooms in my house; I went to bed, and the prisoner and his father slept in the next room; I have two beds in one room, and one in the other; two children slept with me - my eldest, who is a girl, and the next, which is a boy, slept with the prisoner and his father, in a turn-up bedstead about six feet long, and four feet six wide - the prisoner and his father did not go home, because I wanted my cart mended the next day; I cannot write - Hollman's father wrote this receipt - they began to work at my cart that night about seven o'clock, as soon as they came, and worked as long as they could see, and finished it the next morning.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. I recollect going with him to Curtis' on the 2nd of July; I live at Camden town, but we did not start from there, but from the bottom of Oxford-street, about five o'clock, and got to Curtis' between six and seven o'clock; we went there to repair a cart, and returned the next day - we got to Oxford-road about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, were you an hour and a half walking to Kensington? A. No, we stopped and had something to drink; we started from No. 31, Crown-street -Hubic, my daughter, lived there, and I called there to say where I was going; I met my son there - he did not live with me; we stopped at a public-house when we got to Tyburn-gate; it was on the right-hand side - I do not know the sign; we then went on to Notting-dale,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060120"/>and got there about half-past six o'clock - I expected to finish the job by the time it was dark; we stopped there that night - there was plenty of room; I did not undress, nor my son either - the children slept at the bottom of the bed, with their feet to ours; we did not go to bed till eleven o'clock, or a little after, and got up at three - we had bread and cheese, and beer; the cart wanted a new tail-board, a new bottom and sides - the shafts were very good; the cart was about three feet six inches wide', and four feet in length - the timber was there, and we took our tools; we finished about ten o'clock the next day - I do not know where my son lodged at that time; it was on a Monday we went.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 13th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060121"/>August, at King's house; I read the warrant to him - he said he did not expect that; and on the 18th, when I was bringing him to Newgate he said he did it on purpose to be transported, as he wished to get out of the country; and if this did not do, he would commit forgery to a great amount, for he could do it as well as any man in England.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell whether these are what were taken on the 7th of August? A. No; many of these ends fitted to pipes remaining on the building - the pipes to which these fitted, were not taken away.</p>
               <p>MR. FIDLER. The manufactory and the property in it belonged to Mr. Trebout, Sen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came the prisoner to take charge of the garden? A. By consent of his father; he applied to me for part, and I would not let him have it - his father has had the premises for twenty years; these gas-fittings were not used in his business - they were in the lacemaking business about three years ago, and since then they have become useless - I live close by, and had a power of attorney to take care of the premises; there are some fields at the back of the premises to which persons may have access, but not to these premises - I supplied the prisoner with 10s. a week by his father's order, but I deducted 4s. a week out of it for the garden, which was worth a great deal more; he could get a good living by the garden - it was full of fruit; his father ordered me to give him 4l. more - I did not give it him at one time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know of any gates being taken away? A. No; that I swear.</p>

I produce some articles, which I got at a pawnbroker's shop - the prisoner took them in, but did not pawn them; I took them from his hat, and one shirt was on his back - this was on the 4th of August - I asked him if the two shirts on the counter were his; he said Yes - I asked if they were marked; he said Yes - I asked him his name, and he said Edward Connelly; as I was taking him, he threw a duplicate behind him, and I found 5s. on him.</p>

             (Police-constable K 227). The prosecutor gave me notice of this on the 27th of July; and on the Sunday, the prosecutor's wife came and said the prisoner had sent a man for the girl to go and join him near Charing-cross; I followed that man and the girl, in private clothes, up to Field-lane, and on Saffron-hill I saw the prisoner join them, with this great coat on - I followed them some distance further; the prisoner then saw me, and ran into a public-house - I ran in, and took him with the coat on, and the shoes on his feet.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sent a letter to the prosecutor saying I was very sorry, but if he would send a person, I would return his property; I sent the man for the young woman to tell her to take the things - I had been in the Philanthropic Institution.</p>

On the 9th of July one of my shutters was taken down and the window broken; I came down, found the glass out and the property stated gone; there was a blue-edged plate and a small tray: I went out with the officer, who called me up, and we met another officer, who advised me to go home again - I went home and found my shutter in a neighbour's garden, under some pales; I then went to bed, and was afterwards called up by Salmon, who had these two bottles, which are mine.</p>

             (Police-constable C 42.) On the afternoon of the 10th of August I saw the prisoner in company with another; I went up, and followed them to <placeName id="t18320906-287-crimeloc1620">Vine-street</placeName>

            . I was in the yard at the time the prisoners came down - they tried the doors, and could not get out; they then tried the water-closet, and that was fast- I then heard one of them say, "What shall I do?" and the other said, "Put them down the kitchen stairs;" the witness then came down, and I told her what I had heard.</p>

I said, "I think you were going to kill it;" he said, "No, I had nothing to kill it with, if I had wanted;" the ditch was dry, and about three feet deep.</p>

On the evening in question, between twenty minutes to nine, and nine o'clock, the prosecutor came to my lock; he was very much agitated - I put my hand to his face, and found it wet; it was too dark to distinguish whether it was blood or water - I took him home, and found his throat was cut; it was light enough to see a man's face - he was robbed about one hundred yards from my lock.</p>

I was called to the prosecutor's house; he had received two incisions on the right side of the throat, and another on the left; the one on the right was full half an inch deep, and of a very serious character; the others, though very extensive, were not so deep - he was under my care for ten or twelve days; the wounds healed favourably.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, our inspector came to me to go into a field, adjoining where I was on duty, to see if I could find any sharp instrument or bludgeon; and about four o'clock in the morning, I went and found a watch, laying on its face, exactly at the entrance of the gateway - there appeared to have been a scuffle about two yards from where it lay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Was not this spot between two hedges? A. The watch laid on the gateway, nearly on the east side of the post - it was not hedges; there is a small fence, and the scuffle appeared to have been near the fence; it would be darker at night on one side the fence than in an open place - the fence is about four feet high; I do not think that would make it darker on the ground, because it is about midway between two gas-lamps, which throw a reflection nearly on the spot.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I throw the things down before you came up to me? A. Yes; he dropped them, and ran up the court - I caught him in Heathcock-court, about a dozen yards from the Strand - it is a throughfare.</p>

I had seen the prisoner two or three times before the 29th of February; I heard a noise at our gate that day, went out, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I opened the gate, saw the prisoner running, and pursued him; Edwards and several more were running after him - I saw a piece out of the shoulder of his coat; I caught him myself, but was knocked down by two or three, and he escaped - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I have been placed here a second time on a capital charge; the first was on the 6th of April, when I was charged with robbing Mr. Wood, and had his Majesty's free pardon - he is brother-in-law to Sowerby, and he must know me; after receiving my pardon, I went into the employ of Mr. Bailey; and after this I was told if I walked for a wager, I should be taken into custody for robbing Sowerby, but knowing nothing of it, I went to walk the match - I knew Edwards, and saw him at his door on the 6th of July, and bid him good night; he said good night in reply - Lee said at Worship-street, that he did not believe I was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. These rings were worth 10l.; they were not all stolen.</p>

On Friday, the 27th of July, I placed exactly 5l. in sixpences, shillings, and half-crowns in a bag, and when I closed shop just before my Sabbath commenced, I put the bag into a drawer with 19l., which was in a piece of patchwork - it was in the middle of the drawer, in my bed-room; the drawer was locked, but whether I left the key there I cannot tell: I put it away to pay my coal bill - I did not go to look for it till the Monday morning; I found the patchwork tied up as I had left it - I brought it down, untied it, but found the bag of silver was not there; I called the servants, and said, "I am robbed! I am robbed!" I have another servant: the prisoner was near enough to hear me - I said,"I will go and send for a Policeman, and have every one of your boxes searched," meaning all the servants: the other servant said I was very welcome to go over her box, and that it was not locked, but the prisoner said nothing - I sent for Lealter, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, what had happened; he went up stairs, the prisoner went first, and he followed her - they were not up stairs long Lealter; brought down my purse and the 5l. in silver (the prisoner slept in the same room as I did); I said, "Oh, here is my little coarse purse with my 5l. in it," and asked her how she could be so cruel as to rob a widow with a family of children, as she had robbed me - she prayed forgiveness and I let her go; and on the same day, in about two hours, I received a summons from her, and went before the Justice, but she did not attend, and the case was dismissed - I told the Justice what had happened; he granted a warrant for her, and she was taken the same day.</p>
               <p>The summons being read, was for unlawfully taking 5l. out of the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. How long had she been in your employ? A. Two years altogether; she lived with me twice - I gave her 1s. 6d. a week: she had told me about a fortnight before, that she was going to give me warning, but not till I suited myself; we were to part friendly; I am sure when I put the money into the drawer I locked it, and had the key in my pocket, but whether I left the key in the drawers when I took the money out I cannot tell - the bag was made of coarse cloth; I never made another bag of the same stuff; none of stuff was remaining.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mrs. Hunt say any thing to her about more money? A. Yes, she said, "Have you not got more money belonging to me?" she said, "No, I have only got 16s.; you have got all belonging to you, (meaning the 5l.) and this is mine."</p>

I saw the prisoner take the hat off a stand inside the shop; I took him immediately with it - he said he did not care any thing about it, for he wished to go and see his old palls in Clerkenwell - that Moore was transported, and he should not mind going to see him.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>

               <p>MRS. GALE. In consequence of the trouble his wife was in, she asked me to make out a bill, which I did, but the money that was paid, was 9d. off 1s., which he had borrowed of my little boy; his wife and Mrs. Neal asked me to make out the bill.</p>

I saw all the three prisoners, and two more that night - they all came together; I only saw three come to the shop - I heard them making a noise, and Wass turned them out; he went down the street, after shutting up his shutters, and drawing the door after him; I saw Rands and Manning, a brother of Manning's, and Philip and another man who is absent, all standing in the gateway by Wass' door - two of them went into the shop, and the other three remained outside; Philip took the jar out, and gave it to the other man, who they call "Waggoner;" he was one of the five - I had been watching them for half an hour; I gave an alarm directly - Manning and Rands were taken by a Policeman, who came up; they were close to the door when Philip and the other man went in and took the jar; they had kept together for about half an hour before.</p>

On Tuesday, the 21st of August, between one and two o'clock; I saw the prisoner just pass my father's shop, I saw this time-piece in his hand - I knew it be my father's, and gave an alarm; he was pursued and taken almost directly - the time-piece was thrown down and brought back by a person who picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was he walking? A. Yes; my father had the time-piece for sale; I often saw it - I was in the street; the prisoner ran before me - I saw it in his hand; it was kept in our shop, about two yards from the door.</p>

            . I am one of the examiners of the Court, and took the depositions of the defendant; they are attested by me - here is a deposition taken on the 3rd of June; it was signed by the defendant, after being read over by me - she was not sworn by me; she has signed it as having been sworn - it was read over to her as having been sworn, and she signed it afterwards; she had been sworn to speak the truth - I then examined her, and took the examination myself; the examination appears to have been resumed on the 17th, as a cross-examination on the part of the promoter of the suit; Dr. Matcham's name is signed at the end of the two examinations, when she was repeated; on the completion of the examination, she deelared that the signature was hers, and that the contents of the examinations were true, by virtue of her oath; and I have attested that repetition - that acknowledgement extended to the examination of the 3rd, as well as the 17th of June; I believe the defendant to be the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.

Just so; I could not, of my own knowledge, know she was sworn; the proctor is responsible for that, and the registrar certifies that she is sworn; it is Mr. Shephard's duty to attend the swearing of the witnesses, or somebody for him, and the proctors on both sides, but not myself.</p>

            , Esq., livery-stable keeper, of Foley-place, from his wife's death, to Christmas last - that Mr. and Mrs. Kenrick were in the habit of coming there; Mrs. Kenrick was afterwards in the habit of coming without Mr. Kenrick, to see Mr. Elder- she at first came two or three times with Miss Paris and Mr. Elder went out walking with them - that one Saturday after Christmas, she came alone; Mr. Elder was standing in the stable-yard, as if looking for somebody, and on seeing Mrs. Kenrick, told her to run up staris to the nursery as fast as she could - she did so; they were alone with each other, and dined together (Mrs. Kenrick had called alone, and dined with Mr. Elder once before, in the early part of the same week); she came about two o'clock, just as dinner was ready, and remained till nine at night - she told deponent she and Mr. Kenrick were parted, and he had turned her out of doors; on the Saturday she remained till about one in the morning - nobody went into the room to her and Mr. Elder, on that occasion, but deponent, who went in when they wanted any thing; they dined in the nursery - it is up stairs, and not so public as the parlour; Mr. Elder's bed-room joins the nursery - he and Mrs. Kenrick went into the bed-room twice, to her knowledge, on that day; the first time was as soon as dinner was over; deponent being in the parlour, distinctly heard them both walking from the nursery into the bed-room, and suspecting what was going forward, having observed familiarities before, deponent listened; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060137"/>bed-room is over the parlour, and any person in the parlour could hear almost every thing passing in the bed-room - I plainly heard the noise of two persons getting in the bed, and presently after, that sort of breathing, which left no doubt on my mind that that two persons were in the act of sexual intercourse with each other; about half an hour after, Mr. Elder came down, and sent me up for the glasses - I went into the bed-room; Mrs. Kenrick was there, and the bed was tumbled, and had the appearance of two persons having been on it - the blinds of the bed-room were down, which was a very unusual thing; Mrs. Kenrick's face was very much flushed, and at that time I was half a mind to tell her what I thought, but I went down without saying any thing; after tea, the same evening, I went up stairs for something, and as I passed the nursery door, I saw it ajar - I looked into the room, and not seeing Mr. Elder or Mrs. Kenrick there, I went very softly to the door, leading from thence into the bed-room, and peeped through the keyhole; the bed was just opposite the door, and I could see it very plainly, and almost every thing else in the room - I saw Mr. Elder and Mrs. Kenrick laying on the bed together; her petticoats were up, and Mr. Elder's small-clothes were down - they were in the very act of sexual intercourse with each other. I do not remember Mrs. Kenrick coming to Mr. Elder's house, and remaining alone with him any time after the Saturday of which I have been just deposing, but she did so occasionally before that time; he went out with her on the Saturday, but did not return till after I went to bed; I went to bed at twelve o'clock, and do not know at what time he returned - he went out with her often of an evening before that, and returned alone; he did so particularly on the Tuesday on which she dined with him - on those occasions they dined in the parlour; the parlour door was closed at such times, and they remained alone together an hour or two or sometimes not more than half an hour;" deponent often saw improper familiarites between them in the parlour, but nothing criminal - any body might see their familiarities together, even a stranger, who had never seen them before, for it was never concealed, she could scarcely describe her behaviour, but her way and manner to Mr. Elder, appeared very light and familiar; they used to sit on the sofa together - deponent had sometimes seen them with their arms round each other's neck - at other times kissing each other; at other times she was laying on the sofa, and he was putting her clothes down, or laying with her, but there was nothing to induce deponent to say they had sexual intercourse with each other till the Saturday in question; that one morning, a few days before the Saturday, Mr. Elder had taken some of his late wife's clothes out of her drawers - Mrs. Kenrick was waiting below; Mr. Elder said, "Poor thing, I must let her have something to change herself with, for she has nothing but what she stands upright in" - that Mrs. Kenrick took the clothes in a bundle with her; that when Mrs. Kenrick told her she had parted from her husband, she told deponent if any body came to inquire for her, not to say she was there, or had been there, for if Mr. Kenrick knew it, it would be the ruin of Mr. Elder; that Mr. Kenrick would not mind giving deponent 20l., if she let him know she was in the house - Mrs. Kenrick used to wring her hands, and beg her not to let Mr. Kenrick know she had been there, and said she loved Mr. Elder's little finger, better than Mr. Kenrick's whole body; she spoke in that way at different times - that on one occasion, Mr. Elder had, in Mrs. Kenrick's presence, desired her if any body inquired about Mrs. Kenrick, to deny her, and Mrs. Kenrick added, "For God's sake be sure you say nothing;" deponent never disclosed these circumstances to Mr. Kenrick, till about six months ago, when he called with his lawyer.</p>
               <p>The deponent, in answer to the interrogatories on the above depositions, deposed, among other matters, that Mr. Kenrick had promised to satisfy her for her expences in attending as a witness,and had given her half a sovereign when she last attended, as she was ill, and had to pay coach hire; that she had no expectation of receiving money for giving evidence; that the nursery joins the bedroom and communicates with it by a door; Mr. Elder dined at five o'clock on the Saturday - the nursery door was shut the first time, but ajar the second, when she went to it; Mrs. Kenrick was dressed in a black silk dress, a velvet bonnet and veil; there was no light in the bed-room that she remembered, yet there might must have been - they had candles in the nursery, and might have taken them into the bed-room, but she did not remember noticing them there; Mr. Elder's bed stood in the middle of the room, between the door and the window - it was in its usual place, and could not stand otherwise; there is but one window to the bed-room - "I will take upon myself to swear the largest part of the bed could be seen through the key-hole of the door, particularly the foot of it, and it was across the foot of the bed that I saw Mrs. Kenrick and Mr. Elder laying at the time deposed;" the key was usually kept in the lock of the bed-room door, but was turned round, so that a person might look through the key-hole - I always kept it turned round, to prevent its falling out.</p>

            . My husband's name is Thomas Kenrick - I was a widow when I married him; there were some differences between us, and we agreed to live apart; when I first left him I went to Brighton - that was in November, 1829; I lodged there with Mr. and Mrs. May, house-agents - I remained there till March, 1830; I came to town by the mail, on Wednesday, the 30th of December, remained in town on the 31st, and went back on Friday, the 1st of January, 1830. I know Mr. Elder - Mr. Kenrick introduced him to me; I had no acquaintance with him previous to our marriage, which was on the 9th of May, 1829; I did not see Mr. Elder at all during the three days I was in town - I once met him at Brighton, when I was out with Mr. and Mrs. May; I never went out alone all the time I was at Brighton - when I came to town in December it was to fetch my son; I did not come by a packet - I got into the mail on the 30th, about half-past ten o'clock at night, got to town on the 31st, in the morning, and left about half-past two o'clock on the 1st of January; while I was in town I was at the Blossoms Inn, City, where the mail put up - I did not go out while I was in town; when I arrived I sent to Mr. Bedford, my trustee, and he wrote to Mr. Kenrick to send my son, and I took him out of town with me - (he is my son by my first marriage); Mr. Kenrick brought him to me on the 31st, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. I need not ask you then, whether you were dining at five o'clock, and staying till late at another part of the town? A. Certainly not - I never went out the whole time I was three Mr. Kenrick stopped with me, I suppose, about three quarters of an hour - I took my son out of town next morning; I certainly dined with Mr. Elder one day before I went down to Brighton; I cannot say whether it was on a Saturday; we dined in a room up stairs - it was in November.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your going to Mr. Elder? A. I was afraid to go to my own family, for they did not like my marriage; I knew Mr. Elder was a friend of Mr. Kenrick's, and I thought it best to go to him, to ask Mr. Kenrick to let me have my clothes and some money - he said he would think of it if I called again; I did not dine there that day - I was there about ten minutes, and saw him in the parlour; it was in the morning; I called again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060138"/>in a day or two, as he desired - I think it was in the afternoon, and believe I then dined with him; we dined in a room up stairs; I think it is called the nursery - the defendant waited on us; nothing improper passed between us - we dined by candle-light - the room communicates with the bed-room; I did not go into the bed-room at all that day - I have been there with my husband, when Mr. Elder has had a party, and then went into the bed-room to take off my things with other ladies.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true then that you and Mr. Elder went into the bed-room that day, laid on the bed together, and that any thing improper took place? A. Certainly not; I never went into the bed-room with Mr. Elder - I took off my things in the room I dined in; nothing improper took place between us, I was too much flurried - the defendant did not come into the bed-room and find me there, having got of the bed with Mr. Elder; I never was in the bed-room when she came there - I never was in the bed-room with Mr. Elder; I did not return to town after the 1st of January, till Mr. Kenrick fetched me home himself, which was I think in March, 1830 - I lived ten weeks with him, and then we separated again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What is your present age? A. Thirty; I had been a window five months when I married Mr. Kenrick; I had known him in my first husband's life time; I lived in the country with my first husband.</p>
               <p>Q. How then did you know him? A. Mr. Yates (my first husband) hired a pheton of him, and after my hushand's death, I met him at Brighton, where I kept a house; my first husband died in Warwickshire - I went to Brighton a month or six weeks after his death; Mr. Kenrick was a widower - I do not know his age; I suppose he is near sixty; my first husband was twenty-nine when he died - I had been married to him four or five years; my son is eight years old next February; I was married to Mr. Yates in 1824; in August I think - my son was born after my marriage to Mr. Yates; I cannot exactly say how long - it was not in the same year as we were married; he was born in February - I have not other child; we were married on the 12th of August: my son was at school at Hampstead - I think he had been there half a year; he was not at Brighton till I took him in December: it was the vacation, and I came up to fetch him - Mr. Kenrick had got him down at the farm; while I was in town I had all my meals at the inn; Mr. Elder was always Mr. Kenrick's friend - I went to him in November, to intercede with Mr. Kenrick for my clothes and money; he told me always to go back to Mr. Kenrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not aware, when you called at Mr. Elder's to intercede with your husband, that it was his jealousy of Mr. Elder that caused your separation? A. He was always jealous of Mr. Elder, but I never knew why; for I have asked him why he did not shut the door against Mr. Elder, but he was always shaking hands with him, and inviting him to dinner - we never had any company but Mr. Elder; I had a Miss Paris, of Coventry, a friend as I believed her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your husband, before any person, complained of your conduct towards Mr. Elder? A. Never, till the night I left Mr. Kenrick - I then told him I should leave him; he then scolded me before Miss Paris - he said,"There, madam, is my door, leave my house;" he always used to say so; that was before I called on Mr. Elder - one day he began with me, and I said, "Mr. Elder, it is through you Mr. Kenrick is jealous of me," and Mr. Elder said he was very sorry he was the cause of any piece of work; I never went out alone at Brighton - my trustee had put me under the care of Mrs. May, and told me never to go out alone; I had no idea of calling on Mr. Elder when I came to town from Brighton, and did not call; it was before I went to Brighton, and why I called then was, because I did not know a soul who knew Kenrick but Elder; my family were shocked at my marriage, and would not go to him; I did not see any barm in calling to get him to interfare - I think I called two or three times on Mr. Elder, with Miss Paris, and he took us once to see the King's horses; Mr. Kenrick never took me any where; I never called on Elder alone, except about my clothes; he often called to see Mr. Kenrick - I never knew when my husband was to be at Tattersall's sales; he never told me any thing about business - I know nothing about Tattersall's sales - I do not think Mr. Elder ever called when Kenrick was out; he never saw me in his absence, I am quite certain; the defendant pretended to be my friend the night I called - I told her how Kenrick had abused me; she pitied me, because she said she had a husband that used her ill - I told her that I had left my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell her not to mention that you had called on Mr. Elder? A. I believe I did, because I knew Mr. Kenrick was jealous; he was jealous of every one; when I dined at Elder's, I think I did not leave till near ten o'clock - I went about half-past six - he had a bit of cold meat and pickle; I think neither of us had any wine, nothing but beer; I think we did not dine for an hour after I got there - now I come to recollect, I think it was the day Kenrick took me to Bow-street office, to see if Sir Richard Birnie would part us; he did not stay to see Sir Richard; he saw Ruthven, the officer, who asked what he came about; he said he came about a servant who had robbed him at Brighton - Ruthven said then he must go to Brighton; that was in the morning, and I know that was the day I dined at Mr. Elder's (Kenrick took me to Bow-street without a summons) - I never went to public places of amusement with Mr. Elder alone; I went to Vauxhall, but Mr. Kenrick was with me - I have known nothing of Mr. Elder lately; I have seen him here the last two sessions; he did not come here with me, not go away with me last Sessions, or this: Mr. and Mrs. May came with me to-day; I do not even know where Elder lives, and have had no conversation with him respecting this charge - I do not wish to state where I now live, as Mr. Kenrick may be in Court; I do not wish him to know; I live in London, and my trustee knows where; Mr. Kenrick has annoyed me at one of my lodgings, and sent an anonymous letter to my landlord - I have been in my present lodgings a fortnight; before that I resided in Great Marylebone-street, where he sent the sister of the woman he kept, to abuse me - my landlord turned her cut of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you prepared deliberately to swear that your child was born after your marriage to Mr. Yates?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060139"/>A. Am I compelled to take my oath about that? it was born in February - I cannot say what year, in 1825, I suppose; I thought Mr. Kenrick would have spared me this, but he is bad enough for any thing - if I must tell the truth, it was not in 1825, but I did not like to say so - he was born in 1823.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did your first husband know you had the child when you married him? A. Yes, and Mr. Kenrick knew it before I married him; I had not parted with Mr. Kenrick when he took me to Bow-street - I was living in Gloucester-street by myself, and he took me to Bow-street because I wrote him a letter, telling him I was living there, and wanted 50l. and my clothes - he came to my lodgings, and took me to Bow-street; he gave me three sovereigns that day, and not getting my clothes, I went to Mr. Elder to interfere, having nothing but what I stood upright in- Mr. Bedford, the trustee under my first husband's will, is a solicitor; when I told Elder I had no clothes - he told me he had some things of his late wife's, which he would send me if I would accept them; he did not produce them to me - he sent them to my lodgings; I never told the defendant I loved Mr. Elder's little finger better than Mr. Kenrick's whole body- I was a good wife to Kenrick, and did every thing to make him happy - my son's schooling, I believe, is not paid to this day, though Kenrick placed him there.</p>

            . I live in Grantham-place, Park-lane. I was acquainted with Mr. Kenrick, and he introduced me to Mrs. Kenrick - I frequently visited them while they lived together; I was on familiar terms with Mr. Kenrick up to the hour of their parting, and afterwards; I had known him for years, as we both followed the business of horse-dealers, but I was not intimate with him till the marriage; I remember Mrs. Kenrick dining at my house - it was in 1829, and I think about the middle of October; I am positive it was before Christmas; we dined up in the nursery - the defendant attended at dinner; she was my only servant; no unbecoming familiarities took place between me and Mrs. Kenrick at any time - I did not take the slightest liberty with her; I did not dine alone with her after that - she was never in my bed-room with me, to my knowledge, nor in any bed-room any where else - I never had sexual intercorse with her in any place whatsoever; my bed has always stood in one situation in my bed-room - Mrs. Kenrick told me she had no clothes but what she stood up in, and I supplied her with some of my late wife's; there was never any familiarity between me and her, to give Mr. Kenrick cause of jealousy - the defendant looked out the clothes for Mrs. Kenrick; I told her Mrs. Kenrick had left her husband, and was in that destitute state, and to look out the clothes for her. If any familiarities had taken place in my bed, it is impossible it should be seen through the key-hole - Mr. Beasley and others have taken a survey of my room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You were not acquainted with Mr. Kenrick, except in the way of business, till he introduced his wife to you? A. Only on speaking terms; my wife had been dead three years then; the defendant had been my only regular servant for three years - I am still a horse-dealer; I was a bankrupt in October, and obtained my certificate in February or March- I am sure the time I mention is the only time Mrs. Kenrick dined with me; she never supped at my house alone; she was never at my house more than three times, to the best of my knowledge, and one of these times was in the same week as she dined there - the whole three times was within a fortnight of that time; she called a few days before she dined in the nursery, to solicit my advice to know if I had heard what her husband intended to do; I believe the day she dined there was the last time she came - she took tea there the same day; I think she had called twice before within a fortnight, but cannot be certain; it was two or three times, I cannot say which - I think she came in the morning when she dined there; I generally dine at two o'clock; I got nothing for dinner, except what I should have myself - I sometimes have a roast joint, and sometimes chops.</p>

               <p>Q. Your dinner hour is two, was it before or after dinner she came? A. I cannot tell, for I have had so many things in my head to perplex me since: I am sure she dined there - I cannot tell whether we had candles, but I rather think at two o'clock we should dine by daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your belief that you dined at your usual hour? A. I have no doubt but what I did, but I cannot say - I dine at all hours, just as business will allow; she did not remain in my house after ten o'clock at night - I do not think it was so late as ten, it was as late as nine; we had candles lighted certainly - I frequently called at Kenrick's house while they lived together, both by invitation from Mr. Kenrick and without; I called at different times morning, noon, and night - I mostly found Mr. Kenrick at home; when he has been out I have seen Mrs. Kenrick and Miss Paris, who was visiting there, and generally the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you called, I suppose, and found Mrs. Kenrick alone? A. Very seldom; I cannot tell how often, whether it was once, twice, or five times, or twenty times; I have called and seen her alone - she was in the diningroom; I never sat down in the room with her alone - I never staid ten minutes on any occasion; I sometimes dine in my parlour and sometimes in the nursery - I had dined there for many days before Mrs. Kenrick came; I do not know whether the cloth was laid when she came; there are three windows to my parlour - a door opens out of the side into a passage, and then into the parlour; the room is ten or twelve feet high - I never knew Mrs. Kenrick in my bed-room except when Mr. Kenrick and her dined with us, and then the ladies went up to change their clothes; the defendant had been three years with me, and left on account of ill-health - she applied to me to be discharged, but she was useless to me: I only kept her out of charity - I was never charged with any thing criminal; there was once a misunderstanding between me and a brother horse-dealer - I was taken to Marlborough-street on a charge of stealing horses and held to bail; I did not know Mr. Kenrick was jealous of me at the time Mrs. Kenrick dined with me - I afterwards learned, through Mr. Murray, a clerk of his (an uncertificated bankrupt, who robbed his creditors), that he was jealous of me; Mrs. Kenrick never told me so to my knowledge - I never recollect her saying, in the presence of her husband,"Why do you sit there making faces about Mr. Elder;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060140"/>when the quarrel took place between them I was playing at backgammon with Miss Paris, and attending to the play, and do not know what the quarrel was about - it was not about me to my knowledge; only us four were present - I paid no attention to the quarrel; I never interfere between man and wife.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It did not come to blows? A. No; Miss Paris was a clergyman's daughter, from Warwickshire - I was never tried for horse stealing; the man took the money for the horses - the Magistrate, seeing it was a matter of account, said that it should be settled; when I called and saw Mrs. Kenrick alone it was purely accidental - the dining-room windows have no shutters, but muslin curtains and blinds, which would prevent persons outside from seeing into the room; I frequently dined with Mr. Kenrick, by his invitation, after his wife had dined with me - when Mr. and Mrs. Kenrick and her sister dined with me, I believe the defendant showed the ladies into the bed-room.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Beasley, an architect, and am an architect myself. I have seen the premises where Mr. Elder lived; this model (looking at it) was made under my direction, and is a faithful one; if the door from the nursery to the bedroom was ajar, a person putting their eye to the key-hole could not see the bed - it is impossible from the position of the bed; I went into the parlour, and requested a man, who was in possession, to go into the bed-room and call out - I could hear a sound, but that was all - if he had breathed as hard as human breath could blow, it would be impossible to hear him in the parlour; here is a plan of the room, which will show it was impossible to see any person on the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. The door opens into the nursery? A. Yes; the hinges are on the side nearest to the bed - whether the door was shut or ajar, the eye could not see the bed through the key-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person's eye to be close to the key-hole, and the door in the slightest degree ajar, would not that person see the bed by looking through the aperture caused by the opening of the door? A. Certainly, but not through the key-hole.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When a door is open, is that a convenient situation to peep through a key-hole? A. I should think not.</p>

            . I am an architect, and live in Soho-square. I have seen this model, and attended to the situation of the bed and door - if the door was shut, I should think it utterly impossible for two persons on the bed to be seen through the key-hole; nor if the door was open, as the key-hole would be rather further removed; I went into the parlour, and sent my clerks up into the bed-room, to talk - they told me they talked very loud, and I could not hear them at all; Messrs. Clancey and Dunell were my clerks - I could not bear any thing they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Putting experiment out of the question, do you from your professional knowledge, think it possible that hard breathing could be heard on the bed above? A. I should think it impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the parlour door shut? A. I really cannot say, but should think it was open; I do not know whether the bed-room door was open or shut.</p>

            . I am a house-agent, at Brighton. Mrs. Kenrick came to live at my house about the middle of November, 1829, recommended by Mr. Bedford; she remained there till March, except going to town on the 30th of December, by the mail, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening; she returned on the 1st of January, between seven and eight - I do not think, while she was at my house she hardly ever went out without either my wife or daughter being with her - that was in consequence of some directions from Mr. Bedford.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say she never left your house without them? A. I do not think she went out without some part of my family - she was very particular about it; I saw Mr. Elder at Brighton twice - he was by himself; when I first met him my wife and Mrs. Kenrick were with me; we talked to him a little while, and then left him - he did not come to my house; he called once, but not then; I think Mrs. Kenrick was out with my daughter when he called - he was not there five minutes; he merely called to ask how I was - I had met him once before, which I named; he asked after nobody but me -I did not know him till I met him at Brighton; I saw him in the Court last Session and this - Mrs. Kenrick was not with him; she was with my wife when he passed; I have had no conversation with Mr. Elder about this prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He came to your house, having met you a few days before, and asked how you did? A. Yes, and was there about five minutes - I never saw the least indiscretion in Mrs. Kenrick's conduct.</p>
               <p>MRS. MAY. I am the wife Mr. May. Mrs. Kenrick came to live with us in November, 1829, and left in March, 1830 - she came to London on the 30th of December, and returned on the 1st of January by the evening coach with her son, who she went to fetch - she never went out without me or one of my daughters; I never observed the least levity or misconduct in her.</p>

I took the defendant into custody, and told her it was for a charge of perjury, in the case of Kenrick - she said the only untruth she had told was respecting having seen them through the key-hole; but the reason why she said so was because she did not wish her master to know how she did see them; she said Mr. Kenrick had promised to give her 20l., but had never given her a farthing: I am positive she said this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she give you this as a running observation, or at one time? A. No, it was at once, while we were in a coach - she said it in one phrase: I did not take down her words, but am certain I have not misplaced one word - she did not say the door was ajar.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Kenrick. My master was sometimes out on business on Mondays and Thursdays, about sales of horses - he went out about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, and came home at two or a little later; I do not know Mr. Elder, only by seeing him at our house - he called once or twice a week in the morning or the afternoon; he has been there when my master was out and when he was at home - he frequently called on Mondays and Thursdays; and when he has come, and knocked at the door, he has asked if my my master or mistress were within - I have said my master was not but my mistress was, and he has sometimes come up to the room where my mistress was; my mistress has seen him - he did not come very often, once of twice a week; he has come on the days of sale - I only lived there three months when my mistress was there, and after she had been from Brighton a fortnight, is the first of my recollection of seeing the gentleman call - he called every week all the time I was there.</p>

He was endeavouring to trace out his property, not to prevent his getting his certificate; I know he was about getting his certificate; Mr. McDuff, the attorney, was endeavouring to get his certificate - I do not know that he has got it; I have some doubt about it; I should rather say he has than that he has not - I never heard that he got it; I know there were great exertions made to get it; I never inquired whether he got it or not - I never heard from my master that he had got it - I rather think he has got it; I have not the proceedings here to-night - I have seen them; I believe I attended the last examination, if the last examination was when they were about to commit Mr. Elder to Newgate - I was there; I think I attended every one of the examinations - I have no doubt I attended the last examination, but I really did not inquire whether he had got his certificate, the proceedings will tell - they are outside; I meant they were not in the Court.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. Nixon, and one of the messengers to the commissioners of bankruptcy. I attended a number of the private examinations of the bankrupt in this case, and heard him examined - he is not a person I would believe on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Mr. Norton? A. Yes, by his being solicitor to the commission; he or his clerks attended the examination - I do not know whether Mr. Elder got his certificate; they may get it without our knowing it - I have seen Mr. Norton write; I do not think this is his writing.</p>

               <p>MR. NORTON. This is a memorandum of the commissioners having signed the certificate, but that is nothing till the Lord Chancellor signs it; I do not know how it got into our proceedings - I think I was out of town, and I think this is Mr. McDuff's writing; an attorney often borrows proceedings, and signs it.</p>

            . I am of the firm of Lloyd and Hoskins. On the 20th of August, when I returned home, Collins told me of this order; and between five and six o'clock that evening, the prisoner Sheldrick called and expressed his surprise that the wine had not been sent down, which he ordered in the morning; I said he need not be surprised, as it was the custom of our house not to send wine or spirits to any one unless we knew them - he said, "I understood you knew Mr. Frost, he became security to you for 30l.;" I said, Yes, he did, but we should not trust him the more for that- he said, "He is a young man who employs twenty or thirty men, and if you send the wine down it will be paid for, as he has a party of friends coming, who have promised him a good order, and he wishes to have it;" the order was for two dozen of port, two dozen of sherry, and two gallons of brandy - I said, "On the understanding that the money will be ready, I will send it at seven o'clock, but you had better tell him to be prepared with the money, otherwise I shall tell the man to bring it back."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060143"/>the order from Sheldrick alone? A.

               <persName id="t18320906-329-person2738">drew</persName>
             the cork of the brandy bottle with his teeth, and said, "What the devil is this?" they then went out at the back door, and waited some time - they then came in -Sheldrick left the shop, and Frost walked about, and said, "I have a little instrument here, called a crow-bar, and every man who enters my premises I will cut his liver out - and all that remain I will serve the same way;" I concluded by that he meant me; he still walked about, stamping the crow-bar about, and asked when I intended to leave the shop - I said I would lose my life before I would leave without the goods or the money - I still kept begging and praying of him to let me have the wine; and just at that time the Policemen came to the back door, which was then fast - I sung out, "You can't come in that way," and they came round to the front; Frost then said to me, "You may take the goods if you like" - I went on my knees into the counting-house, feeling for the wine and brandy; I got them into my basket just as the door was opened to the Police; and just at that time, a man came in, and said, he had been to Mr. Lloyd, and he was gone to Peckham; Frost said he would knock his b - y brains out; I do not know what became of the bottle of brandy which they took out at the back door; I missed that, and one bottle of wine, beside the one that was broken; I said I was two short - they said they knew nothing about it; I am sure it was correct when I delivered it - Sheldrick counted it, and found it so; I had not been put out of the premises - I was there about an hour and a half, or three-quarters; in the course of the time, Frost told me if I would sign a paper, I should have my goods; I said I would sign no paper, I would have my money or goods.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Frost tell you this before the brandy bottle was drawn? A. Yes, the bottle that was broken might have been an accident; at the time the brandy bottle was drawn, there was a mob round the house, and they were calling to me not to leave, as he was a bad character - Sheldrick said if they were to give them a glass of gin a-piece, they would turn on their side directly, and then they could soon clear the house altogether- I re-packed the bottles in the counting-house; I said at that time that I missed two bottles of sherry, and one of brandy, and to the best of my recollection, I told the Magistrate that I mentioned it then - Frost offered to go with me to Mr. Lloyd's; I said if I went, I should take the wine with me - I did not see the paper he wanted me to sign; Sheldrick unpacked the wine till he broke the bottle, and then I unpacked the rest; I never was struck with the crow-bar - it is such an articles as glaziers raise their lead with; I did not see Frost partake of any brandy - he took it out; I remained in the shop, and the wine was in the counting-house - I placed myself about the middle of the shop, facing the counting-house; the shop was shut, but I do not know whether it was done to preserve it from the violence of the mob - the mob collected when I was struck, and I think the shop was shut about eight o'clock; all the property, with the exception of the two bottles of sherry, and the one of brandy, are at the station-house; none of the mob came into the shop - I think only four persons came into the shop, and one they told me was a publican, who lived just by; I believe he was a man who kept a retail beer-shop - Sheldrick was gone before Frost told me I might take the goods back, but the bottle of brandy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060144"/>had been drawn before then; I told them it was not their property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Tell us as near as you can, what was said at that time? A. Frost said he could not draw the cork, and Sheldrick said, "Let me draw it," and he drew it, and said, "What the devil is this? I can't tell," and he gave it to Frost, who took it out at the back door, and Sheldrick followed him; it was before that that Sheldrick had said if they gave them a glass of gin a-piece, they would turn on their side.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you give him permission to take out the brandy? A. No; I said they were doing very wrong, as it was my master's property.</p>

I work for Mr. West, the superintendent of St. Luke's; the prisoner was employed to break stones in the yard - I had three hammers under my care, and missed one from the window-ledge, about twenty yards from where the prisoner was at work, on the 4th of August; I saw him leaving the yard in the evening, and called to him - he refused to come back; I asked what he had got wrapped up in his jacket - he said only a piece of wood, which was of on use to me; I went after him, and he was brought from a public-house - I saw the handle of the hammer projecting from his jacket; I took it from him, and found this hammer, which is the property of the overseers and guardians of St. Luke's - he afterwards said he merely meant to take it home to break up a piece of wood; but he had denied twenty times that he had any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There were a great many people? A. A number passing; I gave an alarm - after I had the prisoners in custody, I was knocked down several times, but I still kept hold of them; they fell with me - Smith took one of the prisoners out of my hand- it was near the Police-office, but that was shut up; I put the watch in my fob again, after I took it from Jones, and buttoned it up out of sight - I had Jones in my hand at the time; it took but a second to put it into my pocket with one hand - there might be thirty or forty persons round me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say there were some men collected, who were quarrelling? A. Yes; I do not know what about - I was at a distance, watching them, and before I could ascertain what it was, I was drawn of my watch; there was not a chance for Harvey to get away.</p>
               <p>Jones. We were both going down Bow-street; he caught hold of us, and would not let us go; he was quite intoxicated - he wanted us to go to a house to treat us with liquor; when he was at the station, he said he took the watch from Harvey, and at Bow-street he said he took it from me. Witness. I did not; I was in plain clothes, as I had been ordered.</p>

             (Police-constable F 69.) On the night of the 11th of August, I was on duty in Great Russell-street. I saw a crowd at the corner of Bow-street; when I got up, I saw Tipper surrounded with people; the prisoners were endeavouring to get from him - there were some men about who were trying to hustle the witness, and get the prisoners from him; I secured Harvey, and they were taken to the station-house; the witness said Harvey took the watch, passed it to Jones, and he took it from her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is this from your station? A. From three to four hundred yards, and about fifty yards from the office; there were people about, and the corner shop was open - there were a number of persons there; it was a fair night - there was no rain; I believe the witness had a brown coat on - I observed nothing particular about his clothes or face; he told me he had been hustled and thrown down twice by the crowd - I did not see any dirt or mark on his clothes; when I got up, he seemed quite fatigued and harrassed; when I went up the crowd dispersed - we were not in hail of our station; he certainly did tell me that he had been knocked down- I heard him swear to that at Bow-street, and I was told of it by a gentleman I know, but who is not here; his name is Barns; he is a chemist in Great Russell-street - he came across the street, and told me a gentleman had been hustled, and I went over.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not Burnell tell you that he had taken these things to Worms' at different times? A. No; he said he had sold him the property, but he did not say when - I was not with Waddington when he took Burnell, but I joined him before he locked him up, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, and about three minutes walk from Worms' - he was passing by a turning which led to Worms', but not coming from there - it was about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and live at No. 22, Cumberland-street, Middlesex-hospital. I know the prisoner - on the 16th of June I was in his company from seven o'clock till twelve; I took a hat home to his brother and stopped there till about nine - Mr. Hagan came in about eight, and we went to the Mogul, where we stopped till twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day was this? A. On Saturday night, the 16th of June - I know very little of the prisoner, but his brother I am intimate with; he is a fishmonger, and the prisoner assisted him - he was at his brother's when I took the hat home; Mr. Hagan then came in, and we went to the Mogul - his brother mentioned the circumstance to me, and then I recollected it; I cannot tell where I was on the 26th, 27th, or 28th - I suppose I was in my business, but on the 16th I know I took the hat home to the prisoner's brother; I gave him a bill and receipt, and got an order from Mr. 
               <persName id="t18320906-362-person2990">Hagan</persName>

             the next Saturday night - we had some half and half at the Mogul; I do not recollect having any spirits, and we had no wine.</p>

               <p> - HAGAN. I am a tailor, and live at No. 22, Rupert-street, Haymarket. I know the prisoner perfectly well; on the evening of the 16th of June I went to his brother's, in Lumber-court, to give an order to Mr. Highfield for a hat - he had brought a hat home that night for the prisoner's brother; the prisoner was there; I went there about a quarter before nine o'clock, and the prisoner, Mr. Highfield, and I went to a concert at the Great Mogul, in Drury-lane, and remained there till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you leave his brother's? A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter past nine o'clock- I had gone there about nine, or a little before; I had been to the Mogul once before; the prisoner was at his brother's when I went there - he was serving in the shop part of the time; Mr. Highfield was there when I got there- I do not know Mr. Lloyd, nor Mr. Pontifex; I never heard of Holloway - I have seen the prisoner since the 16th of June, driving a cab and an omnibus.</p>

Two or three days after the robbery, and I looked night and day for him; I took him on the last day of August - he was sitting alongside the driver of an omnibus; he drove a cab before the 16th of June, but I never saw him drive one afterwards.</p>
               <p>- HAGAN re-examined. Q. Who did he drive for? A. I do not know - I really never noticed what sort of a cab it was, nor what number; I did not know any one was looking for him - I saw him twice in Holborn, and once in Oxford-street; I had drank with him repeatedly before the 16th of June - I cannot tell the date; when I saw him driving a cab - I did not take notice of it; I cannot say when I saw him in Holborn - it might be five weeks ago; I cannot tell the month - it must have been in July - I cannot tell what coloured cab it was; I think it was a bay horse - I nodded to him; he had a fare at the time - I believe he never had a cab of his own.

            . I am the prisoner's brother. On the 16th of June my brother was sitting with me till near nine o'clock; he lived with me at the time - he was not out in the evening; Mr. Highfield brought me home this hat, which I have now in my hand - Mr. Hagan came there at the time; they and my brother went out together - I live in Lumber-court; I was born in the house, and my father kept it for thirty years before - my brother has been driving an omnibus latterly; before that he was driving a cab, and before that he lived with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did he come home that evening? A. About five or six o'clock; he might have been out for five or ten minutes; I do not think he was out half an hour- he was not driving a cab that day - he went out about nine o'clock with these two witnesses; I heard of the charge the night he was taken, and then I recollected this; he had driven an omnibus since the latter end of June, I think - I believe he has driven a cab during that period; he left me about the latter end of June - I did not hear of this robbery till he was taken; I never heard he was being looked after - I do not know what omnibus he drove; he drove one twelve months ago - I cannot tell what time he left me - he had driven cabs and omnibusses before he came to me; I think he had driven a cab since - I cannot tell what coloured horse he drove; one cab may have different coloured horses.</p>

               <p>ELIZA RUGLESS. I am quite certain of this spoon; the prisoner never claimed it as his own - I know it from a mark on it; a flaw - my father followed him immediately.</p>

            . I live in Rosamond-place, Limehouse. On the 21st of August, early in the morning, the shawl was on the neck of my child, which a friend was carrying - he is not here; I had occasion to stop behind, and as I came on I saw the prisoner take the shawl off the ground; I said, "My friend, this is my property;" he said, "I wish you may get it," and run across the road-I followed; he said, "You may run, and be d - d;" I cannot say that he saw it fall from the child, which had gone on about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is your friend? A.

On the 8th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I received information, and watched by a cellar in Carey-street, St. Giles' - I saw the prisoner go to the cellar, pull the flap open, and go down; I went down after him - I could hardly, see it was so dark - I said, "What is your name?" I believe he said Francis - I said, "Come to the light" - he threw his hat off, and I found two pewter pots in it; I found a string tied round his waist, with another pot suspended to it, concealed; I proceeded to search the cellar, and he tried to escape - I pulled him back, and in the cellar found this frying-pan, with metal sticking to it.</p>

            's Defence. I have endeavoured to elicit from the prosecutor, the fact of a serious quarrel between us, in consequence of his accusing me of having intentionally lost my child - in consequence of this, I availed myself of the information I had of his having bailed Pollock in the name of King, and justifying in the name of Wilson, and informed Mrs. Pollock of it, and she refused to pay him 10s. for having been bail; I believe she wrote to say, if he attempted to make the claim, she would see into it - he received the letter on the Monday, and made this charge; I admit selling the things, but distinctly at his request; his wife as he calls her, not supplying him with funds to procure liquor; if I had stolen them, I should not have sold them so near his house.</p>

I said Yes - he said he would give me 3d., and that man took the bag to hold while I went; the prisoner could hear and see what passed - the man sent me to some street, and said the name of Painter was over the door; the prisoner came with me to the house, and then ran away - the name of Painter was over the house; when I came back the other man, who was to wait at the court, was gone; I saw the prisoner on the Monday following, in Air-street - both of them were together, one a little way from the other - I informed the officer, who took the prisoner; the other ran away - when I saw them the prisoner was laying down, and the other standing a little way from him; the other spoke to me, and asked me to go to Mr. Bloomfield's - I said I would not; I went home to my master, told him I had seen the man, and then returned with an officer, and pointed the prisoner out, who was still there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time of the day was this? A. I started about eleven o'clock in the morning, on Thursday, the 2nd of August; I was about half an hour going to where I lost the bag; when I saw the prisoner some days after he was asleep on the step - I had no conversation with him that day; they were about ten minutes with me when the bag was taken, I think - I observed him particularly; the one who took my bag had a black body coat on - I did not notice his neckerchief; I noticed his face.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the man who went with you to Painter's on the 2nd of August, and who you saw in Air-street on Monday? A. He is the man; he had the same coat he has on now, I think- I am confident of his person.</p>
               <p>RICHARD DAVIES. On the 2nd of August I delivered Lymn a coat to carry to Mr. Freer, King-street, Finsbury - it was my property; I sent him out a little after eleven o'clock from No. 65, Regent-street; he returned in about two hours, without the bag, with a Policeman, and was crying - on the Monday following he came and took me to Air-street, and pointed out the prisoner; I felt doubtful about him, and desired him to be particular - he persisted, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the boy came home the first day was he not much alarmed and disturbed? A. He was crying, but did not seem particularly frightened; he was certainly confused.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner's business? A. He works for the army, making soldier's caps, I believe - he was slack of work, and often came and sat by the timber in our yard when he has had nothing to do; I was there alongside of him the whole time; he sat there while I was eating my dinner - I dine about a quarter-past one o'clock- he had none of my dinner; Mumford and a person named Spearing was there - Mumford and Spry were at work, and Spearing was standing there, doing nothing but walking up and down; he is a farrier, but he had no horses in his shop, which is in the yard - the prisoner lives at No. 43, Ham-yard, at Morgan's house, and is single-Spry and Mumford fined with me on the timber, and had beef and pork; it was cold - Spearing had no dinner; the prisoner did not go away after dinner, for I gave him 1s. to move the stuff out of the way, and he never left till after eight o'clock at night, and was never out of my presence five minutes all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing from eleven o'clock in the morning till that time of night? A. Why, we had a book amusing ourselves with; I was reading the book - I believe they call it the Old Testament; the prisoner was hearing it; we could not read much, for it was a piece thrown out of a firkin of butter - I was the only person who read; I sometimes read to myself, and sometimes to the prisoner - he sat at one end of the timber; it was smeared and dirty - we got a verse here and there; I read for three hours - I had no tea; I did not give him any dinner; I had no supper, except bread and cheese - he had none of that - Mumford and Spry supped with me; they were at work, and had no reading - I was not able to work.</p>

From Spicer's cook-shop, in Crowncourt - it was in one dish; Edgington's brother fetched it- he was my mate; it was not cold, but might not have been taken from the fire that moment; it was pretty hot- I had one plate at the top of the dish; I used my fingers for a fork, and cut it on my bread; neither Spearing nor Mumford work with me; I think Mumford dined with us - he works for us at times, but did not that day - I do not recollect Edgington reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of a greasy book? A. It was part of a leaf that was sent from the cook-shop - there was no book there; I do not recollect Edgington reading at all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was you on the top of the timber or down in the pit? A. On the top.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Might Edgington be reading and you not see it? A. He might; I was attending to my work.</p>

            . I am a sawyer by trade. On the 2nd of August I was in Ham-yard during the whole of the day, and saw the prisoner there about ten o'clock; I went to my dinner between twelve and one - I believe the prisoner was then just gone up to his dinner at his own place- I am sure he was in the yard till then; the witness Edgington did not work that day; his brother and Spry were at work; I believe he was cutting timber, sawing it - I was there when Edgington and Spry dined; they had beef and pork - I do not know whether it was hot or cold- I had no work to do that day; I did not observe whether Edgington was reading or not; he might, and I not observe it - I dined at my sister's, which is in the yard, about one o'clock, and was up there about a quarter of an hour- I was in the yard all day.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Did you dine before Edgington or after him? A. After they had done, before I went up - I believe Spry brought the beef and pork; he fetched it from Crown-court; I was not at work all day - I did not help Edgington or Spry; the prisoner went up to his father's room to dinner; he lives at No. 33, Ham-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he doing in the yard that day? A. Smoking his pipe mostly the whole day; he walked from the saw-pit to the farrier's to light his pipe, but was mostly sitting down by the saw-pit - he was not employed at all; I was in the yard till about half-past nine o'clock; I should have seen if he had been at work, and am sure he did not do any thing; I remember it was the day the thunder and lightning was - it thundred and lightened very much between six and seven o'clock, and rained - we all remained in the saw-pit while it rained; it thundered loud, and the lightning was vivid, and it rained heavy.</p>

            . I am a farrier; I live in Rupert-street. On Thursday, the 2nd of August, I was at work in my shop in Ham-yard, and saw the prisoner there first about a quarter to eleven o'clock - he came to my shop, and lighted his pipe; I was in and out of my shop, but not out of the yard - the last time I saw the prisoner was about seven o'clock in the evening, when he was sitting on the wood by the saw-pit; I cannot tell where he might have gone all day - I remember the thunder storm; it was towards the afternoon - there was a very heavy clap of thunder; I dined at a public-house at the corner of the gateway, alone - I saw no dinner brought into the yard; I saw John Edgington and his mates at work; I passed the prisoner several times - he was smoking his pipe at the sawpit; he used to come into the yard when he had no work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was in the yard most days when disengaged? A. Yes; I do not recollect where he was on the 31st of July, or the 1st of August, or any other day - I recollect the 2nd, because he came into the shop, and spoke about the thunder; it quite struck him and made him jump off his legs - that was about four o'clock; I was not much in the yard - I generally go outside for a little air, between the heats, but I was pretty well employed - I did not see them at dinner; it was not John Edgington that was at work, but a lusty man they employ - I saw

             (Police-constable C 30). I was on duty in Piccadilly; I took the prisoner on the 13th of August, at the Egyptian Hall, and received these articles from Mr. Till - I found on the prisoner two gold rings, two medals, and some money.</p>

               <p>JAMES KENNERLY. When I took the prisoner I took off his hat, and there was a dent in it, in which, probably, some of these things had been, and some hay in it, and some hay was in these things; he said he had been playing with some horses in a stable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TILL re-examined. Q. How came you to buy of him? A. I had bought some things of him before, of what they call Terra cotta; I then lost sight of him for some time - I then saw him again, and he sold me these things; they ask 4l. or 5l. a-piece for them at the Museum, which is a ridiculous price.</p>

On the 9th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the door with my daughter Mary in my arms - she had a coral necklace; I saw her put her hand to her neck, and saw the prisoner behind us - he ran down a street; I told my husband, who went and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is your husband? A. A fruiterer; he goes by the name of Davis, and always signs it so, but Levy is his proper name.</p>

             (Police-constable F 137.) I was in Broad-street, St. Giles', on the 7th of August, about half-past three or four o'clock - I met the two prisoners together; the man had the child in his arms, which he went has now - she gave him two books, with which he went into a pawnbroker's shop - I went in at the front door, and saw him offer them to pawn, for 2s.; they were refused - he took them out again to Wilkinson, and I took them both - these are the books; it was half a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Lane's Defence. I met three women, who asked where I was going, and if I had any money; I said I had not - my fellow prisoner was one - she asked me to hold her child, and and then she asked me to take the books to pawn; they would not take them; I brought them back, gave them to her, and the officer took her.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson's Defence. I was going to Covent-garden, and met him with two women - I did not know him, but I knew one of the women; she asked me how my husband was; I said, "Very bad" - she said, "We have got something to pawn;" Lane then said, "Shall I carry your child; I let him do it to rest my arms" - one of the women then gave him the books to pawn.</p>

On the 1st of September I saw the prisoner in Rose-street, with this saddle on his head; there was a boy before him, and another behind him - they went down a street by St. Giles' church; I went close up to them, and one of them said, "You two stop here, and I shall not be long" - I went to the corner of the street, and the officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060163"/>came up; the prisoner then took the saddle on his head again, and was going off.</p>

             (Police-constable F 49.) I took the prisoner with this saddle, on the 1st of September, about ten o'clock - it was a mile and a half from the prosecutor's; he put the saddle on his head, and tried to run away with it - the other two ran off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Soho-square - a man and two boys asked me to carry this saddle, which one of the two boys had - they promised to give me a few halfpence for it; I set it down to rest, because I was tired - one of them then ran away; I then thought it was stolen; I put it on my head, and walked up the street.</p>

On the 14th of August I was at Bell-wharf, Shadwell, talking to my sister; the prisoner crossed over, and asked me for a bed; I said if he would come with me he should have my bed, and I would sleep with my landlady - he did so, and next morning I let him out at half-past four o'clock, and went up immediately; I then saw a new bonnet destroyed on the table; I then missed the shoes, reticule, and scarf - I have seen them since.</p>

            . (Police-constable K 154). I met the prisoner at Bell-wharf, about half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 14th of August, about half a mile from the prosecutrix's - I had received the information soon after four o'clock; I found this scarf in his hat, and the shoes and reticule in his pocket; he said he would give me 5s. and the articles to let him go, as he had a large family at Shields; that he had had 10s. in his pocket the night before, and had been robbed of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had been in company with my brother, and had a good deal of drink; this woman came and took my arm, and asked where I was going - I said,"On board my ship;" she coaxed me to go home and stay with her; I had four half-crowns, and some other money - she pulled off my things; I said, "If I can't sleep by myself, I will go out of the house;" when I awoke in the morning I had not a farthing, and I took these things out of vexation.</p>
               <p>MARY SHARPE. I did not pull off his clothes; he pulled off his jacket and trousers, and left on his drawers and shirt; I did not lead him from where I saw him; he took hold of my arm, and spoke to me while I was speaking to my sister; I had been to the doctor for a bottle of stuff for my cough - I did not take him home for improper purposes; when I awoke in the morning, I heard a footstep, and I said I thought it was that man; I asked my landlady for her shawl, I put it on, and opened the door for him; he said,"Good morning," and went away.</p>

               <p>Ward's Defence. No one saw me with the property, nor with these two boys; when the officer saw me, he asked what I had in my apron - I said Nothing; he knocked first at one door, and then at another, and when Foley opened a door, he ran in, and said, "This is the house you came out of."</p>
               <p>Foley's Defence. The officer stated at the Thames Police-office that I ran up stairs; but instantly I opened the door, he laid hold of me, and said there is another of them - I had been with Pickard, and left him, and went home to go to bed; he then came again to ask me to go to swim; I knew nothing of Ward till the officer brought him in.</p>

I had watched them for twenty yards previous to their going to the shop; when I took Steel, Clark said I had no business to take her - I said if I did wrong I must answer for it; he was very violent, and a man stepped up and assisted me to take them - Steel then wanted to shuffle the shawl from her shoulders, and I assisted her, in order that the other might come to the station - Clark then took off his hat, and I asked Wiley to carry it for him, which she did; I then met another officer, and we took the other two prisoners.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CROW. I am servant to Joseph Fennel. I was in his shop, and saw Humphries take hold of the toes of the shoes and turn them round - she said they were a nice pair, and then Steele took them down and put them under her shawl; they had got twelve or fifteen yards before they were taken - I gave an alarm; my master went out and Steel was brought in - I was at the back part of the shop; the shoes were hung on hooks.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FENNEL. About seven o'clock in the evening my servant gave me some information - I went into the street and saw Steel in custody of the officer, who was taking these shoes from under her shawl; they were twelve or fifteen yards off - Clark then came and was taken - they are my shoes, and worth 4s.</p>
               <p>HENRY COLTON. I had seen all the prisoners together in deep conversation for twenty minutes before; and I had seen the whole four together before that evening,</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHORT. I live with Mr. Gregson. On the 23rd of August I fell in with the prisoner at a beer-shop in Shoreditch; he was with another person, whom I knew - I have known the prisoner twelve years; the other person asked me to drink, and I sat down and drank out of a glass of ale - it was then between eight and nine o'clock, and I stopped till ten o'clock, but I was not intoxicated - we then all left and went to another house in Church-street, and had some beer there; we then went to Whitechapel, and there had a quartern of rum; that was between eleven and twelve o'clock - the other person paid the reckoning; the prisoner said he had no money - we then went with some females to the door of a house in <placeName id="t18320906-415-crimeloc2340">Baker's-row</placeName>

Jem! I then went with the other person to the prisoner's father, but he was not come home - the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What is the reason you did not give an alarm? A. I did not think you meant to rob me, as we had been particular friends.</p>

I was with the prosecutor and the prisoner - we all sat on the step, and the prisoner in the middle; I fell asleep in a short time - Short touched me, and said that Long had taken his watch and ran off - we went to the corner, but lost sight of him - I heard the prisoner caution him about his watch in Shoreditch, and he put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DEVEREUX BOLTON (Police-constable H 49). At three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and the other two in company with a prostitute - as they passed me the prisoner said "It is all right, Bolton;" I said I did not know that it was, they had better go on - they went to Rose-court, and stood talking together; I went past them, returned, and they were still there - I desired them to go on; I went on, and when I returned a third time, they were asleep on a step in Baker's-row - the prisoner said, "It is all right, let us sleep a while." - I said, No, go about your business" - he then started up, and before I could well turn round, he was out of sight; the prosecutor looked about and called Jem! and asked if I saw which way he ran; I said No - he afterwards went to the station, and gave notice.</p>

I have seen the prisoner frequently; on that Sunday night she brought me the coral necklace, and asked me if I would let her have 1s. on it, as she had had nothing to eat all day, and there was no pawnbroker's open - I let her have 1s., out of compassion, and the next morning she came and said her old man, who is a coachman, would not go out without his breakfast, and would I lend her another shilling, which I did, and the officer came and took the necklace.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No.7, Collingwood-street. On the 19th of August, about two or three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came there, and the prosecutor with him - the prosecutor laid on the sofa, and went to sleep; the prisoner said, "I will go and see what money my friend has got;" he put his hands into both his waistcoat pockets, and took some money out -I saw some silver, but I did not see any gold; he put it into his trousers pocket - the prisoner then wanted to go up stairs with my friend Miss Slater, but she would not have any thing to say to him; he then went out, brought in two Policemen and the watchman, and said that Miss Slater had robbed him; the prisoner took off his coat, and threw it down at one end of the room; the watchman took it, and found in it an old silk handkerchief with a sovereign and a half tied up in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What house is this? A. A lodging house - there were myself, Slater, and Mr. Farley the landlord there, besides the prisoner and the prosecutor; they did not come to see us - they came, and wanted something to drink; the prisoner went up stairs with Slater, but he did not stop - we were all there when he took the money from the prosecutor's pocket; we did not say any thing to him; I saw some silver in one of his hands - he turned one of the prosecutor's pockets out.</p>

At the next house to me there were some bricklayers' repairs going on at the back of my premises; on the 9th of August Read came and asked me to allow him to go down stairs and remove a large stone at a place which they were going to break up - I went down into my cellar with him, and helped him to remove the stone; I did not see Neale at that time, but between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Neale, who was the labourer, drunk- I had allowed him to fetch water from the pump in my cellar: I went down in about an hour, found my winecellar door open, and missed between two and three dozen of wine.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to the prosecutor. I went down into his cellar, and found the wine-cellar had been forced open, but I did not know that any wine was gone; the prisoners were working in Mr. Robinson's cellar on the other side of the brick wall - they could get from one cellar to the other; I saw that Neale was tipsy when he came into our kitchen for water - he broke part of the dresser; he said he was not tipsy - I said he was, and I would not go away: their master then came there, and when he was gone I asked them how they got so tipsy - they said they had been drinking some porter; I asked where - they told me, and then I found they had been drinking some finings; I then went to look at our taps, to see if they dripped, and knocked down a bottle of wine which stood there; I asked where they got that from - they said from where the bottled ale stood; I said it was wine, and I gave it to them to smell - they threw it behind them into Mr. Robinson's cellar; I then asked them how much more they had taken - Read said five bottles - he told Neale to give me back what he had, and he gave me back three - one of them was ale, and the cork had been drawn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You stopped a long time in the cellar? A. Yes; I did not take any myself; they were both tipsy, and hardly knew what they were saying; I saw no bottle of wine but the one that was broken.</p>

               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, he dealt with the concern about two months before, and knew Walton was in their service - the hospital people keep a key of the can.</p>

On the 8th of September the prisoner and another came, and asked to look at some gauze ribbons; I placed a box on the counter before them; both took up different pieces, what I call crosshanded; I replaced them as quick as possible, and observed a vacancy - I observed the prisoner's left arm confining her shawl, and saw a projection; she moved to the other side of her companion - I opened her shawl, and took this piece of ribbon from under it; I jumped over the counter - her companion said, "What have you been doing, how could you think of such a thing?" they were both taken to the station - her companion was discharged, on promising to attend at Bow-street at eight o'clock, to produce the pattern of a ribbon they had bought before, but she never came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. You did not see her take it? A. No; she conducted herself otherwise very properly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young woman in Drury-lane, who asked me to go with her; she looked at several ribbons, and told me to look at this piece at the door; the shop being dark I did so, then came back, and laid it on the counter - she saw none she liked; I took it up again to see if she would have it, and the gentleman snatched it out of my hand; he said I wanted to rob him, and he would make me suffer for all.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALKER. I said I recollected her being there a few days before when I lost a piece of ribbon, and suspected her, and now she must suffer for all; I had missed this ribbon two or three minutes before I took it from under her shawl.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not before said that you saw a female, and you really believed she was the person who robbed you? A. I have said so, but I am certain she is the person - she was taken and one half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and some halfpence were found on her; I had felt it safe ten minutes before I lost it - in my way home a young man followed me from the station as far as Finsbury-square, and he offered to lay down his life if I would take the money of him, and offered me double and treble the amount - he spoke so feelingly, that I took 3s. 6d. from him, and he wanted me to take more - I went to the Police-office after that, but I thought it would be all settled; I did not mean to go any more, but I was sent for on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you meet the prisoner? A. On Saturday, about eleven o'clock; I did not say I would not be sure she was the woman - I expressed some doubt of her identity; I went by her dress as much as any thing at the time, but I know quite well she is the person - she had another dress on, but I can be positive as to her features,</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the gentleman who came up to you say it was not the prisoner who took the money? A. No, he said he was not present at the transaction; I took the 3s. 6d. of him, and I might have had a larger sum.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your doubt respecting her dress? A. Yes, I had no doubt about her person - I saw her under the wall, and again at the public-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of Mr. Reatt? A. I was in company with his brother, who is not here; I heard the prosecutor called by the name of Henry Alexander Reatt - I only knew him by the name of Henry; I always said I saw the prisoner take it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HARK. Reatt is a young gentleman, about sixteen or seventeen years old - I believe he had been struck, and he took his jacket off to return it; he gave his address in Charlotte-street - I went there, and heard he was gone abroad.</p>

On the 30th of June I was walking down the City-road with Sarah-Edwards; the prosecutor came up and spoke to us - he was very much in liquor, and asked us to take a glass of any thing to drink; we walked to the Castle public-house, and had a glass of wine each - he went with as to Edwards door and there said he would go home with me for the night - I would not let him; I went home, and about one o'clock I heard a knock at my door - I got up, and then saw the prosecutor and three Policemen; one of them put his light before my face, and the prosecutor said he was sure I was the girl; they came in and turned out my drawers - then he said it was not me, it was a fairer girl.</p>

               <p>HENRY FRASER. The Policeman went in search of the prisoner, and they would search the house, but I said Baker was not the girl.</p>

On the 20th of September, 1831, the prisoner came to my house and asked me to cash an advance-note for the ship Trusty; I agreed to do so - he looked out some shirts and other things; I gave him a sovereign, and some silver out of the note - I took the goods he bought on board the Trusty; I then missed a waistcoat - I never saw him again till the 11th of September last, when he had the waistcoat on; I said, "You are a pretty sort of fellow to come and get my things from me; and leave me a cash-note of which I could make no use, as you left the ship directly" - he said he had come home from Antigua, and if I would go with him I should find where they were to be paid; he walked me round the dock twice, but I refused to go any further, and took him into custody - I am quite certain he is the man. I went back to the ship - he had taken these things he bought of me, and was gone; I cut out vthis waistcoat, and know it well - this is the note he gave me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen the prisoners in company? A. I do not recollect that I have - Barrett was driving a coach, No. 154, belonging to Mr. Bird, of Rathbone-place - I took it to the Green-yard, but I believe it has been restored.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you perfectly sober? A. I was; I have known Barrett six years; he drove a hackney-coach five years ago, and since then he has been a sort of cad - I have seen him about I cannot tell how lately before. I took him; when I took him, he said he had been engaged by two gentlemen in James-street, to drive round to the Plazzs, and to stop at the Piazza coffee-house - he said he was driving Shirley's coach for him while he got his supper; I believe he said her Shirtley-deshed him to drive one fare, and then return; he did not say that Shirley had then sent him with another fare, nor that he drove a fare to Islington; Mr. Bird and his man (who I believe is Shirley) attended at the office, but I do not think he was examined - I put the coach and horses into the green-yard - I have heard a deposit was left, and they were given up - I attend the market as a street-keeper; I did not apprehend Barrett at all - I indicted him, and a true bill was found, I believe, on the last day of last Session.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Vauxhallwalk, and am an earthenware and stone-manufacturer. I have lived there forty-eight years, and been in business twenty-five - it is within a quarter of a mile of Vauxhall-gardens; I have a daughter named Susan - she became of age on the 29th of May, and we went to Windsor; Mrs. Wood, myself, and my two daughter in a chaise - Mr. Wood and the prisoner Jepsom in a gig - we left Vauxhall-road about six or seven o'clock in the morning, and we got home again about two in the morning of the 30th - we stopped at Windsor till late, and then went to Hampton, where I have several friends; we took tea there, and did not leave till eleven at night, and in consequence of that we were so late in town; the whole party came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060182"/>house, and stopped there an hour - Mr. and Mrs. Wood are tenants of mine, and live next door; they and Jepsom left my house together about a quarter or twenty minutes after three - Jepsom was asked to stay, but he refused, as he lived in town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that daughter here? A. No, she is in Staffordshire; my youngest daughter is at home - Mr. Wood is here, but I believe not Mrs. Wood: she is ill - I saw her at my house this morning: I do not know where Jepsom lived in town - he came with Wood that morning; my daughter was Christened at Lambeth church - I have not brought the register of her haptisin: we got to Windsor about eleven o'clock - we dined there, but I cannot say at what inn: we left about eight o'clock in the evening; I think we dined about two - we got to Hampton at halfpast nine or ten; the ladies had tea, and Jepsom, Wood, and I had two or three glasses of brandy and water - I have the bill now in my pocket; I know Hampton - I went to take a son of mine to the Bell there some time before, but that night we went to the Lion, kept by Mr. Lawrence - I got this bill on the day I paid it; I had it accidentally in my pocket to-day - I believe it is not usual to have bills marked "Paid" at public-houses.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What had you drank in the day? -A. We took our own provisons, and half a dozen of wine and two bottles of brandy; we had four glasses of brandy and water at Hampton - we had not finished our own brandy; we brought one bottle home, and I think three bottles of wine; I have only known Jepsom since Wood took my house at Lady-day last - I have seen him come backwards and forwards; I understood he bought and sold, but I do not know what - I do not know his character or his circumstances; Mr. Wood asked him to go with us that day, I did not - I do not know that my house was searched last night; the officer was there, just to ask where Mrs. Wood lived - I did not know another person named Wood; Mr. Wood's house was searched last night - I am quite sure it was past three o'clock before Jepsom left my house on the 30th of May; it was past two before we got home - we were sober enough to know what we were about, to take the horses out, and put them up - we went to bed as soon as Mr. and Mrs. Wood went home: I was told I should be wanted to give evidence soon after Jepsom was taken; Wood told me of it; I will swear I have not got this bill since Jepsom was taken.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS . Q. It was not your house was searched last night ? A. No, Wood's ; no charge was ever made against me .</p>
