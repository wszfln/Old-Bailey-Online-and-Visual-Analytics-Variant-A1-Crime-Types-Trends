I went to the door to the milk woman, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle of things in her apron; I seized her by the gown. The prisoner had then got out of the door, and was turning round; I pulled her back into the house and pushed her into a back parlour where my master and mistress and two young ladies were. The prisoner being questioned about these things, which she then had in her possession, said a short gentleman in green clothes gave her the bundle. Then she let them drop.</p>

Upon first being questioned about these things, she said a man in the two-pair-of-stairs room gave them to her. I went up stairs and found four drawers in one room broke open; I missed the watch and buckles. I had had the muslin gown in my possession half an hour before it was found upon the prisoner. I came down again to the prisoner, and charged her with having taken, besides the things found in the bundle, the watch and buckles. She denied having taken them; upon which I took her into a little room apart to search her. She took them out of her stays, and laid them down. Then she went down upon her knees and asked pardon.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of last June, I took my watch from my side and laid it upon a little chest of drawers in the back bed-chamber, the room in which the prisoner and I lay. I went out for a pint of beer; when I returned I found my watch in the same place I had put it in; I sat down at the door of this bed-chamber in a front room; the prisoner went to bed a quarter of an hour before me; when I went to bed I missed my watch. I looked for it; she laughed. I said don't make a joke of it but let me have my watch. She laughed and said, d - n you and your watch; and she said it should be the dearest watch to me I ever saw. I have never seen my watch since. I took her up the next morning to Sir John Fielding's office, there she was discharged. The next time I saw her was in Clerkenwell prison; I went to see if she would own to the watch, and if it had been in pawn I would have released it. I asked her if she knew any thing of it; she said it was in a person's hands for a little money, and I should have it again when she came out of prison. She would not tell me where it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She charged another person with it? - I took all the three lodgers up, upon suspicion, because they had been in the place, but nobody could take it but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I went to the prisoner in Clerkenwell to see if she would own where the watch was, and Mrs. Cavenagh would release it if it was in pawn. She said she knew nothing about it, for Mr. White had got the watch, and that if Mrs. Cavenagh would go to the Crown and Cushion, she would find the watch in Mr. White's pocket that night.</p>

I had no money; I agreed to let her have my buckles, and I promised to fetch them in the morning, and give her three shillings. She took them and pledged them. I had not been in bed with her above ten minutes before she took my watch from under my head; I felt her hand under my head, and felt her take it; then she made an excuse to go out of the room for the chamber pot. I was clear she had my watch. Then I followed her and said you have got my watch.</p>
               <p>Was she undressed? - Yes. She went out of the room without putting on her clothes. She began to swear at me and said she had not got it. I went back into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180005"/> room to look for the candle , and followed her up stairs. She went up into the attick story; there was a boy there in a cheque shirt. I heard the chain of my watch rattle in her hand after she had got it; and I had nothing about my breeches but my watch. I called the watchman; he came; we searched for the watch but it was never found. We took the prisoner to St. Giles's roundhouse.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking I suppose by your picking up this woman? - Only very little.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I was not sober, but sensible enough that she took my watch.</p>
               <p>Do you know with certainty whether you had your watch after you got into the room with her? - Yes, I am clear of it because she had it in her hand in the room, and I took it out of her hand again; I let her have my buckles and not the watch.</p>
               <p>You did not find your watch about the bed afterwards? - No, and we made all the search we could.</p>
               <p>Had any other person been in the room till after you missed your watch? - No, and after she got to bed I heard the chain rattle in her hand.</p>

               <p>He gave me the buckles; I went to bed with him; after he used his pleasure with me, in order to get his buckles back again, he charged me with stealing his watch. He had been with another girl and she had stolen all the money out of his pocket.</p>

I went into the back kitchen to see if all was fast; I saw a string under the dresser; I laid hold of it, and pulled a cloth apron of mine out of the fish-kettle. I observed the prisoner had on a pair of my stockings; I watched her taking them off, and took them from the side of the bed, the instant she took them off. There was my name on them; she begged my pardon, and said she was ashamed of what she had done; she confessed taking my linen out of the clothes bag; and said it was through distress she had done it.</p>
               <p>Did you say it would be better for her to confess? - No I said nothing to her before she owned it. She said she must lie in the street if I turned her out; and begged I would let her stay. I had compassion on her, and consented for her to stay till she had cleaned the house. On Saturday I looked up every thing. On the Friday night I had some company playing at cards; she went up stairs and picked the lock, and took the muslin and some other things; I have never found them since.</p>

I knew I had very lately before made use of it. He shewed me a handkerchief, and said I fancy this is it. I immediately knew it to be my own.</p>
               <p>Did you see or feel the person take it? - Not in the least. I went back with the gentleman, who was Mr. Barrett, and secured the prisoner. I had bought a piece of handkerchiefs two or three days before; this was one of the handkerchiefs. (The handkerchief was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.) There was no mark upon it.</p>
               <p>You undertake to swear positively to the handkerchief? - I do.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner pick Mr. Widnell's pocket. I was looking in at a window at some stockings on Holbourn-bridge when I first took notice of him; they made an attempt upon me first. Mr. Widnell passed by me, and the prisoner and another person went after him; I followed them. Just at the top of the hill the prisoner got close to Mr. Widnell, and as he hopped close to him, he put his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief; when he saw me put out my hand to lay hold of him, he dropped it, and said, it is not me. I took up the handkerchief and went after Mr. Widnell, and we went after the prisoner and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We first secured the other, he was a lusty fellow. As we came down the hill we saw the prisoner; Barrett said that is the fellow that picked your pocket, and I laid hold of him. He would give no name. The next morning he went down on his knees, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>To Barrett. How came you to take the other boy first? - I did not take the other first, I saw him and bid the prosecutor take care of him while I went for a constable. I pointed him out as the companion of the prisoner, I then took the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>To Barrett. How came the prisoner when you took the other boy not to run away? - He had made his escape; I saw him standing by Field-lane with some girls. I took him about a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>That was near the place where this had happened? - Yes, within thirty yards of it.</p>
               <p>He had seen you take his companion? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Did not you take him immediately? - No, I suppose I ran about twenty yards with the handkerchief after Mr. Widnell. His companion was somewhere about Field-lane. I said this is one of them, and laid hold of him.</p>

I went in with them; the other woman was taken ill and asked me to let her sit down? I let her sit down in the arm chair. I did not like continuing in the parlour myself, as I had left nobody in the shop, so I called a lodger; they asked me to bring them some dolls into the parlour. I did not choose to do that, as I did not like their looks. The lodger came down immediately. I only went to the stair foot just without the parlour; I had the sight of the parlour and shop all the time in my eye while I stood there, which was till she came down; then we all four went directly into the shop, and

             asked the price of the rest of the dolls. I shewed her a large doll at four shillings. She offered me three shillings. I told her she must give me three shillings and nine pence; she said she would not, she would give me three shillings and sixpence, and I agreed to let her have it. She gave me sixpence earnest, and agreed to call for it in a quarter of an hour; then they went away; after they were gone about half an hour the child cried. I went to feed it and missed the pap-spoon. I was informed the same evening that the two women were taken up in Charterhouse-street. I went to the constable's and saw my spoon. I never saw them again till I saw them before the justice.</p>

               <p>Just before last session an horse dealer in Long-lane, whose name is King, came to Sir John Fielding's office and gave an account of these two geldings; they had been advertised at ten guineas reward. He said they had been offered for sale to him. I went with other officers to, I think it is, the Black Horse in Aldersgate-street. I went down the yard. I asked which stables the horses were in which were for sale; the stables were shewn me; there was a padlock upon the door. The horse-dealer took two men with him to go after Johnson; the prisoner Johnson's wife was in the yard. I asked where her husband was? She said she did not know rightly. I went with her to her lodgings; then she said her husband was in company with one

I took him into custody; I took him to the yard where the horses were; when I came into the yard with Brown, the officers were coming from the stable with Johnson. They said they were not the horses mentioned in the hand-bill; they thought they did not answer the description. I asked the two prisoners where they bought the horses which were in the stable? They said in Suffolk of a man who came out of the farther side of Norfolk. Mr. Crow came into the yard; I had never seen him before to my knowledge; he went into the stable and said they were his horses. I took the prisoners immediately to the office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You said there was a padlock upon the stable door when you first went there? - Yes; when I went away with Johnson's wife, but I found it open when I came back again.</p>
               <p>What colour were the horses which were there? - Black.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of August I saw Johnson. I asked him what he would have for the couple of black horses? He said forty pounds; he was in Smithfield. I took him into custody; as I was taking him towards Long-lane another officer came up to me and bid me search Johnson for the keys; I was going to search upon which he immediately gave me the key and the padlock of that stable. I opened the stable; he took out one of the black horses himself.</p>

               <p>I saw Johnson and Brown on Tuesday night at the Sun-Dial in Goswell-street, at the corner of Swan-alley; they were riding both the horses. I went the next morning to look after the four-year-old horse; I booked him in Mr. Johnson's name. Mr. Brown gave me an order to book him at sixteen guineas; at Beaver's repository he wanted to book him at twenty pounds; I said he was not worth above sixteen pounds. I took him to the Repository.</p>
               <p>Was he sold there? - No. I had seen the hand-bill, so I sent a letter into the country to Mr. Crow; he came to London, and when he saw the horses he swore to them.</p>
               <p>How came the horses afterwards to the Black Horse? - They were going to the stable when I first saw them; they were put up that night at the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>How long after that was it before Crow came up? - About three or four days.</p>

I went out after her, and saw the prisoner in the foot-path. I asked what she wanted; she said a pair of silk stockings. I said, come in, my dear, I will serve you; just as I said so two pair of stockings fell from her on the footpath. I seized her by the hand, took up the two pair of stockings, and brought her into the shop, and then another pair of stockings fell from her. I called the maid and Mrs. Walker into the shop, and told them what had happened, and desired them to search her; the maid would not, and Mrs. Walker was very poorly, and was not able. I desired her to sit down in the chair, and then she dropped another pair of stockings. When Mr. Walker came in we got a constable, and under the chair where she sat we found two other pair of stockinge.</p>
               <p>Whose property are they? - Mr. Walker's, I believe; there are no marks on them. The prisoner cried, went down on her knees, and begged pardon.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises? - No; nor did I make use of any threats.</p>
               <p>Were any stockings missing? - There was a parcel.</p>

               <p>Describe what he did? - He used me very indecent, dragged me by my arms; he mauled me in the coach and left my flesh all black.</p>
               <p>What sort of rudeness; did he want to take indecent liberties with you? - He did. I had the money when I went into the coach; when I came out I told the people where I lived, that I had been ill used, and robbed of two guineas, 18 s. and my buckles.</p>
               <p>How far was you gone before he did this? - Not above a quarter of a mile; he kept me three hours with him before he took me home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180011"/>He drove you home at last? - Yes; he did not bring me to the house, but brought me to the yard, and sent me home with a woman, a friend of his.</p>
               <p>When you got out of the coach had you your buckles? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Had you your money? - I had not; he insisted on my paying 3 s. for the coach. I am friendless; he sent the buckles by some person, and throwed them into the area.</p>
               <p>Was the money in a purse or loose in your pocket? - The two guineas were rolled up in a piece of paper, between the lining of my stays and the stays, and the silver was loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>When did you first know that you had lost your buckles and money? - In the coach. I told him if he took my buckles my name was on them, and he would suffer for it. I did not know his face.</p>
               <p>Did you miss your money while you was in the coach? - No, not till after I got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Did the coach put up at the place where he set you down? - It belongs to Mary-le-bonne. Woodall got the coach for me.</p>
               <p>What became of the coach when you got out? - It stood there till twelve o'clock; he was drinking with a smith's wife.</p>
               <p>What time did you get home? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>You had been at Mr. Woodall's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was ill in the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the matter, had you drank any thing that did not agree with you? - Indeed I had, with this Woodall and his wife.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I do not know; I believe it was not very good.</p>
               <p>Had it got into your head? - I believe it had.</p>
               <p>You do not know what passed, but you observed him take the buckles? - I observed a person take my buckles, and bid him not rob me.</p>
               <p>A person, did you know who that person was? - There is a witness saw him come into the coach and stay half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was the coachman at the time? - There was nobody else to do it; he drove me into a square and dallied about. I knew him when I came home that it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the house with you? - Three men and their wives. The men were not at hom e; Mrs. Lockwood was.</p>
               <p>Did their husbands come home that night? - Yes, one came home and lay with his wife who had not lain with her sixteen or eighteen years before.</p>
               <p>Is there any watchman in that quarter? - I believe there is.</p>
               <p>When you was robbed, and he stayed so long there with his coach, how came you not to have him taken up? - This Mrs. Lockwood I suppose had not the presence of mind to call a watchman.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - Two days after.</p>
               <p>When were the buckles thrown in the area? - Two days after.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Woodall's in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave Woodall's? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Woodall keeps a publick-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a widow? - About two years.</p>
               <p>How long have you been at service? - I have not been at service yet, my husband could support me without going to service.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Woodall? - I never saw him till I saw him the night before.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him the night before? - I may say I had been led astray out of my way; I asked a gentleman's servant the way, and he took me to this Woodall's house,</p>

               <p>Two glasses of gin? - I am not very sure whether one or two, she had got three guineas in her pocket. My wife perceived she was a little in liquor, and said, young woman, you had better give me your money and sit down in the parlour and have a little sleep. For it was a shame for a woman to go out in the condition she was in. She went and slept about four hours, I believe, till about five o'clock. My wife desired her to go out then as we had company coming into that room. I gave her her money and bid her make the best of her way. She was sick and was to give one shilling for cleaning the room. I gave her in change two guineas and eighteen shillings.</p>

I said no; and I was glad I had substantial witnesses that I gave her her money. Then she said if you have not got it, somebody has robbed me.</p>

I said he seemed very sleepy, he might go if he would and lie down on the bed where he used to lie; that was in a dark closet where the chest with the clothes was kept. After that he came down again and went into the garden; I happened to turn round. He brought in a coat upon his arm, which he had laid down with his hat, when he came in; that coat was gone and missing; that coat and his hat. I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay in this dark room? - I believe it might be about three hours.</p>
               <p>Did he go away? - Yes, without saying any thing. I saw him come out of the garden; I thought he was gone into the fore kitchen. Missing the coat and hat I went to see; he was not there; and when I went up stairs he was gone. I went into the dark room and found the chest open, and there was nothing left in it.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else? - Yes, some tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the chest was locked or open? - It seldom was locked; I had not opened it all the summer.</p>
               <p>Had not other people during the course of the summer been in the house besides the prisoner? - Yes, there was a char-woman at that very time cleaning down the house.</p>
               <p>Of course she had occasion to go up stairs and into all parts of the house? - She had. The woman was not in that place to take any thing.</p>
               <p>How do you know that; was she never out of your sight? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Was this room locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Then when she was out of your sight she might go into this place as well as any where else, how long did she continue in the house? - A long while after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Did she come the next day? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her go away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe her carry any thing away with her? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Did she go out while the prisoner was there? - No, only for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Where is this room? - Up stairs from the kitchen on the ground floor. When he went into the garden he came down and went through the kitchen; when he came in he went up stairs again.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to this woman about missing any thing? - I did not; I did not know what was gone. I said to her, this chest is open, have you been in here? She said she had not.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Adams. How long was you from home? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Your master was from home three weeks or a month? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During that time had not other persons been in the house with you? - Yes; to drink tea with me.</p>
               <p>And went freely about the house? - No, they never did.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 13th of September and left a knife and fork with me; he told me they were his own; I never saw him before that time; he came in between four and five o'clock in the morning; he was playing with a girl in the tap-room, and for fear he should cut himself he gave them me to take care of till he went away, and then he gave me his hat to take care of till he went away; while I went down into the cellar to draw some beer he went into the bar and took the hat and went away. I had put the knife and fork in a drawer, he could not get at them; he left them for the reckoning.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In an orange-coloured coat and waistcoat, and had on a pair of black breeches and a large horseman's coat.</p>

She said here I am my dear; Mrs. Malone and Murphy both asked for some drops, and Mrs. Malone went to get a glass of water, and Mrs. Murphy put her hand in my pocket to feel, as I thought, for a smelling bottle; after I had drank a little water I fainted away. I was not in that situation above three minutes by the account of the company. Mrs. Murphy went into the parlour to call my husband , and did not come in again; the bar was very small; there cannot above three persons stand in it; when I came to myself my husband came to me and asked me to go into the other room, and I did. I was very cold; my husband ordered some hot punch for me to have some before I went home. He said, as he called for the liquor, it was right we should pay for it. I felt in my pocket for my purse and missed it; some of the people went to look in the bar for it but could not find it. I knew Mrs. Murphy's hand had been in my pocket, but I did not think she could do such a thing; I had not the impudence to charge her with it; in about a minute after the bar had been searched she asked for one

             a young man, who was in company with us, and went out. I then went and looked in the bar myself and found the purse dropped in the corner of the bar. I catched it up in hopes the money was in it, but found it empty; when I returned into the room she was in the room offering to lend my husband a shilling to pay for the liquor, telling him not to make any more fuss about it. I went up to her and said Mrs. Murphy you are the woman which took my purse out of my pocket. She looked as red as scarlet, and said, me! Mrs. Lorder, and down she sat; then Mrs. Malone and the other woman began to pull off their things to be searched. Mrs. Murphy untied her apron and pretended to unlace her stays, but she was not searched.</p>
               <p>Did you see her hand when it came out of your pocket? - No. I felt it in my pocket; it could be no-body's but her's; when I felt it it rather roused me; she stood by me; I saw her hand in my pocket.</p>

When the purse was missed the landlord, the landlady, and a young man, and I, went and searched the bar; the prisoner was then gone out; she went out immediately on Mrs. Lorden saying she missed her purse; we looked round the bar, but could see nothing of it; the prisoner came back into the room; I said there was nobody but she and the landlady in the bar, and insisted on having her searched.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after Mrs. Lorden found the purse? - Before.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner searched? - No, by nobody but herself. I insisted upon Mrs. Lorden searching me.

I went with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180017"/> her; she picked up the purse just as she went in on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Had you looked before in the place where she found it? - Yes, I am very clear I had, and that then it was not there.</p>

I went to a publick-house , and saw her drinking; she went with me to her lodgings; she put her hand under her pillow, took out a white rag, and put it in her pocket; when she came to the justice's the justice asked her how much money she had in her pocket; she pulled out the rag, with five guineas in it; she said she knew nothing of the charge; the justice delivered a guinea and 4 s. to me, which was what Mrs. Lorden said she had lost.</p>

On Friday the 22d of September there was a sale of a farmer's stock in my neighbourhood. I went up stairs to see what money I could spare, as I had my rent and other things to pay. I looked over my money. I put my bank notes in a private drawer in my bureau which stood in my bed-chamber. I put forty-seven guineas and six half-guineas in a canvas bag, which I put in the drawer upon the bank-notes. I then told over two guineas worth of silver in shillings and sixpences; there was a half-guinea, and four half-crowns. I put all that into a common drawer which slides in by the side of the private drawer; they were likewise in a bag. I saw that my snuff-box and other things were all safe; that was at nine o'clock in the morning; then I went out among my plowmen and servants. I came home again a little after twelve o'clock, and between twelve and one I went out to Evans's auction. After the auction was over, seeing some farmers there who live at distant villages, I asked them to come home with me and eat and drink something, as we had not dined. We came to my house a little before five o'clock, and sat together in my kitchen till between eight and nine, when they went away. As soon as they were gone I went up to bed;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180018"/> there is a closet by the side of my bed in which I put my clothes and some garden-seeds. I observed that a seed-box was removed out of its place; then I saw a hole through the ceiling in the closet which led up into the cock-loft. I went directly to my bureau; I found it broke open, and I missed all my money, the snuff-box, the spoons, the seal, and the other things. I called up my boy and my men, and we alarmed the town directly. I found the back-door of the barn was open. The way in which the fact had been committed was by getting into the barn, getting upon the barley in it, and so getting into the cock-lost, which communicates with the end of the barn; that cock-lost is over some stables; she must have crept along the cock-loft till she came over my chamber; the hole that was made in my chamber was large enough to admit a person to pass through it from the cock-lost. We searched, but could not find any person about. I rode that night to Hounslow and Slough; I did not get home till three o'clock; I went to bed for a short time; when I got up in the morning I came and laid an information at Sir John Fielding's office; then I went to the Bank and gave an account of the Banknotes I had lost; I could hear nothing of them. On Monday morning I came again to Sir John Fielding's office and to the Bank, but they had heard nothing of them; coming along Piccadily , between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I accidentally met the prisoner along with a man opposite St. James's Church.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - Yes; she had lived with me. I asked her where she had been? She said in the country. I asked her what country? She said Chester. I asked who the man was with her? She said her husband. I said come we will drink together; I wanted to see you, for I have been thinking about you. I asked her where she would go? She said to the Blackmoor's-head , behind St. James's Church; there was a chairman at the door; I put them in first, and begged him to get me a constable; when we went in I desired the landlady to let us have a back-room to ourselves, for we should want some victuals. I called for a pot of beer; the constable did not come; I went to the door to the chairman, he had not been for one; at last I persuaded him to go for one; when I went out the prisoner wanted to go out too; I followed her; I said she should not go out; she began to be very abusive; the chairman then brought in the constable; I gave him charge of the man and the prisoner; he said he would search them. She insisted I should not see her searched. I went out of the room; the constable searched her, and, as I afterwards learnt, he found fifteen guineas and some silver upon her, and likewise my snuff-box; the constable took her to Sir

               <p>Morant. The prisoner was brought to the office on Monday the 25th of September. I searched her very closely; I found this snuffbox in her pocket; after some time she wanted a pinch of snuff and took it and put it into her pocket again. Mr. Marshall stood by; there was nothing said about the snuff-box; she took it away with her; after that the prosecutor relating that he had lost a snuff-box with a quantity of doits and farthings, Mr. Dowse said she had given such to his child, and mentioned the box. I said I had seen her have such a box as that and would go next morning to prison to see if she had it about her then. I went to the prison and took this box from her; the prosecutor described it and the motto upon it before I went.</p>

The prisoner and her husband lodged with me six or seven months in a one-pair-of-stairs front room; there was a chest of mine in the room which was locked, I had the key of it. On the 6th of October I asked her to pay her rent? She cried and said her husband had left her. I said, as she could not pay four-shillings a week she must get a cheaper lodging; she begged I would not take away the few things she had. I said I would not; she must pay me as soon as she could. I went out and returned in about half an hour; then my wife informed me the prisoner had taken away her things and was gone. I took her afterwards at Lambeth-Marsh , and she told me where the things were pawned; she never let me know that her husband was gone till I asked her for the money.</p>

On last Friday night I met with the prisoner at the sign of the Boot, in Newton-street, Holbourn; an acquaintance of mine was going into the country on Friday night; he asked me to walk with him to the White Horse, Piccadilly. I stayed late there; as I came home I went into this publick-house, drank a pint of beer, and asked a man if he could recommend me to a lodging; the prisoner heard me inquire and said she could help me to one. I took out my purse, changed half a guinea at the bar and went out at the back door about seven or eight yards with the prisoner to her house. I paid her for my bed; I went to bed; I put my breeches on the bed; she came in for the candle. I got out of bed and went towards the door after her; she pulled the door too and fastened it on me. I got the door open. I could not find her. I put on my clothes and went home. I went up to the Boot on Saturday, she came in while I was there; I tapped her on the shoulder and said she was the woman I wanted. She asked what did I want with her? I said she need not make herself strange about it; had she got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180025"/> any of the money left or had she spent it all? She said she had no money, and denied ever having it; I saw all the money after I was in the room.</p>

I said he might have part of mine, what would he give me for the lodging? He said two shillings. I went out for a pint of beer; the door was on the latch; when I came back he was gone; he dined with me afterwards on Saturday, and drank with me at night.</p>

On the 8th of October, at a little past seven in the evening, I returned home from Islington; while I stopped at the bottom of the court to make water I perceived a man jump out of the parlour window of my house; immediately after that I perceived another jump out; as he came past me he gave me a wheel round; then I saw a third jump out, which was the prisoner. I catched him by the throat and said, I would hold him if he was the Devil. I seised him by the collar and cried out thieves and murtherers! and I held him till some neighbours came; then my wife, who was behind me, came up and opened the door; there was nobody in the house. I went out about half after one; she came to me about an hour and an half after, and we walked up to Islington; when my wife had opened the door I took him in; when I came into the parlour I saw a table-cloth spread upon the oil-cloth, and the sundry things, mentioned in the indictment, laid upon it; they had been taken out of a drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>When had you seen them in the drawer before? - I suppose three or four days; when I took him in and found these things laid upon on the table-cloth I held him by the throat and asked him if these things were his? He made no answer; the sash was pulled down; there was a pane of glass in the sash broke. I suppose they got the window open by breaking the pane of glass and putting an hand in and opening the fastening to the sash; the pane, which was broken, was immediately under the fastening.</p>
               <p>The other two got away? - Yes. I had not the same presence of mind as I had when I seised this, or they would have stood no better chance than this man.</p>
               <p>Was it dark then? - It was light enough to see him.</p>
               <p>Was it by day-light or the light of the lamps you saw him? - By the day-light.</p>
               <p>You could see him plain enough by the day-light to know him? - Yes.</p>

I was afraid he wanted to take some of the things, and watched him; when he had got the shirt they both went away towards Cloth-fair I went and informed Mrs. Keysell of of it and we went up Cloth-fair and met the prisoner there. I laid hold of him and asked him what he had taken out of the church-yard? He immediately pulled the shirt from under his jacket, and said he found it. I held him till a gentleman came and sent for a constable, and took him to Guildhall. I am sure the prisoner is the man I saw take the shirt.</p>

             told me a man had taken a cask out of my cart and was gone up Hatton-garden. He said a boy gave it him. I said it was mine. I missed the cask, I pursued the prisoner, and took him with it in Charles-street, Hatton-garden. I asked him where he got the cask? He was very willing to deliver it up. I took him to Mr. Hodgkin the constable and he was carried to prison, Hodgkin has had the cask ever since.</p>

When I had let him a lodging, he asked me for a coat he had left with me last Christmas. I told him I could not find it just then. He said I had better find it or he would very quickly be a match for me, I found it the next morning and showed it to his wife, and she was very well satisfied with it. He and his wife went out the same day, which was Sunday; on the Sunday night I saw him walking up and down the court two or three times, he did not offer to come near the house; at eleven o'clock at night I undressed myself and went to bed; I put my clothes at the back of a chair at the foot of my bed. I left my maid sitting in the room with a young child that was very cross; I desired her to put it in the cradle; I was very heavy to sleep, and could not sleep for the child. About an hour after she put the child into bed to me, I locked my door, and put the key under, and went up to bed. I did not miss my clothes till I got up in the morning then I went and asked her if she knew any thing of my clothes? She said, no; she had left the door open while she had gone up stairs, but that she was not gone above five minutes. I cut a piece of the gown which I had left, in about twenty pieces. I went round to all the pawnbokers, near St. Giles's and left the pattern of it. I was sent for afterwards to the office; the prisoner having been stopped in the night with my clothes.</p>

Another man came up, he and I burst the door open, upon which the prosecutor cried out, I am very glad you have burst the door open, for I had like to have been murdered. As he spoke that I saw M'Locklin throw a knife out of her hand, the prosecutor was all of a gore of blood, he had a wound on the side of his cheek.</p>

               <p>I was in my father's (the prosecutor's) shop. The prisoner and another man came up to the show-glasses, between five and six o'clock on the 18th of this month. They stood there a good while; then they went away. I went to the little parlour; when I came back I saw the same two men at the glass again; and I saw the shorter one, which is not the prisoner, have his hand in the glass. I went up to the window (the prisoner saw me) while the other was taking the buckle out of the glass. The prisoner made a kind of an halloo; he ran a little way not quite the length of the window, and then stopped till the other man got the buckle out of the glass. I saw the buckle in his hand. Then they both ran off together. I ran out to the door, and Mr. Scotcher, who is a neighbour, pursued them; the other man ran off; the prisoner was secured. He was searched but nothing found upon him. He said he did not do it. This was between five and six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was it not dusk then? - Not so dark but I could plainly discern their faces.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my door, which is opposite Mr. Salmon's. Miss Salmon advanced towards the window seemingly in great confusion. At that time I observed the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180031"/> and another man standing close to the window; they seemed to stagger. I did not see them do any thing. When Miss Salmon came to the door she turned about, as I supposed to call her father or some of the family. Her father advanced towards the door and I observed the prisoner and the other man to run away very precipitately. I ran after them. The prisoner was the hindermost; I took him, and brought him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He made no resistance. I asked him where his accomplice was? He said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I say I had nobody with me? - No. I asked him where his accomplice was? He said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me where my accomplice was gone? I said I had nobody with me. - His accomplice was within eight doors of me when I laid hold of him, but I had not the presence of mind to call out stop thief!</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180032"/>Had you occasion at any time and when to remit any bills to London? - I had occasion to remit some the 25th of July last for Messrs. Hitchons and Wood, in Chandos-street; I endorsed those that were endorsible; I gave a frank directed to Messrs. Hitchons and Wood, London, to my clerk, and desired him to enclose the bills; there were sixteen of them, the amount of the whole was 181 l. 8 s.</p>
               <p>Look at that bill (the draft for 30 l.) and inform the Court and Jury whether that is one of the bills you gave to your clerk to be so forwarded? - It is; it is drawn by a Mr. Toper, payable to me.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Topper? - Yes, I saw him write this, and it is endorsed on the back by me.</p>
               <p>You said there were fifteen other bills sent by the same mode of conveyance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look over these sixteen bills, and see how many you can identify? - (Inspects them) Here are eleven I am certain to; the other four I believe to be the bills, but I cannot swear to them; they answer the descriptions in our bill-book.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you found those bills had not arrived at your correspondent's in London? - It might be three weeks, or longer, before I received the letter.</p>
               <p>You received no intelligence of it till three weeks or more; was not that an uncommon circumstance that you received no advice of them? - At that time I owed them a considerable sum of money, and I desired my clerk, when he sent those bills, to wr ite a letter to them, and enclose it under cover, desiring them not to give me advice of those bills till they received something further; and that was the reason why I did not expect advice by the regular course of the post.</p>

               <p>Did you afterwards let to him a parlour? - Yes, last Michaelmas was a twelve-month.</p>
               <p>Where was the parlour? - On the right hand going in.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 1, Jerusalem-court, Clerkenwell. The prisoner lived in the same house.</p>
               <p>What apartments did he occupy in that house? - A parlour on the right-hand side and a cellar below.</p>

               <p>I understand there are two cellars in the house? - Yes, there are.</p>
               <p>Which did he occupy? - It is on the left-hand side as you go into the house, it is under the left-hand apartment.</p>
               <p>Who occupied the other cellar? - I did.</p>
               <p>There were but these two cellars in the house? - No, only those two.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether the other cellar you did not occupy was kept locked or not? - There was a lock on it, I cannot tell whether it was locked , I never had the curiosity to try; sometimes I have seen it open.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>There are several lodgers in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say the cellar is on the left-hand side, and that sometimes it is open, and sometimes locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then any body might have access to it at any time? - Yes. Our door is generally open from morning to night, and when it is not open, there is a string to it for any body to let themselves in, and so they might have a communication with the cellar.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 1, Jerusalem-court; I found a key in a coat pocket which Mrs. Bishop said belonged to Mr. Bishop. She said it was the key of the cellar. She struck a light and went down with us into the cellar. The door had a padlock on it. I unlocked it with that key; she went into the cellar with a candle in her hand. Carpmeal took the candle from her; he found a box, which he broke open. He found a packet, containing a seal and two impressions in it , and a letter.</p>
               <p>Among other things did you find any bills of Exchange? - Several.</p>
               <p>Did you mark them at the time you found them? - I kept them in my custody till I arrived at the office , in Bow-street. Mr. Bond sealed them up directly before Justice Addington. They were sealed with my seal, and Mr. Hull's, and Mr. Addington's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you see it afterwards opened? - Yes, a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>When you saw it opened did you find that your seal had not been broken before? - I did. I then marked them.</p>
               <p>Are those the same you thus found? - Yes, they are; I marked them with my name; they are all the same.</p>
               <p>Are these the bills you found in the box? - They were not found in the box, they were found between two boards which hung up with a rope at each end; it was a large board at the bottom and a small one at the top, and between those two boards these notes were found rolled up in a piece of blue paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hull was above stairs waiting for you in the parlour? - He was. I went up and shewed them to him.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, which together with the endorsement , was exactly as set forth in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Hull. When they came up to you in the parlour they brought these bills? - They did. I looked them over and delivered them again to the constable; he produced them at Bow-street that night. Mr. Addington did not care to let me nor Mr. Todd have the bills; he said he thought it proper they should be sealed up, and delivered to some banker. There was no banker's open then, therefore it was that they were sealed with M'Manus's , Mr. Todd's, and Mr. Addington's seals; I put Mr. Todd's seal to it. The next morning they were shewn to Mr. Addington; he saw they had not been opened. The next morning Mr. Wright said he saw no objection to my having the bills; they were delivered to me and I marked them immediately (inspects them). These are the sixteen bills I marked.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What induced you to make enquiry concerning this cellar? - Finding the key in the coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Who told you that key was the key of the cellar? - Mrs. Bishop.</p>
               <p>She pointed out the cellar to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And lighted a candle to light you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you had found these bills was there no intermediate time, in which you quitted the possession of the bills before they were sealed up? - I never quitted the possession of them. Mr. Hull looked them over in the parlour before my face.</p>

There was a person at the door, to whom he gave the butter. I did not take notice of the other person. As soon as they were gone I told Mr. Combes of it, and he went after them. I do not know whether or no he overtook them.</p>
               <p>From Allen. What time was it? - About a quarter before eight.</p>
               <p>Did you know Allen before? - Only by seeing him go by our shop; I am sure he is the person; there was a light in the shop, I saw him very plain.</p>

I went, and saw the prisoner there. He had stopped a watch. I took the prisoner to the office. She said her brother gave it her. I found a letter in her pocket with a direction on it to her brother. I said I would go and fetch her brother. She then cried, and desired to speak to the Justice, and said she had it not from her brother, but out of Mr. Stuart's shop. I went to Mr. Stuart, the watch was produced to him, and he swore positively it was his.</p>

She said they were very coarse, and desired to see some kenting ones. I took a bundle out of the counter, and shewed her some. I had two more customers at that time in the shop; I did not mistrust her. She asked me the price of the handkerchiefs; I told her three shillings. She said she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180037"/> give me two shillings and fourpence. I refused the two shillings and fourpence. As she t urned the corner of the door-way to go out, I saw the handkerchiefs behind her, under her arm. I called to my son to run after her.

               <p>I hung the clothes up about nine in the morning. I saw them about half after three, or a quarter before four. I missed them about half after five. I locked the door myself between three and four o'clock. I found the door wrenched open. I went up into the prisoner's room immediately, and found her drinking tea; there was another woman in the room, and her daughter a little girl; we found two of the sheets which I had hung up in the yard, in the morning, and my petticoat, in her room; when my mother found the sheets she said , these are my sheets; she jumped up and said, before God she was mistaken , that she had been washing and they were her own; when the petticoat was found, she said she did not know how it came there.</p>

She locked the door and locked me in, and locked Hartman out.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in the room? - No; then she threw a coat over my face; she laid hold of my throat with one hand, and put the other hand in my pocket. I had at that time in my pocket half a guinea, 15 s. in silver, and a crown-piece. I put my hand down to my pocket to prevent her taking it out. I found she had left in my pocket the half-guinea and two shillings, and had taken out the crown-piece. She then shoved me out at the door of the room. I found Hartman at the door upon the staircase. I saw Barnsley give the other prisoner the thirteen shillings as soon as she opened the door. I cried murder; then Barnsley pushed me, and knocked me down; the other girl Hartman did not beat me, she only took the money of Barnsley. A neighbour came up, hearing the cry of murder; then Hartman said, Good man do not make a noise, I will find some of the money, and she gave me a crown-piece, a half crown. and a shilling.</p>

               <p>Mr. Brockholes came to me and said murder was cried out at No. 11, in Fleet-lane. I went there directly. I went up stairs, and saw the prisoners , a young man, and the jew; I asked them for what reason they cried murder; the jew said he had been robbed; I asked him what he had lost; he said he had lost half a guinea, a crown-piece, and some silver; he said they had given him again the crown-piece, an half-crown, and a shilling, and that there were nine shilling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180039"/> and sixpence missing. I locked the door and searched both the prisoners. I found a few halfpence in Barnsley's pocket; the other had some apples in her pocket. I did not find any money upon them. I searched the young man, and found nothing in his pocket but a knife.</p>
               <p>Why was not the young man taken up? - The prosecutor only charged the two women. I asked him if he would have the young man taken up; he said no; he came up into the room upon my cry of murder. Barnsley threatened to cut his bloody liver out; she said she would if I had not been there.</p>

            . About the beginning of September I was recommended to Mr. Richmond, the husband (or the person who passes for such) of the prisoner, to take part or all of my house. I agreed to let them the house; he referred me to several wholesale shops which I did not apply to; he was to take the things at a fair appraisement. I agreed to let them the whole house, and that I would take an apartment in it of them; he and the prisoner had lodged in the house about eight days. On the day that the agreement was up, when my broker came to appraise my things , my house was robbed. He had been recommended to us as a man in distress, ill-used by a gentleman, who had arrested him, but that he had an estate in the Isle of Wight , worth six hundred pounds, left him by his wife's father. He had said that, in the presence of the prisoner, different times. He said he had received some money from that, and from Mr. King in Holbourn, who keeps a coffee-house there; that he said he should be able to pay for the fixtures on the Monday. On the Thursday, the 14th of September, I waited for the brokers coming to appraise the things. My broker, Mr. Swain, in Moorfields, came; his broker was to come by appointment, but he did not come; I waited at home till twelve o'clock, then I went out, and returned between seven and eight o'clock; then I was told by Mr. Richmond that Mrs. Richmond was taken in labour, and was obliged to go to a house where she was to lie-in. Mr. Richmond slept there that night. The next morning I went out about eight o'clock, and came home about twelve. I dined betweed one and two. When I went after dinner up stairs, I found my room door and chest of drawers broke open. I lost a ten pound bank-note and twelve guineas and an half in gold. Then I missed a bed-gown I had worn, and which lay on the foot of the bed, and two pieces of cloth, out of the dining-room window, which had been lying there some time. I missed a number of things, but nothing that I could exactly tell when I had last seen them, as my maid servant went away on the Sunday before. I had seen the pieces of cloth and bed-gown about eleven or twelve o'clock on the Thursday, before I went out. It was on the Friday I missed it. The bed-gown was in the room which was broke open; that room was broke open on the Friday, but I did not see the bed-gown after the Thursday. I never saw the husband after the Thursday night.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner coming down the stairs of the house of Mr. Whitmore, No. 6, Lombard-street, with a bundle under her arm,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180040"/> containing two pieces of woollen cloth; the colour of one was blue, the other russet , what they call home-spun. She went past me and went down stairs; I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you lodge in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was her husband at home at that time? - He was not; I never saw him during the time of my being in that house, nor was he in when I went up stairs. He came in again in the evening about six, but I do not know when he went out. I asked the children if he was at home, when I went in: They said he was gone out. Mrs. Whitmore enquired after these things when she missed them. Next day I told her I had met Mrs. Richmond with a bundle under her arm, containing two pieces of cloth , which had been lying in the dining room. I went in search of Mrs. Richmond; I found her in Jerusalem-court, Clerkenwell. That was the Monday following. I advised Mrs. Whitmore to take a constable; I found the prisoner was there. Mrs. Whitmore and the constable went up and found there two pieces of cloth, which I saw the prisoner take out of the house. The prisoner was not there at that time. She was taken up before the cloth was found. We could not find it till we came back, then the sister owned where it was. The prisoner was found in the same room the cloth was found in. She said if any thing was done amiss her husband must answer for it.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced two pieces of cloth and a bed-gown, which he found in the same room in which he took the prisoner, which were deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>My husband was a prisoner almost seven months in the Poultry Compter. This Mr. Middleton came in a prisoner; my husband told him his father-in-law in the Isle of Wight was dead and had left him some money. This Mr. Middleton and Mr. Whitmore took him out of prison to go into partnership in the shop; I was often obliged to pledge things to get money to pay Mr. Middleton for getting my husband out of prison. Mr. Middleton took my husband home to Mrs. Whitmore's house. She sent word by Mr. Middleton, that we should sleep in her house till I was brought to bed. I was taken up the 17th, and brought to bed upon the 25th.</p>

               <p>Who was along with Morris? - There was nobody with him. She ran up to him and spoke to him. I stood there. Then Morris came down to me and asked what did I stand there for? I said I waited for the woman. He took my handkerchief out of my hand, which was a silk one.</p>

               <p>And you must tell me what he did to you? - I told him he threw me down; he would not let me get up, not when I halloo'd out so.</p>
               <p>Was that all he did only to refuse to let you get up again? - He would not let me get up.</p>
               <p>I dare say your mother has told you you must tell the jury all that passed between you and him, you say he threw you down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Go on to describe what he did to you after that? - He vowed he would have his ends of me. I told him he should not, and I cried and halloo'd.</p>

               <p>What was it he did to you? - He pushed me down in the fields against my consent.</p>

               <p>Was it what you call the first time, the second, or the last time that he hurt you? - He hurt me all the times.</p>
               <p>What was the difference between the first time and the third time when you say he had his ends of you? - He did not hurt me so much the last time.</p>
               <p>Why do you suppose that he had his ends of you the last time rather than any other time? - Because he swore he would.</p>
               <p>You said he swore he would at first, what makes you suppose that he had his ends of you then more than the first time? - Because I was examined as soon as I went home by a midwife.</p>
               <p>But that would not inform any person when he had his ends of you; tell me every thing that passed, just in the manner in which it passed; you said he threw you down, what was the next thing he did? how were your clothes when you fell? - Wet.</p>
               <p>Was any thing done to your clothes? - I was very wet.</p>
               <p>Were your petticoats up or down when you fell down? - He pushed me down and pulled them up.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did after he pulled up your petticoats? - He began pulling me about. I struggled, and halloo'd out murther!</p>
               <p>You was upon the ground, where was he? - He was upon me.</p>
               <p>You say he hurt you in your private parts, what was it he hurt you with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>You say your clothes were wet, when was that? - The first time.</p>
               <p>Did you fall down in a dirty place, or upon grass, or where? - Upon grass.</p>
               <p>What part of your clothes were wet? - The hind part of my shift and petticoat.</p>
               <p>How long was he lying upon the ground with you in this manner? - Not a quarter of an hour in all. I halloo'd and cried, and they halloo'd at one another.</p>
               <p>You say he used you ill during this time three different times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say he had his ends of you the last time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe that makes you suppose he had his ends of you the last time rather than the first time? - I did not know till I was searched by the midwife when I came home.</p>

               <p>But she could not tell whether it was the first or last time; why do you say it was the last time? - He hurt me all the three times.</p>
               <p>In a quarter of an hour he halloo'd, and they came back? - I was crying.

             lay with me at my lodgings at that time; she did not come home all night; so I thought she must have got my daughter somehow away, because I had heard she had taken her to the camp, when I was out, the day before. I directly set out for the camp; when I came to the little gate, which faces Whitehall, I asked the sentries if they had seen a woman and a girl go through that way. They said they saw a woman, about twenty-six years old, and a girl about fourteen, just pass by. I asked where they thought I should find them. They said if I went to the next sentry, he would tell me. I went there. He said, a woman about twenty-six years old, and a girl about fourteen, had just walked along, and he thought they were gone into the farther tent. As I turned my eye, I saw my girl stand at the corner of the tent; I went up to her; she met me, and ran out of the camp; for I was in a great passion.</p>

When I had her home she cried very much. She told me how she had been used, as soon as I came out of the Park into a convenient place. When I got her home I asked her the particulars; she said she would not make it publick before company, but if I would take her by myself she would tell me the rights of it; I took her to her own lodgings and examined her, and I found things not right; I saw she had been plainly ruined.</p>

               <p>What did you do then? - I did not know what to do; I was like a woman out of her senses; I came home and advised with my friends; they advised me to get a warrant and take the man up; I got a warrant on the 21st day of the month, which was the Friday, and on the Monday it was served upon him.</p>
               <p>When she fixed upon him did you go and speak to him? - Yes; he asked me to go and drink with him; I told him I did not choose to drink with such wretches; I had no notion of soldiers at all; he had the impudence to call me mother; he said, mother, don't be angry.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I asked the child if that was the man who had injured her; she said it was.</p>
               <p>How near was Morris to you at that time? - Close to me; he talked all the impudence he could to her.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I told him he should have no more than the law allowed.</p>
               <p>Was any other person with him at that time? - There were a great many soldiers in the camp.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to any of them? - I talked to nobody but him, and said but a word or two to him.</p>

               <p>Why did not you apply to some of the officers, and have him taken up immediately? - I did not know which way to set about it.</p>
               <p>Was this all that passed between you and him that day? - Yes; I took him up by a warrant the next Monday.</p>
               <p>How did you find out his name? - I enquired of the soldiers in St. Paul's Church-yard if they knew one Morris; I had got his surname, but not his christian name.</p>
               <p>How came yo u to know his surname? - My daughter mentioned his surname.</p>
               <p>Where had the girl lived, from the time you came out of Oxfordshire , till she came up to London? - I left her at school.</p>
               <p>Who had the care of her? - Her mistress; she boarded at her grandmother's.</p>
               <p>Did you send for her up? - No, I did not know of her coming up till I saw her.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of her coming? - She wanted to see me.</p>
               <p>Did she come up of her own head? - Yes, she did entirely.</p>
               <p>How did she know where to find you? - I had sent letters to my mother almost every week; she got intelligence by the letters.</p>
               <p>Was there no particular occasion for her leaving the country? - None at all.</p>
               <p>It is a bold thing, I think, for so young a girl, as you describe your daughter to be,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180048"/> to come to London to find you? - She could herself read and write; she read my letters, and therefore knew where to find me.</p>
               <p>When she was in her place, did she use to come out now-and-then to see you? - Her mistress gave her leave to come and see me every Sunday.</p>
               <p>Then she knew something of London streets? - She knew the way from Tower-hill to Watling-street; I do not know that she knew any farther. The man injured the girl very much; she was sent to the hospital, and came out incurable; but Surgeon

               <p>When did you first see this girl? - All I know of the matter is, that about two months ago the mother came to my house, said her daughter was very ill, and begged my advice; she brought her to me; I found she was very much injured with the venereal disease; I cured her. She came as a pauper to my house; I looked at her.</p>

I said I will go along with you, if it is agreeable. Martha Linett said it would be very agreeable, if I would go with her. I went along with them, and asked them if they would drink. They said they would; and they drank with me at the booths in the camp. By that time it was near eight o'clock at night. I told them I must be absent from their company, for I must go to the roll-call at eight; I went. They said they would stop for me till I had done at the roll-call. I said that might detain me half an hour.

             said she did not care, she would stop for me; and she did stop till I was dismissed from the roll-call. It was then about half after eight. We went to the same booth we had been at before, and had a pot of beer; then we walked about the camp till about half after nine. I said I could not stay longer, I must go to my tent; for we might be roll-called again. She begged I would stay a little longer. I told them, if I staid longer I must miss my roll-call, and be out all night. Then she directly begged me to stay all night. I said I would. She said, could we go to no other place but the camp. In the discourse this man came up and asked me how I did, and this gentlewoman and we all fell into discourse together. These two women said it would be better for us to go out of the camp; we went out; it was then a little after ten o'clock, I believe; Buckingham gates were shut up; we took a walk to Pimlico; we went, I think it was to the Queen's Head, and had two pots of beer and some bread and cheese; it being late they were going to shut up; they begged we would leave the house; I paid the reckoning. Then we went to Chelsea Five-Fields; we sat down in the fields, I suppose an hour, together; then we came down to the publick-house again; I had left my black stock behind me; the people were gone to bed; we took a walk round the King's Road; then we took a walk across<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180049"/> the fields, where the patroles were patrolling; there we sat down for, I suppose, half an hour. I asked her the question, if I should have to do with her. She said no, I should not; she would not be hurt by any man. I said, rather than hurt her, I would not meddle nor make with her. We walked about till near one in the morning; then we all four left the fields, and went across the road into the other fields; five or six gentlemen came down from Chelsea; the girls seemed afraid of them, and made great noises. Mills said, You have no occasion to be afraid, no person shall hurt you. The gentlemen seeing us soldiers said, they are comrades; one gave us sixpence, and another threepence. They asked me if I would let them kiss my wife. I said, You shall not hurt any person with me; I was lying down upon the ground, and they all three stood up; Mills said, Do not injure or hurt the girls. They said they would scorn it; they went away, and wished us a good night. As soon as they were gone from us we went down the road to the Wheat-sheaf at Pimlico; there we had three pots of beer; the patroles drank with us and the watchmen; we told them we were going to the camp; we parted with the two women, and told them to go home. They said they would not go home, but would walk about till such time as they should not be taken notice of to come into the camp again. They came in after us, about eight o'clock in the morning; the girl staid in the tent with me till her mother fetched her away, which I believe was about eleven or twelve o'clock. The mother fetched this gentlewoman and

The girl and mother went away from me. The mother and another woman came the next day and made a great noise in the camp, and said they would take me up with a warrant. She said she would hang me for ruining her daughter. On the next Monday following she took me up with a warrant; I was taken to Bow-street office; Justice Addington examined me; the girl swore to me; I was committed for further examination to Tothill-fields prison; she was ordered to appear against me on the Wednesday; she did not appear against me, but the mother came; then the mother and she were ordered to appear against me again on the Friday. On the Thursday the mother and daughter came up to the prison to me, and asked me what I thought of myself. I said I was innocent of the thing that was charged to me. They asked me if I knew any thing of Mrs. Lock. I said I knew nothing of her at all. She said if I could find out where she was, nothing should come to me. I said I knew nothing of her, nor where to find her; upon which she asked me who was to pay the expences she had been at, if she did not appear against me. I asked what the expences were. She made the warrant, and serving and all, to amount to three shillings. I said I would give her three shillings, and seven more, which made it ten, to make the whole affair up with her. She said she would ask an acquaintance of her's about it, and I should give it to the person she lodged with; and if her friends approved of it, she would take it, and not appear against me. The next day she took the money, and did not appear against me; whereupon I was discharged at Bow-street office. Then she came down to the camp to me, and asked me several questions if I knew any thing of this Mrs. Lock. I said I did not. She told me, if I could not find Mrs. Lock she would take me up again; then she left me; that was about the 24th or 25th of July; I was taken up again a month after. I have a dozen witnesses who heard the girl say that what was done she was as willing as me; the mother and daughter were both together then.</p>

               <p>To S. Linett. What do you say to that? - I did not take any money. He had got a a woman with him; he drawed this girl out of the lodgings; the woman would not let my daughter be at rest one minute in a day, but she desired her to come down to prison to him, and that he would make her his lawful wife, and use her as a father and a husband. I told the woman who came after her , that she should not go to the prison. That woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180050"/> pretended to be Morris's sister. She cried, wrung her hands, and asked her to go down with her. I told her she could have no regard for such a man.</p>
               <p>Did this woman get the girl to go to him? - Yes, she drawed her there twice.</p>
               <p>How came you not to appear the day he was discharged? - The serjeants and his acquaintances who were there persuaded the girl not to appear, and kept her back, and persuaded her that as soon as he was discharged she should have a husband; and she, a silly girl, minded them more than me They kept her back, and this woman, who pretended to be his sister, proves now to be his lawful wife.</p>
               <p>So he was discharged because you and your daughter did not appear? - He sent for me to the prison. I beat the girl in the street. I told her she should not go down to the prison, but the woman desired her to go, and said he was a-bed, and like to die, and she should lose her brother if she did not go; and she told her she would buy a ring and she should be married in Houndsditch, and they would make a gentlewoman of her at once.</p>
               <p>I asked you a short question, was he discharged because you and your daughter did not appear? - For want of appearance.</p>
               <p>How came you not to appear? - They told me I could be of no service without my girl, and the expence would be so much it would ruin me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the reason why you preferred your indictment at last was, because you found that other woman was his wife? - No; the reason I did it was, the child did not prove to be so much injured then as she did after; when it came to be proved she had the foul disease, I chose to see her righted. I went to Mr. Addington and Mr. Wright, they told me to indict them all three, and see them punished. Morris sent for me down to Bridewell to him; he drawed writings and gave her. When I found he was a married man, I threw the writings away. I searched and would not let my girl be married to a man who was married before. He sent for me into Bridewell. He said, mother, as I am going to have your daughter, I know you have been at great expence, will you take this money? I said no, I did not do it for benefit. He said will you let Patty have it? I said no, I do not do it for lucre of money, but to see my child righted. I said I would not take it. A young woman sat by me she said shall I take it? I said you may do as you please, but I will not take it. The other young woman had the ten shillings.</p>
               <p>What was done with that ten shillings? - Four of it was spent amongst them; the other six I received for my loss of time.</p>

We drank a little beer, and I not being much used to drink, it got into my head; my partner came to the end of Broughton-street into Bond-street with me, there I met with the prisoner and another woman; they seeing me a little in liquor asked me, would I treat them with any thing? My partner left me, and they took me away to a cellar, a publick-house, the corner of Clifford-street; we drank one pot of beer; I had only the price of that pot, and twopence more; I paid for that pot, and was coming away, but the prisoner said she would be three half-pence to my twopence for another pot. They came along with me up the steps into the street; I was going towards home; they stood right before me, to stop me from going away; the other woman stood before the prisoner; she kept talking to me. I missed my watch out of my pocket. The prisoner made her escape directly. I took hold of the other woman who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180051"/> was with her; we struggled all along <placeName id="t17801018-41-crimeloc215">Bond-street</placeName>

She pulled out this watch and shewed it the man who waters the horses; she asked him to buy it. He said he had no money to buy it, may be I might buy it, pointing to me. She shewed it me, and asked me to buy it. I asked her how she came by it? She said she found it in the kennel. I said if she found it in a kennel it would have been dirty. The watch was going at the time. She said it was dirty, but she had washed it under a pump; I stopped her and the watch.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of August I was in a publick-house, the Magpye, Holbourn-bridge, where I drank rather more than common. When I came out of the house, which was at about twelve o'clock at night, the wind took my head; I leaned my head against the pales where Mr. Langdale's house stood; the prisoner and another woman came up to me, and said they would see me home; they went with me past my house; I said we were past my house; they said, no , it was a little farther; they would see me safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180052"/>Then you went past your own house without percieving it? - When they got me a little farther they took me into a house. I cried out immediately, This is not my house, I will not stay here. There was a candle burning; I made an attempt to come out; upon which the prisoner struck me on the stomach, and knocked me down; then she ran her hand into my left-hand breeches pocket, and took out five guineas and two half-guineas; the other woman began to strip me. I thought they were going to pull my clothes off and murder me. I got up directly; then Catherine Romsey put the money into her mouth. I heard the watchman going past, and I called him; he came. I told him I had been robbed; there were then three women in the house; the one was a servant; she was in the house when I went in; she was discharged before the justice. I desired the watchman to get the constable of the night, and I would endeavour to secure them till he came. When he was gone,

             said, D - mn your blood! I will run a knife into you, if you do not let me go. I had the candle in my hand; she snatched it away, put it out, and attempted to run away; but I held them both fast by their gowns till the watchman came back. When he was in the passage the other woman ran away. They took the prisoner, and the servant who was in the house, to the watch-house; the constable searched the prisoner, but found nothing upon her but some silver and a knife. When she was before the justice she said she hoped my eyes would be scratched out of my head.</p>
               <p>Did she deny the charge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner ever out of your sight, after you lost the money, till she was taken to the watch-house? - No.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had this money in your pocket? - I know I had it that afternoon I was burnt out by the fire; I took a walk in the afternoon, met with a friend, and went into the Magpye to drink.</p>
               <p>When did you feel it in your pocket? - About an hour before; I took it out to pay my reckoning; I put it into my left-hand pocket, and buttoned it up.</p>
               <p>When you was so much in liquor, as not to know your own house, how could you know the persons that went with you? - When I came into the house and saw a light, that frightened me so that my senses returned to me.</p>

               <p>I am deputy to Mr. Marshall, at the Bill of Middlesex-office, Clifford's-Inn. On the 4th of April last, Collins, and Roberts came together, late in the evening, after office hours, in Hillary vacation, to make an affidavit, and have a bill of Middlesex signed on that affidavit; I administered the oath to Collins; the affidavit was reduced to writing; this is it (producing it) I asked him if it was his hand-writing? He said it was. I asked if the contents were true? He said they were. Roberts appeared to me to be the attorney, but I did not ask him whether he was an attorney or not.</p>
               <p>Did he sign any thing? - I did not see either of them sign any thing, I signed my name after it was sworn.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt these are the two men? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>(The affidavit read.)</p>

               <p>Roberts appeared as an attorney, did he say or do any thing? - Yes; I told him he must pay expedition money because it was after office hours. Roberts hesitated, and said Jones was a poor man and could not well afford it.</p>
               <p>Did he call him by the name of Jones? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Roberts paid it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Do not you remember exceeding well it was all the money he had in his pocket; that he paid the shilling out of his pocket; and you remarked it was a large sum of money to be owed to him? - I did. I remarked it was a large sum of money to be owed to such a man as that. He said it was a large sum, but that the defendant was able to pay it. I said it was a pity he was not willing. Collins said he would make him willing.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Who paid the shilling he or me? - To the best of my knowledge you paid it; it was to you I directed my discourse.</p>
               <p>Roberts. It was a publick business, I do not know that I did not pay it? - Whether Jones gave it to him, I do not know; I was within the desk; they were behind the rails.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am bag-bearer and porter to the sheriff's office. Roberts, the attorney, as he pretended to be, knocked at the door with his knuckles a little before seven o'clock in the evening. The office is shut at six. When I opened the door he said, Mr. Thomas, cannot I have a warrant this evening? I told him no, he could not after the office was shut, without paying extra for it. He said he would pay any thing extra because the man he was going to arrest was going off, and he should lose the debt. He asked me then what the warrant would come to? I said half-a-crown if it was a common bill of Middlesex. He said it was. He said he would go to the Apple-tree ale-house , in Cursitor-street; that his clients were there, and would let them know and get the money, for he had not the money with him. I told him he must make haste because we had but one gentleman in the office who signed warrants, and he would be gone. He came back directly with the half-crown in his hand to have the warrant made out. I let him into the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see him get the warrant? - I carried it to the Apple-tree to him. Mr. Cater signed the warrant at that time; he gave him the writ and paid the money and went away, and desired me to carry it to the Apple-tree ale-house to him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burchell. Who has the writ? - It has been in my custody ever since; we file them regularly in the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas. Mr. Cater filled up the warrant, and when he came to look on the back of the bill for the indorsement, there was no sum nor date, there was only T. Parry, I think on the back of it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burchell. T. Parry is endorsed on the back where the attorney's name is usually endorsed? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas. Mr. Cater looked at the two shillings and sixpence, one of the shillings was bad. He said there is no endorsement on the back, take the half-crown back to the gentleman at the Apple-tree, and the gentleman must go without it, I cannot stay any longer. I took it back with the half-crown, and said Mr. Cater could not stay any longer, he could not have it done. He said, for God's sake let me have it done, for we shall lose the debt, you shall have a good shilling in a minute. He told Shears he must give him a good shilling for the bad one.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180054"/> Shears gave it him, and then he gave me the two shillings and sixpence. He called for a pen and ink to write the endorsement. Roberts was very drunk when he wrote that endorsement on the back. I saw him write it, and then we came back together for the warrant.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor when he first came to you? - Very much both times. Mr. Cater asked him what officer he was to have it made to; he said Armstrong. He was told Armstrong was gone to Ireland. He said he had an order from his clients not to put Clipson's name to it, but he might put it; it would do. He told me then as soon as he had got the warrant I should go down to the Apple-tree to produce the warrant, and tell them he had paid the half-crown, else they would think he had sunk it. When I got the warrant I went down to the Apple-tree ale-house , Roberts was sitting at the door waiting for me; he desired me to come in and said I will shew you the person you are to give the warrant to, he is one of my clients. When I went in, he pointed to Shears, and said, there give it to him. I could not see his face then for his hat was flapped over his eyes, and Collins's hat was the same; they were both sitting down by the fire; it was rather dark. I gave it to Shears. The boy brought a candle in for them to look at it. He desired the boy to take the candle away for they did not want any candle at all. When Shears looked up and told the boy to take the candle away, I saw his face and knew him; he had been at the office before to offer himself for an officer. He took the warrant and stooped down by the fire side and read it by the light of the fire to Jones; then he said well, now you think this will do, this is all right.</p>
               <p>What name did he call the tall man by when he mentioned him? - He did not mention any name, but said it will do. Jones made answer, "I don't know, you know best, if you think it is right; I suppose it is all right; I shall leave it to you."</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of these men before? - Yes, Shears came to offer himself as an officer; I had seen Roberts before.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt whether any or all of these men were at the Apple-tree? - They were all there.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt as to the person of either of them? - No, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Shears. At what time was the warrant made out? - I carried it to the Apple-tree a little before seven o'clock on the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Was it not day-light then? - Not where they sat, they sat by the fire.</p>
               <p>Jones. Do you think I was in liquor when you saw me at the Apple-tree? - I do not know; he hung down his head more than either of the other men.</p>
               <p>Jones. Do you know whether I was asleep or awake at the time? - I know you was awake, I saw your eyes open.</p>

               <p>Roberts. Whether I was not very anxious to have Armstrong's name to it? - Armstrong was the person whose name was pitched upon to be put to the warrant.</p>

               <p>Did you know him by the name of Jones? - No. When Shears was an officer in the Marshalsea-court I knew Collins then. The warrant was brought to me by one Young, in the morning early; I hesitated a little before I went. I never saw any of the prisoners about this business.</p>
               <p>Shears. He never saw me write in his life?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180055"/> - I have seen him write I suppose an hundred times, and a hundred to that.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Was you indebted to that plaintiff, or to any person of the name of Jones, in the sum of eleven hundred pounds? - Not to any one of that name, not a shilling; I do not know any person of that name, but one in Oxford-road, and he is indebted to me; to him I am not indebted, nor ever was. I saw Roberts three or four days after at Hicks's-hall, acting as an attorney, he was taken up by Clipson on my application and carried before a magistrate. He said before the magistrate he was an attorney, and had done what was right, and to shew his innocence he would produce the plaintiff, or to that effect. He said his name was Roberts, and that he officiated for some person of the name of Parry, who was a gentleman in the town of Danby , sollicitor for the government there. I understood that he was his clerk, and Parry had given him authority to use his name.</p>
               <p>He admitted that he put the name T. Parry on the writ? - He did. In consequence of his information Jones was taken into custody. The constables went after him and brought him to the tavern where we waited. Upon my seeing Jones or Collins, I asked him if he knew me? He said no, but he supposed I might be the defendant. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, and exclaimed in the most poignant manner against Shears, who he said had taken him in.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not relate any thing he said relative to Shears or Roberts , except they were present? - Roberts was present I believe; but I am certain. Previous to my having seen Roberts and

                  Collins

             I should have mentioned that I saw Shears; I took Mr. Berry, the attorney along with me to Cock-lane, where it was said Shears, the timber-merchant, lived, and I found him at home.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The day of the arrest.</p>
               <p>How did you get discharged from the arrest? - I put in bail immediately. I was not taken out of the counting-house.</p>
               <p>What passed between Shears and you? - I must rather relate a conversation between another person and him in my presence: the attorney, Mr. Berry, of Meard's-street, Soho, asked him if he had not given a writ , or which way he came by the writ that was given to Clipson? To which he replied, that writ was left at his house by a stranger.</p>
               <p>He asked him how he came by the writ against you? - Yes. Shears said, what is there any thing amiss? Mr. Berry gave him to understand there was, and asked him how he came to get possession of the writ? He said that having been an officer in the Marshalsea-court , it was not generally known, but he was one yet. Mr. Berry gave him to understand that if he could find the party out and give him notice about it that he should be rewarded for it. He promised he would, and that he would see the man that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not relate what he said after that promise of reward.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect what Collins said to you? - I have it under his hand, and in several ways acknowledging his guilt. When they were before Justice Addington or Justice Wright, Roberts said he wished to be understood not to have any knowledge of Collins, but only by the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180056"/> of Jones. Collins insisted upon it, that he knew him very well, and gave me this paper (producing it) to shew me what a rascal Roberts was; it is a paper of Robert's handwriting, to shew that he knew that his name was Collins.</p>
               <p>Do you know it to be his hand-writing? - I believe so; there is a person who will prove it.</p>
               <p>When it was shewn to Roberts, did Roberts acknowledge it to be his hand-writing? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did you ever shew it me at all? - No; from the first moment he was apprehended, he said he was made the tool of Roberts and Shears; that they knew what he was about, but he did not know himself.</p>
               <p>Did he say that in their presence? - In the presence of Roberts.</p>
               <p>What did Roberts say to that? - I do not recollect; I know nothing more but apprehending of Collins at Guildsord , after he was discharged on account of not being indicted.</p>

               <p>Where did Roberts live? - No. 19, Seacoal-lane; he was found there when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>There is no date to this paper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robson. He gave it to me on the 7th of April.</p>
               <p>Roberts to Mr. Robson. I believe the first time you saw me was at Hicks's Hall, on the 7th of April? - Yes; I do not know that I ever saw you in my life before.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Whether he saw any temerity or fear in me, such as guilt would produce? - I think I did.</p>
               <p>How came Jones to be called Collins? who mentioned the name first? - Upon applying to the Middlesex Office, I had a description of Jones and Roberts; I went to the Prothonotary's Office , to enquire if they knew any such person as had been described to me. One of the Marshalsea officers said,</p>
               <p>"Good God! that must be Collins and red-faced Roberts." On requesting of the Prothonotary to know if Collins had made any affidavits in their office, he said he had. I begged to see the affidavits. He took down the file and shewed me, and on comparing the hand-writing -</p>
               <p>Court. You must not mention that.</p>
               <p>Roberts. When I was taken to Litchfield-street, Clipson was treated indignantly there, and kicked out of the office; they would not take his oath.</p>
               <p>Court. If you mean to impeach the character of Clipson as a witness, you must not examine any witnesses to what other people said, but call the persons who said it.</p>
               <p>Roberts. When you and I parted at the end of Bow-street, did not you give me a direction to your attorney? - Probably I might, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire me to ask Jones how or wherefore he formed this conspiracy? - I think it is very likely; I do not remember it. I rather think I did.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did not you promise to reward me if I found it out? - Probably I might, I wished very much to investigate it to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you offer this man any reward? - I was very wary what I said, I thought some of the persons would turn cat-in-pan, and tell their employers.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him any reward if he made any discovery? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Did he make any discovery? - Never any.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I did make a discovery, I sent him a letter, and he called twice at my lodgings in consequence of it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Consider what a situation I am in here for subornation of perjury, for God's sake do not be guilty of it yourself. Did you receive a letter from me? - More than one.</p>
               <p>Roberts. You know my hand-writing I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180057"/> suppose whether it is similar to the letter you have produced?</p>
               <p>Court. He does not know that the letters come from you.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I gave him an account in writing according to his own desire, and made every discovery that was in my power.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you in consequence of any information received from the prisoner, make any enquiry, and did that enquiry lead to any discovery? - I have never been able to make any discovery from any information I have received as yet.</p>
               <p>Did it lead to any enquiry or discovery? - None but what would have come out without it,</p>
               <p>Did that information prove to be true? - No.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Your counsel says there was a conspiracy against you, I wish to know if you could find any traces that I was concerned with those parties? - I do not know that there were any conspirators besides these parties.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Whether we were acquainted? - I have every reason to believe you did know both the other prisoners; Sheers and he were acquainted.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Did not you call twice at my lodgings? - I think I was twice at his lodgings; I never had any interview with him.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Do you bear the expence of this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Counsel. It is nothing to you whether he does or not? - I am a member of a society; we have certain rules by which we engage to each other in certain cases to be at a common expence; I expect this will be at the common expence.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Very well, I much admire it and think it is a very good one! Did you ever see Mr. Murrell, a constable at Islington, who had me in custody , while I was seeking after Jones? - I think the last time I saw him was the night this indictment was found.</p>
               <p>You saw him at Islington? - I think I saw him once at Islington.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him I had done every thing in my power? - I do not recollect; when he was apprehended I did not know but he might have been deceived.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you recollect whether you said so? - I rather think I did not; I think my ideas at that time were very well fixed.</p>
               <p>Roberts. You said in your evidence that I gave you directions where Jones was to be found? - You did.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - You went along with the constable.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I repeat the question again, where I gave the direction to find Jones? - All I know is, that he offered to take him to the plaintiff, and the constable , and he, and I do not know whether Clipson did not go; several persons went together, but I was not present.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I should be glad to ask Storey a question. When did you see me write? -</p>
               <p>Storey. In Mr. Robson's counting-house, on the side of the desk I write on.</p>
               <p>Mr. MOYSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you was present and heard some of the prisoner speak of this transaction? - Mr. Robson is a member of the society I am a member of, he came on Wednesday night and complained of this matter, we agreed to prosecute if we could find the persons. I was present when Roberts gave the directions to find Collins; that was before Justice Blackborough in Clerkenwell; he said he would go with the constables to the plaintiff. He said he could find him. We desired that if they found him they would come to the Jerusalem tavern , Clerkenwell, and we would be at the tavern to see them. Neither Mr. Robson nor I went with them. We went to the Mansion-house to hear the the examination before Mr. Alderman Kitchen; on our return we found Roberts, constable, and Collins together at the Jerusalem tavern. When Mr. Robson came in he went up to Collins, or nearly to him, and asked Collins if he knew him? Collins said he did not know him; but he said I suppose you are the defendant. Roberts and he were close together. Mr. Robson then asked him if he owed him any thing? Collins said no, he did not. Mr. Robson then asked him if he had not sworn to that debt of eleven hundred pounds , by the name of

               <p>COLLINS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All I have to say is, I was entirely innocent in the matter; I did not intend to injure Mr. Robson; I told him I would endeavour to give him every information in my power. I never intended to prejudice or hurt him. Sheers said it was only to do a friendly action for him, it was only to lock up a person for an hour, that no harm would come of it. I did do it I acknowledge. I am very infirm, I hope it will not affect my life.</p>
               <p>ROBERTS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty wilfully or intentionally. If they have deceived me I cannot help it. I had no malice against Robson. There is no evidence that I ever received a farthing for it. To my sh ame I was much in liquor at the time. I gave every information I could; I gave directions for the constable to find out Jones. I went to two different houses in the court, but could not find him. At last we found him at No. 8. The girl said that he went out at six in the morning. I went into the garrett and found him in his shirt hid in the chimney; I pulled him out. I gave Mr.

             a question or two: What he said when he came to me in the King's Bench, some time after these people were taken up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Robson. I believe I asked Sheers if he had made a full discovery of the other conspirators, and who it was that employed him? To which I think he gave me some strange answer, very unsatisfactory; that he would not squeak, or something of that kind, and that I had ruined him.</p>
               <p>Shears to Clipson. You know I was a Marshalsea-court officer; whether it was not usual to share the profit?</p>
               <p>Clipson. Yes, it was; I have executed several writs he brought in, in the Marshalsea-court, and the Sheriff's-court too; I used always to allow him half the profit.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I should be glad to ask you one question respecting that note given to his lordship, if you do not know whose handwriting it is. (It is shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see Roberts write? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose hand-writing that is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. He swore to it before? - I never saw it before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I have known Roberts eight or nine years; he follows the occupation of an attorney.</p>
               <p>What character has he borne? - An exceeding great one; as far as I have ever heard or experienced a very good character; a very just, conscientious man. I believe him to be an enemy to no body but himself. He has made it his practice, as he lives among very low people, to help other people more than he has helped himself.</p>

               <p>Are you in his service now? - No, I am here now.</p>
               <p>You understand my question; are you in his service now? - Yes, every day, when I am in his labour.</p>
               <p>What do you do for him? - I load and unload, pack and repack silk, and carry money out and bring money in.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You said you was servant to Mr. Fletcher? - Yes; Mr. Fletcher is Mr. Peach's clerk; he pays me my wages; I am a ticket-porter; I have done nothing for any body but Mr. Peach and his family a great many years.</p>
               <p>You are not a lawyer or writer? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the reason of your knowing Roberts so much in his profession? - I had a matter in hand eight or nine years ago; he undertook it, and went through it very judiciously; he gives his total labour away almost to serve other people.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I suppose then he is a gentleman of fortune, and practices law for his diversion? - He has been in prison these four months; the distress he has been in would make the stoutest heart in this court to melt.</p>
