               <p>Q. Look round and tell me whether you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar on the 1st of December last - A. I do; I saw her at Covent Garden market; she came to purchase a basket of apples, of the price of four shillings and sixpence; she turned them out of my basket into her own and gave me four shillings and sixpence; I signified to her that the money was bad and that twice she had given me such money as that; I do not remember exactly the words that I spoke; she said give it me again and I will give you a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she shew you the seven shilling piece - A. She never shewed me a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with the money that she had shewed you - A. No; she signified that she had lost her pocket or left it at home, I do not know which, and run away immediately; I pursued her and caught her, and brought her back with great difficulty; I got a porter in the market to assist me; she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bergin - A. Yes; he came afterwards; there were several that had hold of her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Where was she - A. In Covent Garden market, a few yards from my stand; when I heard of the piece of work, then I went up; a porter had her in custody; then there was a great many people round her; they said she had more in her hand.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Before you took this from her hand, did you see any thing drop from her hand - A. Three shillings dropped from her hand on the ground; as I was getting the others I saw the three shillings drop from her hand; I had them given to me; the three shillings were never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards take the paper from her hand - A. I took the paper and the seven shillings altogether from her; the three shillings besides sell out from between her fingers.

I went into Mrs. Yorke's shop on Saturday afternoon between four and five o'clock; the two prisoners were in Mrs. Yorke's shop; the tallest of the two prisoners took a ball of blue ribbon out of the first drawer that shopwoman shewed her, she said there was none in that drawer that would not; the shopwoman shewed her another drawer of ribbons; and she took out another ball of ribbons; I asked the shopwoman if she had another person that could serve; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110005"/>directed me to go to the parlour; I went to the parlour and called Mrs. Yorke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners take the ribbons - A. I saw Ann Green take two balls, one out of the first drawer and the other out of the second drawer. She concealed them under her great coat; a gentleman in the house stopped them; he picked up the balls of ribbon.</p>

Which of them asked - A I do not know which, they both spoke together; I shewed them a drawer of ribbons; I suspected the motion of Ann Green's hands, I did not see them take any thing; they both put their hands in the drawer and took the ribbons to look at them together; I called Mrs. Yorke; Ann Green was charged with having the ribbon; I had spoke to the witness Fisher; she said she had seen her take it. When I charged Green with having the ribbon, she let it drop.</p>

               <p>Green's Defence. I met with this young woman, I asked her where she was going, she said she was going to buy two yards of ribbon for her head; we saw some ribbon in the window, we went in the shop and asked what the price of it was: the shopwoman said she had some in the drawer that came to eight pence; she took two pieces of ribbon to take two yards off; it rolled off the counter; the gentleman came round and said I dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cox's Defence. I went into the shop to buy a couple of yards of ribbon with this young woman; the gentleman came round and said this young woman had some ribbon; he turned round and knocked the ribbon down with his elbow; I never put my hand in the box.</p>

I picked up the great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you picked up the great coat was it without the street door - A. Yes; he ran towards James street; I pursued him; the watchman sprang his rattle, he turned down King's road, I was as near him as possible; I saw a man lay hold of him, he was never out of my sight.

            . Q. Do you remember on Friday sennight hearing the cry of stop thief - A. Yes; I was just below Mr. Garrow's door in Bedford row; I saw the prisoner running and several others after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that servant, the black man - A. Yes; the prisoner turned towards King's road; I stopped him; the servant came up, we took him back to Dr. Temple's house, and from there to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I will endeavour to occupy the time of the court as little as possibly I can. I have been in the habit of teaching privately; from the unexpected loss of several scholars, I was a long time almost without employment, with a family of six children; I was obliged to let my rent run very much behind; the consequence was I was not able to pay the debt, for which I happened to be arrested; and having spent all the money I could raise by my clothes to support myself and family while I was in prison; I got released by a lady who was my scholar; I then had a situation to go into the country, but unfortunately my wife was taken in labour six weeks before she expected. I have since got some little employment by writing. I have now another child; the youngest is five months, and the second not twenty months, driven to the utmost distress; hearing my little children crying for bread, and I had none for them, on my coming by Dr. Temple's house the coat struck me - I had not strength to resist the temptation, but yielded to the weakness of my nature.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it that you went to Decaux's house - A. On the 4th, about half after eight, I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it that you saw any person come to lady Morton's house - A. At half after twelve, I saw five persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Baker - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons of these five men particularly so as to know them - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether Baker was one of these five men - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these five persons do - A. Three of them went to the iron area gate, and two of them went to the street door, they looked at each; the watchman was coming past crying half after twelve; they went away, I saw no more of them that night. On the 5th, about half after six, I went to lady Morton's house before it was dark; in my way to the house, about half after five, I was crossing Chapel street, I observed five men standing at the post at the corner of Chapel street in Park lane, two of them was Starkey and Lasper; I had known them before, they had their faces towards me; I did not know any of the others, their backs were towards me. I went on to lady Morton's house, where Jackson, one of the constables, was waiting; I walked about some little time to get unobserved in the house by the people that were there. After I had been there a little time my brother and Budgell came in; I found Jackson in the house, he had gone earlier in the evening. We four officers then went down into a room that opens out of the house into the area, we remained there some time, I suppose at least an hour, then I heard the area gate unlock, and some persons come down the steps to the area door, I heard them attempting to unlock it, they were as much as twenty minutes changing the keys; I heard them changing the keys; they could not unlock it; and some person, that seemed to me as if he was standing upon the top of the area steps in the street, called out d - n you, send it in; I believe it was the one at the door then said, hand me down the jemmy.</p>
               <p>Q. That means an iron crow - A. Yes. I heard the crow directly put into the door, they began to wrench it at the outside, after wrenching it several times and stopping now and then. There was a bell hung behind the door; when they wrenched the bell rung, they stopped a bit then, at last they wrenched it open; one of them came into the passage immediately and called to the others, come along, it is all right; some of the others said, now get a light; I heard them go along the passage, and it seemed to me to be the feet of four people by the sound, as nigh as I could guess; they went up stairs, I could hear them walk about the back parlour, over my head; I had pulled my boots off before that; I went up after them, my brother,

            , Jackson, and Budgell, followed me; we had no light; I saw there was a light in the back parlour, I went into the parlour immediately, there I saw four men, three in one corner of the room, and one by the fire place, nearer to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them men - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they see you - A. Yes; they put out their lights immediately, they seemed to me to have two lights. I laid hold of the one nearest me by the fire place, it was dark then, I held him for a second, I had only got one hand to lay hold him, I had my cutlass in my other hand; he struck me across the breast and shoved me to the other side of the room, and then I was close to these people, I then heard a striking against the wainscoat near me; I thought it was a crow at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that they were striking at you - A. I thought it then; there was nobody else in the room as I know to assist me at the time; I 
               <persName id="t18090111-7-person102">drew</persName>
             a pistol and fired at the place where the noise came from; I followed them up into a little passage about as big as where I now stand; then there were four of us in this little place; they shoved me back again; as soon as they shoved me into the room I heard a door burst open; I called to the other officers to bring me a light, which they did immediately; as soon as they brought me a light I followed them into the yard, I saw which way they had gone, through a door that leads into the back yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. The door that was open communicated to the back yard - A. To the back yard: when I got out there I saw Starkey had got on the back office.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation you found him in - A. I found him getting up from off his knee upon the coping of one of the back offices; there is a side wall adjoins the house; he was getting off that and getting on one of the offices; I ran round and got into Park lane, he had jumped off the wall and broke his leg, he was laying under the wall; I had him taken back to the house and I went back to examine the place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you observe what became of either of the other three - A. I did not then; they must all have escaped the same way. One of them went over the wall of the next yard; I did not see him, we found that afterwards. When I returned to see the state of the house, in the parlour I saw a man's hat and some blood, and the ball of the pistol sticking in the door; I found an iron crow, six skeleton keys, and a piece or cotton of a candle, where Starkey had gone over the parapet of the wall; he had dropped them before he got over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was it you found them - A. This door out of the parlour opens to a flat which covers a kitchen below; then along the yard there is another place which makes it level with Park lane wall; that was where I found them and that was where I saw Starkey getting up, where I found them. I sent Starkey to the infirmary to be taken care of. I found the door that leads into the yard broken open, with the lock broke; the door they went out of. The door of the area into the house was broken open with an iron crow; it was evident the door had been forced with a crow, and I have no doubt but that is the crow; I compared the crow to the marks, it tallied; I matched the skeleton keys, none of them would unlock the area door; one of them opened the area gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Shortly after this Lasper was taken into custody - A. Lasper was taken immediately after; Cavill was not taken for a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You did not know Baker till he was taken up - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. This offence was committed in the month of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Baker has been recently taken up - A. Yes.</p>

Jack the Baker, the prisoner, made answer, I will go with you, Cavill replied with all my heart; they came back again, Lasper said how is it, the prisoner answered, why he is gone to Croydon fair with his girl, we must leave it alone to night; both Baker and Cavill said so.

             the Baker and Cavill went to this person again, they did not mention the name; they went again after the tools, they came back and said it was all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that - A. Cavill said it was all right; Cavill asked what time they should meet, the prisoner said about nine o'clock, Lasper said he thought it as good a time as any; but where they did not mention in my hearing; they were to do the trick at eleven, Cavill said that. I then proceeded to Marlborough street, and gave information to the officers.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it you went to the Bleeding Hart - A. About three in the afternoon; it was about seven o'clock when I came away from the Bleeding Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went to the public office - A. I went to the public house opposite of the office; I acquainted Mr. Foy of it, he spoke to his brother officers; I told them to be at such a place, and I would secure them a place whereby they should be secure from the sight of them, at the house kept by my wife for lady Steward: I lived at that house with my wife, I would be there ready to let them in about nine o'clock; the officers came on Tuesday evening, I put them in the front parlour; we then waited there till about half past twelve o'clock; at that time there were five men came up to lady Morton's door; I was then in the front room along with the officers; five men went up the steps of the street door, three of them came down to the area gate, and the others might be upon the steps for about a minute or two; the watchman came and called half an hour after twelve o'clock; they then dispersed, I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish who they were - A. The prisoner was one, I am sure of that; it was a bright moon light night at the time, and I had taken particular notice of the persons before, I knew them all by sight, and the names by which they called one other I took down on paper, and the description; I went the next day to the Bleeding Hart, about ten in the morning, and saw Cavill, Lasper, Starkey, and Jack the Baker, they were all in company together; I heard them talking about meeting

               <p>Q. What direction did you take - A. I turned to the right towards South street; I saw the five men, Lasper, Starkey, Jem Britten, Cavill, and the prisoner; I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110008"/>sure the prisoner was one of them. I then followed them up South street into South Audley street, round to Chapel street, down to Park street again.</p>
               <p>Q. Making a little circuit and then returning to lady Morton's house again - A. Yes; still keeping in company together; after they came into Park street, they went into Park lane; my wife and the young woman of the house were coming out then; Cavill and the prisoner followed the two girls in Grovesnor square; I followed them at a distance; they came back after seeing them into the square; they returned to their partners; Cavill said it was all right; they went round to South street, to my lady Morton's house; I was still keeping my eye upon them, I was in South street, I stood by the public house. They went up to the gate of lady Morton's house, all five; Starkey and Jem Britten remained at the gate, the other three passed on a little way.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time in the evening was this - A. That I cannot say, it might be about seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Was it dark - A. It was duskish; they opened the area gate and went away; by persons passing they were disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how they opened the area gate - A. They opened it with something they had in their hands, I cannot exactly say what it was; as soon as they opened it Starkey said it was all right.</p>
               <p>COURT. How near were you to them when he said that - A. I was about three doors off, standing at the public house the corner of South street; as soon as the people had passed they returned again, three of them then went down the area steps, Starkey, Britten, and Lasper; they were trying at the door some considerable time; I heard a bell ring, I supposed it was the bell of the door, and I heard the door crack; I was then opposite, at my own door; I supposed the door was then opened; just before that one of them, (Lasper,) came up the steps and halloed out bring the jemmy this way.</p>
               <p>Q. He came up the steps - A. Yes, just to the top; the prisoner and Cavill were standing at the corner of South street about three house off.</p>
               <p>Q. Fix exactly, if you can, the hour, what time in the evening it was when you heard the bell ring - A. It might be seven o'clock, past seven, it might be a quarter after, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the light at that time - A. It was dark at that time, it was duskish; I was about four or five houses off; it was not very dark and it was not very light.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any remains of the light of the day - A. No, very little indeed; it was so dark that I could distinguish a person about three houses off by the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your judgment any remains of day then - A. No, not any; it was not real dark nor real light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Could you have discovered their faces without the assistance of the lamps - A. I could the distance I was off them at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was duskish but not dark - A. Not so dark as it was afterwards; it was darker afterwards, before the moon got up; at that time there was no moon to be seen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. After the three men what became of the other men - A. Cavill went down immediately after the jemmy had been called for, and left the prisoner at the bar at the corner of South street; I kept my station opposite watching; the prisoner then went to the back of the house into Park lane as soon as Cavill had left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what the men at the area gate did after this - A. No, I could not; I remained at the front of the house, and after hearing the report of a pistol about a quarter of an hour afterwards; in a few minutes after the report of the pistol, I saw the prisoner come running from Park lane into South street and down Park street to the front of the house; he came as if from the back of lady Morton's house to the front of it; when he came into Park street

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Then if I understand you right, you say thought it was a little duskish, there was still remaining light enough to distinguish a man's face about three or four houses off - A. Yes, by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my lord and the jury that you knew Cavill - A. I knew his face; I had worked with him a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You did know him - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he knew you - A. He might not be so exact as to look at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his house of call - you knew that he resorted to the Bleeding Hart, he told you that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you knew that Cavill was to be found at the Bleeding Hart - A. I did not know it till I went.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there - A. I went in there for curiosity, the same as before mentioned, because I thought there was no good going on; he had given me an invitation to go there, but I did not go there then; that day I took the liberty to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no invitation on that day from him nor had you given any invitation - A. No; I expected to meet him, and there I did see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why Cavill must know you - could Cavill forget you - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other people in the house, were there not; other people might see him as well as you - how far did you sit from him - A. About as far as I am to you.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not make yourself known to Cavill at that time - A. No, nor to any body else; I did not speak to him; I only called for my beer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. There were other people in the house besides you and these men you have been describing - A. There were only these thieves and bad women.</p>
               <p>Q. And yourself - no honest person would use the house would they - A. Oh, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there were other people there - A. Of course there were other people there at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they pay attention to what passed - A. I do not know they did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this house Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were always fortunate enough to go at the time that some of these people were there - A. Yes, and I always found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there expecting to find them there, and you found them there - never by accident that you was too late, you always found some of them there - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110009"/>Q. I take it for granted that during the number of times you were there, other people besides these men and yourself were in the tap room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these men here - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were constantly talking of this robbery - A. Yes, at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Speaking of it in the manner you have told the jury and my lord - mentioning time, place and name, loud enough for every body to hear - A. So loud that I could hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think it very extraordinary that these men should be so rash as to talk before you - A. Being a common house for thieves, I naturally thought they were not very particular in speaking; they might think the people were thieves like themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known him two years before - when did you first know it was the house of call for thieves - A. When I first went.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you know it was a house where their guests were reputed thieves - A. Only as I had heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Honest people go sometimes there, because you went there - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed these men constantly in the street on the night of the robbery - were they not likely to see you dodging of them - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my lord and the jury that you were some distance from them, yet they spoke so loud of this robbery that you heard them - A. I am only speaking of what passed in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. About the iron crow being handed down you heard in the street - A. I heard that about three houses off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. How many yards was that off - A. It might be twenty yards off; I did not measure it; I suppose it might be between twelve and twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You would have the jury believe they talked so loud that between twelve and twenty yards you heard what they said - A. I do not understand your question.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you were between twelve and twenty yards off, yet you heard what they said - A. I heard them call out for the jemmy; I was nearly opposite then.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what distance were you when they talked about the jemmy - A. When Lasper came up to the top of the steps I was opposite of lady Morton's door; it might be ten yards across the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you not say just now that you heard some conversation in the street between the prisoner and Cavill - A. When they followed the girls they came back and said all was right; then I might be about twenty yards off; I was at Chapel court at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You know as a carpenter that is sixty feet - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were so cautious, that you might know their names you took down their names on a piece of paper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nothing to do in planning of this, previous before you gave information - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Decaux, how much reward do you expect - A. That I do not know nothing about the reward, I did not till last sessions; my lord informed me as last sessions. I know it now.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know that the greater the number that are convicted the greater would be the reward - A. Of course I knew it after I was told it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect the reward - A. Of course I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that if this young man is convicted there will be a reward too - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he is indicted of a similar offence - you know there is a reward now - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect part of the reward if that young man is convicted - A. Of course I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Did you know any thing about this reward about the conviction of these persons till you were here last sessions - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to be employed once with Cavill, you then learned from Cavill that he used the Bleeding Hart - A. No, I only received information from him to go to that house; I never went.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your reason for going to the Bleeding Hart to find out Cavill there - A. Yes, and to learn the intentions of these suspicious men.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no share in counselling or advising this robbery - A. Upon my oath I had not.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long before this month of October was it that you had received this invitation from Cavill - A. I believe very near two years; I never had any communication with Cavill after that period; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you followed him had you disguised yourself in your dress - A. No; I had not the same clothes on, I had an apron on.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any partners - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did your family consist at that time - A. My wife, a maid servant, a shopman, a boy, they all slept in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it this happened - A. On the night of the 3d of April last; I was last up that night; I fastened the doors at one o'clock in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about one in the morning - A. I secured the doors of the shop and the windows likewise. The door opens in half, and has two shutters, which was secured by two iron bars on the outside, and fastened on the inside and locked; the shutters were perfectly fast, with iron bars and pins to secure them.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your shop communicate with the dwelling house - A. The stairs of the house face the shop door; there is an inner door that goes to the stairs the stairs are not in the shop, they are not enclosed by a wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. You go into the house by the shop door - A. Yes; there is no other outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of the night did you hear any noise or any alarm - A. No; my maid saw it first; she got up about five o'clock, or a little afterwards; I received the information from her, upon that I got up immediately and went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then - A. It was day light. I saw that the door of the shop had been broken open by cutting a hole in one of the pannels of the door shutter; it was cut in a direction that they could put their arm in and unscrew the fastenings of the bar with their hand. This is the whole of the pannel, I had the carpenter to take it out; they cut out the whole square of glass. In the morning the door was shut and on the latch, the shutter put up, and the bar fastened as before, the lock was tied back, and the hole in the pannel was covered over with paper the colour of the pannel; it appeared that they cut the hole of one square, so that a person could go in and unfasten the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that square of glass large enough to let a person in - A. Yes; large enough to let any middle sized person in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your shop with respect to the goods - A. I found three or four shelves empty; the first I missed was a pile of Irish linens which stood on a small counter near the door, I will not be positive whether they stood on a stool or the end of the counter. I missed a quantity of printed cottons, and two wrappers of muslins; this was on the 3d of April. On the morning of the 6th or 7th of April I received a letter by the post, giving me some information, in consequence of which I had a warrant from Worship street office to search the prisoner's house, No. 45, Seward street, Brick lane, St. Luke's, three officers went with me. The prisoner <rs id="t18090111-8-deflabel48" type="occupation">keeps a chandler's shop</rs>

                        targets="t18090111-8-defend118 t18090111-8-deflabel48"/>; in the parlour behind the shop, in a drawer of a chest of drawers, we found a piece of muslin; in other parts of the house we found a quantity of skeleton keys, and other articles not belonging to me; I found nothing belonging to me but the piece of muslin. The prisoner was not at home at the time of the search.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that this house, No. 45, belonged to the prisoner - A. The landlord is here to prove it. I saw his wife at the time I searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What you found there was part of a piece of muslin - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to know it was part of the property that you lost - A. Yes. The officer has it here; I never found any other part of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the keys found - A. In one of the cupboards up stairs, in a small bag, and two or three pair of pistol cases with them.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw the prisoner after having searched his house - A. Never, till last Thursday at the Mansion house; I have understood ever since, he has been out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having found the muslin at the prisoner's house, did you ever afterwards go to the prisoner's house to enquire after him - A. No. In consequence of the prisoner being absent the prisoner's wife was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110011"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that your maid servant came down first in the morning - A. Yes; we heard her go down stairs, she returned immediately and gave me the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down you saw it was day light - A. It was sufficiently day light, I could see all over the shop, I saw what I had missed without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the only thing that is produced is a piece of muslin - that is a very small part of that which you lost - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it is yours, that piece of muslin has been produced before upon a trial that you charged the wife with a burglary - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For which she was tried in June sessions and acquitted - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you then venture to swear to the muslin, and remember what was said was taken down - A. What I then stated I will now say; from the length and breadth of it, the quantity and texture of it, I believe it now to be mine, but I have since found something more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you then upon its being produced upon the trial of this burglary, examine it carefully in court - A. I examined it as carefully as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you done so at the police office before the magistrate - A. I had so, but not in the light so much as what I have at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Now attend to me, did not you state as your reason for believing it to be yours from this circumstance; the quantity, length, breadth, and texture; their being no marks that you could not swear to it - A. I said the fagg end being turn off, my private mark being gone, I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the manufacturer who manufactured the article for you, does not he manufacture for half the town besides - A. I do not presume to say he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was tried in June for this, and she was at home at the time of the search - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find there were other people in the house at the time - A. Yes, there was an old man in one of the back rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room were the keys found - A. It was in a back room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You was asked what you said upon the trial of the woman about the piece of muslin being your property; you say you have since discovered something else - A. After the trial, when I left the court, I parted with all the officers in the court, they gave me the muslin wrapped up in paper. I then went directly home, I will not be certain whether I laid the muslin in the shop or my man. I immediately went up stairs; during the time I was at my dinner, I had another try to see whether I could match it. I came down stairs and asked my shopman to assist me, and looking to see if we could trace any of the marks; we found the smallest quantity possible of my shop mark, the top of an O and a W; it is sufficiently perceivable.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship office. In consequence of a search warrant, I went to No. 45, Seward street, with Bishop, Kenedy, and Mr. Rutter; when I came there, I saw the prisoner's wife; I knew the house before. I then read my warrant, and proceeded to search; in a back room below stairs, even with the shop, I found a piece of muslin in a drawer, which was handed over to Mr. Rutter; this was on the 7th of April. In a bed room up stairs, there was a great coat hanging behind the door; in the coat pocket we found some wax taper; in a closet in the same room we found a large black bag; that was all that we found that had any thing to do with this that I could see. I kept the muslin from the time I found it, till Eversall's wife was tried; it was then by the order of the court returned to the prosecutor. After I returned it back to him, I went to the office; he returned at seven o'clock the same evening, and desired me to take care of it. It was then sealed up by me in this paper, and put into a warehouse where Mr. Armstrong keeps a key, where we deposit all property that is taken under warrant. Armstrong unlocked the door and gave me possession of the bag that this was in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor has said that he sent the officers after the prisoner - A. We have been continually enquiring after the prisoner in the neighbourhood; we never went to his house.</p>

I called Mr. Joslyn, stop thief, Joslyn; the other that was with him come and gave me a push of one side, and they both ran off. This was about four o'clock; I did not see them afterwards.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Roberts. On the 16th of last month I went into the barn were Lovett was threshing of barley; I told him he would be able to thrash it all out the next day; he said no, he should not be able to finish until Monday. I then took up the fork to see how much there was, I stuck it in a sack; I took it up, I asked him what it was; he said he did know any thing at all about it; I found it contained barley, I told him so; he then said he had gleaned it up for Joseph, and he had not taken it away. I then left the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Joseph - A. He is an odd man, he takes care of the pigs and cows. After the men had left their work I went into the barn, I found the barley there; I marked the sack. On Sunday morning I found it was gone; I acquainted my master; we searched about and found it in the horses' bin covered over with straw; we took out a sample of it. At night the sack was marked by the constable.</p>
               <p>- I am a constable. I found this sack in the corn bin in the stable; I saw Lovett come out of Mr. Roberts's gate with the sack upon his shoulder, between five and six on Sunday evening; Fletcher came out of the gate with him into the lane, I followed them and brought them back to Mr. Roberts. Upon examining the sack I found it contained barley; it corresponded with the sample; that is the sack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The sack is not his master's - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel.</p>
               <p>Fletcher called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I lived servant with Mrs. Pink when she kept the Nag's head public house, Whitecross street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Wogan - A. Yes, I have seen him often at that house, before Mrs. Pink removed from the public house. On the 5th of November he came into the tap room with an umbrella in his hand, and asked me for a needle to repair it; I gave him a needle, he could not make use of the needle, he asked me to repair it for him; I did; he said it belonged to the captain's daughter, he should get anger if he did not repair it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else that he had - A. Only a watch that he had in his pocket; I did not particularly observe the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that umbrella that you mended - A. I do; here is the place that I mended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When it was rainy I was in the habit of borrowing the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pink. That is the umbrella that was in my possession; I never allowed him to make use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Sindall ever come back to you again - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The night before this affair happened Mr. and Mrs. Pink, Sindall and me, went to the play; I had the umbrella the night before; I was going home, I left them close to Smithfield; Mrs. Pink said, I shall not be at home tomorrow, I am going to my sister's child christening, there is some cold shoulder of mutton in the cupboard. The next morning I went to the Nag's Head with the umbrella about one o'clock in the afternoon; I went to Mrs. Pink's, I went up stairs and knocked at the door, no answer was given to me; I went and asked the landlady it any body was at home, she said she did not know, there had been a great many people up and down; I borrowed five pence of the landlady, I told her I should go to the Bell. When I was at the Bell Sindall came in, he said he heard me knocking, he told me had the landlord of the Three Pigeons in the room, and a woman of the name of Lawson; he and I went to Mrs. Pink's room, and when I was going I said I would lock the door and take the key down to the landlady; he said no; I went down stairs, and saw no more of Sindall till the Saturday morning; going down Whitecross street I met Sindall with Mrs. Pink's great coat on his back; he said he was going home; I have never seen him since, I went to the house on the Monday; neither Mrs. Pink nor the landlady was at home; I met the landlady, she told me of this, and told me Mrs. Pink would prosecute me. I being innocent, was afraid of being put in prison; when I went with Mrs. Pink to the office there was no officer to prevent me from going away. If I had a mind to resist I might.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Had you been to the play the night before - A. Yes; they went to the play with us; Sindall and the prisoner had the use of the umbrella; I took it from them when we parted in Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you say upon your oath that she said she did not suspect him - A. Yes, she said so several times.</p>
               <p>Q. But she wanted to know where he was - A. Yes. I told her I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the prisoner the last time - A. On the Saturday morning, as I saw Mrs. Pink in the evening; I saw him about ten days afterwards; I went to Mrs. Pink's house, she was not at home; I left word with the landlady I had seen him; Mrs. Pink told me that she had been down to the father and mother of the young man, that his father said he had a watch in his pocket and a bundle; he had one of Mr. Pink's shirts on, and one of the pair of stockings in the bundle was marked in full length with his name, and that a gentleman at his father's asked him what the watch cost; he said two pounds, and that he had another watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of that umbrella - A. That umbrella was left with my landlady in the room below and a letter for Mrs. Pink; I delivered it into Mrs. Pink's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Pink, in fact had you been down after the other man Sandell - A. Yes, at his father's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you traced a number of things into his possession - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had good reason to suspect that the other man Sandell was in possession of a number of things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told that young woman so - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found the things, you only heard it from the father of Sandell - A. I only heard it from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any other horse at that time - A. No. He said he was going to sell it; I asked him what he asked for it; he said a guinea and a half; I told him that was too much, I put my basket on my head and was going away; I told him I would give him sixteen shillings for it; he stood a bit, I went on, and when I returned again he said I should have it; I asked him then where he lived; he told me he lived in the Kilburn Road, two doors from the Black Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what his name was - A. No. He said that he had this horse, and that he worked him in the Brick carts at Kilburn, the weather was so bad he could not draw bricks, he turned the horse up the lane, he thought he had better sell it than let it lie starving about the hedges; I told him I would trouble him to go home with me; I gave him twelve shillings in Camdem Town; he led the horse to my door, I gave him a seven shilling piece, he gave me three shillings and delivered the horse to me; then he left me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know at that time that the horse had been claimed - A. Yes. He said I gave him a bad shilling; I told him if I did I did not wish to do it, I would change it for him; he gave it me; I told him we must go to the public house and have something to drink, and then I would change it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a shilling - A. He gave me a large sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what you gave him for a shilling - A. He said it was, I did not know it; we went into the King's Head public house, Tottenham court road; I asked for some purl, and shut the door, and told him that he had stole the horse that I bought, and that it had been stopped; he said he had not; I told him I was sure he had; he then sat down and said he did, he had done it for distress, he had a family, and his children wanted bread.

               <p>Q. Had you intended to sell him again when you bought it - A. I did not know; if he had suited me I should have kept him. On the same afternoon I sold him to one Mr. Cross, going down towards Battle bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with Mr. Cross - A. In the road going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. No. He lives in Maiden lane, Battle bridge, he is a knacker; I agreed to sell him for twenty shillings and sixpence; he wanted me to trust him; I would not; he then gave me three shillings earnest; he said he would fetch the horse at seven o'clock at night, if I would keep him for him; I then took him home and told him I would; this was on the Thursday; he never came for the horse; I tied the horse up and gave him some hay. I called upon him the next morning to know whether he meaned to fetch him or no; he said he would come for it about ten o'clock. I went out with my goods, when I came home the horse was there; this was about two o'clock on the Friday; I said to my wife I would take him to Smithfield to sell him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to Smithfield to sell him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been yourself in Smithfield market - A. The young man that I took with me held the horse while I was talking to a man that I had bargained with to sell the horse; I saw him in Smithfield just as I was going in. The young man's name is Wood that held the horse for me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say you saw this Cross in the market - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the horse then to him, or did he pay for it - A. No; I went to him, we had a few words; he said if I would bring the horse up to him he would pay me; accordingly I went to fetch the horse to him; the horse was standing in the market; I halloaed for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110016"/>the young man; I saw a great mob about the horse and that it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body there that owned the horse - A. Yes, Berryman claimed the horse; I went to Berryman, I told him that young man knew nothing about the horse, that I had brought it from Camden town; I told Berryman I bought the horse; he said the horse belonged to Cockbill his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you at the time that he took the horse - A. They wanted to put me in the counter; they knew me, and I begged of them not to put me in; he took the horse down, and I was to go to him the next day; I was told to come to him at Walham green, Fulham.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you told us you met the prisoner as you described - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Walham green before you saw him - A. No; I went afterwards to Walham green, and informed them after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was you yourself that had him taken in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that horse that Berryman took away was the same horse that you had bought of the prisoner the day before - A. On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Well this was on the Friday that the horse was taken away - A. Yes.</p>

On the 15th of December, about seven in the evening, I heard a noise in the apartment that is getting ready for a coffee room, where the carpenters had left work; I went to the side door of the coffee room, I asked whether any body was there in that room; the carpenters had not left the key of that room; I could get no answer; on my speaking I heard somebody fall over some deals. The door is a sash door, not glazed, the carpenter had nailed a board across inside, that nobody should get inside; it is a side door to the coffee room, that communicates to the yard; I saw the board up; it was up for security, to prevent people from getting in through the sash. When I heard the noise of some person falling over the deals I immediately put my back to the door and burst it open, and called for a light; when I came into the room, there is a place erecting for a bar, I found the prisoner lying on his back with all the smaller part of the tools about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the tools left by the workmen - A. Yes, they always left their tools there; the large saw and small saw and large plane, I found lying by the door, laying where the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you observed the board that was on the sash - A. I observed that as soon as I put my hand against the door it laid by the side of the door; there was an oil stone, a gouge, and many other articles that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110017"/>I do not know the name of, as I am not a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these within the bar where the man was lying - A. Close to him, about his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen in what part of the house these tools were left when the men went - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any other of the articles - A. There was a flannel jacket and a two foot rule.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner when you found him - A. Yes; I asked him how he came there; he gave me a good deal of abuse, he pretended to be very much intoxicated in liquor, I could not get a reasonable answer for a long while; there was a pair of folding doors, I found them fast; I noticed it particularly; the sash of the front was not glazed, no more than them at the back; it was nine foot from the pavement to get at them; there were no steps erected.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body have got up to that height - were the sashes large enough to creep through - A. Yes, I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body had got there, was there any thing to interrupt their passage, from where you found the prisoner - A. No; they could come to the side door on coming through the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other place where there was a possibility of any person coming in without breaking - A. No; there were two sashes backwards; they were both fastened, I examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person to whom these tools belonged - A. Yes, to

               <p>Q. In what part of the room did you leave the tools - A. I left the tools in one corner of the room; it is a coffee room, parted off with benches for gentlemen, where we were working; I put some on the seats of the box and some on my work bench.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You had not observed any thing about the door with the sash in it from between five and six o'clock, and the time you received the alarm - A. No, it was impossible, because it was dark. I generally tried the other door with my hand when the carpenters had done work. I dare say I had that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you as you were walking - A. As I got up to Pear Tree court I had a blow on this side of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a blow on the side of your head - did you see where the blow came from - A. I did not; it was from a person behind me; it was not a violent one, it stunned my ear; immediately after that my hat and my veil went right off my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hat was it - A. A round hat, made of straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call it a hat - A. Yes, it was a turban hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a different thing from a bonnet - A. Oh, yes, sir, it is; it was not a bonnet, it was a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the veil over this hat, as you call it - A. No, it was pinned inside; I had pinned the veil to my hair and the hat was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have gone off with the blow - A. No, it was pulled off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the veil was pinned to your hair and not to the hat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe next - A. I directly turned round and saw the person run up the court that took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean, you saw a person run up the court with a hat in his hand - A. Yes, and the veil.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see him take it off - A. No; he ran up Pear Tree court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of his person so as to know him again - A. No further than by his dress; he had on the same kind of a jacket as he had on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then after he ran up the court - A. I lost sight of him; this was on the Sunday; I did not see him after till on the Tuesday when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether at all the same person that you saw on the Tuesday was the same person that you saw running - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. You only saw the back of him did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. You say this was in the month of December, and in the evening - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received a blow on the side of your head - should you suppose it a blow, or occasioned by some person snatching your hat - A. I had a little baby in my arms, just five months old; it was not a violent blow; my hat went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person that made a blow at you, the sensation of that would be very different from a person taking your hat - A. I believe it was both.</p>
               <p>Q. The veil was under your hat, could a person see that - A. Yes, they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the person behind have seen the veil, or not - A. Yes, they must.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in Turnmill street, that is a street very much frequented - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any persons passing and repassing at the time - A. I saw no person; I hooted out stop thief; no person came to assist me; the hat was put on without any fastenings, but the veil was pinned.</p>

On Tuesday the 3d of January, about ten minutes past six, I was going up Holborn, I heard a woman say stop thief; I was about four or five yards from Mr. Schneider's door. I saw a man run from the door; I did not see any thing in his hand; he ran across the road as fast as he could; I followed him; he crossed over and came back again; I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive that he dropped any thing - A. No; it was very dark; I should not have been able to see a muff if it had laid before me, without I had trod upon it; I caught him on the pavement; on his return there was a coach passed between us, then he slackened his pace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of particularly observing his person - A. I had not; I saw nobody else there. I never saw him before; I could not swear to the man that I took; only the person that I followed I brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Pimlico; I had been to a house there two or three days. About two or three o'clock I came home to my wife and drank tea; when I came out of the court just by, I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran after the man, I missed him; a man came after me and said he believed I was the man. I said I did not know, I believed he was wrong. The master of the shop laid hold of my ears and wrong them well.</p>

I lost these ducks last Sunday night, they were in a hen house; I missed them on Monday morning, I had seen them on the over night, between four and five in the evening; they were locked up in the hen house in an enclosed yard; I lost eight ducks from the poultry house, and five from the fattening house, and three chickens besides I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse this man of taking them - A. On Tuesday morning I went to Leadenhall market, I found twelve out of the thirteen; they were all alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these ducks are your master's - A. Yes; they had a private mark on them, and one of the drakes had but one eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man - A. He lived about a quarter of a mile from us; I cannot say I know him, I know his wife very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service - A. He was an <rs id="t18090111-23-deflabel138" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you attend to see him that night on the watch - A. I did, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon the next morning did you see your craft - A. I did not see it the next morning; the lug boat had gone her journey by another man.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had discovered that James was in custody upon this, did you bring back the trunks again - A. I did, myself; I went to Blackwall and got it before it was received into the ship out of my own lug boat, the trunk No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it had been unpacked, and repacked - A. Yes; it was so well done I could not discover it; when I came to open it I found fifteen pieces of muslin, and upon the top of it were stumps of brooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these fifteen pieces fill the trunk - A. Oh no, not much above half; on the muslin were stumps of brooms and the birch, to the amount of two brooms, I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT. It filled up the vacancy - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And done so neatly that your eye could not discover that it had been unpacked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your partners are responsible for these goods when they are delivered to you - A. Yes; the trunk is here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Macqueen. Is that one of the trunks that you packed - A. It is; the mark at the bottom is PD No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of goods that you packed for Mr. Davis - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed to Thompson. Have you mentioned all the names of your partners - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When the trunks were delivered to you, were they delivered to you in person - A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you did not make the mark PD - A. No. There were twenty four trunks put in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that the trunks that were put in the lug boat, that is one of them before you - A. I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. They were covered up in matting - A. They were so; this side of the trunk is left outside; the merchant gave me the numbers; we prick them off; the matting does not go round, it covers the top; the mark is on the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man was an apprentice of your father's - A. Yes; I believe he had been out of his time in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the lug boat was, it was not in the river Thames, but in one of the creeks - A. No, it was in the Thames.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You yourself received them on board the lug boat, and you are quite certain they are the same - A. I am quite certain they are the same.</p>

Between four and five in the morning I saw four men come out of East Smithfield, down Butcher row; two of them kept on the side I was on, and two crossed over on the other side; the first was the prisoner at the bar, he had a bundle under his arm; I crossed over; the hindmost man I elbowed, and thought he had nothing; I followed the prisoner into a dark entry, I was about five or six paces behind him, when he put the bag down by the corner of a house in the dark entry; I went up to him and asked him what he had got there. he said nothing; I put my stick to the bag, and at the same time I kicked my foot against it; I went to put my hand to lay hold of him, at the same time I kicked the bag farther away; he made a spring and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the bag contained any thing in it - Yes; I ran after him; before we got out of the dark entry a man in a blue coat got between us; I made a blow at his head in order to knock him down, but I missed it; I continued pursuing the prisoner; he ran into my partner's hand at the top of Dean street; he was stopped at the top of Dean street by Adams. I never lost sight of him before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this dark entry where you left the bag to where the prisoner was taken - A. About one hundred and fifty yards or two hundred yards; I told Adams to take the prisoner to the watchhouse. I went back to the dark entry for the property. I found the bag contained five pieces of muslin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. How long is this dark entry - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far behind the men that was running from you might you be at any time - fifteen yards from him - A. No; I think I should have got hold of him if it had not been for the man that ran between him and me.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS. Q. You are another patrol of East Smithfield - were you on duty on the morning of the 27th in East Smithfield - A. Yes. The prisoner was running up Dean street as hard as he could run; the last witness was close to him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Then on the 27th you began the night by going to sleep - A. It is impossible for a man to be up sixteen nights upon a stretch without some sleep</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes it is impossible for a man to be honest - A. Very true.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a very young man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a young man - A. A great deal younger than me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told all that passed - A. No; you have not asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing that was said to you, was, shall we go to work - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it at once - A. I did, because he called the trunks Peters himself before; in taking in the goods, he said here comes the Peters. I did not know what the Peters were till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a watchman did not know what Peters were - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a strange term - A. It was a strange term.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it at once it was to break them open and steal the contents - A. That is without a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the term Peter being a strange term to you and you understood it immediately - it did not occur to you to take him into custody immediately - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Is he a young man or not - A. I cannot say; by the appearance of the man in the dark I could not say whether he was young or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Long a man that you knew perfectly well - A. He was not, I never had any connection with him whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You soon acquiesed with them - A. I was as culpable as them.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you proposed it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you were shocked at the proposal - A. I was not.</p>

            . I am a merchant. On Thursday evening, near five o'clock, I went through Lombard street into St. Swithin's lane; as I turned out of Lombard street into St. Swithin's lane I heard the prosecutrix screaming out stop thief, I was at the corner, I saw the prisoner; he turned round the corner out of Bearbinder lane; I prepared to meet him; I turned him up against the window; the person who was behind me, I do not know which, laid hold of him first; I believe we both laid hold of him as near as possible together; I had hold of him in the front and the other behind; he dropped his arm as if he was going to throw something down; I kept my eye on his hand; I saw him rise it again, and he put the notes into the bridge of the shutter, where the shutters slide in; I took it out immediately; there were plenty had hold of him at the same time; I took the number of the notes, and gave them to the prosecutrix; I went to the banker to see whether she had taken them from Messrs. Robarts.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you before that missed these pieces of carpeting - A. On Saturday evening the 24th, I missed not only the piece mentioned in the indictment, but a large quantity of wrappers, above an hundred yards, which is not in the indictment; the table cloth cover I did not miss till it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the pieces of carpeting - A. It was about six weeks before that I had employed him to assist me in sorting a number of patterns, among which were these mentioned in the indictment; these are the patterns. Donaldson the officer went to search the lodgings; I accompanied him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to search did you enquire where he lodged - A. I did; he told me he lodged at 23, Exeter street in the Strand; a young man in the warehouse told him he knew he did not; he persisted he did; the officer took a key from him, he stated it was the key of his room door; he also described the room to be a back room up two pair of stairs; I accompanied the officer; I found he did not lodge there. I afterwards found out he lodged in Berwick street; I am not sure whether it is the Black Swan or the Black Lion. The constable took two keys from him; one unlocked the chamber door, and the other unlocked the prisoner's trunk; there was a shirt in that trunk; inside of that was a green cloth table cover; I immediately knew it to be the property of my partners and myself, from the private mark that was attached to it. I received from the hands of the landlord other articles - pieces of carpeting and thread.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he state to you how he came by those pieces of carpeting - A. Seeing my bed room door open, he said landlord, you have no bedside carpeting; I said no, I cannot afford them; he ran up stairs and brought down these pieces of carpeting; I asked him how he came by them, he said they were his perquisites, he did not want any thing for them; I was in a hurry, I throwed them down in the room; when Mr. Harris came I delivered them to him.</p>

               <p>Q. You never bought any candlesticks of him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you wanted a supply of forged bank notes, how came you to call them dozens of candlesticks - A. Because the first thing that we talked was about candlesticks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110029"/>of which I had a notion of buying some, not of him.</p>
               <p>Q In short, by whose direction did you describe forged notes by dozens of candlesticks - A By Mr. Nicholls' direction.</p>
               <p>Q You have told us at the time of this correspondence you were in custody - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Of course you were not at the Lemon Tree - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Were you taken to the Lemon Tree by Foy and some other person - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q When was that - A I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q Was it at the time according to the letter from the prisoner at Birmingham, when you expected him to arrive - A Yes, it was on that day.</p>
               <p>Q How long had you been at the Lemon Tree before you were informed that the prisoner had come there - A About three or four or five hours.</p>
               <p>Q Upon that you were permitted to go into a room by the officers, separated from them by a partition - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did you agree with the officers for any signal that you were to do, if any certain event happened - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q What were you do - A To put on my hat when I was certain that Mr. Nicholls had the notes in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q What did the prisoner and you do after you went in to him - A We talked about this business about the notes; I asked him if he had brought them with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you ask him - A What he had brought, if he had brought these things; I did not mention what; he said yes; I asked him for a pencil and and little piece of paper; I think he cut it from that letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He took out some letter from his pocket and tore some paper off, which you believe was this - A I cannot say it was that.</p>
               <p>Q But you believe so - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q What was you to do with the pencil and the piece of paper - A To cast up all the notes - 20 dozen, No. 5, according to what I had ordered, at thirty shillings each, and to see what they came to.</p>
               <p>Q Was the price of the same proportion of the smaller notes as the large ones - A Yes, at six shillings for a pound; that was the price of all.</p>
               <p>Q So that you were to pencil the number of each, and cast how much six shillings in a pound would come to - A Yes; then I made out the account, and said it comes to so much money.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect how much it came to - A I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q But you mentioned to him how much they came to - A I did, and I put down the price of the notes, and two guineas for his journey.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to put down the two guineas for the journey - A Because in my first letter I proposed two guineas for the journey.</p>
               <p>Q Upon your putting down this money on the paper did you say any thing to him that this was a large purchase that you were making - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Do you recollect what he said - A One must get rid of them in the way of trade. When I was certain he had got the notes, I said now we will go up to my room, it is cold, I will put my hat on.</p>
               <p>Q Then as soon as you put on your hat the officers came in and secured him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Now Alessi, when you were taken for uttering this note to Mr. Taylor, you were not permitted to go back to your lodgings again - A No.</p>
               <p>Q You were not in your own room when you met the prisoner - A No, in the club room.</p>
               <p>Q This room that we are talking of, is a room parted off by a separate partition from the club room - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see the officer bore the hole through the partition, so that they could see what passed before the prisoner came - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q When you went out on the day that you were taken up for uttering the note to Mr. Taylor, had you left any forged notes that you had bought of Nicholls at your lodgings - A Four.</p>
               <p>Q Four of that nineteen that you spoke of - A Yes. I left these four behind the mantle shelf in the crevice of the partition.</p>
               <p>Q I believe you, after you were in custody, directed somebody to that crevice to find these four notes - A I did, to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q You described to him the crevice where to find the four notes - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q to Westwood. Did you, from the direction of Alessi, go to his lodgings and find these four notes - A I did; these are the notes; I found them concealed in a crevice behind the mantle piece, wrapped up in brown paper.</p>
               <p>Q You found them readily by the decription that Alessi had given - A I did. There is four five pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q to Alessi. You are aware that you are acquitted of those charges that were against you - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. How long have you been in this country at this time - A About five months and a half.</p>
               <p>Q What, besides forged bank notes, have you been about this time - A I wait to go over to Holland to go into my own country.</p>
               <p>Q I did not ask you what you are waiting for - have you been about any other business besides forged bank notes - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Have you had forged notes from any other person besides the prisoner - A No.</p>
               <p>Q I do not ask you the name - do you mean to swear that you have not had dealings with another person resident at Birmingham - A Yes, I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q How long were you at Birmingham - A Seventeen days the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. By saying the first time, I presume you have been there more than once - A I have been there three times in all.</p>
               <p>Q How long were you there the second time - A. A day and a half.</p>
               <p>Q How long the third - A Half a day; I came back directly.</p>
               <p>Q On the business of forged bank notes - A Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q Only the second and third - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q You say you have not had any dealings with any other person for forged bank notes - do you mean to say that you have not given information of others for forged bank notes - A I did not receive bank notes from any other person but Nicholls. The first bank note that was shewn me was by another man.</p>

               <p>Q Had you dealings with that other man - A No.</p>
               <p>Q But you had conversation with another man on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110030"/>forged bank notes - A Yes, because he shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. As a matter to deal in, did he shew it you - A Yes; he asked me if I wanted to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q Then whether you had this note among others that you uttered to Mr. Taylor, or whether you had that note of the prisoner, or of the other person, we are to take upon your credit - you have no other person to shew it - A No.</p>
               <p>Q You were taken up upon uttering that note to Mr. Taylor, is it so or not - A I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q When were you taken up first - A On the night of the 25th of November, I believe, at Mr. Taylor's.</p>
               <p>Q Then if you were taken up at Mr. Taylor's, do not you know that you were taken up for uttering the note - A I went to Mr. Taylor's for two bottles of wine, I presented that note; they said it was a bad note.</p>
               <p>Q Did not you know that the very moment you were taken up, that you were taken up for uttering of it - A I knew I was taken up for that; they said it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q How long have you lived in England altogether - A I have been in England three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q Altogether how many years, about fifteen years - A No, it is fifteen years since I first came.</p>
               <p>Q Have you lived several years in England altogether - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Then you know you were taken up about giving the forged bank note to Mr. Taylor - A Yes; on the 25th of November.</p>
               <p>Q And from that time you were kept in custody till within this half hour - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Perhaps you then began to think you should be hanged - A I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q Now you must know, therefore you must tell - A I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q You cannot tell me what you thought - do you mean to state that upon your oath - A That is the last thing a man can be done to; I hope I should not be hung in this country.</p>
               <p>Q But as you were caught putting off a bad bank note you thought very likely you should - A I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q Do you man to say that you did not know that they hung men in this country for putting off bad notes - A I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q You swear that - A I swear that; I knew that people that forged bank notes they were condemned to die; but I did not knew that a person was to be hanged for passing them.</p>
               <p>Q Perhaps after you were taken up you were let into that secret, that they hang people for passing them - A No, I could not speak to any body, except a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>Q I suppose you spoke to the turnkeys - A No, I never spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Q No person spoke to you and told you that you were likely to be hanged - A I do not remember it; I did not ask any body.</p>
               <p>Q Then let me ask you whether you did not learn from any body that you were in danger of being hanged for putting off forged bank notes - A I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q From neither the gentleman of the bank, or them who took you up, or from the turnkeys, you cannot recollect being told that you were in danger of being hanged, or likely to be hanged - A I cannot say I recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q However you were determined not to be hanged if you could help it, so you desired to be a witness - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q Then did not you hope and believe that if you could catch Mr. Nicholls, or any body else, you should escape yourself - A I did not know any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q I dare say you did all this for the sake of public justice - A I do think I did; I did not know whether my life was in danger or no; but at the same time I did it for my own sake.</p>
               <p>Q That is, you hoped if you were in danger of the halter, you should escape by doing this - A Certainly, that is the general case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I know it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have told us that you never received any forged notes from any other man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever correspond with any other about forged notes - A. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q Never by letters, nor by the denomination of candlesticks, did you correspond with any body but the prisoner - A No.</p>
               <p>Q Who first made the proposition that you should buy forged bank notes of Nicholls - A Another man.</p>
               <p>Q In whose presence - A Nobody was present.</p>
               <p>Q Was that before you were acquainted with Nicholls - A Yes; I saw Nicholls that evening.</p>
               <p>Q You refused to buy the one the man offered you - A I did.</p>
               <p>Q When you saw Nicholls, tell us what passed - A I went to a public house to ask for a person who was clerk to some person at Birmingham, about seven or eight years; I met with the man that showed me the first note; I told the other man, that I had it in contemplation to go over to Spain, with some hardware goods; after this time the landlord and one man went out, this man stopped there; I had said before, I had been to one Johnson, a brass founder, to buy candlesticks with small figures; this man who offered me the forged one pound note, he said he could afford to sell candlesticks as cheap as any other man in England, he thought they would go in Spain; then he offered me dollars, which he said were more current in Spain; he said if they were liable to go in Spain he could serve me. Mr. Nicholls came, he said the other man said he would not come himself, but that he should come.</p>
               <p>COURT. You understood from Nicholls that the other man sent him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understood from Nicholls that the other man who had been talking about candlesticks had sent him - A Yes; Nicholls came and said he could not produce me a patent candlestick, but he shewed me a one pound note, and a two pound note; he said do you want to buy any thing of that sort; which I objected to buy at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the price - A. Yes; he said half a guinea for a one pound note; I told him that the other man said only six shillings; well, he said, if the other man said six shillings, if you have a mind to buy, you shall have them for that; I objected to buy them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q How soon did you see him again - A I do not remember, but I know I bought some three or four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110031"/>Q In about three or four days you had your first dealings with him - now attend to this question - upon the oath that you have taken, did you apply to him to sell you forged notes, or did he apply to you - A It was the other man that proposed to me.</p>
               <p>Q And then this man came to you - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean to swear to the court and jury that the prisoner proposed to sell to you and you to buy of him - A Yes, I can swear so.</p>
               <p>Q At that time you declined having them - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Was that from a principle of honesty or the fear of being found out - A I do not know.</p>
               <p>

            , they are officers also; I placed myself in a room that adjoins the club room.</p>
               <p>Q What sort of a partition is there - A A thin partition between that and the other room.</p>
               <p>Q Had you any means of seeing into this club room and what - A I had, through a small hole in the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q Did you make that hole expressly for the purpose - A I did; I bored a hole with a gimlet.</p>
               <p>Q How long had you been there before any body came - A From seven o'clock in the morning till half after three in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you recollect what day of the week it was - A No, I cannot recollect; I think it was Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You were there from seven o'clock in the morning till about half after three in the evening - did any person then come there and ask for Alessi - A Yes, the prisoner, Nicholls, came up into the room; I did not see him until he came into the club room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You had left Alessi in the club room by himself - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You had the means of seeing through the hole what passed - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q About half after three the prisoner came - A Yes, he came into the club room.</p>
               <p>Q What passed between Alessi and the prisoner in your sight, you looking through the hole - A They asked each other how they did.</p>
               <p>Q Had you previously agreed with Alessi upon any signal being given - A That he was to put on his hat when he ascertained that the person that was to come to him had got the forged notes about him. After Nicholls had taken off his coat he sat down by the fire opposite of Alessi; Alessi asked him when he arrived in town; he said he had just come to town; Alessi asked him how long he was going to remain in town; the prisoner said he was going out of town at seven o'clock that evening. They were drinking together, they had got rum and water, and after some other talk that did not seem to belong to this business, Alessi asked Nicholls for a pencil, which he gave him, and a piece of paper, upon which Alessi seemed as if he was casting up an account; when he had added it up he said, well Mr. Nicholls, you will take all my money this time; Nicholls said never mind, endeavour to get it back again in the way of business; at this time Alessi was reaching back for his hat, which lay behind him as he sat in the chair, and said to Mr. Nicholls it was very cold; Mr. Nicholls then said to him put on your hat, sir, which Alessi did immediately; I then immediately went into the room and took Nicholls into custody; I searched him, a pocket book I found on him, and a small brown paper parcel in his left hand close coat pocket; his pocket book was in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. That paper parcel was in his close coat pocket - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Was it in that paper that you hold in your hand - A It was; I wrote the date on it, I marked the contents and each separate note.</p>
               <p>Q Look over these notes and see whether these are all the notes - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Were all these notes marked by you, and were they in the parcel - A. They were; there is twenty five pound notes, twenty four one pound notes, and these are the four two pound notes, all marked by me, they were in the same parcel.</p>
               <p>Q Now look at that letter, is that letter marked by you - A Yes, it is; I found it in his pocket book, dated December 13th, 1808. I asked him how he came possessed of the notes, he said he had found the parcel in the street; I asked him if he meaned any street in town; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q Did he mention what street in town - A No; I did not ask him; he said yes, but did not mention the street; afterwards he said that some friend at Birmingham had given him the parcel and two letters to put into the post office, and he had two letters in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q Was the parcel directed to any body - A No; it was exactly the same as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q Did you understand him that the parcel as well as the letters were to be put in the post - A. No; it seemed to me as if he meaned the parcel had been given to him, and no account of the notes. The pocket book, I recollect, was in his right hand coat pocket, he had pulled his great coat off; in his left hand coat pocket were the letters.</p>
               <p>Q You before said the pocket book was in his great coat pocket - A Yes; but I recollect it was in his close coat pocket; I recollect he had pulled his great coat off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the first letter of Alessi's there is no direction to the letter but London, in the answer there is the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>COURT. I observed that. I want to know when it was the four notes were found.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTWOOD. I found the notes concealed in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110032"/>the mantle piece on the 10th of December, the same day the letter was directed to Nicholls.</p>

             lodge at your house - A He did.</p>
               <p>Q Look at the prisoner Nicholls, do you know him - A He was at my house twice; he came first to my house soon after Alessi came from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q How long before Alessi was taken up - A A week or a fortnight; I am not quite correct in that.</p>
               <p>Q When Nicholls first came to your house he was a stranger to you - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q Who did he enquire for - A For Alessi. I told him he was not at home, but it was likely that he would be in presently; he seemed to be at a loss what to do; he had the appearance of a traveller; there was a good room and a fire up stairs; I asked him to go up stairs and sit down.</p>
               <p>Q Was it Alessi's room - A No, the club room. I told him he might have lodgings in my house if he wanted; he continued in my house four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q Was Alessi and he much together during the time he remained there - A A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q You remember the circumstance of Alessi not coming home at the time he was taken in custody afterwards - A Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q Do you remember Mr. Westwood coming to your house - A Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q Was he shewn into Alessi's lodging room - A Not by himself.</p>
               <p>Q Did Mr. Westwood go into Alessi's lodging room - A He did, I was present; he did not find any thing the first time of his coming.</p>
               <p>Q Was it occupied by any body - A No, I kept it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q Were you there when Mr. Westwood was there a second time - A I was.</p>
               <p>Q The first time was immediately upon Alessi being taken up - A It was.</p>
               <p>Q In the course of some days he came again - did you see him find any brown paper with any thing in it - A I did; he found it behind the wooden mantle shelf in a little crevice; he looked behind; there he found a little brown paper parcel; it contained four five pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q From the time of Alessi being detained, and to the time that the bank notes were found, had you kept it locked up - A Yes; no person was in the room but myself; I always kept the key, and my wife at times when I went out; I asked her particularly about it.</p>
               <p>Q Some time after this Alessi was brought there by the officers of the police - A He was.</p>
               <p>Q Did they go with him into one of the divisions of the club room - A They did; they went into the farther part of it, it is partitioned off.</p>
               <p>Q Were you at home when the prisoner Nicholls came - A I was, I waited at home on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q You were apprised of the object of their visit - A Of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q How long after the officers and Alessi came, did the prisoner come - A The officers came at seven o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner Nicholls did not come till about three in the afternoon, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q Who did he ask for - A Alessi. Upon Nicholls' coming Alessi was permitted to go into the other room by himself, and Mr. Nicholls was shewed up to him; I shewed him up myself, and then went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q You know no more of it till after he was taken in custody - A I know the officers were watching him; I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>Q You have no doubt that this is the person that came to your house both times - A I am quite convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Is your wife here - A She is not here.</p>
               <p>Q She had the key sometimes - A When I went out, twice, I left the key in the drawer, and told her where it was.</p>
               <p>Q You told us just now that your wife had the key - A She knew where it was.</p>
               <p>Q She could get access to it if she wanted it - A She never wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q Then if she pleased she might have given it to any other person - you keep a common lodging house - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q In the course of a year you have many people like travellers coming into your house - A Yes.</p>

            . Q You are an inspector of the bank notes, employed by the governor and company of the bank of England - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q I am now going to put in your hand the first note, the note uttered by Alessi to Mrs. Taylor, look at that note and tell me whether that is a note of the governor and company of the bank of England - A It is not; it is a forgery; it is not the cashier's name, it is altogether a forgery. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q We are now going to prove the note that was uttered by Mrs. Meredith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. The prisoner said he did not recollect any thing of that transaction.</p>
               <p>Q Look at that note, is that a forgery - A It is in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q These are the four what was found in the crevice in Alessi's lodging, are they a forgery - A The whole are a forgery; the signature and filling up, the paper, and all, are a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q Now I am going to put in your hand the twenty five-pound notes found upon the prisoner - A I have seen them before, they are all forgeries in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q Now look at those twenty four ones - A They are forged, and the four two pound notes they are forged likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Look at the one stated in the indictment and compare it with the hand writing of all the other five pound notes - I will ask you whether it appears to you that they are filled up with one hand writing, and whether they are from the same plate - A I have not a doubt of it; I have examined them before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you speaking of the twenty five pound notes, or the notes in question - A All the five pound notes appears to be filled up by the same hand writing, together with the note in question, and they are all of the same date, the 8th of April, excepting one which is only as it came from the plate; it has no writing at all.</p>

               <p>Q Does the bank in any possible instance part with any of their paper - A I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever know of the bank parting with any impression of their plates that is not filled up with current notes - A Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The first note which has been shewn to you, which we call Taylor's note, and the four compared by you with the twenty five pound notes, or more correctly with the nineteen - they appear to be struck from the same plate - A Undoubtedly, and they are all filled up by the same hand.</p>
               <p>Q The imperfect one is from the same plate - A Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q The same observations applies to Meredith's, as Taylor's, they are all the same date - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q I believe in the course of numbering bank notes the usual method is to put them up in fifty - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q So that to illustrate it, if the first of the fifty should be 1000 they would go on to 1050 - A Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q That is the method of banking houses, and banking houses are supplied so, from the first to fifty and at last to four hundred - they never issue the same number of the same date - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q For instance you never have two of this day of the same number - A Never.</p>
               <p>Q The note in the indictment is No. 7484, Taylors, note; 7489 Meredith's; those found in Alessi's room 7486, and found upon the prisoner's person 7634.</p>
               <p>MR. TERRY. Q You are engraver to the bank of England - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q I first shew you Taylor's note, is that a genuine bank note or altogether a forgery - A Altogether a forgery, plate and every thing.</p>
               <p>Q I now shew you Meredith's, do you give the same account of that - A This is forged also.</p>
               <p>Q I now shew you the four found in the crevice by Mr. Westwood - A I have seen them before, they are all forgeries; the twenty five pound notes, nineteen filled up and one blank, they are all forgeries; they appear to be all struck from the same plate; I have not the least doubt of it; it is impossible that it should be otherwise; there are defects that were not intentionally put in, and that exactly agress in every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q Therefore you speak with certainty - A I do.</p>

When Pobjoy went out I continued shewing them different kind of shawls; when they came in the shop there were a large quantity of prints laying on the counter; I took them all away to another counter excepting eight pieces, I counted them. When Pobjoy came in I gave them up to him; they stood bargaining for a shawl, bought nothing, and went out; Pobjoy and the constable followed them; they brought them back in the shop and this piece of print was picked up off the floor. I counted the pieces on the counter and there were only seven.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner in your shop - A. Yes, on Monday evening the 5th of last month, about half after five in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come in alone - A. There was another person with him; he asked for half a pound of candles, two pennyworth of wafers, and two pennyworth of wax taper. I served him with these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay in the shop, or had you occasion to go out of the shop - A I had occasion to go out of the shop into the back room for a pair of scissars to cut the wax taper for the prisoner; when I came back he paid me and he went away; he went out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the shop - A. No; there were other other people in the shop; I was engaged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing soon after they were out of the shop - A. Yes; in a minute I missed a box of soap, three quarters of a hundred weight; it was standing within the shop, about a yard and a half from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that box before - A. About a minute before; when I missed the box of soap I immediately run out of the door and pursued him; I overtook the prisoner about twelve or fifteen yards from my door, in the street; he had the box of soap on his shoulder; I did not see the other with him; I laid hold of him by the collar, I told him he had robbed me; he swore at me a good deal, he would not lower the soap off his shoulder; I immediately called out stop thief; he smacked it off his shoulder as fast as he could, and began to run away off the pavement; I had hold of the tail of his coat at the same time; I had help; we brought him back. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he is the man that you served with the articles in your shop - A. I am quite sure of that; one of the articles, the candles, I served him the other man took; he was searched in the watchhouse. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took up the box did you examine it - A. Yes, after I had brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark by which you know it to be yours - A. Only by the mark on the box.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of the soap - A. It cost me eighty eight seillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. Did you see them go out of the shop together - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out of the shop at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell us you saw them go out together - A. They left me when I had done serving them. I was engaged.</p>
               <p>COURT. He said they went out together, but he did not see them.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. It looks like the same, it is the same quantity that he bought, and the same colour; the paper is the same that I wrapt it up in. This is the box that had the soap in; there was eighty three pound and a half in it; it cost me eighty eight shillings. I weighed the soap three hours previous to his taking it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been as far as Leicester fields; on my return home I come into Holley street, and as soon as I came into Clement's passage I heard the cry of stop thief; a man dropped a bit of paper containing this wax taper; I picked up and I looked to see which way he was gone; the gentleman came up to me and said you are the man that came into the shop door and took the box of soap; he took the box of soap, he took me back to his shop, and when I got into the shop, he said do you think you are innocent, or that you are not; I said I am as innocent as you are, take me before a magistrate. I was taken to the watch-house; this man came in and said I will take you out of here; he took me to the office.</p>

Yes; I made a full stop to look at him; he asked me to help him up with it; I did, and went on, and the prisoner went on; I suspected he did not come honestly by it.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Laycock, he is a cow keeper and farmer. On the 10th of last month, about two in the morning, I and my fellow servant met the prisoner in a field called Eleven Acre, belonging to Mr. Laycock, in a field where there were sheep. We have lost a great many sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Broad's - A. About a quarter of a mile; I was about thirty yards from him, I called out who is there; he said a gentleman; I said gentle or simple, I shall see who you are; I said where are you going, my friend; he said to Hornsey; I said that is not the way to Hornsey, he said he had lost his way: I said it is very odd you should come into this field among the sheep. There was no foot path in the field, only a dirty way where our carts were kept. He said he wanted to go by Ball's pond to miss the watchmen. I took him in custody and took him to Mr. Laycock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the road near the field - A. Yes, within a field. He begged us not to take him to Mr. Laycock, he said he would give us a guinea, or twenty pound, sooner than we should take him to the watchhouse, or to Mr. Laycock's, he said he was a very troublesome severe man, he said if he had known that we should have taken him he would have given us a run for it; I told him if he went nigh a hedge, we should have sent something in him that he was not aware of.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he from the hedge at the time you stopped him - A. Twenty five yards from the ditch, and three or four yards from a pond. I found the lead by the cart track.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you found the lead - A. It was day light when we found the lead; it was some pipe lead and some ridge lead; Mr. Broad saw the lead. We found some lead in a bag.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Broad to put up this lead spout on the the 2nd or 3rd of December. On Saturday the 10th the lead had been taken away; on Sunday morning following I went to the house; I saw it was gone on the 11th; I saw it at the magistrates; I put it up myself, I made it myself; it is the same lead.</p>

On the day laid in the indictment I was in the housekeeper's room with the prisoner; the hall bell rang; Mrs. Megan, the housekeeper, went and opened the door, and left the door open; she returned through the room where I was sitting into the adjoining room, and said a poor girl has left her basket here; on my hearing a poor girl was at the door, I ran to the door in great haste, saying, if she is a poor girl I will give her something. At my coming to the door I was much surprised to find instead of a poor girl a friend of Mrs. Megan's of the name of Fitzgerald; I then said, oh dear, Mrs. Fitzgerald, if it is you, why did you ring, you need not be afraid of me, you had seen me this day week; this was in the evening between six and seven. Mrs. Fitzgerald came in with me immediately into the housekeeper's room; the prisoner then met us without a basket, and we all came into the sitting room together, and sat down for a minute or two; on coming into the housekeeper's room, the bed room door exactly opposite was wide open; the basket stood full of something in her bed room; it was a mat basket; after sitting a minute or two, struck with suspicion, I got up, saying I should go and see whether a dress was ready for my mistress, but in reality run down stairs and called Burrows, a man servant. I went to my master and made him acquainted with it.</p>

I opened the basket by my master's order; I found in it a china bowl and cover, a china dish or bowl, and a china chocolate cup, a blue and white mug, and a hand lanthorn; I left them there. Mrs. Megan was sent for into the dining room; I saw her go in; I saw nothing more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is the housekeeper's room on the same floor with the hall, and near the door - A. Yes; and the housekeeper's bed room is near her sitting room.</p>

Burrows took out the articles; at the top of the basket was a bed tick; immediately after that there were the china, with paper put inside of them, and wrapped round with paper on the out; upon their being produced, Mrs. Adams said I will immediately swear to their being my property; the first thing I ordered was for the street door to be locked; then I sent for the prisoner to come up; I then asked her what she meaned by presuming to carry them things out of my house; she said, oh, they are some little things of my own. I then pointed to the things which stood upon the harpsichord, I said do you mean to tell me that these are your property; she said oh no, certainly not, sir, I put them in by mistake for things of my own; I believe, I then made use of a strong expression - do you know there are things in that basket for which you may be hanged; she said, oh no, she hoped not; I then said, you were to have left me in two or three days, I now tell you you shall not stay half an hour in my house. I then told her to take what necessaries she wanted for the night, and to leave my house immediately and to give up the keys; she then went down stairs. I almost immediately ran down to her in the housekeeper's room, there I found Mrs. Fitzgerald. I asked Mrs. Fitzgerald, in the presence of the prisoner, how she could presume to take any thing out of my house; she said she did not know they were mine. Mrs. Megan had told her they were her's, and desired her to take them home. I then said I could not contradict the assertion, as I had never seen her face before; I desired her immediately to walk out of my house; she immediately left my house, and the prisoner in about half an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you make any application to have her taken up - A. In the course of the next day; we looked about us, and she was taken to Marlborough street and committed. I have had the care of the things ever since.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told us you asked Fitzgerald how she could presume to take any thing out of your house, her answer was she did not know that they belonged to you - I want to know whether Megan said any thing - A No, I think not.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             go away from the premises with something in his hand; it appeared to me to be part of a leaden pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your master had on his premises any thing in the shape of a leaden pipe - A. Yes; I had it in my hand not ten minutes before; I followed and overtook the prisoner in Brick lane; I saw him crossing the way with two pieces of lead, one in his hand and the other under his arm; he went into an old iron shop; I went to him and told him to bring the lead back; the prisoner was in conversation with a woman in the shop; the prisoner with persuasion brought the lead back to my master; one piece of lead was on the shop counter and the other in his hand; I was not two minutes after him in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had not disposed of it - A. He had not; he brought it back to my master's premises: then I fetched an officer.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Worship street office - A. I am. On the 20th of December, about a quarter before seven in the evening, I was out on patrol duty in company with Crosswell and Valentine, and going up Hackney road we met the prisoner, he was coming towards London, he had a bag on his shoulder; I asked him what he had there; he said they were his tools and a bit of lead; I examined the bag, I found it contained nothing but lead and a bit of iron, a kind of an hold fast for a window.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the weight of the lead - A. I suppose about twenty pound or upwards. I asked him where he brought it from; he said from Mourning lane, Hackney, it belonged to a man of the name of Barnes, that worked for a bricklayer, and he was carrying it to a plumber's in Shoreditch by Barnes's order; he could not tell the plumber's name. When we got him down to the office he said what he told me before was all lies; he said he was coming out of Thomas's square, in Hackney, opposite the Nag's Head in Mare street, a young man overtook him and asked him to carry the bag as far as Shoreditch; what was in it he did not know. He was committed that night. The next day I went to Hackney, there I found Mr. Brown instead of Mr. Barnes; I saw the plumber fit it to the top of the house; it fitted exactly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the matter; I took the lead to carry for the person, as I was coming home; I never saw that person but that evening; he asked me to bring it on the road for him and he would give me a pot of beer. As I was returning home I met these gentlemen; they detained me with it.</p>

On the parlour door I found that the box of the lock, the screws, had been drawn to enable them to open the door without unlocking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person had got in that way - A. Yes. I found the lock of the till had been picked, as I supposed; I left it locked; upon examining the till I found that half a guinea that was marked was gone, three shillings in silver, all marked, were gone, seven penny pieces, and two halfpence were gone. About eight o'clock the prisoner came down; I fetched the officer; at seven o'clock the prisoner came into my bakehouse to get a light, and then she went into her own kitchen. Wood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110040"/>the officer, at that time was in the area, I told him she was gone into the kitchen; he went into the kitchen after her, he searched her, he produced half a guinea; I believed she gave up the silver. I saw the mark on the half guinea that I had put on it the over night. He searched her box up stairs and found the copper pieces that I had lost; all the money I had marked the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any key - A. Yes, one that opened my till, and the other opened my tea caddy; I had lost them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being discovered what did the prisoner say - A. She said it was the first time, and she hoped I would forgive her; I told her it was not the first time. I told the officer to take her away.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 9th of November I went to Mr. Jennings' house; the prisoner came down about eight o'clock; I followed her into the kitchen, told her what Mr. Jennings suspected her of, and said I must search her; upon searching her I found half a guinea, marked with a cross on the head side; I shewed it to Mr. Jennings, he recollected it; I found three shillings on her, all marked with a cross; I found the key of her box upon her person; I searched her box; I found five penny pieces marked with a 2, and two halfpence marked with a figure of 6; Mr. Jennings claimed them all. In her box I found two keys that Mr. Jennings claimed - one the key of his till, and the other the key of his tea caddy. The prisoner went down upon her knees, and begged for mercy very hard, she said she had done it last night, it was the first time. - Through a mistake last session I put the money into my pocket; the marks are worn out.</p>
               <p>Q. That it is very incautious conduct - A. It is, my lord; I can assure you it was not done wilfully.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you secure your door and windows - A. This was about six o'clock in the morning; we all got up together, the prisoner, I, and two more lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money in the house - A. I had eight guineas belonging to myself, and seven guineas and fourteen shillings belonging to my three lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money belonging to this man - A. Not above two or three shillings when his way was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep this money - A. In a box by the bed side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep in the same room with you - A. No, in the next room, on the same floor; we had separate doors.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your door fastened when you went to bed - A. It fastens with a latch; sometimes I fasten it and sometimes I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before this had you seen this quantity of money of your's - A. I had seen it in the evening before; I went to the box to get money at five o'clock, it was safe then; when I went to bed I took my shirt out to put on in the morning, it was safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body sleep in the same room with you - A. My wife and little child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked - A. I think it was, I am not certain. This prisoner, my wife, and I, went to mass at six o'clock in the morning to Duke street, Lincoln's inn fields.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know that you had lost the money - A. I was sure that I had not lost the money. When I went out to mass the prisoner went as far as Lincoln's inn fields with me, then he left me; it seemed to me as if he stopped to draw water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at chapel - A. No; I went home a little after seven, I found the door wide open, and the box removed from the place where it had been; there was not a farthing of money in the box; somebody had removed it from the bed side to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner had been back to the house - A. I did not see him till nine o'clock. There was one man remained in the house all the time; his name was Macdaniel.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that the money was in the box when you went to mass - A. I really believe it was. I suspected Macdaniel then, because I had left him in the house; I sent for an officer, Wensley came, he searched Macdaniel and found nothing on him; I heard the prisoner was drinking; I went to the public house to him; I saw he was getting drunk; I give a dinner to my lodgers, it is customary on Christmas day, I brought him home to his dinner; after he had ate his dinner I sent for Wensley, he came and searched him, he found nothing but sixpence farthing in copper on him; we let him go. At night he came in dead drunk, and throwed his clothes on the middle of the floor; I got up in the morning, I took hold of his coat, I found it weighty; when he got up I said John, I suspect you have not been at work to get money; he said he would go to his brother; he ran down stairs, I ran after him and threw him down; I said he should not go. He threw a letter on the ground as he was running away, I picked it up; I caught hold of him by the handkerchief, I found there were money there; I took him to Wensley's house; he took the handkerchief off and found two guineas and a half. The prisoner took the handkerchief off and put the money in his pocket in spite of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how much money he took out of the handkerchief at that time - A. No; when the constable got up he searched him, he found two guineas and a half in gold, two shillings, and some halfpence; he said it should be decided by the law, he would make us all sorry for robbing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose none of the money that you had in your trunk was marked - A. No; but the half guinea I think I should know, it was crooked on the harp side.</p>
               <p>Q. That is common - A. It is. I knew the letter that he threw down; that was in my box, with two guineas and a half in it, the night before; I have the letter here, it was addressed to me, it came to me from Ireland.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not come down till the man had taken off his neckloth - A. No; he was struggling to get away from the prosecutor; when I came down on searching him, I found in his breeches pocket two guineas and a half in gold, and two shillings in copper in his waistcoat pocket; I observed to the prosecutor that there was a crooked half guinea; the prisoner said it was his own, and threatened us with law for taking his money from him; the prosecutor afterwards delivered me this letter; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

On Wednesday the 4th of this month, between five and six at night, I saw the prisoner at my window; I saw him lift my shop window open; I was standing behind a screen that parts the shop and the sitting room; he put his hand in and took a silk umbrella from the inside of the window. that was there for sale; when he opened the window a board tell out, it had on it, lodgings for single men; I went out of doors after him into the highway, I could see nothing of him; the next morning I went to Shadwell office and described the man; he had lodged with me; he left his lodgings ever since the 8th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he and you differed about something - A. I never spoke to him after I was married to the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find men for ships - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. They are called crimps - you know the prisoner was a seafaring man - A. He is so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lodge in the house - A. Two years; he never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married to this woman - A. About three months on the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner left your house by your account on the 8th of October - that is just a week after you was married to this woman - when did you take him up - A. On the 7th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your umbrella - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you saw him so plain he could see you, you had lights in the shop I presume - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could see you - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you prevent him from taking it when he opened the window - A. If I had gone out he would not have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought of the forty pounds - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a seller of fish. On the 5th of December, between twelve and one, I was coming up Church fields, Walthamstow, I met Mr. Rawlins; he asked me whether I saw three men; I told him no; he told me they had robbed him; he gave me a description of them. When I came to Clapton, in the Back lane, I saw three men that answered the description; one of them had a bag under his arm, and a bit of bed sacking hanging out of the bag; I catched hold of him by the collar, I asked him what he had got there; he said nothing that belonged to me, and chucked the bag down to Smith; he said to him, that is not my bag, it is your's; he hit me on the breast and wrenched himself out of my hands; when I found he was gone up the Back lane I went to Smith and said if he is gone you shall not go. Russell went on, a gentleman on horseback went after him and stopped him; they got a constable and took them in custody, and I went to Walthamstow to let the prosecutor know.</p>

               <p>Q. Was eighty seven quartern loaves the quantity that there should be - A. Ninety one I put in myself. I am quite sure of it, it is always a regular quantity. I asked him whether they were all up; he said they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for the remaining four - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There have been a number of loaves sold out at that private door; Mr. Chew knows that he served a woman in the house, and that he cannot deny.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never knew in my life that a loaf went out that way.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . Q. Your bakehouse is down stairs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have two doors to your bakehouse - A. Yes, one door goes into the street and the other to the internal part of the house; when we are not there we usually keep it shut. I knew the prisoner was robbing me; I did business as well as ever I did it, I found myself deficient very much; I went to Marlborough street and got an officer to come to my house. About two o'clock in the afternoon, on the 29th of December, I cut a hole in the bakehouse door to watch the prisoner, I saw him take his hat from one side of the bakehouse to the other, he turned his handkerchief on his hat and laid in two shovels of flour; he laid the corners of the handkerchief on the flour, he put the hat on his head, he went out of the bakehouse from the area steps; I went up the area steps.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he put in - A. I suppose as much as he did when the officer stopped him, four pound all but an ounce. I saw him go into the highway; when he was crossing the road I said Thomas, there is a cake belonging to Mr. Smith of Marylebone lane, perhaps he may want it; he said I am only going over the way, I will be back in five minutes; he came back in five minutes. I went down stairs, and just as I got to the bakehouse he put his handkerchief on his hat and put in two shovels full as before, doubled the corners, put the hat on, and took the cake with him; he went up the area steps and went out; he returned in about an hour. When he came back it got dark, so that he could not see without a candle; when he came to the shop door I said Thomas, you will not be able to see without a candle; he went down stairs, I went to the door where I had been before, I saw him wash his arms; I went up stairs, I stood in the shop; he said sir, the door is fastened; I said it is, there is a fresh batch of flour, I put a padlock on the door; I said I will come down and stop while you fill the copper; he said no, I will come up the same way and lock the door; I went up stairs, I saw the prisoner through a crack up stairs; he took a candle; I could see in the middle part of the bakehouse, I saw the hat in his hand, I had looked in the hat when I went down stairs for him to fill the copper, it had nothing in it then; I saw him take the hat across the bakehouse when I was in the sitting room. He after that came up stairs and said, here is a strange key of the bakehouse, I found it in the cellar; the officer seized him; he found in his hat the flour that is now here; there was four pound all but one ounce.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think there was as much upon a former occasion as there was then in the hat - A. Yes; much about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The two former quantities of flour you could not ascertain the weight - A. No; there were two shovels full; I think two shovels full to be four pound almost.</p>

In a loft above the prisoner's room the officers found the articles specified in the indictment; the boards I knew by having my chalk mark on them, and the nails and the iron plates are such as we use in our business. The prisoner, upon the officer producing them, said they were mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards leave him alone in the bar - A. Yes; I heard the halfpence rattle while I was in the bar; I have a tame jack daw about the bar, I supposed it was him at first; I was in hopes that it was, but to convince myself I put him in the cage; after that I heard him rattle the halfpence; there was nobody else in the bar at that time; I made believe to go into the tap room, but I did not go, I opened the door and let it go so, then I looked over the bar: the basket containing five poundsworth of copper, which I had counted up that day for the purpose of payment, was behind him on the ground; I saw him stoop twice, and I heard the halfpence rattle at the same time; he was sitting in a chair close to the basket; I saw his hand in the basket; the third time he was stooping I went round and catched him; when I seized him he dropped the halfpence from his hand on the ground; I said good God, Scott, what are you about; he said he did not know, he seemed confused; he then said he had like to have fell down; I said you shall not sit there any longer, I moved the chair; he said I know you are wrong; I said I was sure I was right, and put the basket on the table and began to count the halfpence; he said you have no occasion to do that, you cannot tell; then I said I insist upon you giving me the money that you have taken out; he put his hands into the flap of his small clothes and pulled out two handfulls; I counted them, I found I was deficient; when I first counted the copper I was deficient in three shillings of my five pounds; I made him untie the knees of his breeches; he shook out sevenpence halfpenny, that made up the three shillings; I asked him how he came to do it; he said he was mad or the devil must be in him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of these two lads - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner step into Mr. Chalkley's shop and take a piece of carpeting; I seized hold of him about five or six yards from the place where he first laid hold of it; the other ran away; I asked him what he was going to do with the carpetting; he said he was only going to look at it; he dropped it down when I laid hold of him; I picked it up and took him back to the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any casks of rum on board - A. Yes; I knew Witsch six years; I asked them if they did not know me; Stratton answered he knew me very well; upon this I left the lighter and bid him good night. It was a moon light night but very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sufficiently light from the moon for you to see at some distance - A. Yes; after I had quitted the lighter Pearce and I went behind some paling and secreted ourselves there, where we could see very plain what was doing on the forecastle of the lighter; we had not been watching there ten minutes before I saw Witsch come up from the forescuttle, he handed something to Stratton; Stratton immediately came on shore, he went over the lock gates and walked towards Lime-house; I followed immediately and overtook him, I took him by the collar and told him I must search him, that I suspected he had got something about him that was not legal: upon that he opened his great coat pocket, took out a bladder from his left side and threw it in the bason; I told him he had throwed a bladder in the bason; he said he had not, he insisted upon me letting him go; I told him I would not; he put his foot across and attempted to throw me in the bason; I drew a pistol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110048"/>and told him I would shoot him if he made any resistance; Pearce came up; we gave him in charge of the centinel.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did this take place from the lighter - A. I suppose about thirty yards. After I had put him in custody I saw Witsch come aft, go down below, bring something up and throw it overboard; I took a boat and a light and searched that part of the bason where Stratton had thrown the bladder in; I there found a bladder containing a gallon and a half of rum; this is part of it. I went on board the lighter, there was a great many puncheons of rum on board the lighter; I found a spile in one of the puncheons, the spile was sticking out seven staves from the bung hole; we afterwards took Stratton and Witsch to the round house; Stratton was very earnest for me to let him go; he wished me to keep the rum and to say nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 31st of December were you on duty with the last witness - A. Yes. A few minutes after ten in the evening I heard a noise on board the lighter, the Three Brothers, No. 443, the owners names were Drinkall and sons. George, my brother officer, went on board and stood on the foresheets, I remained on the key; the lighter touched the shore; I knew Witsch before, he was a servant of Drinkall and sons; George asked him if he had been bleeding any of them; Witsch answered, d - n you, no;

             the officer then came on shore, we left the lighter and secreted ourselves behind an iron gate, commanding a view of the lighter; we looked through the railing, in a few minutes I saw Stratton come over on the lock gates; George ran from me and stopped Stratton, I heard something fall into the water after he had seized Stratton; when I went to George's assistance Witsch went from the fore sheets of the lighter to the stern sheet, went down below, and came up again immediately, he leaned over the quarter of the lighter, near the stern, but I did not see him heave any thing over board.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able from the situation he was in to lay any thing on the surface of the water - A. Yes; he then went and learned on the pump; I went and searched Witsch, I found only a knife on him; I brought him on shore and gave him in charge of the centinel. I saw George pick up a bladder that was floating on the north side of the bason; we searched the lighter and found a spile in the quarter of a puncheon, sticking out seven staves from the bung hole. As we were taking the prisoners to the watchhouse Stratton told us we knew such things were done, we had no cause to make it so bad without we liked; he wanted for us to take the bladder and let them go; that is all that past. Witsch said nothing, he behaved very well.</p>

            . I am as excise guager of the port of London.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 2nd of January did you examine a puncheon of rum, No. 39 - A. I did; I observed a spile in the quarter, seven staves from the bung hole; there would have been no spile put there except there had been a worm hole, and this cask appeared to me to be sound by the guage; I found it had lost the key allowance, from a gallon to a gallon and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find the full contents of No. 39 - A. One hundred and thirty two gallons was what the cask was capable of holding; in it was one hundred and twenty five gallons; that is giving no tenth to the trader; if you give the tenth to the trader it should have another gallon. I guaged No. 30; I found it fifteen gallons deficient.</p>

On the 5th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Elliott and Gill came in my shop and asked to look at some muslin; my shopman shewed them some; they bought a nail of muslin.

She went away directly I laid hold of Gill; Gill was taken to the watchhouse, and while the officer was searching her Elliott came in; then she was taken in custody.

In the evening the prisoner came home and went to bed; I then charged him; he declared his innocence. In the morning the prisoner confessed that he had taken it out of the box and sold it to a pawnbroker for five shillings. I got up, put him in the charge of an officer. I found the diamond at Mr. Pearson's, where he had sold it.</p>

            . I am a newsman. Passing by the premises of Mr. Freemantle, I observed Coleby take a piece of iron, it was laying about a yard and a half from the door in the street, it was just cast to appearance, it lay there to cool; the foreman was coming out of the shop when the girls had turned the corner; I told him, and he pursued them; the iron was given into my possession.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the employ of Mr. Passingham. On Thursday the 22nd of December, I went to thrash in the barn, I found it had been robbed; there was a hole in the heap of oats I had left on the Wednesday evening, that made me know there were some gone; there were some beans scattered among the oats, there was a great hole in the heap and the heap was diminished; on Friday I found a lark in the heap.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how West was employed at that time - A. I know he used to catch larks; I do not know what he was doing then; I locked the bar on the preceding evening and I found it locked on the Thursday morning.</p>

            . Q. On the Thursday morning in consequence of information from the last witness you went to your barn - A. On the Friday morning I observed there were a great many oats scattered about the barn; there had been a large fall of snow on the Thursday, where they were shed, from the barn door to the prisoners house door; there were oats scattered all the way to the prisoner's door; I got a warrant from Mr. Fraser the magistrate; we searched the prisoner's house; the children were at home, the woman was gone to sell the larks that had been catched the day before; I found a good deal of corn under the bed in tubs, some tick beans and barley; some cleaned and some not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any barley - A. Not as I know of; we found some oats scattered under the bed; we found no oats in the house that I was looking for; we found oats in the poultry house, in an old bran sack; they are my oats and I will swear to them; we took a sample from the barn to the magistrate and compared them there.</p>
               <p>COURT. You might as well have produced a sample to the jury, as well as to the magistrate - A. I have not brought a sample here from the barn; I am sure they are my oats.</p>
               <p>Q. We can best judge of that by the sample from the barn with the oats here - A. The beans that were in the barn are among them; they are tick beans; there were tick beans among them in the barn, and there are tick beans with these.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you know that the prisoner was a lark catching - A. He was; his wife was gone to sell them he had catched the day before. After the prisoner was apprehended I took him before a magistrate; as we were going along he said he hoped I should not hurt him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Now be correct - A. I said what shall I hurt you for, you said they were not my oats; he did say that when he first came into the house; we went into Mr. Fraser's, into the hall; the magistrate said West, I am sorry to see you here upon such an occasion; he asked him how he came to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the magistrate say you had better tell us how you came to do it - A. No; he said if he had not been drunk he should not have done it, he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Do you, Mr. Passingham, looking at them oats, believe them to be yours - A. Certainly; there are two bushels half cleaned, about five shillings value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when he took them - A. He acknowledged before Mr. Fraser that it was eleven o'clock at night when he took them, and that he got up between the barn door and the barn rack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nothing of this sort was taken in writing - A. Nothing taken in writing while I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Mr. Fraser's, Mr. Fraser never took pen or paper in his hands - A. No, not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the magistrate what was your charge against him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the magistrate - A. I told him that my man told me that my barn was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man tell you that the barn was broken open - A. No, he told me that somebody had entered the barn door; the door was fast when he left it and when he came there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the magistrate in the hearing of the prisoner - A. I charged him with stealing the oats, my barn was robbed and I found the oats on his premises: after I said this the high constable was examined; the prisoner confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the prisoner confessed, it is a short receipt - was that the next thing that followed - did not the magistrate tell him it would be much better for him to give an account of it - A. The magistrate said if he did not steal the corn he had bought it under the value; he gave him an hour to go to the public house, and if he would own who he bought it of, it would be the better for him; that was not my corn. This is my corn.</p>
               <p>Q. I know that is the corn you claim - what was the question the magistrate asked him - A. How he came by the oats and beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not he tell him it would be better for him to tell him how he came by it, and he would give him an hour - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me the magistrate said he had better tell, and he would give him an hour to go to the public house - what did the magistrate say to the prisoner, before he said any thing - A. He asked him how he came by the corn; the prisoner said he had not stole the corn from me, he had bought it of somebody else under the value.</p>
               <p>Q. And this you call a confession - was the prisoner sent back to the public house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before he got to the public house - A. He got in between the rack and the barn door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the magistrate told him before that it would be better for him to give an account of it - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you found the oats was the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110051"/>apprehended - A. In the course of an hour or two. I saw him at his own cottage afterwards; the prisoner there said he came by them honestly. We went to Mr. Fraser's into the hall; Mr. Fraser came to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Fraser wrote any thing down - A. I do not think he did. Mr. Passingham told Mr. Fraser that he had found the oats, and that he was ready to swear that they were his property; he told me he was ready to swear they were his property; he told him he had found them in an outhouse at the back of the prisoner's cottage; Mr. Fraser said he was sorry to see him in that situation - West, how did you come by them; he said, sir, I will tell you the truth; I got up between the barn door and the rack and got in; I was drunk or else I should not have done it.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Passingham. I went with Mr. Passingham to his barn door, I saw a quantity of oats laying at the barn door; we traced these oats from the barn door all the way on the snow to the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>COURT On the Friday - A. Yes; the 23rd. I found no oats beyond the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find any beans among the oats in the track - A. Yes; one at the door. I saw the oats brought out of the fowl house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Is there the same proportion of beans among them as with those in the barn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you can form your judgment are they of the same description - A. Yes; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. That question is not worth while asking, if they would not bring a sample from the heap in the barn for the jury to tell for themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any sample from the heap in your master's barn to compare that sack of oats with, would you venture to swear they are the same - A. No.</p>

On the 3d of December, between seven and eight o'clock, from the information of some boys, I overtook the prisoner with a cheese under his arm in Harper street; I pursued him to Boswell court; he dropped the cheese in Harper street.</p>

I saw him have the cheese, that was when I first saw him; when I laid hold of him I told him he had stole a cheese; he said nothing. The officer has had the cheese ever since; it weighed about eighteen pounds.</p>

            . I was standing nearly opposite of Mr. Taylor's door, I saw the prisoner go in Mr. Taylor's shop first, take something out of the shop, I think it was a piece of cheese, he came out and gave what he had taken from the shop to another one; there were three standing at the door while he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw him take something from the shop - A. I am quite sure, and he handed something to one of the other three. The prisoner went into the shop again and took a whole cheese; then Sealy and two more went down Theobald's road, the other ran up Red Lion square, shaking his head at Smith, another boy, and me, we were standing together; we went and told Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor came with us and we shewed him the men; I saw him overtake the prisoner; the prisoner dropped the cheese in Harper street; I saw him drop it.</p>

             - A. I left the other prisoner when he was going to Hanway yard; I then saw Stone with two empty pails on his shoulder; I followed him to the back part of our premises, where the yeast was kept; he did not come on the premises, he merely deposited a pail on the premises where the yeast was kept, I believe; I did not stop to see; I went round to the front and concealed myself. In about twenty minutes I saw two of our servants fill a stand with yeast and heave it up to the loading place. I then saw our two men look very anxiously about them, and heard a signal given, when the loading place gates were opened sufficient to admit the body of a man; an empty pail was brought in by one of our servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner all this time - A. Walking outside of the premises. This pail was filled with yeast, and was then taken out and placed on the head of Stone; the other pail was outside of the gates. I immediately rushed from my hiding place, and took the prisoner Stone in custody; he requested me not to detain him, he would tell me where he lived if I would let him go; he said he paid our tunman for the yeast; the tunman immediately absconded, and has not been heard of since.</p>
               <p>JURY. You know it is not uncommon for bakers, or any body else, to go to the tunmen and get a quantity of yeast without the knowledge of the owners - A. Not at our house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I will trouble you with a question or two - whereabouts is the value o A. I fancy ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. For one pail of yeast! it must be a very large pail - you are first clerk to a very important concern - with respect of yeast are you competent to form a judgment what the value of a pail of yeast is - A. I do not precisely know it.</p>

            . Q. You are the chief brewer - do you know this Stone - A. I think I recollect him when I come to look at him - he said he paid three shillings for the yeast to one of the tunmen who is run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was in the habit of coming to one of your tunmen to buy yeast - A. No, it was never allowed for any man to come and buy without applying to the accounting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it allowed in other places for the tunmen to sell - A. I believe it is.</p>

I therefore wrote a direction to Mr. Ward, and as Mr. Ward had made out letters of administration for some other persons who had defrauded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110054"/>the hospital before, and which persons had been convicted. I wrote at the bottom of the paper -</p>
               <p>"This is one of the fatal Eurus." - in order that he might be more particular. The woman went away then. I think on the 13th of October I received this letter and administration by the post; this is the letter of administration, and this the letter in which they were enclosed; the letter is directed to me at my house, by the post. On the 14th of October the prisoner came again. When she came again I told her that I had got the letter of administration, but still I could not pay her until I had got an answer from Dumfries, where I had written to enquire whether her statement was true; she then went away, and came again the 26th of October. Still I had received no letter. I told her so. She came again the 19th of November. I told her when she was down on the 26th of October I would write again, and I did write again. On the 19th of November I had not received any letter; she pleaded very strongly to be paid the money, as she was in great distress, and as I still told her I had not heard from Dumfries, she produced this letter, which she said she had received from her sister at Dumfries; the letter is dated the 2nd of November 1808, from Dumfries. Upon my looking at the letter I told her it appeared to have the twopenny post mark, not the general post; she said to save postage a person had brought it up and put it in the post at London. I told her the production of this letter, so far from inducing me to pay, confirmed me that she was an impostor; I told her from the circumstance of the letter coming this suspicious way, by the twopenny post; she protested that she was innocent. I told her that if she was, she might come again the middle of next week, and if she was not sure that she was the person that she had stated, she had better not come again. On the Monday following, which was the 19th of November - I must have made a mistake with respect to the date of her last coming, it was the 19th that I received the letter - she came on the Saturday the preceding, that it must be the 17th that she applied, and then it was that she produced the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said she came on the 19th - A. It was the 17th. On Monday the 19th of November I received this letter from the reverend Mr. Scot, one of the ministers of Dumfries.</p>
               <p>COURT. That we cannot read - A. On the 25th of November she came again. I then told her that I had now proof of her being an impostor. My lord, if you would permit me, I was correct that she came on the 19th. On the 25th she came again; I told her I was confident that she was an impostor. I sent for Mr. Marter, the solicitor of the hospital, and after asking her several questions, Mr. Marter said we must send for an officer, which was done. She said she had three children, she said the youngest was six years old; I asked her how that could be, when she stated her husband had been dead nine years; she said, to tell the truth, she had been married again, about six years ago, to one Grimes, she was married at Dumfries by a

After this she was taken to Bow street; she was there committed for farther examination that night. On the 25th I think she was brought up again; she then sent a message to me that she wished to speak to me before she went to the magistrate. I received the message from Adkins the officer. I went to her where the was, in the office, in the outer room, or the passage leading to it; she then stated to me that she was never married to Rotton, she asked me to forgive her; I told her it was perfectly out of my power, it was in the hands of the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this perfectly voluntary - A. It was perfectly voluntary. I never asked her any questions; she said she was never married to Rotton, she was not born in Dumfries, nor never had been there; on the contrary, that she was born in the north of Ireland, but that her mother was born at Dumfries, and that it was from her she had learned what she knew of Dumfries. I then asked her how she could take upon herself to endeavour to defraud the hospital; she said she had been led into it by two men named Vaughan and and Knight; I then told her they could not have led her into it at this time, as the former had been hanged and the latter had been transported nearly two years ago; she said it was on account of owing her landlady some money, who pressed very hard for payment, and she took this means for obtaining money to pay her.</p>

After some conversation I told her it was necessary she should have a bondsman, and that if she would attend at the office to-morrow morning by ten o'clock, accompanied by a bondsman, I would prepare the necessary instrument ready for it; she told me that she had no money to pay for the administration, but if I would send it to Mr. Smith he would deduct the charges.

               <p>COURT to Ward. In stating the letter which was produced to you, you have not stated what was the date of that letter - A. I think to the best of my recollection it was 1795 or 1796; it was a letter of an old date.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not stated in what terms it was written - A. It was written as from husband to wife; she was described as his wife in the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you mention that before - A. I might not have recollected that before; I am certain of the circumstance; she was described as his wife; it began my dear Margaret; she said it was from her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words in the letter he calling her his wife, you cannot state that - A. No. It was a letter as from the husband to the wife, it appeared to me to be a letter that came from a sea port town; I think it was ship letter upon it, there was some post upon it; I had no idea at the time of being called upon.</p>
               <p>Q. The administration, and the warrant for administration, stated that he died in the West Indies in year 1797 - A. She stated that her legal husband died about a twelvemonth after the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Which letter you recollect to be dated in the year 1795 or 96; you have put it down died in the West Indies, 1797 - A. Yes; that was from the information I received from her. (The administration read.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Give us as near as you can the expression that she used - A. She said it was Vaughan and Knight had been the cause of her going down to Greenwich; that she would not have gone there but she owed some money to her landlady, Mrs. Flinn, and her landlady pushed her very hard for the money. She begged very much that I would let her see Mr. Smith before she went before the magistrate, that she would tell him the whole truth about this unfortunate business; I promised her that she should see Mr. Smith before she went before the magistrate. I then asked her if she had ever been married to a man of the name of Rotton; she said no, she never had.</p>

I examined the book which they call the banns being published; I went to Mr. Scot, the minister, and requested to search the register of marriages of the church of Dumfries; I was told that they kept no register of marriages; but it was a register of the publication of banns; I examined that register for twenty five years back; as far back as 1785; I could find no such banns being published as that of

Mr. Ward and Mr. Smith, read this letter; it was as loving a letter as ever a man could send to his wife and children. After he was at sea a few months he died, when, I cannot say; I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it is twelve years ago since he died; I cannot say exactly to the time. A letter was sent to let me know of his death; I did not receive it. A man of the name of Kelly, who was in the same company with my husband, he wrote home to his own friends for them to let me know that my husband died such a time in the West Indies; the exact time I cannot recollect, it being so long ago. Upon which, after some time, two or three years, I married a man of the name of Grimes, and after that, it was my misfortune he died; I was left a widow; misfortunes have been against me every way, and after I came to London, I may say to my misfortune, about two years and a half ago, not knowing any money was due to me until such time I came here, I, one day, shortly after I came here, met with a man belonging to the same regiment as my husband did; his name was

He told me all about it, where it was to be paid and at what office; he put the question to me if I had got my marriage certificate; I told him I had not, I had had it, but I had the misfortune to lose it. This Knight told me that he knew a man that had been some kind of an attorney; he would get me to this man and he would put me in the way to get the money; I told him if he would I should be very much obliged to him.

So accordingly he wrote out this certificate; I was ignorant and simple, I knew nothing of the consequence of it, and I do own, through distress, I applied for the money, I thought it was my property by right.

            . Q. We understand you formerly was in the service of the prosecutor - A. Yes; I left his service last Christmas was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, I lodged with him last March. I then saw some netting in his possession laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about it - A. No, I only saw the netting for a minute or two; we spoke about it on the Wednesday following that I saw it; I asked him whether it came from Mr. Lhonne's. I knew that Mr. Lhonne had lost a net that covered his tulips; he told me he had been in Mr. Lhonne's garden, he had great difficulty in getting over the garden wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever communicate this to your former master - A. I returned from the country the week before last Christmas; I then went and told Mr. Lhonne the circumstance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you write - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. If one wants to know where an honest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110058"/>servant lives, we shall know where to find you - where do you live - A. In Phip street, Holywell mount.</p>
               <p>Q. In March you saw this net - have you not been working for Mr. Duffy in Finsbury square - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is the master with whom the prisoner works - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Duffy lately discharged you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the prisoner's instance - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mr. Duffy discharged you, did you make this charge against the prisoner - A. About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go in the country last month - A. Into Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord you could write - then from last March down to the 3d of January you never told Mr. Lhonne - A. I could not while I was in the country; I dare say I should have told him if I had not been going in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you write so soon as you got down - A. I do not know that I had any particular reason.</p>

On the 5th of January, about half past ten o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, apparently very much in liquor; he asked me if he could sleep there as usual; I told him he could have the same bed he had before, he then took out a watch from his pocket, begging me to take care of it for him; he left it in my care till the officer had it, he said he gave five guineas for it; he then told me he had no money, to keep the watch until he got a ship, the captain would pay me; the sum was two pounds five shillings that I had let him run up.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of January last, and some time before, the prisoner, I believe, was in your employ as a clerk - A. He was, six years last July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed and entrusted by you to receive money on your account - A. He was; I placed a deal of confidence in him as an honest man; that receipt is his own hand writing that Mr. Duzado produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the book that he made the entry first - A. This is the rough entry book kept by the prisoner entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he also make an entry in the cash book - A. He makes the entry there also; but that is Mr. Lyne's department; there is a letter B. that is Mr. Lyne's writing.</p>

               <p>Q. The entry respecting Mr. Duzado is the prisoner's hand writing - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that book, which is the entry of the ledger after the entry of Mr. Duzado - A. There is a B. Duzado twenty five pounds five shillings and sixpence, as a debt; 48 as the page of the ledger, in the prisoner's hand writing; 27th January, 1808, that signifies it to be paid on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever account to you any other way than in his rough entry book - A. In the cash book he accompted to Mr. Lyne; if I received money I always gave it to him, and he was to accompt to Mr. Lyne.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive the money of him of Mr. Duzado's - A. He never paid it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. His duty was to receive money of a variety of people and to keep it till he took it to the bankers - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His way of accompting himself was, by stating it in the book, and whenever he had a large sum to carry it to the bankers - A. Whenever Mr. Lyne ordered him to carry it.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner we are told kept the cash book - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had received money he was to enter it into the rough entry book, then in the cash book - when he accompted to you in the cash book did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110059"/>compare the sums in that cash book with any thing else - A. They were posted in the ledger; we have another clerk here that posted it in the ledger, and I made a signature here that it was right; I compared this entry with the entry in the ledger, I found it was right; then I put a letter B. to denote that they corresponded.</p>
               <p>COURT. If it was found right with the cash book, then you put the letter B. to denote that it was right - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Does it correspond now - A. No, the entry in the ledger is twenty five pounds five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you wrote that letter B. page 48, the accompt in the cash book was the same as in the ledger - A. Yes; it is now only fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence; the one before the five appears to be upon an erasure, and in the rough entry book it now stands fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and that one appears to be upon an erasure similar to the other; the prisoner accompted for money that he received in that cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that cash book in you hand and tell me how much he has accompted to you for, as paid by Duzado - A. It appears only fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and casted up only as fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence, and paid into the hands of the bankers as fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence; it is fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence in the bankers book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made the alterations in these books from twenty five to fifteen - A. I have not; I believe it to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. By the entry being made as they are now, without some suspicion arising, you would not have found it out - A. I do not think I should; it would not have been detected unless we had refered to the ledger. He remained in my service till the 5th of November; on the morning of the 6th of November, I received that letter. (The letter read.)</p>

On Wednesday, or Thursday. next I hope to be in London again, perhaps before, I will not stay any longer; if I am not with him before his departure I shall not forgive myself; I have sent you a letter from my mother enclosed in this.

               <p>Q. Look at the ledger, 48, B - is there any charge there made to Mr. Duzado - A. There is twenty five pounds five shillings and six pence, as money paid; I copied it from the entry in the cash book; the cash book is now altered, it stands fifteen pounds five shillings and sixpence; when I copied it, it was twenty pounds five shillings and six pence; it has been altered since; it was posted about a month after it was received.</p>

            . Q. I am an officer. On the 28th of December I went to Mr. Wright's, in company with Hewit and Martin. On Mr. Wright's premises, there was one anchor lying in the yard, and one in the shop; I took the anchors and Mr. Wright to Shadwell office. The same day I went back to Mr. Wright's, there I found the prisoner, I took him to the office; he was committed for re-examination, and Mr. Wright was admitted as an evidence. I have had the anchors ever since in my possession.</p>

On the Saturday they brought it again into the shop; master told them the price that he would give - eleven shillings and nine pence; he gave them twelve shillings, because he had no small change; it weighed three quarters and eleven pounds; that is the anchor they brought into the shop.</p>

On the 23d of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another man came with the anchor; the prisoner had the anchor on his shoulder, we told him master was not at home; they left the anchor, they called again in about an hour; they said to master we have got an anchor, they found it down the gallions, they found it by the anchor of their own barge grappling with it. I weighed the anchor, it weighed three quarters and eleven pounds, at three halfpence a pound; it came to eleven shillings and nine pence, old iron price. The other man did not like that price; they went away; the other man came back, the prisoner did not return the second time. That is the anchor that the prisoner brought the first time.</p>

            . I am an anchor smith, I live at Limehouse New Cut, by the river side; the prisoner was one of the men that came on the Friday night before Christmas day; I asked the prisoner and the other man where they got the anchor; one of them said (I do not recollect which) they got it at Bow in the gallions, they picked it up with their barge's anchor; they told me they would not take my price, which was fourteen shillings a hundred, three halfpence a pound; they took the anchor away and returned on the Saturday night, and I gave them the money; this is not the man that received the money from me, the other man received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. The anchor that you bought in this way was found on your premises - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another anchor found, how did you get that - A. I do not know, it was thrown over my pales on the Wednesday morning; I saw it at nine o'clock. This is the anchor that I purchased; it is a temporary anchor, the stocks are both deficient; one is temporary, and the other is broken. That is the one that was thrown over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ask either of these persons where they lived - A. No; nor who they worked for; they appeared as working men; they were both strangers.</p>

I have no doubt the coal was taken from my master's heap, but I did not see him take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming to live with Mr. Hughes - A. I do, it was about the month of March. On the second or third Sunday after he came in the service, as near as I can recollect, about ten o'clock, I saw him in the back warehouse; I was able to see him from the front warehouse; I saw him take some chips from the tub in the back warehouse, rolled them up and put them in his left hand inside coat pocket; on my observing that I communicated it to the cook, Mary.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had communicated it to her, where did she and you go to - A. We went to the street door, I and the cook stood at the door; we saw him walk to the square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever communicate it to your master - A. No. I went into the country shortly after and did not return till lately; I communicated it to Mr. Bristow, I think on Friday, in the other week.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you the cook had told - A. Yes, I was willing to tell if in case I had gone back to Mr. Hughes; I would have told it lately if Mr. Hughes had sent for me; but I was desired not to go by several people.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you told us just now that you had not told it to any - A. I have told it to different people where I have lodged; they told me not to go for fear I should get myself into trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the boy come and tell you something - A. He did; it was on a Sunday morning, in the latter end of March, or the beginning of April; after the boy told me Mr. Pratt came out of the warehouse; I and the boy were at the street door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe Pratt come out of the warehouse - A. Yes, he passed by the side of me, as he went out of the door; I was as nigh to him as I am to you; I observed a roll of chips inside of his coat of the left side; I saw the rims of the chips in his bosom; I saw only the end of the bundle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you perfectly sure that at the end of the roll you saw chips uncovered - A. I did; Mr. Pratt went out of the house, nothing was said to him by me, nor by Hazard; I saw nothing more of him till Sunday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you, or had you not, reason to suppose that the chips had been stolen - A. Every time I went to the chips I thought that they decreased faster than they came out; I thought it was my fancy, I did not suspect any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the chips and find whether any quantity was missing - A. I did; and found there was the value of between sixty and seventy poundsworth missing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hughes mention it to the prisoner and the other servants - A. He did, in the beginning of August; Mr. Hughes consulted me and the prisoner together. When we found they were missing Mr. Hughes asked the prisoner whether he suspected any person; the prisoner told a long story of living with persons who had been robbed, and he told of one person that he had been the means of bringing to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in Mr. Hughes' service after that - A. I believe, till the latter end of August, or the beginning of September; I was in the country at that time; he went to live with a furrier in Gough square.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of December was indigo in that warehouse - A. I rather presume there must have been; but there were valuable property there.</p>
               <p>- PEACOCK. Q. Were you a servant of Mr. Myers, a bricklayer, in Checquer yard - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of Friday the 16th of December, what time did you go to Checquer yard - A. Half past five o'clock. I saw three men loitering about in Checquer yard, I did not seem to take any notice of them at all, I passed close by them, I saw all three of the faces, they were altogether; at that time it was quite a light morning, I could see across a ten acre field. I went into the stable and cleaned the horse; I came out again to the dung hole, I unchained the dung hole and went in it, it is about four feet deep; I saw these three men again, I watched them, I saw them walk up to Mr. Gossett's warehouse door; I saw Taylor, the <rs id="t18090111-86-deflabel514" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

I was on the opposite side of the way where there is a wine vaults; I watched them, I saw Freeman and Taylor walk up to the door again, and when we walked down I saw Taylor at the door at work again; the others walked about, and just as I saw the watchman come I began to walk up the court; they saw the watchman, Freeman said, no nose; two of them ran up Bush lane, and Taylor came down towards Dowgate hill; the watchman took Taylor at the corner of the court; I came up immediately, saying, that was one of the men; Taylor struggled, he dropped an iron crow.</p>

               <p>- WAINWRIGHT. Q. On this morning were you called by this lad that has just been examined - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend any person - A. Yes; Taylor; I took him to the Falcon public house; I searched him, I found the fife upon him; he struggled when I took him; I saw a crow drop from him, and I heard it fall; my partner came up. This is the crow. I asked the prisoner Taylor what he was; he said a fifer in the Tower Hamlets; I took the fife from him; he said he bought it at Mr. Gerrard's in Bishopgate street; I went back to the warehouse, I saw there were two strong locks broke off, and the door very much forced. I left the prisoner at the Falcon; I was away about five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110064"/>minutes; when I got back I found him there; I took him away and put him in the watchhouse, and locked him up; while I was away, he got away from a small window in the watchhouse that opens into a church yard; he made his escape over another wall.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of the 16th of December did you see Taylor - A. Yes; I went to the Robin Hood and Little John, Webb square, Shoreditch, there I saw Taylor; we went from there to another public house in Shoreditch; I found there a young man he wanted to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see whether you know him - have you seen him since - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, was the man that you saw at the Mansion house the man that you saw at the public house with Taylor - A. I should not know him again; I went with Taylor and the man to buy a fife at Mr Gerrard's; as we were going along I heard the word Jemmy mentioned; which of them spoke I cannot say; Taylor came into Mr. Gerrard's after we were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you seen that man since - A. I cannot say; I do not know him if I was to see him.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 16th of December, do you remember any person coming to buy a fife - A. Yes, three young men; the soldier I am sure of; the other prisoner, I believe he is the man, but I did not take particular notice of him; that is the fife I sold to the prisoner first; I sold that fife to Taylor three days before; there is a particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Duncan. I beg your lordship's pardon, I think it is the man; he had a short jacket on at the time.</p>
