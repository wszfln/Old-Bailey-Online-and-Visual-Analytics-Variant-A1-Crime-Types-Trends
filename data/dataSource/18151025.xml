               <p>Q. Was that door shut, and were the windows down - A. The door was shut; there are no shutters to the windows; but they were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in your cottage besides yourself - A. Only my wife; she was out to nurse a lady at Bayswater, and had been so for a fortnight before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left nobody in the house - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return - A. At about a quarter after eight; I found my door upon a jar, a little way open; I pushed it with my hand, and opened it; the prisoner looked me very hard in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. What! was he in the house - A. In the house at the time. I said, you villain, what business have you here? what could you expect to find in a poor man's cottage like this? he said, he was searching for money and victuals. He had tied up in a clean white napkin, a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, of mine; they were tied up on the bed. He laid hold of me to try to get out at the door; we struggled together a good deal, and he said, I was not going to lock him in there. My coat, waistcoat, and breeches, were not tied up on the bed when I went out. I ran to call somebody; he got right through the roof of the cottage, and ran down Black Lion-lane; I ran after him, and caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he then say - A. He said, he did it through distress. I brought him back to the side of the house. I then got a person to go in, and see what damage was done, and then I got another person to go in, and we took him to the watchhouse, and after that to Marlborough-street. I have one thing to say in his favour, he offered me no violence. I found that the drawers in my house had been rummaged.</p>

            . At about a quarter before nine in the morning of the 2nd of October, I was by the turnpike gate, at the end of Black Lion-lane; I saw Kenton with the prisoner at the bar; he hallooed out, Kelly, and told me, that man had broken into his house; and then he gave him in charge to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say - A. I asked him what he did it for? he said, he was in expectation of finding money there, as he thought, it was the foreman of the field's cottage I led him to the Crown at Bayswater, and there searched him; but found nothing on him. I then took him to the watchhouse, where I left him, and came back to the cottage. I found that the staple of the bolt was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kenton. Did you find the staple broken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kelly. What did you then find - A. I found this bundle of clothes tied up on the bed; they were tied in a towel; there are a pair of small-clothes, a body coat, and a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kenton. What is the value of the body coat - A. Why, it may be ten shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. And the breeches - A. Five shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any further conversation with him - A. Yes. He said, he tied up these things, and expected something better than what he found.</p>

The prisoners at the bar came into my shop at about eleven o'clock on the night of the 29th of September, for two plates of beef for supper. I had shut up my shop; but on their knocking, I let them in; I was just going to put a note for which I had given change into my pocketbook. I let them in. There were four one-pound notes in my pocket-book. The watchman came in for a light just then; and the two prisoners came in whilst he was there; he went out on his duty. I then served them with what they wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the pocket-book - A. In the till. There were four notes in it; and the one I was going to put in, was in the till. When I had given them the beef, they wanted some pickles. I went down to the cellar, and I heard a foot go from the place where the prisoners sat over to where the till was; and I returned directly; I immediately suspected; I returned directly, with only a few pickles; I was not gone above half a minute. He asked me was my stock of pickles almost out; I told him, no, but my time was almost out. I went to the till, and found my pocket-book gone. The prisoner wanted to go out to make water; he said, he could not get out without my assistance; I opened the door for him. No one can get either in or out without my help. Then being in fear, I went to look for the pocket-book in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not look for the pocket-book until the prisoner was gone out - A. No. He then knocked at the door, and I let him in again, and he finished his supper. I did not say any thing, nor make it known that I had lost any thing, at that time. I left the door open for a minute, and ran to the watch-box at the corner; I told the watchman I had been robbed, and he came back after me; he did not say any thing to the prisoners then; but he saw the patrole passing by the door, and called him. They then paid for their supper, and wanted to go; I said, they would not go yet, for I had been robbed since they were in the place, and it must be they who had done it. I told the watchman to search in the street, to see if they had thrown down a pocket-book, while we were away; but nothing could be found. We then took them to the watchhouse; they were searched there, but nothing found on them. When we came back again, I said to the watchman and the patrole, I wish you would assist me to look. We must have a good look, and I dare say we shall find it some where about. We then searched all along St. Giles's Church railings, and Little Denmark-street, and through Dudley-court, and then came back into High-street, out of Dudley-court; they shewed a light with the lanthorn into all the corners. Just there, there is a spout comes down by a doctor's shop; and there, by their shewing me a light, I spied the old pocket-book stuck behind the spout; the doctor's shop is two doors from my house, and Roberts's, the tobacconists, is next door. We took the pocket-book down to the watchhouse, and then brought it home again; the notes were in it, and three of them had my name on the back. When we came back to the shop, the woman was sitting where we left her; she was there when I heard a foot go towards the till; so it was between them.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and was on duty at the end of the street. On the 29th of September last, I went to get a light at the shop of the prosecutor; and while I was there, the prisoners came in. I then went to my box; and I had not been there ten minutes, when the prosecutor came, and said, Hogan, Hogan, I am robbed; he said he believed he was robbed of five pounds. He went into the shop, and I followed him. The prosecutor whispered across the counter into my ear, and told me to look about the door, to see if they had thrown it into the street. I could not find it; and as the patrole was coming by, I called him to assist us. We went into the house, and took the prisoners into custody. They were searched at the watchhouse, but nothing found upon them. Coming back from the watchhouse, the prosecutor, Mr. Walton said, we will have a general search, with your assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you assisted in that search, when the pocket-book was found - A. I did.</p>

I had Mr. Blackford's butler's leave for letting her be there; she was just then out of place, and had been a gentleman's house-keeper. I gave two shillings to the groom on the morning of the 27th; they were part of five shillings which I borrowed of Mrs. Sibley. The three-shilling piece I understand was also marked.

The prisoner said she was just in that room that morning, but never touched the money. The dressing-room is left open in the course of the day. The three shilling piece was found in a drawer where I said I had put it.</p>

I had twenty one-pound notes in a glove; I got them at Greenwich; they were what I sold my pension for, to take me home. In shaking out a shilling to pay for the gin, the notes fell from the glove, which a woman observed, and went into the tap-room, as I thought, to tell the prisoner and the other men. I picked my notes up, and put them securely into my pocket; I pinned the glove in my pocket. Immediately the men came out of the tap-room to me; one man asked me for a pipe of tobacco. I went into the street, and they shoved me in again, and shut the door; then a man of the name of Gooding asked me for a pipe of tobacco; I gave him two farthings. He said, he did not want any; but putting his hand on my pocket where my money was, and said, this is some of the tobacco that I want, There were nine men standing round me at this time, and the prisoner was one. They were all pushing me about; I knew directly what they wanted, and called to the landlord for help; but he turned himself away, and said, he would not get himself hurt among so great a sight of people. The prisoner had hold of my right arm; I kept singing out to the landlord all the time. This Gooding tore my money out of my pocket in the glove, and jumped out into the street, and ran away. The prisoner had hold of my right arm where he did this; but immediately afterwards let go, and quitted me. I immediately ran after Gooding, and followed him half an hour, and then lost him. I met a gentleman in the street, who took me down to Bow-street, got a warrant for me, and we came back to the house; when I came into the room, the prisoner dodged his head down immediately, and made believe he was drunk. The constable held his head up, and I knew him to be the man that held my right arm. The prisoner was taken down to Bow-street; he was searched; but nothing belonging to me was found on him. I appeared the next day at Bow-street. I have never seen my glove or my money since.</p>

I went with them, and enquired of the landlord, who were the people that robbed the man; he said, that he knew nothing about the people; they had followed the black man in. I then searched his house. I went into the tap-room: the prisoner's face was towards the tap-room door, and he was talking to the company when I opened it; the prosecutor was close behind me. The moment he saw the prosecutor; he shut his eyes, pulled down his hat over his face, ducked his head, and made believe to be drunk, and fell off the settle. I immediately lifted up his head, and the prosecutor swore he was the man who held his right arm in the robbery. He did not deny being in the scuffle; but said he was not the man that robbed him.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came down to Bow-street office between eight and nine on the Sunday morning; I went with him and the gentleman who was with him, to the Turk's Head, where he said, he had been robbed. I called the landlord into the parlour, and asked him if he knew who robbed this poor man; he said, he saw the scuffle, and was afraid to go amongst them, but did not know who it was in particular; and that he had enough to do to mind his customers. I then went and fetched Godfrey, who lives closely; and when he came, we went into the tap-room; as soon as we went in, the prisoner held his head down, and appeared to be very much in liquor. Godfrey held his head up, and the prosecutor said that he was the man who held his right arm while the robbery was committed.</p>

By the account he gave of it, I thought he could not have come honestly by it; I told him, I would send my boy with him to know where he got it. I told my boy to tell the watchman to take him into custody, and take him to the watchhouse immediately. It may be worth about two shillings a yard, and I don't think it is worth forty shillings; though I dare say it cost more.</p>

The prisoner attempted one of the gentleman's pockets; but did not succeed; they followed them on, and then the prisoner pulled the handkerchief a little way out of his pocket; then he made a snatch at it, and stuffed it up between the waisthand of his breeches and his apron. I immediately seized the prisoner, and told the gentleman he was robbed. Here is the handkerchief. The gentleman gave me his card, and said he would attend at Bow-street; I went to his house, which was in Piccadilly, and learned he was an officer in the Army, and was obliged to join his regiment.</p>

On the 10th of October, a man came in for a pair of strings; when I cut them for him, he threw down two-pence, and went out. I observed while I was cutting them, he tried to stand between me and the door, that I could not see it. As he went out, I perceived the boots were snatched by somebody, but not by that man. I told my husband, and he ran out, and soon returned with the boots.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner standing at his door; I saw him cut the boots down, and ran off with them. I stopped him, and in the scuffle he broke a window. Mr. Smith then came up, and took him, and got the boots; and then he got away from Mr. Smith; but afterwards was taken; I am sure of his person.</p>

            . I am a partner in the house of Oxley and Co. The prisoner is a rider for our house. When he sets out upon a journey, it is the constant practice for him to take a little book, with the names of the persons upon whom he is to call in the course of his journey, each upon a page; and the sums due by each of those persons written there-under; then on his return, he gives that book to us, with the sums received upon each of those accounts entered in the several pages. He rendered this book to us on the 6th of May, after the journey in which he ought to have called upon Mr. Wicken. (Book put into the hands of the witness.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book which the prisoner rendered to you - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to Mr. Wicken's page and see what entry there is there - A. Mr. Wicken is charged eight pounds seventeen shillings, and under that is the prisoner's hand writing, in the words</p>
               <p>"next journey;" signifying that it was to be paid the next journey. The next journey, we sent another traveller and by that means discovered this fraud. The words</p>
               <p>"next journey," are in the prisoner's hand writing. We never have received this money upon Mr. Wicken's account.</p>

            . I am a waterman and lighterman. On the 1st of this month, I heard a cry of stop thief! and saw the prisoner running. He got up under the pillars in Wellclose square. I followed him up there, and the people run by him and me. I told him he had stolen the hat which I saw in his hand. He made use of shocking had language, and I collared him; we struggled together, and he made use of horrid imprecations, what he would do to me, if I did not let him go. He swore he would cut my b - y guts out; and I don't know what he would not do. He struck at me, and I hit him very hard in the eye, and knocked him down. I then got on him, and kept him down. Nobody would come to help me, though there were plenty standing about, because he was such a desperate villian. A young man I knew came up to me, and said Lillie, let him go, he is an, out, and outer. I had not lived so long near Tower Hill, without knowing pretty well what that means. It means, one of the very worst description of thieves. I then let him up, for I was frightened. When I got up myself, I found my seal was gone, and a double breasted waistcoat which I had on, cut through and through. He then took off his coat, and put himself in an attitude for boxing; and said, come on you b - y b - r. He squared backwards, until he came to the corner, and then he right about face, and was off in an instant.</p>

I remember the two prisoners being in my house on the 20th of September; they were in company with each other; my till was in the bar; I don't know exactly what money was in it; when it was full, it contained between four and five pounds in halfpence. It was full that night. There was a gold ring in the till, and a key. I cannot swear positively to the quantity of halfpence; I am sure there was more than forty shillings, that I can swear, I was called into the parlour, and left the bar for a moment; and on my return, the lights were out. There were a candle and a lamp, and they were both extinguished. The male prisoner was gone, and Sarah Rabnett remained; I gave her in charge to the watchman, and she was taken to the watchhouse. I should tell you, I found my till gone, and all the contents. Soon after the charge was taken, the watchman brought in the till, empty; it had been found in the street. I went to Worship street the next morning to support the charge against the female prisoner. The man was brought in on the information of a witness who will appear.</p>

The glass was broken, and they insisted on my paying half towards replacing it; I had not money enough about me, and I went home to get four-pence; on my coming in the second time with four-pence in my hand, the woman put out the candle, which was on the counter in the bar; the landlord was not then in the bar. I laid hold of the candle to go and get a light; and when I was coming out with a light, I saw the man at the bar, jump over the counter, out of the bar, and run out at the door.</p>

The prisoner came in, and asked for a lodging, and I told him he would get one. The woman here made answer, and said to him, that he should have a lodging for a week, for two shillings a week. The watch at that time, was under my head, between the pillow and bolster. I pulled it out in the prisoner's presence, to tell the woman what o'clock it was. I then fell asleep. I wakened again; in a few minutes the prisoner went out of the room; I then missed it, and went after him; I never saw him afterwards until I saw him at Greenwich. He had informed us that he was a <rs id="t18151025-21-deflabel115" type="occupation">Greenwich pensioner</rs>

I could not come to an agreement with him; he staid in the shop from five to eight minutes; he then went away. As soon as he was gone, I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs, containing four. I told Mr. Stevenson, and he told me to go to Mr. Thrickley's. I found the prisoner coming out of Mr. Jones's; Mr. Jones is a haberdasher. I stepped into Mr. Jones's, and asked him if a person had been looking at some silk handkerchiefs. I did not find the handkerchiefs at Mr. Jones's. I then crossed over into Mortimer-market, and saw the prisoner pull the piece of handkerchiefs out of his pocket; I stepped up to him; I laid hold of him with one hand, and took the handkerchiefs from him with the other; he got away from me, and ran as hard as he could; I cried stop thief, and he was stopped in the street.

            . The prisoner used to come to see her; I had seen him there three or four times. On the evening of the 10th of this month, I was at Mrs. Crompton's house; my mistress was not at home; Sally was also gone out. I was in the house by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Sally been gone out - A. She went out between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening were you called to the door - A. At about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that came to the door - A. It was; he asked if Sarah was at home? I told him she was not. He then said, she had told him, if she was not at home when he called, to wait until she came in: upon that, I asked him down into the kitchen. He sat there a very few minutes, before I said, I was going to shut up the house, and he said, he would go with me, and help me. We went into the parlour, where the plate was, and shut up the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate was there - A. I don't now exactly recollect; the plate was on the table, in something of a tray; there were some gravy-spoons there, there were some sauce-ladles, a sugar sifter, table spoons, tea spoons, silver forks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these in the parlour when you went in with the prisoner - A. Yes; I had cleaned them all myself, and put them into the tray that day. My mistress did not dine at home that day. We then went into the kitchen, and after that, I went up stairs to see after the drawing-room fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it then become dark - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were up stairs, what then - A. When I came down, the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been up stairs - A About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut the street door after you let the prisoner in - A. Yes, I was sure the street door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then - A. I was very uneasy, and stood still for a few minutes; then I went into the parlour; I missed the plate, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. All - A. No; the greater part of it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The tray then, and some part were left behind - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, all this time, had there been any other person in the house but the prisoner - A. Yes; a porter had come and sat a box down in the hall, and then went away again directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the house after you had shut the shutters - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon missing the plate what did you do - A. I put the candle down, and stood at the gate; I was very much surprised, and frightened; the first person I saw was Mr. Butterfield; I communicated this to him. I know no more, except I was taken to the police office to identify the plate.</p>

            . On the 11th of this month, I saw the prisoner at the bar, whom I knew, in Tottenham-court-road. I had heard of the robbery. I saw him go into a pawnbroker's; I followed him in, and asked him if his name was not James Moorehouse? he denied his name a dozen times and more to me. I said to him, it is very strange you don't know your neighbours. I then asked him, if he knew that good woman, (pointing to my wife, who was at the door) he said, no; he had not the least knowledge. I then asked the young man in the shop, what property he wanted to leave; that moment, the prisoner ran out of shop, over a basket of linen; I followed him directly; I brought him back; when I brought him back, he acknowledged that he knew me. I said, why not know me before? he said,</p>
               <p>"a guilty conscience wants no accuser." He then put his hand in his pocket, and said, I will give up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250012"/>to your care, all that I have about me; the first thing he gave me was a one-pound note; and then a quantity of plate that he had not made away with; he then gave me as much as three pounds one shilling and sixpence in silver, and fourpence in copper, and said, that was every thing material he had about him.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road; I am a constable, and a pawnbroker. The prisoner had not pawned any thing at my shop; he offered something, but the instant he was in the shop, Jackson came in, and recognized this person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you produce the plate he offered to pawn, and the plate he surrendered to Jackson - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, tell us all that was found on the prisoner - A. I took an inventory of it; there were four silver forks, two sauce ladles, one silver fish slice, a silver sugar sifter, four gilt egg spoons, one salt spoon, a one-pound note, three pounds one shilling and sixpence in silver, and four-pence in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the worth of that - A. Why, about fifteen pounds altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you put it at a low value - A. It is fashionable plate; I put it at an humble value when I say thirteen or fourteen pounds. I also found some pawnbrokers' duplicates on him.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employment on the 29th of September. On that day he was out, and a person called for him. I asked the boy what he wanted, he said the prisoner owed him one and sixpence; I asked him what for? he said for carrying a box, to the Bolt in Tun Inn, in Fleet street. I remarked that a shilling might have been enough for that. I got this box, from the Bolt in Tun, and found it contained a cream ewer, and a silver mug, and other articles of my property. The box itself was mine.</p>

On the 3rd of October, there was a dinner at the Hall.

The officer, Limbrick, brought me a key, which opened a small door in the cellar, where on a shelf we found a skeleton key, which opened the wine cellar. I got the treasury broken open, and found two spoons, with the Company's arms filed out; also a file, with silver in the teeth, and a polishing stone, which when used, would take of the marks of the file. In consequence of an information which I received, and which I supposed came from the prisoners, I sent Mr. Ness, my clerk, to them; I made use of neither promise nor threat.</p>

            . The prosecutor acquainted me with his loss; in consequence of which, I apprehended the prisoner; she immediately put something like a bit of paper into her mouth; I suspected it was a note, and seized her by the throat, to prevent her swallowing it; but it was no use. I then was about to search her hair, when she put up her hand, and took something out of her cap; it was a five-pound note. The prosecutor told me he had the five-pound notes, all of following numbers two were stolen, and he had one in his possession. On comparing the note I found on prisoner, it was the following number to note the prosecutor then had in his possession.</p>

At about twelve o'clock on the night in the indictment, I thought I heard the glass of the kitchen window broken; I got up, I struck a light; I went down to the kitchen, and under the window, I saw some fragments of glass. I did not appear to notice it, and went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you acted in such way, that if any person was looking at you, you would not seem to see it - A. Yes. I then extinguished the light, and went to an upper room; I then gently opened the window where I sat. The watchman then came down the street, crying the hour; and then I heard footsteps coming down before him; they did not come as low as my house. The watchman then went round to the front of the buildings, and on his coming into the other end of the street, the footsteps then retreated. At one o'clock, a coach drove through the street; I observed a person following the coach, and I saw him come over to my kitchen window, and kneel down upon the grating. The only light there was, was the light of a lamp opposite my door. I then took a dirk, and proceeded down stairs, very softly, into the kitchen; I then heard some one endeavouring to get out a gimblet, with which I had fastened the two sashes together; for I had been robbed so often. The person then desisted for some cause. I then went to the window, and perceived it was broke, and felt something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250014"/>moist, which moistness afterwards turned out to be blood. I then took a chair and sat myself down, opposite to the window; after a little time, the person came again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the person, do you mean to say, you had so much light as to be able to discern it was the same person that came at first - A. No; that is only as I conjecture. The person came again, as I was saying, and succeeded in getting out the gimblet; he then forced down the upper sash, and introduced an instrument; it was a stick, with a hook fixed to the end of it. I could see, by the light of a lamp, that he was reaching to a basket of clothes, which was under the window; there was only his arm in; I thought a little management would be only requisite to take him. I then put the dirk into my pocket, and ntly advanced towards him. When his arm was in he full extent, I then seized it with both hands above wrist. I pulled him as tight as ever the railing w permit; at one time, he almost got away; but by sudden hard pull, I brought him down to his shoulders. I then called to the watchman, and so did Mrs. Jenkins; the watchman came; I refused to deliver him up the watchman until he had got more assistance; then two gentlemen, neighbours, came to our assistance, and then I let him go.</p>
               <p>(A stick was here produced, with a large fishing hook affixed to it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What do you conceive that is for - A. The family had been washing; the sheets were hanging before the fire, and a basket of clothes was immediately beneath the window. I, and my neighbours, have lost our clothes frequently in the same manner.</p>

At about one o'clock, in the middle of the day, on the 5th of October, the prisoner came into my shop, and requested a pennyworth of white cotton balls. When he first came in, I was in the parlour, adjoining the shop; I went out into the shop to him; he seemed very much confused. I suspected all was not right. I told him we had no balls of cotton. I did not see him do any thing that created any suspicion, nothing but his being confused. During the that he was in the shop, a piece of stuff fell; I don't what occasioned it to fall; the prisoner was at least two yards from it and appeared very much frightened. I thought as he went out, I saw him take something from the door, but I was mistaken, and missed nothing thence. As soon as he had been gone about two or three minutes, I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs; I asked Mrs. Walker if she had sold this piece of handkerchiefs, and she told me not. I immediately went to the corner of East-street, and saw the prisoner running: he then looked back, and I cried stop thief; he then turned along Blandford-street, into Manchester-street, and through a court, into a mews. the persons who were in the pursuit, as well as myself, made a motion for me to go along South-street, into which the end of the mews runs. I got to the end of the mews, and the prisoner ran into the side door of a pawnbroker's shop; I ran in at the front door, and so secured him. I searched him, but did not find any thing on him. I thought perhaps he might have thrown them away. I took him down the mews, in order to find the property, if he had; a few doors from the pawnbroker's side door, the handkerchiefs were picked up; a coachman picked them up, in my presence, and gave them to me immediately; the constable was present at the time they were picked up; they were delivered to him, as well as the prisoner; the constable's name is Hunter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sitting in my parlour on the day of the robbery, and saw the prisoner run by, with the prosecutor after him. I saw the prisoner taken just by the pawnbroker's. I also saw the handkerchiefs picked up; they were delivered into my charge, with the prisoner. Here they are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to my master's house, and he told me to call upon him at two o'clock for some work. I met a person I knew, he told me to go to Mr. Smith's; I went into the prosecutor's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250015"/>shop to purchase some cotton balls; he had none; while I was there, a piece of stuff fell down, and that made me jump. I was going along, and heard a cry of stop thief; I knew it could not be after me; I went into this mews, and made water; seeing the crowd come rushing along, I just put my foot on the threshold of the pawnbroker's side door, to button up my small clothes; whilst I was there, they took me for the handkerchiefs, and I declare I know no more about them than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I turned round, and saw Wallis take a piece of floor cloth from his side, and give it to Price; they then ran across the street, and into a small court, called Kemp's court. Mr. Cox's being the first broker's shop, I went in there to enquire. We went after them, but could not find them then. I was speaking to a friend at a few minutes after seven, in Wardour street, on the Monday morning, and they both passed us; we followed them through a good many streets, and at last, with the assistance of an officer, we took them in Hopkins-street.</p>

On the 18th of September, I bought a lot of silk and cotton shawls. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250016"/>the 19th, I discovered they were colours I did not like; I wanted to return those which displeased us, but they would not take any back, without the whole. Then it was discovered that four were deficient; the prisoner was in our employ. We questioned all the servants; they all denied as well as the prisoner. I then went to the Mansion house, and got two officers. I told all the servants to remain within while I was gone; for I was going to search their respective lodgings. On coming to the prisoner's lodgings, in Swan alley, Coleman street; we found all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the last witness. I sleep in the house; my masters do not. These shawls were missed; Mr. Bickham told us all to stay within while he searched the respective lodgings, but the prisoner went out, for about twenty minutes. He said, gentlemen I suppose you think me guilty, from my leaving the premises so long; the reason is, my wife is very much indisposed, and I went home to apprise her of Mr. Bickham's coming. These shawls that were taken, must have been taken between the 18th and 19th,</p>

I had driven one nail, and I wanted another; I said to the prisoner, I want another nail, and must have one, from some where or other; but I won't go down stairs for one, if I can help it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been quarrelling with him that day - A. No. When I said I wanted a nail, he said, look in one of those holes, and you will find one. He meant the old holes in the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak that angrily - A. No, good humoured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all suspect that he was angry with you at that time - A. No not at all. I found an old nail where he directed me, and said, I have got one, if I can make it do. I went and kneeled down, and straightened it on the floor, and began driving it into the floor, to keep the end of the stick from slipping out of the boards; I was driving this nail, when he came and stabbed me; he stabbed the knife into my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to you - A. He never spoke, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, there was nobody else in the shop besides you two - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave the knife sticking in your body, or did he carry it away with him - A. It was found in the room. I ran after him; when I came to the top of the stairs, I put my hand to my side, and felt it wet, and looking at it, and there it was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of this wound upon you - A. I was taken to Bartholomew's Hospital almost immediately; I was confined there a fortnight and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever give you any reason since, for doing this - A. I never have seen him since, but once at Guildhall. Not an angry word passed between us. I kept my bed with the wound for about eight days; I never was out of it during that time.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Q. Can you venture to say he did not fall upon you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back was towards him; now can you venture to swear he did not fall upon you with the knife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed he had any occasion to use his knife - A. We had been cutting tobacco stalks but with other knives. We had not been eating bread and cheese, nor any thing of the kind.</p>

I took a candle and went up stairs into the cutting loft, or snuff room, and I looked about, and in the right hand side on the bed.

The prosecutor was brought to me; he had a wound on the right side of his belly, near his navel; it appeared to have been inflicted by a knife; it was not a dangerous wound. He was confined to his bed for a week. He bled profusely when he first came, but I soon stopped the blood.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning were you alarmed, and by whom - A. About half after five, by the watchman. I got up instantly; on my coming down stairs, I found the street door open, and my servants in the shop; it was quite dark at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was up last the night before - A. That I can hardly tell; I was not; but I rather think the servants were. I went to bed myself at about half past ten; all was then safe, I am convinced. The door was fast before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discover by what means the people got in - A. At the top of the house, by taking a pane of glass out of the lead, and then undoing the flap.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they get at the top of your house - A. From an adjoining empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this flap at the top of hour house - A. It is a wooden shutter, with a flap to it; it is secured by this hook, and a pane of glass had been taken out, and the hook removed, and then the flap could be opened. The only way I can suppose is, that they must have got over both houses to get into the gutter at the side of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the front door open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key left inside the door usually - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know, could persons who had entered at the top of the house, get out of the street door by means of the key being on the inside - A. Yes. I missed two spoons, from the kitchen, a silver sauce ladle, and other articles of plate; but none of them have been found at all. A Bow-street officer came to us, and told us he had apprehended a man with part of the property. Out of the shop, I missed several shawls, six scarfs, seven gowns, twelve yards of sarsnet, five yards of crape, three silk stockings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250018"/>a black cloak, fourteen silk handkerchiefs, and a yard of green baize. We have got the things that were taken from the shop. but the silver things are not come-at-able.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your family sleep in the place where the persons broke in - A. I have three maids, who slept in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The flap leads to the leads on the top of the house. I know my servants had not been using the leads to dry clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your man used these leads to dry the things in your business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. No; I could not bring him; he is Clarke's father. I took Clarke in because his father had a bad leg, and discharged him about two months ago, for stealing a shawl.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I am a watchman; Brook-street is in my beat. I was crying half past five on the morning of the 14th of this month, in Brook-street; a man going past asked me what the time was? I told him. I just turned round, and at the other end of the street, I saw a man cross the road with a bundle under his arm. Knowing he had not passed me in the street, I guissed all could not be right, and ran after him; coming up to Mr. March's door, I perceived it was open: I saw two bundles laying on a table, and that made me suspect there was some one in the house. I sprang my rattle, and called for assistance; when they came up, we went into the house. I found the drawers had been opened, and a quantity of things taken out. We examined the lower part of the house, with the shop and parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. March with you at this time - A. No. I rang the bell, to alarm Mr. March and the family; there were two other watchmen with me at this time. I asked the servant girl if she had locked the door when she went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. But we can't hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Witness. I then requested Mr. March to go along with me to the upper part of the house. When we got to the lap of the house, there is a kind of a workshop, with a ladder going up to this flap, that has been described. On the top of the leads, I found an old knife. The night before the robbery was a wet night; so that the knife must have been brought there on the night of the robbery, for it was quite bright.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 14th, I was in Catherine-street, in the Strand, at about seven o'clock. I know the prisoner Thompson well. I perceived the prisoner Clarke, in company with another man, who is not in custody; the other man was carrying this bundle; I saw them talking together, and evidently in company with each other; I was close by Eagle-court. I went up to them, and asked them if that was Eagle-court; they told me yes. I went up it a little way, and then returned, and watched them; they were then joined by Thompson. The man who is not in custody, then gave the bundle to Thompson; then they all three went into Eagle-court. I laid hold of Thompson; he then had the bundle, and the others ran away, On searching him, I found a pair of black silk stockings, and a letter directed to</p>
               <p>"Mr. Marsh, silk dyer;" these were in his great coat pocket. After I had locked Thompson up, I went with Ruthwin, and we found out where Mr. Marsh lived, and told him what I have now told. In consequence of information I received there, I went in company with Ruthwin, to Somers Town, and apprehended Clarke in his lodgings. I saw Ruthwin take some silk fringe from a cupboard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Mackay, when we apprehended Clarke; he had a lodging at Somers Town; we apprehended him between eight and nine o'clock; we met him just coming out; we desired him to torn back, and he unlocked the door, and let us in; Mackay put the handcuffs on immediately. In one corner I found a pair of boots pulled off quite wet, and he said he had not been out at all. I also found this silk fringe in a cupboard. I took two handkerchiefs out of his hat; he asked me for one of them, as he said, to hide the handcuffs; I told him if he was not ashamed to break into a man's house, he need not be ashamed of the consequences.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. March; I have been so these six months. I slept in the roam adjoining that which was broken into; I was not disturbed by any noise during the night. I, and two other servants, were up last in the house; I am sure the street door was fast; we all went to bed together; we did not get up the next morning until the alarm was given. The female servants used not to dry clothes out on these leads. I don't think a female could open the flap. I know this silk fringe to be my master's property; I also can swear to this letter, for I delivered it to Mr. Marsh myself. I know all the other articles also to be my master's property.

            . I am a headborough of the parish of St. George's in the East. On Saturday, the 16th of September, I saw the prisoner, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, in Cable-street; that is not so much as half a mile from Old Gravel-lane. I observed something under his coat. Knowing him before, I suspected all was not right. I saw him go into an old clothes' shop; I stood at the door, and watched him; I saw him offer this gown to the woman for sale; they could not at first agree about the price; he was about coming out, but he did not; he went back again; they agreed upon the price; I think it was three shillings and fourpence for the gown and apron too: they were counting out the money when I went in. I seized the prisoner, and took the gown and apron off the counter. I asked him where he got them? he said, from his mother's. I told him that was not true for it would not fit his mother; I knew his mother. He then said it was not his mother's, but his sister's. I then took him, and locked him up in the watch-house. Soon after, I heard that a house had been broken open in Crane-court, Old Graval-lane; I went there, and asked the prosecutrix what she had lost? she said, several articles; at last, she said, she had lost a blue gown; this gown was blue. I asked her could she describe it by any thing else but the colour, and then she described two darns, which the gown really has upon the back of it. She described the apron also sufficiently to prove to me, before I shewed them to her. I examined the door of her house, and could perceive that it had been broken open with a chisel or small crow.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my property.</p>

Then I thought it necessary to search the stables, which the prisoner had the care of. Whilst the officers were searching the stable, he went to one of the coaches in the yard, and stood on the step for between two or three minutes. When he came down, the officer said, now, let me get up; he then got in, and brought out thirteen one-pound notes.</p>

            . I am the person whose business it is to deliver the parcels. I received a parcel directed to Mr. Philips; it was a small brown paper parcel. On the morning of Tuesday, I asked the prisoner to help me up with the parcels into the cart. The man who usually assisted me in this, was busy about something else. The small parcels remained in the office until the last. The prisoner assisted me in putting them in.

I went on the Saturday, and searched the stable; whilst I was searching the stable, the prisoner got up on the steps of one of the coaches, and remained there two or three minutes.

On the evening of Sunday, the 1st of October, between seven and eight, the prisoner was running along with a hat on his head, and another in his hand. As soon as he saw me, he shyed me, and ran into a corner, where there are some pillars, in <placeName id="t18151025-41-crimeloc235">Wellclose square</placeName>

I went up to him, and he was jammed up in the corner, as close as he could get. The prisoner hit me, and I hit him again in the left eye, and down he went; I fell with him, I was uppermost; and I kept him down. Whilst he was down, I felt a tug at my watch, but did not give it a thought at that moment. I called for assistance but the watch was not then set. Nobody would assist me, for the people said, he had a knife in his hand. I saw something in his hand, but whether it was a knife or not, I do not know. He vowed all manner of things he would do to me. He said he would cut my b - y guts out, if I did not let him go. A young man that I knew said Lille, let him go, he is a complete out and outer; that means, the worst description of theives, and a fellow who would as soon run a knife in you as lock at you. I then let him up; and when he got up, I missed my seal, and told a witness, who is here. He then put himself in an attitude for boxing; and backed, and backed, until he got to the corner, and then he turned about, and was off, as quick as an arrow from a bow. My waistcoat was cut through and through. I suppose my seal was worth two pounds.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I live at Ickenham. On the night of the 21st of September, I was watching some fruit which I had, and saw the three prisoners come out of the public house; I watched them, and saw them go into widow Woodman's hen house; I heard the fowls halloo. I saw them run with the fowls down the orchard. I went and got a constable; it was then between ten and eleven o'clock at night. We followed them across two or three fields. At about a quarter before one, on the morning of the 22nd, we met the two prisoners, Bray and Ing, coming towards Bray's house; we were lying in a cart shed, near the house. I told the constable, as soon as they came up that I would jump ever the pales, if he would run to the gate. I jumped over the pales, and took hold of both of them. Ing had eight fowls tied up in the lappels of his coat, and Bray had one. I did not see Lavender again, until<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250021"/>the next morning, at about six o'clock, when he was taken, as he was going to work.</p>

On the 13th of October, I was employed to watch at the door of the prosecutors,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250024"/>on account of a suspicion which was entertained against the prisoner; he came out of the shop at about ten minutes past seven; he went into the Sugar Loaf public house; I went in after him; he remained there ten minutes; he never was out of my sight. When he came out, I stopped him at the end of White Lyon street, I told him we suspected he had something about him what he ought not to have; we then took him into a public house, and in his coat pocket we found about a pound of ginger, loose, and about two pounds three quarters of currants in one breeches pocket, and the other was clammy and sticky, as in something of the same kind had been in that. He described his house as No. 8, Crabtree row, Bethnal Green; we went there, and found a quantity of candles, twine, sugar, a great quantity of sacking, and a sack, marked 4788; the twine and sugar were up stairs; the candles were part hanging up, and part concealed.</p>

I instantly turned round, and made a blow at him with a stick; instantly I heard him drop it. I immediately said, Mr. Ricketts, he has dropped it; pick it up. The prisoner then ran round and round, and the other people ran across me, and knocked the stick out of my hand. I pursued the prisoner, and took him, and delivered him to a watchman.</p>

I said, never mind, follow up your man, and take him; which he did. It was impossible for the prisoner to have got out of our sight. We never got the chain or seals since.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 29th of September, I met the two prisoners; Burke had a bundle; I took him, and Thompson ran off. I asked him what he had got? he said, he did not know, for he had just picked it up. I guessed it came from Shoreditch. I took him into the Sir John Falstaff, in Old street road. Kell, the landlord, wanted me to let him go; but I would not. He then took me by my coat, and made believe to be whispering in my ear, and then pushed me down between two chairs, into the fire. Burke then got off; but I got him again, and I afterwards apprehended the other prisoner.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM RUMBLE. I am a slop seller. On the 23rd of September, at about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and offered to sell a jacket, a pair of trowsers, and a handkerchief; he asked thirty shillings for them. I examined them, and knew them to be part of what I had sold to some one; I did not know exactly to whom; but I knew I had not sold them to the prisoner. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250027"/>aid, they were his own, and he had bought them at Plymouth. He then said, as I knew the clothes, he would tell the truth; he was selling them for another man. I told him if that was so, to leave the clothes in the shop, and fetch that man. He went out for the purpose of doing so, but never returned. In about two hours afterwards, the prosecutor came in to enquire, and then I shewed him the clothes, and described to him the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS. I apprehended the prisoner, and I produce the clothes.</p>

I had an order for half a load of hay, half a load of straw, two sacks of oats, and a sack of bran, to be delivered at Capt. Ridges's stables, in Princes Mews; I told the prisoner to execute this order. Having a suspicion of him, I placed myself in a loft, over my granary, in a situation which I could observe every thing that he did. He came into the granery, and put up a sack of my very best oats I had, and put into the cart; then he came and filled up Capt. Ridges's two sacks, and put them also into the cart with the bran; and then he put the hay and straw over them, which effectually concealed them. I then followed the cart, at a distance, to the stables, and told the governess of the charity school the circumstances; and she let me go up to one of her windows, where I could observe the prisoner, and watch Capt. Ridges's groom; I saw the three sacks of oats taken in by Walsh; I then went down, and taxed Walsh with having three sacks of oats, instead of two, but he strongly denied it. I then went into the loft and there I found them. When I came home, I told the prisoner that I had discovered this, and several other things against him, and I would give him a day to make all right. He then went away, but never returned, and soon after was taken by

There is an internal communication between the two houses, by a skylight. I went to bed at about eight o'clock, on the night of the robbery. I left the warehouse on the evening of that day, at about five. At the time I left the warehouse, the property was all safe. When I got up in the morning, In consequence of an alarm, at a few minutes after six, I found the padlock had been wrenched off, and the spring lock picked; it was just beginning to be day light; when I went into the warehouse, I missed a bale of kerseymere, one thousand three hundred and fifty yards of linen cloth, two hundred and eighty yards of woollen cloth, four hundred and eighty yards of woollen serge, a quantity of canvass, in which the things were packed, and five yards of rope.

            . Day had hardly broken when I was first alarmed. The door was fastened by one of Branthwaite's catch locks, and a padlock on the outside. When I got to the warehouse, the robbers had completely gone. There must be more than one concerned, for the largest parcel was so heavy, that it would require two or three strong persons to lift it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could one person have moved the smallest - A. Yes, if he had been a stout person.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these things which were stolen, on the ground floor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the warehouse, did you see any body - A. No, not a soul near. Our warehouse is about twenty yards from the corner; if six or eight good stout hands had been engaged, they might have got the property round the corner in a short time.</p>

            . I am a police officer. On the 16th of this month, I was at Kingsland, with Avery, a brother officer, at about half past four o'clock in the afternoon of that day, we were walking down Coffin Castle lane, and the prisoner was riding in a one horse cart. I asked him to give me and Avery a ride, for we were very tired; we got in; he said, he was going as far as the Thatched House, at Islington. As we were going along, I saw two pieces of Irish cloth laying at the bottom of the cart; I did not say any thing. He set us down at Scott's-place. We watched him. At this time, we had heard of this robbery. We saw him take a young woman into his cart, and then turn back again, towards Ball's Pond, and the Thatched House. We went into the parlour at the Thatched House, and found him, and the young woman, in company with a man, named 
               <persName id="t18151025-92-person736">

            . The prisoner at the bar, said to us, you have got here nearly as soon as I have. We told him we were officers, and must search him, on suspicion of a burglary, on account of the linen we had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this linen in the Thatched House - A. Yes, laying on the table in a handkerchief. I took care of the door whilst Avery searched the prisoner, in my presence. Henry said to me, do you think he is a smuggler; I said, no; sit you still, we will search you presently. I saw Henry searched, and on him were found ninety-six counterfeit three shilling tokens, and a number of notes, of Country Banks which have broken. I saw them all three searched, but nothing was found on them relative to this business. After the prisoner was searched, we took him to the watchhouse. We then went back to his house in Coffin Castle-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that it was his house - A.Because as we were coming along the lane, we saw the horse and cart in which he rode, standing at the door. I did not see the prisoner come out of the house, but I saw him come out of the yard, and get into the cart, and after that, we asked him for a ride. The house consists of two stories. I searched the top part first; I found three ends of kerseymere; I went into the bed room, and found some black serge in a drawer in the bed room; I found some buckram likewise. I then went down stairs, and found thirteen pieces of canvass under the stairs. I then went the next day. That was all we found that day. I went the next day with my brother officer; the prisoner's wife was in the house; I found one wooden packing case, and the boards of another; I found a rope with a noose bag hanging over a beam in a shed in the yard. We afterwards communicated to the prisoner what we had found, and he did not deny that this was his house.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. It might be an hour and a half after the prisoner left this house, that we searched it the first time. I never knew the man before, nor saw him, before I saw him get into the cart. The prisoner gave a true account of himself, so far as, that he said, he was going to the Thatched House, and so he did. He did not say he bought the linen, nor do I know what he said about it, nor whether any thing.</p>

            , that was the young woman's name. Upton held the door whilst I searched them all three; on the prisoner I found a two pound Bank of England note, which I returned to him. We took him to the watchhouse. We found nothing on either of them relative to this business. We then went to his house. I afterwards told him, we had been to his house. I saw what Upton found. He never denied that it was his house. The next morning we went there again, at about twelve o'clock; we found a packing case, and the boards of another, and the rope was hanging over them. In the front room, I found a phosphorus bottle; that was the last thing found. When we were coming along this lane the day before, I saw the cart and horse in which we afterwards rode, standing at the door of this house, where we found these things, and saw the prisoner come out of the gateway of that house, and get into the cart. We told him, we had been to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250032"/>house, and had found something that answered the robbery. He made no answer to what we said; he only smiled. We did not mention to him where the house was that we had searched. We only told him we had searched his house, and found these things, and he never denied that it was his house.</p>

I mean to say, that if I begin a noose of this kind, you will not find any one else that will finish it; I have knotted some hundreds in my life, and this one corresponds with those which I have knotted.</p>

            . That linen was open in the public house. We took up a person of the name of Hyams that very afternoon, but he was discharged; we also apprehended a Mrs. Faucett; we would have apprehended her husband, only he has absconded. On their premises we found two hundred picklock keys. Hayward said to us before we went to his house, I suppose you will go and search my house, be as delicate as you can on account of my wife. I did not hear any thing about his buying these things of a licensed hawker. We afterwards told him we searched his house.</p>
               <p>Richard Stubbs. This say, or serge, is a woollen cloth, used by the Priests in Portugal and Spain; it is an article of British manufacture, but not used in this Country. We lost the quantity of it stated in the indictment. I firmly believe this to be part of it. We have been a whole year having four pieces made.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing else you can swear to - A. As a packer, I know that buckram, like this is used only by packers for the purpose of packing up such cloth and things as we have lost. The kerseymere I know particularly, because here is the part where there has been a card pasted on; I know no other persons had such a large card upon it as we had; the kerseymere I can swear to; here is a pattern book, and one of the pieces corresponds with it in every respect, in pattern, in all the marks, even in the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. You don't supply all the tradesmen in Spain and Portugal - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say there is but one manufacturer of it - A. These are all made down in Essex; I don't know that there is another manufacturer; but I don't mean to say there is not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I keep livery stables; I take horses in to bait, and receive parcels for the Endfield and Winchmore Hill caravan. On the 18th, a licensed hawker put up at my stables, and the things that were found in my house, as well as the two pieces of linen I had in the cart, I bought of him, and the packing cases and the rope were in the shed by his putting there. Had I any guilty intention, or had I known that the linen in the cart was stolen, I should have hardly let these two gentlemen get into my cart.</p>

I became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, about two years ago; he first paid his address to me by letter. I married him on the 7th of May last, at St. George's Hanover square; he lived with me ten weeks, when he was apprehended for another crime. He had about four hundred pounds with me; the savings of my wages during the whole of my life, and I am now so reduced as to be obliged to go to service. He represented himself as a widower, and as having considerable property. He told me he had lost his wife some years by hard drinking.</p>

            . I live in Ratcliffe Highway, and am a linen draper. On the 24th, in the evening, at about seven o'clock, I understood that there were some suspicious characters about the door of my shop; I walked to the door, and saw three men standing; they went away, seeing I observed them. I then put on my hat, and followed them. When they got to Mr. Davis's shop, the smallest of the three, went in, and brought out a piece of cloth, and gave it to the prisoner; they were all in the same party. The prisoner put it under his great coat. I went across the street, and laid hold of him; another person had hold of his coat. He slipped out of his coat; but I had a hold of him by the breast; I held him fast. I do not know what became of the cloth; I never saw it since.</p>

He took the things, and went away. The next day, the prosecutor came, and asked me if I had seen Emanuel.

The ducks would not keep; but we have out off the wings; and I produce them, together with the shirt, waistcoat, and stockings.</p>

At about twenty minutes before four, on Friday last, I was returning from the Bank, with a friend of mine; it was an excessive wet day. Just by Bow Church, we felt several persons pressing upon us from behind. I was holding an umbrella over my friend's head. I remarked it to him, and looked back; when immediately they left off pressing. When we got some way up Cheapside, we felt them pressing again; I observed the prisoner on my left hand; I walked faster; he kept by my side, and did the same. I slackened my pace; he did the same. When we got to the end of Paternoster row, my friend crossed over, and I crossed to the East side of St. Paul's Church yard. Presently a young chap came up on my side, and made believe to be looking up in the air. When I got to the corner of Watling street, I thought I had got rid of them. I turned round to look which way they went, and saw them going in a direction towards Ludgate Hill. In a few minutes, to my surprize, I found the prisoner behind me.

I was in the act of going round the post, and I felt something at my pocket; I instantly turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief, going up the Old Change. The prisoner immediately said, there is your handkerchief, I picked it up in the street. I said, he had picked my pocket, and he said, it was a man in blue picked my pocket. There was nobody near but a sailor. The prisoner ran away: I followed him; he was stopped; I collared him, and brought him back, and delivered him and my handkerchief to Matthews.</p>

When we were parting, he bid me put my hand to his pocket, and feel, for he had ten pounds worth about him to serve his customers. I did feel, and felt a great weight.

            . On Friday, the 22nd of September last, I was in Tower-street, between five and six in the evening; I saw the man prisoner, gingling a three shilling token, which was bad, on the step of a door. I followed them up Mark lane, in company together; the man went into a baker's shop, the woman went in after him, and I stood on the outside; I saw him tender a three shilling token; it was refused. They joined again, and went through a court, which lead into Billeter-square; they then went into London Hall street; there the female prisoner went into a chandler's shop; the man stood outside, at about ten yards from the shop. She staid a very little time in the shop; when she came out, I went in.

She came out, and they immediately joined company again. I then went into the shop, and was shewn a three shilling piece, which I desired the young man in the shop to mark, and he marked it in my presence. I then followed the prisoners into Crutched Friars; there the woman sat on the step of a door, whilst the man went into a baker's shop. I saw him throw down a three shilling piece, which was refused; that was Moxey's. Then they joined company, and went into Mark-lane, from thence into Tower-street, where they went into a public-house; I followed them, and made some enquiry of the landlord. I followed them from thence into Thames-street; the man then went into a cook's shop, and came out almost directly; upon his coming out, they joined company again directly, and went into the Red House, Lower Thames-street. I went in, and observed the person, whom I thought to be the landlord, coming from the tap room towards the bar, with a three shilling piece in his hand. I asked him what the people had given him, and he shewed me the three shilling piece, which he said was a bad one, and in my presence he marked it, by my directions. I then apprehended the prisoners, who were in the tap room. I found nothing on the man; on the woman I found a counterfeit three shilling en in her right hand, and fourpence halfpenny in copper.</p>

The house where I sleep is divided into three dwellings, the one over the other. On the 25th of this month, at a few minutes before three in the morning, the two prisoners, Smedley and Bevers, came into the room where I sleep, and asked me for my money? I told them I had none. They asked me for some gold? I told them, what there was was about the shop, and then they went and looked for it. They then came and asked me for my burnishing stones. I did not know them before. Then they asked me where my box was. They got five burnishing stones. I told them my box was at the farther end of the shop. They went and broke open a little tea caddy that I had in the shop, which I used to keep my money in; there was no money in it then. I was then dressing myself, when they came to me, and called me a bl - dy b - r, and said, if I did not lie still, they would murder me. I laid still, until they had got out of the shop, and then I followed them down stairs; I put on my trowsers, my waistcoat, and my shoes; I followed them; when I got on the last landing, Bevers came up to me, and told me to go back; I told him, I would not. He told me a second time to go back? I told him I would not. He said, I'd be d - d if I would go back. Then he shoved me against the ladder, which stood on the landing, and then ran down stairs, and he got out, and left Smedley behind him; Smedley was inside the street door; I caught hold of him, and then somebody was pushing the outside of the door, to try to get Smedley out. Smedley then ran up stairs from the first landing on the outside of the house. I then ran out of the yard, and ran after him, and cried murder, and stopped him; he ran up Hemming's row then. When I was fighting with them at the top of the stairs, I got two of their hats; I do not positively know whose hats they were; there were W. B. in one, and a shirt and two muslin handkerchiefs. When I was scuffling with them, one of them caught me by the throat, and tried to gag me; that was Smedley; he got his hand in my mouth, and I bit his fingers. That same day I went out, I saw Smedley and Connor; Connor was an errand boy to my master. I followed them, until I met a man, and told him to mind where they went to, until I fetched Mr. Fitzgerald, who is a saddler, and has the manufactory below ours, in the same house. We pursued them, and took them just by Whitehall, in Parliament-street. I had not seen Connor at all that morning, until I saw him when we pursued and took him. I am an apprentice to Mr. Ingleton. They broke in, by breaking away some wooden bars over the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Beaver and Smedley - A. By the light of the moon, as I lay in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see their faces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure you saw both of them - A. Yes; they came close to my bed side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bevers. Q. What do you swear to me by - A. By your features.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD. All I know is, that when I arrived at about eight o'clock on the morning of the robbery, I found my premises broken open also; I am a saddler; my manufactory is on the same premises; it is a large factory and there are three floors; one door leads to the whole, but each has a separate door, my premises are under Mr. Ingleton's, where Butler sleeps. When I came there in the morning, at about eight o'clock, I perceived the door broken open, the second door of the entrance; there are two doors in the entrance; there is an outer door; then at the end of the passage there is another door, leading to the factories. It was the second door which was broken; and as I went up to the counting house, I perceived the window was open, and the different drawers all knocked about the floor; I had been robbed too. I found a hat which is here.</p>

            . I was sent for at about four o'clock on the afternoon after the robbery was committed. When I came into the workshop, there was Connor and Smedley, whom they gave into my charge. I then took them to St. Martin's watchhouse; and got information where the third man was to be found, at No. 30, Orchard street, Westminster. I took another with me, and went and found out the room in which he lived, and found him at home; he was at tea. I asked him if he knew any one of the name of Smedley or Connor? he hesitated, and then said he knew them a little. Then I told him what I came upon, and that he was suspected to be one of the party. With that I took him into custody, together with the hat, and brought him to St. Martin's. I found out on Thursday, that five burnishing stones were pledged in Smith street, Westminster. The pawnbroker is here.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Fitzgerald came in the morning to Bow street and stated the particulars of the robbery, and I went with him. On examining the premises, I found that a sort of railing, which runs over the outer door, and along the lower part of the premises was broken; and when two or three bars of this were removed, there would be room for a man to get in without disturbing the fastening of the outer door. Then you turn to the left, and there is a staircase, at the bottom of which, there is a strong door before you come to Mr. Fitzgerald's door. A considerable part of the wood of this door was cut away, to get at a strong lock, so as to shove it open. Then the stair case is open to the top of the house. On coming to Mr Fitzgerald's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250039"/>factory door, there is a place large enough to admit a hand to the inside, where I am given to understand the persons in his employment hang the key, for each others convenience. This door had not been broken, but had been opened with the key; then they can go from there up another flight of stairs to Mr. Ingleton's; Mrs. Ingleton's warehouse is made secure by a flap door, so that that was forced, and by that means, the bolt pushed up. When Butler goes up of a night, he bolts this after him, and then nobody can get in there without bursting this flap door up. These things were given to me. (Witness here produced two neckerchiefs, one shirt, and a hat, marked on the inside W. B. another old hat, a tinder box, and a dark lanthorn.) I went in search of the prisoners, and whilst I was gone, they were taken.</p>

            . I made this trap door fast, and put the keys on the inside, and went to bed at half after nine. When I examined it the next morning, I found that the staple was forced, and laying some distance from the trap door, and the keys which I always leave in the lock, to prevent any one putting false keys in, were taken out. The shirt and two handkerchiefs belong to Mr. Fitzgerald. I found one of these hats inside the door, and the other directly I got out, it was upon the premises; I do not know whose hats they are.</p>
               <p>- Fitzgerald. I found one hat in my counting house. The key of my factory was generally hung up on the inside, in a place where the workmen could get it, to let themselves in of a morning. I know the shirt and the handkerchiefs to be my property. I had left them in a trunk on my premises. The new hat which was found at Bevers's, is mine.</p>

               <p>Cross examined. I did not take the letter to the Post Office. The letter was missed about three weeks after this. I recollect that letter positively, by a reference to a letter book, which I keep; that letter book is in the carriage at the door of the Court. I never took a double letter paid before, to Mrs. Simpson. I certainly don't know, but by a reference to that book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Go to the carriage and get the book.</p>
               <p>Miss. Currer. I sent a double letter three or four weeks after the miscarriage of this; but never before the 11th of July, to Mrs. Simpson. I heard the first letter had miscarried before I sent the second.</p>

            . I am Post mistress, at Skipton. The Post Office through which the letters go before they come, some is kept by John Hart, who is a quaker. I received the bag from his Office on the 12th of July. (A paper put into the hands of the witness.) That is a bill of all letters sent to and received from Darnley, on the 12th of July. There is an item here which shews me that there was apart paid double letters from Gargrave to London; there is the sum of one shilling and ten-pence opposite it, which is put there as the sum paid, and which is the amount of the double postage of a letter from Gargrave to London. Part of this bill is made by me; that is the part relative to letters sent by me to Gargrave; the other part is made by Hart, and is the account of letters sent from Gargrave to me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Submitted that the man who wrote this himself, ought to be called.</p>
               <p>THE COURT. Ruled that, that was not necessary; for the evidence of this witness, as to the identity of Hart's hand writing, was quite sufficient.</p>

Had it not come, or had not the one shilling and tenpence been paid, I should have taken notice of it, and have written upon it. I afterwards made up the bag from Skipton to London, and made up the list of the letters. (List put into the hands of the witness.) That is the list; the amount of paid letters is four shillings and eight-pence; that is including the double paid letter from Gargrave.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Q. D. C. C.? what does that mean - A. That is the mark expressing double.</p>
               <p>Q. It does not express how many double letters there were? could it not have been a double letter to some place from Gargrave, but not to London, the postage of which would be elevenpence - A. No; two double letters would be more.</p>

               <p>ANNAND VESTRIS. I am a dancer to the Opera House. My benefit was on the 20th of July; the Public were respectfully informed by advertisements, that they might be supplied with tickets on their application at my house, at No. 11, in the Haymarket. I remember some application to me relative to the subject of a bank note, supposed to have passed from me to Mr. Price.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that a bank note was sent to Mr. Price's to be changed. I don't know that there was. I have a recollection of a person paying me a twenty-pound bank note in payment for some tickets; that person was a stranger; he was dressed in a blue coat, and a yellow waistcoat, and I believe he might have nankeen trowsers on; but I am not sure; he asked me for four pit tickets, and gave me a twenty pound note; I was to take two pounds, and return him eighteen pounds; I could not return him the eighteen pounds, and sent out for change; I gave it to

            . I am a servant to the last witness. I recollect his delivering to me a twenty pound note to get changed, on a Monday, in July. I took that note to Mr. Price's, and got it changed. I saw a person in the room with Mr. Vestris, with the appearance of a gentleman; but I don't remember that it was the prisoner. I believe he had the dress on that has been described by Mr. Vestris. I took the note to Mr. Price's, and got it changed; I returned the change to Mr. Vestris, and the same person was then with him.</p>

               <p>EAMUND WELLS. I am a clerk in the Two-penny Post Office. I know the prisoner. I remember Mr. Ventris's benefit. The prisoner offered me a ticket to go it; it was a ticket to the pit. He said the tickets were given to him by his uncle, in Arundel-street. I do not know his name; but I believe it to be Piper. The prisoner gave me the ticket, and told me he would meet me at the Opera House. He said, he would ask his uncle for a ticket for Mr. Tomlinson. This was on the morning of the 18th. I went to the Opera House, and saw Mr. Tomlinson, and a lady there; but I don't know who she was. I do not know that I took particular notice of the dress of the prisoner about that time. He some times used to wear a blue coat, and nankeen pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. There is nothing particular in a young man like him wearing a blue coat and nankeen trowsers at that time of the year; I have a blue coat myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that paper, (paper put into the hands of the witness,) Is that signature of his name, his hand writing - A. It is.</p>

               <p>Q.You saw Seabrook sign a paper, but whether it was this or no, you can't tell - A. I certainly think it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus, as counsel for the prisoner, objected that this paper, (which purported to be a confession taken in writing from the prisoner's month,) could not be admitted in evidence, until the signature of the prisoner's name affixed to it, was proved to be his hand writing; as in all other cases where documentary evidence was adduced, the handwriting of the person whose name appeared affixed, ought to be proved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin, contra-contended. First, that this must be taken for granted as the prisoner's hand writing, for it was the magistrate's duty not to sign it until he had seen it signed by the prisoner. Secondly, the last witness, Sexton, had sworn he had seen the prisoner sign it, though if he had not, he could not perhaps have sworn to his hand writing. If seeing a man sign a paper was not proof of the identity of his hand writing, half the documentary evidence ever adduced, would be invalid. Suppose the case of a person who could not write, and therefore affixed some mark, why, one could swear to one mark from another; but if they saw a certain person make a certain mark, they might surely be enabled to prove that it was his.</p>
               <p>COURT. This witness has said, I know Mr. Henderson's hand writing; one of those signatures is his; I saw the prisoner sign that paper also. That is quite proof enough of the prisoner's signature.</p>
               <p>(The paper was now read, and appeared to be a confession taken from the prisoner on his examination, and the same in effect, as what he first made to the witness Sexton, and which appears upon his examination.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent, and never knew what the meaning of signing was.</p>

On Wednesday evening, at about eight o'clock, a knock came to my door; which the servants answered; one of them came up, and had hardly got into the drawing room to deliver her message, whatever it was, before I heard the banging of the door. The servant went to the head of the stairs, and immediately returned, exclaiming,</p>
               <p>"the coats, a man;" that was all she said. I instantly ran down stairs.</p>

A great box coat, belonging to Mr. Pheipher; it was hanging up a little after five o'clock, when I hung up my own; there was also a silk umbrella, belonging to my brother. I ran into the street, and soon after, I saw a man near Thames-street, coming down St. Andrew's Hill, with a coat in his possession. I was returning, thinking the pursuit fruitless, when I met him coming in a direction from my house; by the colour of this coat, I thought it was Mr. Pheipher's; I seized the man, who was the prisoner, and asked him how he came by that coat; he said. he picked it up at the top of the street, pointing up St. Andrew's Hill. I said, if you found it. I will shew you where you took it from; the back of my house runs into Addle Hill. I took him in the back door, and the servant immediately said, that is the man, in his presence. Upon that, I immediately sent for a constable of the Ward. He denied he was the person, and said he picked up the coat. Now, the weather was very dirty; and had he picked up the coat, it must also have been so.</p>

            . I was called up at about eight o'clock in the evening, by a knock at the street door; the person to whom I opened the door, was the prisoner; he came within the door; when he came in, I am confident there were two great coats and an umbrella hanging up in the hall. I can't swear there was more. He said, he came from Mr. Gould, a hatter, on Ludgate Hill, for a hat to be cleaned. I had some recollection that I had seen that name up. I asked him to wait until I went to enquire. I observed the person's features when I was speaking to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round the court, and tell me if you can see him in court - A. Yes; there he is, (pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion - A. I rather doubted, but was under no alarm. About two minutes after, I went up to the drawing room where my master was. I heard the door slam. I immediately ran to the top of the stairs; the person was gone; I cried out, oh! the coats! a man! I missed the coats. In a few minutes, my master ran out, in pursuit, and in about five minutes he returned with the prisoner, whom I know to be the man. I saw the coat my master brought back; I knew it to be one of the coats that was hanging up in the hall. None of the other coats nor the umbrella has been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person who knocked at the door; but I would wish to know whether she shut the door after that person came in - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then you shut the door while that person was in the passage - A. Yes, while you were in the passage.</p>

On this evening I had been at a friend's, and was returning home, when just by St. Andrew's passage, I saw a great coat laying at the step of a door; the passage is always clean, because very few people go through it. I picked up this coat, and when I got to the bottom of the passage, that gentleman stopped me, and took me to his house, and then they did not know whether there was any more goods in the hall or not.</p>

After the races, I made up the bill, and told the prisoner to go to Mr. De Fontaine; the bill was my hand writing. (A receipt produced.) That receipt is the prisoner's hand writing. On his return, he said, he had not received all the money for the bills he had taken out, but he should receive the whole on Monday morning; and then he would account with me. After that, he absconded. On enquiry, I got that receipt from Mr. De Fontaine, who said, he had paid the prisoner. I found by further enquiry, that he had received upwards of one hundred pounds, for which he had given receipts. I never received a halfpenny from him.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came into my house, at about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 27th of September; she wanted a pint and a half of beer; I gave it her in a quart pot, and she was to take the pot home with her. She said she was going to take it to Nicholl's, the barber's, in the one pair of stairs back room. I asked her where the people who did live there gone? She answered they were; she went past Nicholl's door, and I watched her into a house, at the further end of Short's gardens, I though she wanted to steal my pots, and I got a constable. We went into the two pair of stairs back room, and found her melting the pot on the fire, I saw the handle fall out, which I could swear to.</p>

In the back room, there is an escritoir; I had seen a bunch of rings on an orange ribbon in that escritoir and two watches without glasses, on Monday the 18th. On Saturday the 23rd, the prisoner came down to me saying that he wanted the key of the drawing room door, to paint the edge of the door on the outside, which he could not do unless the door was opened; I said I would come and open the door myself, which I did. After I had done so, he related to me what direction Miss Thornton had given him about the back drawing room on the Wednesday preceding; it was to make good some places where the paint had been chipt off. He had paint to do the front drawing room door, but he had not paint to do the back drawing room. There is a door between them, which door was shut, but not locked. He came down to me in a very few minutes afterwards, he brought the key, but not to me; I was not in the servant's hall at the time; I afterwards went up and found the door locked. - He did not come on the Monday morning to his work at the usual time; I saw him on the premises at about a quarter before twelve. My seting him then, was in consequence of an information I received from one of the painters that somebody had gone up the back staircase; the prisoner had no business up there whatever. When I saw him there, I asked him what he wanted? he was up about fifteen stairs on the first landing place. He replied to my questions, putting his hand before his face, and appearing very much confused, that he did not wish to be seen, as he had been a bad boy, in getting tipsey, and not coming to his work. He then came down stairs, and said he would come to work in the afternoon, after dinner; that would be in about an hour, but he never came. On the Wednesday following, Limbrick the officer, and his master came to me; and in consequence of something they told me, I went to the escritoir in the back drawing room, and then I missed the watches and rings. The escritoir was not locked; it was not usually locked, on account of the lock being out of repair.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. The key of the front drawing room, was usually kept in the housekeeper's room; it was sometimes in the possession of one servant, and sometimes of another; there were sometimes five or six other painters at work on the premises beside the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker. I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him on the morning of Tuesday the 26th of September. He came into my room as I lay in bed, it was before eight o'clock in the morning; he asked me was I in bed yet? I told him I was; he shewed me a ring on his little finger; I asked him where he had got that from? his reply was, don't you know I am a gentleman. He afterwards said, if I have any money I will give you some gin, and if you will come along with me I will give you some; there was another man in the room. We went out with the prisoner, and he went across Soho square to a pawnbrokers in Princes street, I believe the name is Bartram; in our way there, he shewed me a bunch of rings tied on an orange ribbon, and two watches without glasses to them. I saw him go into the pawnbroker's house, and when he came out, he said he had pledged a ring for twelve shillings. We then went and drank together the greater part of that day; the next day he came to me, and called me a b - y thief, and accused me of robbing him of his money and watch. There was a violent dispute about it between us, and he charged me with a constable, but I was discharged He did not finally take me before a magistrate, but accused me several times in the street. I after that went to Limbric and told him what I have been telling here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never knew him as a gentleman, nor any body else, I believe.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did he tell you how he came by these rings and watches - A. He said he had made a good haul at the gentleman's house where he had been at work.</p>

            . I am a salesman, I live in Swallow street; I produce a ring (producing it.) I received that ring from the prisoner at the bar, on Friday the 22nd of September. He came to me at about five o'clock in the evening of that day, and asked me to lend him one shilling and sixpence; I hesitated at it; he then took the ring off his finger, and said, there was security for me, I need not be afraid; he said he would call and pay me the next night, but he did not. I saw him at the beginning of the following week, when he called and asked me to lend him three shillings and sixpence more, and that would make it five shillings, and he would call on the Friday following, when he got his pension, and pay me, and buy something of me. On the Sunday I was reading the paper, and saw his name, and then I went to Bow street. It was a mourning ring.</p>

            , Esq. M. P. It is impossible to identify one mourning ring from another; Mr. Reakes's son married my daughter, and upon her death, both Mrs. Thornton and myself were presented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250046"/>with similar mourning rings. The ring given to myself, is now in my possession; that given to Mrs. Thornton was in this escritoir, where all the other rings were kept; the other ring belongs to Mary Ann Reakes, and was in the escritoir with the others; it was given to her on the death of her cousin. There were also two watches, without glasses in this escritoir; they cost about ten guineas a piece; their present value I am not so well able to speak to; but I know they are worth seven or eight guineas the two.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the bill department at the Victualling Office, Somerset House. When bills are drawn by his Majesty's officers, they are left in a box at the office for acceptance. (Forged bill put into the hands of the witness.) I look at this, and remember to have found it in the the box, as I described, on the 2nd of June. I find an entry made upon it, of</p>
               <p>"the 3rd of June," which entry I made myself. (Reads.)</p>
               <p>"On the 3rd of June, ordered to be accepted from the 2nd of June, and charged as interest against Captain Kerr."

               <p>"not paid," and my initials,</p>
               <p>"W. B." are affixed to those words; there are also the initials</p>
               <p>"T. R." which I believe to be the initials of Mr. Richardson; he checks my examination, and these initials are indicative of his check,</p>
               <p>"W. Gosling, ordered to be accepted," is also written on the bill; that is his hand writing; I have also,</p>

So instructed, I went to the place which he directed me; I was asked the questions which he pre-supposed to me that I should be asked, and I gave the directed answers.

            ; the bill then purported to be accepted. (Forged bill put into the hands of the witness.) That is the bill; my signature is affixed to it, which I did when Mr. Twedie gave me the draft upon the Bank of England for the payment of the amount. When I so received the bill, I gave it to Bradford; he, and I, then walked into the City together; then we parted. He called upon me, on the 5th of July, at my father's house, and requested I would call upon him that day at Somerset House, before two o'clock. I went accordingly to his request. He then gave me that bill, and directed me to go into a certain apartment for a case. I did not then know what the case meant. He pointed out the appartment. I went, and gave in the bill, and got it back affixed to the case; the bill was wafered to the case. (Case put into the hands of the witness.) That is the case to which the bill was wafered when delivered to me. I was then directed by the gentleman from whom I got it, to go to Mr. Twedie, but I went to the prisoner, who accompanied me to the outside of the door of Mr. Twedie's office, and as it was past two o'clock, directed me, if Mr. Twedie should object to pay the bill on account of its being past the hour of business, to say, he would oblige me by paying it at that time, as I came a considerable distance. I then went to Mr. Twedie; he made the objection, on account of its being past two o'clock; I made the directed reply, and received the draft from Mr. Twedie to prevent my having the trouble of calling again. On my coming out, Bradford was in the hall, and I gave him the check.</p>
               <p>Q. What is on the back of the draft, (putting the draft into the hands of the witness,) - A.</p>
               <p>"Received for George Guy, 7, Montague place, Russel square. George Williams." When I delivered that draft to the prisoner, no such writing as that was upon it. There is no part of that my hand writing. We then went to the Bank together; I saw him write something upon a piece of paper, which I supposed was the description of the notes he wished the check to be paid in; I remember he received a five hundred pound note, for I heard the clerk say what notes he wanted. After he was paid, we walked together as far as the end of Leadenhall-street, and there we parted. I never have received any gratuity or recompence in any way whatever for this business which I transacted for the prisoner.</p>

I hold in my hand the order I gave the presenter for eight hundred and sixty-eight pounds, and a separate order for nine shillings and sixpence.</p>

I recollect a person coming to our house, on the 5th of July, in the present year, to redeem a silver watch, which had been pledged; the principal and interest of which amounted to one pound nine shillings and seven pence; he tendered in payment this note, (producing a note,) which I changed, deducting the amount, and delivering him the watch, together with the change; he put on the front of the note, Mr. Smith, 7, Oxford street, Whitechapel, and that was the name in which the watch was pledged; (turning to a book.)

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Drury-lane; it was so on the 19th of September. When I came back to my box, after calling three o'clock to the extent of my beat, I went into it. Presently I heard a great knocking, I then went out of my box, and walked up and down, and I came up to the Mogul, which is M'Neal's, and found the knocking was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Mogul from your box - A. The second house. I came to the door, and put my hand to the door, and it was fast. I drew back then, and stood up against the side of the house, and left my lanthorn in my-box. and harkened to the knocking all the time. In the course of a quarter of an hour. I heard a person coming to the door, and undoing the bolts, taking the bar off. I then drew back from the door about three or four yards, and the person opened the door, and out the prisoner came with a bundle under one arm, and a quartern loaf under the other. and a bottle in his hand, with as good as half a pint of liquor in it, with his thumb in it for a cork. As soon as he had got as far as the curb stone, I collared him; I walked with him across the street, and asked him what he had in the bundle, and he said, his clothes. I asked him what he had in the bottle, and he said, sugar and water. I called the private watch to my assistance. I put my hand to the door where the prisoner came out of, and it was open We then knocked at M'Neal's to awaken them, and down stairs they ran. I gave the prisoner in custody to the private watchman, while I went into the house. While I was undoing the bolts to let M'Neal's people down into the tap-room, I heard the bottle go smack upon the stones, and away he ran; the private watchman ran after him. I saw them both running along the street; I caught him myself, in Coach and Horses yard, Drury lane, and then I took him to the watch-house.</p>

By this time, the prisoner came out of the shop, and was passing between the door post and my knee, and I held him there, and let the other go; I had a child two years old in my arms, but held the prisoner until such time as the officer was sent for. My hall door is always open, for the accomodation of my lodgers. There is a wainscot divides the shop from the passage; this wainscot is all in one piece, and was secured by two spike nails; it was six feet long, and five feet high; the space between the top of it and the ceiling is filled up with shelves; no person could get over the top of it; one end of it locks into a piece of wood. This wainscot was forced in from the bottom, and by that means, part of the piece of wood into which it locks, was forced off. The prisoner was coming out upon his hands and knees where the wainscot was shoved in at the bottom.</p>
