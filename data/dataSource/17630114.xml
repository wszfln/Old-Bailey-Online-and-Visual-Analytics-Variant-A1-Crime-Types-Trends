I had reason to suspect her robbing us, my wife had lost half a guinea out of her pocket from under the pillow, and we had found our drawers open, and missed money at several times; the prisoner was taxed with taking the money, she confest to the taking a half guinea; (that is not in the indictment) she gave warning to go away, and when she was going, I asked her for the key of her box, that I might see what was in it; it being too dark to look then, I let her take the key away, but she left the box; the next morning a woman, whom she called sister, brought me the key; the woman said she had forced the key from her, then we opened the box and found the things mentioned in the indictment, except the two cotton apron which were found by her direction at a pawnbroker's, mentioning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140003"/> them by name) then we sent for the prisoner, she owned they were not her property.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon that?</p>
               <p>Hill. I did not send for a constable, my wife persuaded me to the contrary. She pleaded with and said she was big, and my wife being child herself, would fain have excused her it on her power, but I would not agree to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money given?</p>
               <p>Hill. I know no farther than what my wife told me, which was, that she had received 2 guineas and a half of the prisoner, for the money she had taken from out of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this told you?</p>
               <p>Hill. My wife told me this some time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she permitted to go away that day without being taken into custody?</p>
               <p>Hill. She was, and she went to some house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she remain in that house?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe it might be about a month before I took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Hill. I took her up the 27th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take her up then?</p>
               <p>Hill. Because I could not be quiet in my house for her, she came abusing and threatening me, threatening to pull my sign down, and to get a constable for me, otherwise I should not have meddled with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How does this agree with what you said your wife persuaded you not to prosecute her, and you would not agree to it?</p>
               <p>Hill. Had she gone away I believe I should not have taken her up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with her when you did take her up?</p>
               <p>Hill. I carried her before Sir

               <p>Q. Did you consent for her to go away?</p>
               <p>Hill. I never did for or against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this money been returned to the prisoner since?</p>
               <p>Hill No, my wife has kept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she had taken the things that were found at the pawnbrokers?</p>
               <p>Hill. She did. They were found at Mr. Keats, a pawnbroker, in Charles-street, on the 23d of Nov.</p>
               <p>Racheal Hill. I am wife to the prosecutor. I missed several things during the time the prisoner was with me, unknown to my husband, 14 handkerchiefs from out of my drawers, and a great many other things, and money at several times, half guineas at a time, and silver. On the day that she would go away, she came to me, and said, Here is the key of my box, see that I have not got any of your things. I called my husband, and said, Here is your maid going away, she wants you to look in her box. The woman that brought the key was there; she said, Sally confess, for I know you are a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>R. Hill. This was on the 23d of Nov. in the afternoon between 4 and 5 o'clock; before we knew what was in the box, she and the woman went up with my husband to look in the box. I staid below, they came down again, and my husband said it was too dark to look into it, and that they had not looked in it; they went away. The next day, that woman came with the key, and said she would have us look into the box, and certainly we should find some of our things in it, She said, She has been a notorious girl to you. She, I, and another woman, and a gentleman, went to the box; I opened it, there I found the things mentioned in the indictment, except the 2 cotton aprons, which were found at the pawnbrokers. ( Produced in court and deposed to) I desired the woman that she called sister to go and bring her; she did: then the prisoner went on her knees, and begged hard, and said, If I would let her go, she would go to Bath, and never come here any more. My husband and I had a great many words about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the two aprons?</p>
               <p>R. Hill. She owned she took them out of my drawers, and pawned them for 4 s. with that money she bought a pair of shoes. I desired her to tell me, where my shifts and other things were, and said, if she would I would get her out of the way of her master. I said, how much money have you got? it is very hard I should be robbed in this manner; she said, she had none. My husband went to see his Majesty go to the house in his new coach, and in his absence they begged of me to take 2 guineas and an half, and the sister and she said, she would go out of London and never be seen here any more. After that she never would tell me where my things were, but came abusing me and my husband, and said, I encouraged her in this thing; then her master declared, he would not be kept off from prosecuting her any longer. I said, it would kill me to have her taken up; he said, if it killed me he would take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell your husband you had taken the money?</p>
               <p>R. Hill. I told him the same afternoon. He said, if I took an hundred guineas, he would answer to none of it, he would screen no roguery of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140004"/> that kind. What I did was out of pity; I did not think I was doing any thing amiss.</p>

I was sitting on the right hand side, I observed a fellow running on the left hand side with a pistol in his hand, I conceived it was a foot-pad, I prepared to give him my money. He came and opened the coach-door, and demanded my money; I gave it him directly. There were some halfpence which covered the gold and silver; he said, you gave me nothing but copper, and threatened to blow my brains out, if I did not give him gold; I said, I had given him all I had. He threatened me thus four or five minutes. Then the other door of the coach was opened, and Delany appeared and put a pistol to my wife's breast, and threatened her and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Delany?</p>
               <p>Toulmin. I am, I swore to him before Sir John Fielding. As to Collins, I have no doubt of his being the other, by his since confessing the fact to me, and he being of the size of the man that attacked me first. As Delanywas holding his pistol to my wife, I shifted my seat, and addressed myself to him, and assured him, I had given his all I had about me, and that I had a case and snuff-box, which he was welcome to, be refused them; then I shewed him my silver salve-box, which he took. I had no sooner delivered it, but I heard a coach coming; Delany that the coach-door, and the other d - d the coachman, and said, if he did not drive on, he would blow his brains out; then he drove on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you?</p>
               <p>Toulmin. They were with us about five or six minutes.</p>

             the next morning, I was positive to him. Collins there confessed the fact, and desired I would transport him. I was robbed on Friday evening, and I saw him at Sir John's on Saturday about 2 in the afternoon. My salve-box was there produced by a constable, and I swore to it; there is my name engraved upon it (producing it). I asked Collins, what share he had of the money? he said, he had only a quarter of a guinea.</p>

I said, to Hackney; he said, Are you going with ladies or gentlemen? after I had answered him he went away, and in about 10 minutes came back again, and said, I wish you a good night; he went about forty yards, and one of the prisoners called him back, he said, What do you want? the man said, Come hither, I want you; the bo y went back to them before they were got by the horses. Mr. Toulmin's door was opened, they got into the coach, and I drove on; I saw the boy and them go along before me up the road, I drove a good pace, bye and bye I overtook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140005"/> them just by the crossing: Delany and the boy crossed over before the horses heads; something was said, I could not understand what, at last I heard Delany say stop, and pulled out a pistol, he came from the right hand side and made a snatch at my horse's head, he missed them, then he commanded me to stop; then Collins opened the door and demanded their money, they gave him some; I heard him say, here is nothing but a parcel of halfpence; Mr. Toulmin told him there was a guinea amongst it: then Delany goes and opened the other door, Mr. Toulmin told him he had given the other all he had, and that he had nothing more but a salve box, one of them took it, I do not know which, then they bid me go on; another coach was then coming down upon us: I walked my horses about 7 yards, they followed me with a pistol, and said, If I did not drive on they would shoot me; then I was obliged to drive on as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Witworth. It was light enough to see them both to know them; it was very moon-light, as light as ever I saw the moon shine in my life.</p>

               <p>Witworth. It was about 7 o'clock. The next morning I took another man with me, and went in pursuit of them: I went down Ratcliff-highway, and upon Salt-petre-bank, when I came near White chapel church, I saw a mob of people, I went to them, they said they had got a highwayman, and they had found a box upon him with Mr. Toulmin's name on it; said I, that is the man I want: I went into a room, there I saw Delany; I said, that was the man that robbed Mr. Toulmin last night.</p>

               <p>Witworth. This was about 11 o'clock; this was at the man in the moon alehouse; he was asked where he was last night; all he said was, No matter where I was. After that I heard there were 2 more taken on new-year's-day at night. I went on the Monday morning to New-prison, and asked for the 2 prisoners that came in on the Saturday night; the keeper asked me which I wanted; I said, let me see them both, i'll tell you which I want; Collins was brought first, I said, that was the man I wanted, he robbed my coach.</p>

Mr. Robertson, I, and Mr. Mustow, went there and took Delany in bed, we also found a pistol under his bed. After we brought him to the watch-house he was searched, and we found this salve box in his breeches under his ham, he had been asked about the box before we searched him, and he denied having any.</p>
               <p>John Seward. Delany came into my house about a quarter of an hour past twelve at night, the last day or the old year, he asked for lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. What sign do you keep?</p>

               <p>Seward. No sign at all. He came by himself, he drop't a powder horn, and endeavoured to conceal it under a chair; as soon as he was gone to bed, which was about 2 o'clock, I took it up; I supposed him to be a foot-pad all the time he was sitting there, having seen a pistol under his arm. I went to the watch-house, and brought the constable of the night and 2 watchmen with me, and took him up on suspicion; the pistol was found under his bed, and was charged 3 fingers high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Seward. I never saw him before to my knowledge I had seen him have a silver salve box, he shewed it about the room, he said he was a doctor; we had some meat for supper, he was going to put some salve upon it, made me think he was no doctor. After he was carried from the man in the moon to the watch-house, I went there, and told them he had such a box about him, they searched and found this box, here produced, upon him.</p>

I saw my black gelding in my ground, and the next morning he was missing; the gate, that had been tied with a rope, I found open, and the rope cut: I could get no intelligence of him till the Sunday sen'night after, then a woman came to me, and said a man told her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140007"/> he had heard Hcaworth waggoner say, the prisoner had been in the country, and sold a horse for half the value of him: the said, he comes up every Friday to the Oxford Arms in Warwick-lane, and that he commonly calls at the half-way house between Knightsbridge and Kensington. I went there, and met him: he told me, he had heard as she had said: I desired him to enquire farther about it the next journey; and, as I was there to meet him, it became dark, I went out to look if he was coming, there stood the prisoner, this was on the 10th of Dec.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you employ him in?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In doing labouring business. I said, at you? He said, Yes, master; said I, you are the man I wanted to see. I took him into the house, and called for some liquor, and said, Now, William, tell me what you have done with my house; he said, Master, I know nothing of him. I said, I heard you had him in the country, and sold him for 3 l. 10 s. at Marlborough fair; he said, he sold one for that money, but that was not mine. I asked him, how he came by the money to buy that? he was at a loss for an answer. I took him into another room, then he said, if I could raise a little money, he believed he could fetch the horse he sold: I said, if it is not my horse what should I raise money for; he said but little to it.

            , the waggoner, then the prisoner said, I'll tell you the truth, it was your horse sure enough. Said I, what time did you take him? he said, about 10 at night. Said I, did you take the bridle and sadle first, or the horse first? he said, he took the bridle and sadle first, and rode him to Slough that night. I said, was he not lame, having lost a shoe behind? he said, he had him shoed there, and that he was not very lame. Then I got a constable, and took him to New-prison. I asked him, who he sold him to? he said, he did not know, but one Mr. Johnson was there at the time, and he knew the man very well. I went down in the country to Mr. Johnson as he directed; he recommended me to the buyer; the buyer told me he had changed him away, and went along with me to the man that had him, where I found him; It was one farmer Soaper, near Andover. We went before a Justice, there I swore to my horse, and the Justice ordered the horse to be delivered to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Waters. I live with Lady Essex. I stopped at London Wall with some acquaintance drinking. and got rather too much liquor; I wanted to take a coach in Bishopsgate-street, but could not get one. Going up <placeName id="t17630114-12-crimeloc60">Shoreditch</placeName>

I asked her, what kind of a room she had? she gave it a very good character, and said, she would use me very well. I went with her to her room, then she asked me what I would give her to drink? I said, what she liked she should have; she said, she would only have a quartern of gin. Then I said, I would go to bed; said she, you will pay me for the room first; I asked her, what she must have? she said, half a crown; I said, I would not give her above 18 d. she agreed. Then I went to bed, she began to undress herself, and I fell asleep in a minute or two I believe; then she took my buckles out of my shoes, my watch, and about 7 s. in money, and this hat that I have in my hand; one of the buckles was left under the pillow: when I awaked there was no body in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took the things, you did not see her?</p>
               <p>Waters. She was found drunk, rolling in the channel, a person went to take her to a public house, and the watchman hearing a knocking at a door, went and took her to the watch-house, as I was afterwards informed, there my things were found upon her. There came two watchmen to me and awaked me, I was surprized and did not know where I was; they told me, I had been robbed; I went to search my breeches, and found no money left; I went to the watch-house with them, and there I found the prisoner, my watch, one buckle, and my hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blisset. I am constable. Between 11 and 12 at night, I think the 15th of November, two of our watchmen brought the prisoner into the watch-house, in a very dirty condition. I said, what have you brought here? We took her in; she had a black cloak or capuchine on, under which I saw a laced hat. I said, what have you got here? how came you by this hat? Said she, it is my husband's. Said I, is your husband a gentleman's servant? Yes, said she, but what is that to you? I said, I had a suspicion she had taken it from somebody, and ordered the men to search her pocket. She pulled out the key of her room. I saw the string of a watch hang out. Said I, you have a watch there. She said, yes, and what is that to you? Then in searching we found an odd silver buckle. I asked her where her husband lived? She said here and there, and gave very different accounts. Some of our watchmen happened to know that she lodged in Shoreditch, I sent them to find her lodging out, and gave them her key; they went and found her lodging, and this man in bed asleep, they brought him with them; he owned the things we found upon her.

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether I did not deliver them, and the key of the room to go and fetch the man?</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar was coming by our door in March last, I cannot tell the exact day, it was in the morning about half an hour after 6 o'clock; she asked me if I would have my fortune told, I said, no; I was opening my windows, she said, there is your sweetheart coming; she told me she had a great deal to tell me for my good; I would have nothing to say to her; I went in and lighted my fire and made my kettle boil, and going out for some sugar I met her again at my door, she said, Young woman I have been home and examined my books, and find there is a great deal of money hid in your house; said I, I do not believe there is; said she, I am no jew, nor no gypsey; I am the 7th daughter of a West India woman, and I wish the d - I may take me alive, and that God may never receive my soul into heaven, if I am not telling you the truth. I was going to shut the door, to shut her out, being frighted, she laid hold, and held the door as I pushed it; she said, but well young woman I am with child, and I wish the child and I may never be parted if I am not telling you the truth. I thought no human person could make such protestations, and wish such wishes to what was false; so I took her in, then she said, there was a captain died and left a great deal of money, and it is in your house; and before she told me, I must tell her what money I had about me; I pulled out some money, she said she knew I had that, but that was not all that I had in my pocket, that I had got there something more either silver or gold; I having broke one of my silver buckles and sent that to be mended, I had the fellow to it in my pocket, I thought then she did know a great deal, I took it out, said she, now is here all. I said, yes it is; she said, do you think you can borrow any thing of your neighbours, for the larger sum you shew me the larger sum you will find; I said, I could not borrow any; then she said, well, child, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140012"/> must look at me; I shall not hurt you, or take any thing from you, I must touch every thing, or I cannot command the planets; (look at me) it will be a great deal of charity, for by this you will relieve a soul out of purgatory that has been there ever since the last war: what is the ring worth. (Look at me) Thus she kept saying look at me. I said it cost half a guinea; she said, will you be true to me, for if you tell, it will be taken from you, and delivered up to the king; you must give me a fourth part of what you find, pray don't hide it from me. I told her I would give it her. Then she kept me in discourse, you must look at me, and at the same time kept taking away the things from out of my hand, and when she had got them she made off as fast as she could; when she was going off I gave a shriek, nobody heard me till she got out at the shop door, then one of the men came down, and ran up one street and down another but could find nothing of her. About a month or 5 weeks ago I was going to my work in Purple-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>E. Farrand. My husband is a cabinet-maker, and I work at the upholstering business. I met her, I was afraid to accuse her, till I was sure it was the same woman; I passed by her, my husband was then in the shop, I called to him to follow me; I followed her, and said, pray, mistress, can you tell fortunes? Yes, said she, who told you I could tell fortunes? I said, I know a person that you did tell her fortune; said she, pray, where is the young woman? I said, in this parlour; said she, tell me where I must come, and I will come, when I have had my breakfast; then I said, it was at that time you took such and such things from me. She began to run; there were several assistance came, and my husband came also, I desired them to call a constable: she threatened to knock me down, and held up her hands to strike me, and said, if she did not do for me then, she would do for me. So I went home. The next morning I was going to my work again, she ran out of the same chandler's shop, she was going to before, I heard her say, O! she is here. My husband was before me. She ran after me, and cuffed me, first on one side of the head, then on the other; I screemed out, and before my husband could come to me, she fastened her hands in my hair, but she got away again. I went to Justice Welch and got a warrant; I found out where she lived; she had lived with a man, but had left him, and now she lived with a blacksmith. That blacksmith desired me to come and talk to her; so I went to her where she was, at the Crown in Chick-lane, one night, there she got about twelve old cloath's women, to make me believe it was not she. There was a gentleman got me out and said he would have me make the best of my way home, for she belonged to such a gang that would kill me. Then another said I had better take her up, for he had heard one of her gang say, she was guilty, for he heard them say where she had pawned the things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>This day 5 weeks, as I was going about my business, I met that woman, she charged me with robbing of her 8 months ago. I am an old cloath's woman; I said, do you know what you are about? She went away; I staid at home all day. The next morning I met her again; I said, mistress, are you looking after me? I am not gone out of the way; are you sure I am the woman that robbed you? Said she, you are the woman; I said, here I am, I shall not go away from you. She took and tore my cloak from my back, and brought a man up directly to knock me down. I went away, and she to get a warrant for me; but before that, she said, she would have a guinea from me for what I had done to her. I knowing myself innocent would not give her a farthing. I never saw her before in all the whole course of my life, as God is true. Finding I would not give her a guinea to make it up, they charge me with a robbery. She came to me in Newgate last Wednesday to ask me for a guinea to make it up. I am as innocent as there is a God in heaven; I never saw her with my eyes before, as I hope God shall be my witness.</p>

            . I was drinking a pint of beer in a public house, where the woman (meaning the prosecutrix) came in, and I understood, there had been a quarrel between them. She said, if she would give her a guinea, she would drop all proceedings, and have no more to do about it. (I say no more than I know.) The prisoner lives just by me. She made answer, it was not in her power to give her a guinea, or any thing like it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. He called to me one day as I was going by, and said, he hoped I would consider and not hurt her. I said, Mr. Read, she has hurt me, for I had the misfortune to hurt my arm in the struggle, and I was out of work about a week. He said, if 4 or 5 s. will make you satisfaction, he would do it. I said, no, Mr. Read, I will do no such thing; I said, my husband had strained his wrist just before, and it lies very hard upon me to prosecute her, and I must be obliged to pawn my cloaths to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, you would make it up for a guinea?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not; I said, my loss was a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q to the prosecutor. Can you undertake to say when you pulled out your purse you put it into your pocket again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am very sure I did. I was not intoxicated so far as not to remember that; I remember it exceeding well.</p>
               <p>Q You say you was very fudled when you went into the house, was you not more so after you was there?</p>
               <p>Colhoun. I was a good deal better after I was there than I was when I went in.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in liquor at that time?</p>
               <p>Colhoun. He pretended to be in liquor, and I believe he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular specie of money about you?</p>
               <p>Colhoun. I had 7 or 8 guineas, and 2 German ducats, these were in my purse; I had some silver in my pocket, but I had given that away, and had occasion to change some gold.</p>

            , Goldsmith, at the Blackmoor's-Head in Cheapside. The prisoner came to our shop on the 6th of December last to sell 3 table spoons; I imagined they were stolen by the marks being erased out. My master bought them, and then sent me with the prisoner to get intelligence of him who knew him, and then to pay for it, and to see; more such spoons, which he said he had at home. He said his name was Reed, and that he lived in Cree-church-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know the purport of your going with him?</p>
               <p>Chapman. He did. As we were going along Cheapside near Bow church, he said to me, If you'll go back, and tell your master you have seen the 3 spoons, I'll give you a shilling. I said, I could not do that. Then he said, If I saw any people in the room, not to say what I came about, for the people would think him poor to sell his plate. I went with him to the sign of the Cock in Cree-church-lane, there he seemed to be very well known; he took me up stairs into a room, and went from me, and returned again in a few minutes, and brought 3 spoons answerable to ters with the engraving taken out. I did ny them, but paid him for the others, and returned home, and told Mr. Smith what I had learned: (he produced 2 table spoons, the Jury inspect them) these are what we bought of him. There were several people at the Cock that knew him, as appeared by their making obeisance to him; he seemed to be respected as a gentleman.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Crocket now: I did live with Mr. Laprimaundaye at the time of this robbery. I was entrusted with the care of his house. I left the doors and windows fast when I went to bed. I cannot tell the day of the month, but it was the night before we discovered the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long may it be ago?</p>
               <p>Smith. It may be about 2 months ago.</p>

               <p>Smith. In the pantry, the proper place for it to be in. (A large box full of plate produced in court, with the plate as mentioned in the indictment in it. He looks at the plate.) These are my master's property, and were there at the time I have mentioned. I know them by my master's crest, and the marks on them.</p>

               <p>Smith. I can't swear to these, the engraving being taken out.</p>

I went and found it all in confusion, then I went and found the parlour window open, then I went and called my master, I told him we were robbed; he came down and saw what was done, and sent me directly to the silversmith.</p>

            . I have examined this plate, it is all my property. In the morning my servant came and called me, and told me we had been robbed; upon that I immediately sent him to Mr. Courtwould my silversmith, and to Mr. Bearance, who had been lately robbed in the same manner, to know what steps I should take; after that I went to justice Welch to take his advice, he advised me to have them advertised, which I did, and after that I advertised them in the gazette, and procured a pardon for any one concerned in the robbery that would discover it, with a reward of 50 l. but I could get no intelligence of my plate, till Mr. Smith, the goldsmith in Cheapside, came to my house, and produced to me 3 table spoons, which he said one Mr. Reed sold to him.</p>

               <p>Laprimaundaye. He came on the 6th of Dec. in the afternoon, he produced the same spoons to me as his servant Chapman has here. I having part of my plate by inheritance from my mother, I knew there was some spoons among my relations of the same make; I sent to a relation, who sent some on the 9th of Dec. I sent them by Mr. Courtwould to Mr. Smith to compare them. He is here, and will give the court his opinion upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment whether these 2 spoons are your property?</p>
               <p>Laprimaundaye. They exactly tally'd with them which I sent to Mr. Smith's. I came here on the 9th in the afternoon for a warrant to Sir

            , to be executed the next morning in searching this Reed's house. Then I, Mr. Bearance, Mr. Courtwould, Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Nash and Mr. Gardner, 2 peace officers, went according to the directions given to find out Mr. Reed in Cree-church-lane: Mr. Bearance went first to enquire, at last we found a shoemaker, that Mr. Chapman had seen to bow to this Mr. Reed, and Mr. Bearance being a German, and by favour of the German language, got out of the shoemaker (who I think was a German too) where this Reed lived, which was near the halfway-house in Stepney fields, the shoemaker said that he went by the name of Autenreith. I went with Mr. Nash to justice Quarrel, and he back'd my warrant. We went and found he lived next door to the half-way-house; then Mr. Bearance went first to get admittance into the house; after he was in, he sent for me and Mr. Courtwould; when we came in we heard a noise, I looked out at a window and saw the prisoner jump out at another window; then I immediately called out he was gone; we ran after him, and cried out, stop thief; Chapman ran and overtook him and brought him back. In looking about his parlour, after we brought him back, we saw in his beaufet a silver salt seller, on which my arms had been, and were then filed off; the silversmith, Mr. Courtwould, said he would swear to it to be my property: after that was found we went up stairs into his bed chamber, there were 2 chests of drawers, Mr. Gardner shook one of the upper drawers in one of the chests, we observed something to rattle in it: I asked for the key of that drawer, his wife and sister-in-law were present, they said they had no key to the drawers, I insisted upon their finding the key, they found it, and on the opening it we found several forks belonging to me, with my crest upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found the key?</p>
               <p>Laprimaundaye. I cannot say who found it. We looked further into the drawers, and found some filings of silver, and files and other instruments made use of by silversmiths, and a small crucible; (the f ilings, tools, and crucible produced in court) after that I opened another drawer, and found all the large plate. I found all my plate again, except 19 table spoons, and 10 tea spoons. After that we brought the plate down, and took an inventory of it; the prisoner seemed very much surprized when we brought the plate down, he asked who it belonged to; I said, to me: he seemed in a very great consternation, and said, he was very sorry any such thing should happen; then we asked him how he came by it, he said one John brought it to him about a month before, and described him as a livery servant, that he became acquainted with him at the house of one Spencer, at the Grey-hound in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention a sir name?</p>
               <p>Laprimaundaye. No he did not; he said he had seen him about 10 days before: he said, this John brought it to his house, and begged of him to take it in, and that it belonged to a captain of a ship that was afraid of an execution the next morning, and he wanted to secure it to live upon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house?</p>
               <p>Laprimaundaye. My house is in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street.</p>

            . I was called upon on this occasion. I having before been robbed of a quantity of plate, and living very near the prosecutor, we have taken a great deal of pains to find it out, but unsuccessful, till the 6th of Dec. then he came and told me, two table-spoons had been brought to him by Mr. Smith in Cheapside, and compared them with others that came out of the same family, and found them to be his own. I advised him to go to Sir

            , and get a warrant to search the prisoner's house that brought the spoons to Mr. Smith; he said, he betrayed himself to be a German by his language, and lived in Creechurch-lane. I being a German, thought it was probable I might be of use in detecting him. We went, two constables, Mr. Chapman, him and I, to Creechurch-lane. I went first with one of the constables to inquire for him by the name of Reed. The people in the neighbourhood said they knew no such man, but upon Mr. Chapman's saying, he saw him bow to a man that lived thereabouts, I found the house and knocked at the door, I asked the person, if he knew one Reed, and if he lived in that neighbourhood? his answer was, he did not know such a person, but upon finding him a German, I accosted him in that language; he said, if I meant Autenreed, he lived in Stepney fields. Then I inquired about his family, and whether he lived at a public or private house? We then went to Stepney fields to the half-way-house, a public house; there again, upon inquiring after one Reed, whether he lived there, it was told us by the landlord, that he did, and he sent his maid to know, whether Mr. Autenreith was stirring, or not? I thought he might suspect something by seeing a number of people, I said I should be glad to know what apartment he had in his house; then he said, he lived at the next door. Then I desired Mr. Courtwould and Mr. Laprimaundaye to stay there and let me go to the house alone, and not to come to the door till I was got in. I went, the parlour window was open, I saw two women in the room, in their undress, as if just come down from bed. Upon my inquiring, whether he was at home? they said, he was not at home; and as I affected to speak broken English like a German, and speaking something about a letter I had to deliver to him, I prevailed upon the women to let me know he was at home in bed, and was getting up. It being cold, they asked me to come in; when the others saw me make a good entrance into the house, they were to come; Nash was close at my elbow; they all came. The women were surprized, and asked me who Nash was? I said, he was a servant of mine. Then I said, we wanted to speak with Mr. Reed; the women burst out with, Good God, what is the matter? I said, I desired to see him as soon as possible. We went into the parlour. Nash rather pressed me to go up stairs to him; upon this the wife's sister undertook to shew us up stairs to the prisoner's room, but coming to the foot of the stairs, they objected to Nash's coming to his room, as a person not fit in appearance to go up. When I was got upon the landing-place, and Nash half way up, I heard a rushing noise, which was immediately followed by a call below, He is gone! and the cry, Stop thief; upon which Nash went down the stair-case again, and I being left alone within the house, thinking we should have success in the search, I kept possession of the house, and remained there about 10 minutes before they brought the prisoner back. I ordered him to sit down in the parlour, and sat myself near him; I ordered then some paper, pens, and ink, that I might make an inventory of the goods that we should find, and to take down what the man should say upon this occasion. (Which paper I have here.) Before he was brought back, Mr. Courtwould and Mr. Laprimaundaye re-entered the house, and found a silver saltseller which Mr. Laprimaundaye thought to be his own, and Mr. Courtwould said positively it was Mr. Laprimaundaye's, and that he made it for him; I think he said, he never made but one pair of that sort. There was a conversation passed about this saltseller in the presence of the prisoner. He asked, what we came for? and I think to the best of my remembrance, he made an attempt to fall on his knees, and crave our mercy. We said, we had no design to hurt him, and desired him to sit down and compose himself, that he might be able to give a good account of himself. While this passed in the parlour, Mr. Laprimaundaye and Mr. Courtwould, and a constable, went up to search the house, I sat below; in a very little time they brought a large drawer full of plate, the same now produced in court, which I desired them to set down on the parlour-floor; I desired Mr. Courtwould to take it out of the drawer, and set aside what he should find to be Mr. Laprimaundaye's property, thinking in so large a quantity I might find a piece of my own; they proved to be all the property of Mr. Laprimaundaye, and not a single bit of plate in the house but what was his, except some small things not worth notice. I asked the prisoner, how he came by this plate? thinking he would speak to me in his own language. All the account I could get at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140020"/> that time was, that one John had brought it to him more than a month ago, at 3 or 4 in the morning; that he came to his door and knocked two or three times, he being in bed with his wife; he went and opened the parlour-window, and saw this John, and he thought another man was standing at a little distance, but he could not tell who he was; that John rested a bag upon the bench by the door, and desired him to take it in, saying it was some goods belonging to a captain that was afraid of a bond or judgment. This I took in writing; and when I had done, I spoke to him to this purpose, That he must really imagine that story to be inconsistent, that so large a quantity of plate should be left in his house by a man that he knew nothing of but only the name of John. I asked him, what the man was? he said, he called himself a livery-servant. I asked him, what livery he wore? he said, he could not tell. Then I said, what did you take him to be? he said, he rather took him to be a tradesman, not a livery-servant. I told him farther, that a man like himself, that seemed to have a good education, and so good a carriage, could hardly converse with a man so long a time by the name of John only. But all that we could get of him was, that his name was John, and that he got acquainted with him at Mr. Spencer's at the Greyhound in Grub street. Having taken down the inventory and this examination, we proceeded with him and the plate to this place, as the Court was at that time sitting; when he was examined here, and told that the nature of the case was such that he must be committed to Newgate, he then took me a-side, and in the German language said, he was rather surprized that the questions, that were put to him, should be asked him so publicly, because if he was to declare publicly who the person was that brought him the plate, he might get notice of it, and make his escape.

             indulged me to speak to him in this language. I told the prisoner, he might give me an account of it, and I would assist him in getting hold of the man. He then told me, the man was one Smith, a leather-breeches-maker, where he lived at that time, he said, he could not tell, but he had lived in the Greyhound-inn-yard, Grubstreet, and that, if I went there, he had not been gone long, I might trace him. I found the description he had given me of the person; though he would not mention the name only by that of John, yet that description came up pretty near to the person of Smith, the breeches-maker. He seemed to have the same idea at home as he had afterwards here; but since that time I have been two or three times with him in prison, I never could get any thing more of him, but that this Smith brought him the plate; he stuck to that story, and in that story he has always remained.</p>

I found this crucible, and the silver filings were in the crucible, but in the hurry, it wat spilt in the drawer, we took it up, and it is here; and there was some of the plate with the crests or marks filed out.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was along with them in the search, there were in all three large draweres, and three small draweres. The drawers in which was the plate were locked. We asked the woman for the keys of the two drawers, we had shook the least of them and found something rattle. She said, she could not tell where the keys were, her husband always kept them two drawers locked. I said, then I'll break the drawers open. Then she took down a black waistcoat that hung by the bedside, and took a key out of the pocket, and unlocked the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bearance. What account did he give for the silver filings being there?</p>
               <p>Bearance. He said that this John took away most of the spoons, 2 candlesticks, and the coffee-pot, most of which he brought again with those files and filings in the coffee-pot; but there was a salt with the arms taken out, which we found in the parlour in the beaufet at our first going in, that he did not say the man had taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this salt escape the recollection of the prisoner, he being in a confusion?</p>
               <p>Bearance. I thought upon my oath he was in as little confusion as a man in such a condition could be; we ordered him something to drink, and desired him to sit down, he was then composed a little, and this was after he had sat some time; he asked me whether I was the gentleman that was robbed, I said not, that was Mr. Laprimaundaye that owned the plate; but when he knew this salt-seller was found in the parlour he gave us no account of the remainder of the plate. I asked him what pieces of plate this supposed John had taken away; after he had told me, I wrote them down on my paper, and read it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140021"/> over again to him in the presence of all the other witnesses, to know whether I had taken it right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any thing particular was asked relative to that salt-seller?</p>
               <p>Bearance. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know that somebody's house had been broke open, and this plate taken away?</p>

            . I am a goldsmith. I saw the spoons that were brought by Mr. Smith in Cheapside, I compared them with other spoons at Mr. Smith's house, they answered to them very well. I was present in searching the prisoner's house in Stepney fields, I observed the silver silings which were found in a drawer, there were a great number of forks and spoons with the marks taken out, several of the forks had been lately filed, and some not touched.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call lately?</p>
               <p>Courtwould. A very few days, may be 4, 5, or 6 days at most.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the salt-seller which we found at going into the parlour. (Holding it in his hand)</p>
               <p>Courtwould. (He takes it in his hand) This at that time seemed to be very lately filed. This is the prosecutor's property, I made it. I have made many salts, but never had an order to gild them in the inside, only this and the other 3 here produced.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you form your judgment from?</p>
               <p>Courtwould. I form it upon the tarnish.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according as it is laid in a damp or dry place, it will be more or less discoloured?</p>
               <p>Courtwould. Very right.</p>
               <p>Councel. Then there is not a positive certainty, because it is possible means may be made use of to tarnish it more or less in the same time.</p>
               <p>Courtwould. There was a coffee-pot seemed to have been filed some longer time than one of the candlesticks. If I file a piece of plate at home, if I look at it immediately I can see no difference at all betwixt that and one of the candlesticks. I look upon it that the candlestick had not been filed above 1 or 2 days.</p>
               <p>Q. Will not one piece of plate tarnish in your shew glass more than another?</p>
               <p>Courtwould. I can't say I have made observation of that, if they are both scraped or filed at the same time I can't suppose any difference.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a foreigner, a German, I do not know much about the nature of the laws of England, but what I have read in books. I have told the gentlemen the truth, and so I will tell you again. About a month or 5 weeks before I was taken up. I was once knocked up, somebody knocked at the door, they knocked again a violent knocking, I put my night gown round me, and went to the window and asked, who was at the door? - It is me, please to come down, I have something to tell you; it was very cold, I shut the window, and went and opened the door, he pushed in with a bundle, somebody stood just by him; said he, It belongs to a captain that has made a bond and judgment, and expects an execution, and I know you will keep it here while I call for it again; it was quite dark, he set it down, and away he went, and shut the door. In the morning I got up a little earlier than I used to do, thinking to see what this man had brought, I opened the window shutter and saw some forks stick out, it made a great noise and ratling in the dining room, I thought it was French plate: my wife came down stairs, then I took the parcel up stairs and went to put it in one drawer, it would not go all there, then I put the rest in another, and locked the drawer, and put the key in my pocket: this man came some days after, knocking at the door, I was smoaking a pipe, he said, I am come to fetch some away, I can't fetch it all at once, I'll take my handkerchief full; he took all he could, great spoons and other things: I said, I wish you would fetch them all away, may be I must answer for it. He said, do you never mind, the captain will make you amends; I have not got a lodging to my mind, and he would fetch them as soon as he could. He came again in about 8 or 9 days, and brought in a handkerchief under his coat most of it again. Said I, I thought you would have fetched it all away. - I'll soon fetch it all away. I said, I will keep it in my house no longer: he did not fetch it. After that my wife shewed me a letter that came from a lawyer of whom I had once a house, I could not pay him, he arrested me, I paid him half the money, and gave him a note for the rest; after that he said, if I did not come the next Tuesday he would serve me the same again. I had got some bills out, but I had not so much money; I thought by Christmass time I would pay him. The next Tuesday I was afraid he would arrest me, I did not know what to do; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140022"/> thought as this gentleman would sell his plate, I would take half a dozen spoons, I can but pay him at Christmas when my bills are paid: I took half a dozen. I had a few guineas that I thought would make the money up, so I went to the silversmith's shop, he said, what do you want for the spoons? I said, I wanted 40 shillings, I had a little bill to make up: the young man said, we can't buy silver of strangers, have you any body here that knows you? I said, I am going to Clifford's-inn.</p>
               <p>Chapman. You said to the Temple.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Said the silversmith, my apprentice shall go along with you, and pay you the money. I said, very well. Said I, I have a friend of mine that lives not quite so far, I sometimes come and dine there; so the young man came there with me, they were just at dinner, they asked me to dine with them; said the inaster of the house, there is a fire in the back room; I went there, so he saw I was known in the house. Said he to me, have you got any more of these spoons?. I took them out of my pocket. Said he, if you will sell them my master will buy them. I said, no, I would not sell them, I thought I should have money enough by selling 3. I went then to Butcher-row by Temple-bar, to my landlord Mr. Fosset's chamber, he was out; I sat down, he did not come in, I went away, and told them, I would call again, I went home; the next day I went again, I staid a good while, he was not at home; then I went the next day and enquired, there was nobody there; after that came a letter for me to pay the money: the next day being Friday, my sister came up and said, there were 3 gentlemen come knocking at my door; my wife came up and said, Lord, have you not paid Mr. Fosset? I was afraid, I did not know what to do; I came out at the window, they came directly after me, and brought me back: they said, you have got so and so of plate in your house; I told them this man brought the plate to me. I am innocent of these things, I know nothing about it; I am an innocent man, and every body that knows me will say I never wronged a man of a farthing or a halfpenny; I have been kept miserable in prison for nothing at all, my poor wife is big with child, I know nothing about the law, none can say I stole any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what hours your brother used to keep?</p>

               <p>Grayham. No I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him speak of it?</p>
               <p>Grayham. I do not remember his speaking of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a violent knocking at the door?</p>
               <p>Grayham. No I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How big may the house be you live in?</p>
               <p>Grayham. It is but a small house.</p>
               <p>Q. What room do you lie in?</p>
               <p>Grayham. I lie in a room by myself, next room to his own</p>
               <p>Q. Are they both forwards or backwards.</p>
               <p>Grayham. My room is backwards and theirs forwards, the head of the stair-case parts one room from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that salt-seller in the beaufet in the parlour never used in the house?</p>
               <p>Grayham. It was a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that?</p>
               <p>Grayham. I can't justly say; it was about three weeks, or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear about it how it came there?</p>
               <p>Grayham. I did not hear any thing in the least about its coming there; I did not ask about it, that was indifferent to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether it had your brother's name, or any arms upon it?</p>
               <p>Grayham. No, I never looked at it to take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other plate used in your house besides that?</p>
               <p>Grayham. Nothing of any consequence; there were a few spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see a silver coffee-pot or tea-kettle there?</p>
               <p>Grayham. No.</p>

               <p>Smith. I never saw him before he was taken up in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he any relation of yours?</p>
               <p>Smith. No. I have no relations of the name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Smith. I never saw him in my life before he was taken up.</p>

               <p>Court. The night before the robbery was committed your lady went out?</p>
               <p>Smith. She did, a visiting; I came in while she was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there one or two maids in the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. There were two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either one or both of them catch you in the pantry?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the parlour windows shut or open?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not two of the salvers in your hands?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire the maids not to tell your master of that?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not hid in the pantry?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; I did it with intent to fright them, no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to look after you?</p>
               <p>Smith. Because I made a noise to fright them, and they came into the room. I apprehended they were a good deal frighted, but hearing me laugh in the cupboard, they opened the door, and I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell your master?</p>
               <p>Smith. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. This might be between 4 and 5 o'clock, it was not dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was not open?</p>
               <p>Smith. I shut the window before, that is not the shutters, only the sash, the sash had been open. This was the night before the robbery happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176301140024"/>Q. How came you to have the two salvers in your hand?</p>
               <p>Smith. I made a noise with them on the marble slab; I thought to make them believe there was something the matter, and they came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you first hear of this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I first heard of this about a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery. I have no reason at all to suspect him; I have a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a character at his going away?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My wife did to Mr. Crocket, where he lives now. I have a good opinion of him.</p>

They both lodged in my house: the deceased had for about 4 months. On the 5th of Jan. we had a wine-club; I came home from Gravesend at 7 or thereabouts, the company called me up to take a glass of wine or punch.</p>

               <p>Smith. I am a Dutchman. When I was up in the club-room, I heard a scolding above; the prisoner and deceased both lay in a room above the club-room in separate beds. We hearing a disturbance, went up stairs; the man that is killed had his shirt off, the prisoner had his shirt on; the door was open, they had no candle in the room.

             went in before me with a lanthorn and candle in his hand, we found them both on the bed that the deceased used to lie on: they had each their breeches and stockings on, and no shoes on.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance were their beds from each other?</p>
               <p>Smith, About 5 or 6 feet distance. They were fighting together like a couple of bull-dogs. They stuck together, I could not at first get them apart; the prisoner was lying upon the deceased, I had enough to do to get them asunder. The deceased's face was bloody. I took and set the prisoner on his own bed, and the deceased up upon his bed. He directly said, Father, it is not my fault; then he arose up from off his bed and said, O Lord, I am a dead man! and directly his bowels were all coming out on his left side; then I took him down stairs, and sent for a doctor. When we were below, the deceased said, he gave me a stab on purpose. The prisoner was then in the room; he attempted to go away, but was prevented. Mr. Thompson, a surgeon, came in the morning; he said, he is a dead man, his bowels were cut, and he would not meddle with him. Then I took him to the hospital; but before I took him to the hospital, I said to the prisoner, how dare you do such a thing? it will cost you your life. He answered, he was sorry. We got a constable, and delivered the prisoner into his custody. The deceased said to me at the hospital as before, it was done on purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

I asked him how that wound happened, whether wilful or by accident? he said, wilful; that a Portuguese had been quarrelling with his friend, and he had taken his friend's part, and it was done with a push.

I gave her half a crown; my watch was then in my pocket. She clasped my arm round just at parting, I had not power to get up, and I missed my watch directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you fallen down?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. No, I was standing. I found my watch gone, and I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been down?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. I had. She put her hands round me while I was taking out my money, and I fell down, and had not power to get up. I said, you have got my watch; she said, go about your business home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hethcote. No. The next morning I went there again, and she came in. We took her to Guildhall; she said there, she had no watch, but the two women that were left behind had it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I go a-washing. This man came into the house where I was in Chick-lane. I never saw him in my life before. I went away and left him in the house. The next morning I was coming up the lane, I saw him; there were two women there that sat by him. I asked him, if I ever meddled with his watch? he said, he did not know, the women imbibed it in his head that I took it. He swore first before the sitting Alderman, that he lost it out of his coat-pocket, tied up in a silk handkerchief. Please to call the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dolman. I am the constable. The prosecutor charged me with the prisoner for stealing his watch. I know nothing at all of it. All I know of her is, she is a very bad woman as possibly can be. When I took her in charge, both he and she were so drunk that I believe they hardly knew one another.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was you in company with any other women at that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I was not.</p>

The prisoner and the other man said, there is a house up over the way under a gate way, the other man went and knocked at the door, then the prisoner gave me a slight push, upon which I fell down; I called watch, and a watchman and 3 gentlemen came immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How was I dressed?</p>
               <p>Isaacs. He had a short jacket and boots on, a small round hat with a lace on his hat, and he said he was at Birmingham at the same time.</p>

I did not go to bed till 1 o'clock; I was called up about 7 by a neighbour and told my door was open; I went down and found it so, and the goods mentioned in the indictment gone. I went to Mr. Fielding, and told his clerk how I had been robbed: a person came from him to me on the Saturday following. I went on the Monday; he ordered me to go to New-prison, and enquire for a person by the name of Simpson, who he said had confessed the robbery. I went there, I found the prisoner Watson; he there owned to me in what form they got into the house. He said,

I found it on my counter, out. (Produced in court) I got a warrant to search the womans house (at the bar) but found nothing belonging to me. The neighbours told me they had absconded a week before I came there; but I found when they heard Watson was cast last sessions, they came back again.</p>
