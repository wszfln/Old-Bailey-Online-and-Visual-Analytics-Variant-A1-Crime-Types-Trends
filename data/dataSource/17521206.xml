             wanted such; I went and found him at Mr. Dickerson's house, and sold that to him, and Johnson stay'd at the Lane-End the while ; I went and gave him 14 out of the 16 s. I have seen him once since, and never but once.</p>

               <p>Lockhart Gordon. On the 25th or 26th of October, about eleven at night, I came out of the Bedford-Head coffee-house, <placeName id="t17521206-4-crimeloc16">Covent Garden</placeName>

He pointed at another man, saying it was him that picked my pocket and flung the handkerchief under his arm. I saw a parcel of ugly fellows about me: I seized him by the collar, drew my sword, saying I was more than a match for him, took him into the Bedford coffee-house, and sent for the playhouse guards who were not then gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the Bedford coffee-house ?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It was about thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to discern the prisoner's person?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It was (the lamps being lighted) very light. I took him to justice Fielding's, who was in bed and refused to get up; this gave the prisoner fresh courage, who used me very abusively saying, that he would blow my brains out, or words to the same purport.</p>

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How near was I to him when he missed the handkerchief ?</p>
               <p>Gordon. If he did not touch my shoulder, he was as near as he could stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No, my lord, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I was going thro' Covent-Garden piazzas, and a young fellow ran away at the same time; there was also a great crowd about the gentleman when the handkerchief was lost.</p>

            . I live in St. Giles's High-Street. In the morning of the 29th of October I heard t he prosecutor had been robbed, and the thief put into the Roundhouse. As I went to church I made water in the Church-yard against the Roundhouse. There I saw the purse lying on the ground, and took it up. (Produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor as his property, which he lost with his money ). The Roundhouse window faces the place where it lay.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Ask the prosecutor if he did not give his wife a 36 s. piece in the watch-house after I was there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did, but that was loose in my pocket.</p>

            . I was in the hospital in the next ward to the deceas'd, and have seen the prisoner come to see him; I had us'd frequently to go to see him. On the Sunday our nurse said to me, I heard say his wife did it by slinging a brick. After his wife was gone, I went and ask'd how he did, and desir'd he'd let me know how this affair happened ; he said, that on lord-mayor's day, at night, his wife and others were drinking together, his wife grew drowsy, and laid her head on the table; he would have her get up and lie on the bed, she kick'd him on the private parts, and hurt him, which he resented, and words arose; then the child's godmother came down and took her part, whereupon she took up a brick, flung it at him, and so did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he struck her?</p>
               <p>Boare. No, he did not,</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem friendly in the hospital?</p>
               <p>Boare. They did; she came often, and was there on Sunday and on Monday morning; and when she came on Tuesday morning he was dead.</p>

I live in the same house; the Saturday following, at night, after the lord-mayor's day, the deceas'd and his wife went out together, and came home together, and they went to fighting; I heard the man say, Sally, my dear, I want to live in peace, be quiet, I'll never strike you more; she said, D - n you, you dog, I'll cut you down.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and was at the London Hospital when the deceas'd was brought in, on the 11th of November, he had a small wound on his forehead; the bone was bare, but not fractured, and in a few days he became exceeding ill; it was the opinion of Mr. Harrison, mi, and others that he should be trapann'd, which he accordingly was; I saw it. The deceas'd complain'd also of a violent pain in his breast, he was blooded, and several other methods made use of to relieve him, but all ineffectual, for he died on the 27th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What appear'd on your trapanning him?</p>
               <p>Kentish. There was no matter appear'd, but upon opening his head after he was dead, we found it lodg'd under the dura mater; there was a great deal of matter upon the brain under the forehead, and part of the brain was mortified: We opened his body also, and found there was a great inflamation on his stomach, and upon that side of the liver which lies upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. By the symptoms which he had, and the appearances of the bod y after dislocation, what do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Do you think the appearance you saw on his stomach might have occasioned his death if he had not had that wound on his head?</p>
               <p>Kentish. I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you think his death was owing to that blow he receiv'd on his forehead?</p>
               <p>Kentish. There were two appearances of the cause of his death, it might be from either of them.</p>

I thought she was a customer's maid, one Mr. Hall in Duke street ; I said to her, what did she there at this time of night, she said, what will you please to have? I went up to the Plough, a publick house, she said, she would not go there, but to her mistress's house; I went there, she asked, what I would give her to drink, there was another woman with her : Then I said, what you will, she called for the Mistress of the house, but would have 6 d. for it before hand: She desired me to make a glass, and forced me to take it ; she desired me to sit down, I did, she came to my knee, and said she was going to buss me, I push'd her from me, she got hold of my watch and pull'd it out; I got hold of her arm, the other woman behind took it, and run away with it : I ran by her to catch the other, the prisoner push'd me back, either with her fast or head, and said, what did I want? the other ran quite off with it, I was not above 4 or 5 minutes in the house ; she was taken up on Monday, and committed by justice Fielding. I did not know who she was till I got into that house.</p>

            . Having missed money at times out of the drawer, and suspecting the prisoner, on the 15th of Nov. the shop being shut up, the prisoner was below in the bakehouse, I concealed myself in a closet in the kitchen, where I could look into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the shop been shut up?</p>
               <p>M. Jordan. Almost an hour; the prisoner came up stairs with a candle in his hand; he came into the kitchen and cut himself some victuals; then he went into the shop with a hammer in his hand; with which he raised up the counter, and took out the till.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Jordan: Mistress suspected somebody had been opening her till; in order to find out who it was, she and I concealed ourselves in the closet: I saw the prisoner come up out of the bake-house (which was under the shop) and go into the kitchen, and cut himself some victuals; after which he went into the shop, and with a hammer lifted up the counter, and took out half-pence; he put his hand in twice, and laid them down on the counter by him; after which Mistress went to the shop door, and asked him if he had taken enough; if not, bid him take more, and said, are not you a pretty fellow for robbing me? He begged her pardon, and gave the money into her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Richards. I did not tell it ; I saw it was halfpence she told me there was twelve-pence halfpenny.</p>

When I got a little farther under the gate-way, he pulled out his private part, (and talked such indecent sodomitical language best omitted here) wanting me to go with him to some private place: said I, are not you ashamed to offer that brutish action to any mankind? then he asked me what I had got in my breeches, saying he was d - able poor; I asked him what he meant; he said if I did not surrender that instant, and d - d me, he'd cut my throat from ear to ear; he had some instrument in his hand which I took to be a knife; he jabb'd it in my mouth, it struck against my teeth and I turn'd my head about at the time, or it had cut my mouth open; I made to the street; but when I was at the edge of the street he was then got before me; there he up with some weapon that he had in his hand, struck me on the temple and knock'd me down; I received another blow on my right breast after I was down, that brought blood from me many days; after this, I felt his hand at my breeches pocket, he presently ran away; I got up and found my pocket half inside out, my purse and 7 shillings in it were missing, I missed also my hat; I had not power to get far, but fell down again in my blood: after this, there came people to me, and when I came to myself, they asked me, whether I knew the man; the blood was in my mouth, I could not speak properly, I catch'd hold on the prisoner's apron, and when I could speak, said, he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought him to you?</p>
               <p>Birk. I did not know the men, they were some that are here to give evidence.</p>

I believe he had more friends than enemies about him at that time. He had something tucked into his coat that stood out, which he dropped, and his friends I believe picked it up. He lost his apron. When we came almost to St. Martin's Le Grand I saw a handkerchief (I believe it to be red and yellow ) dropping out of his bosom; I said, I believe you have dropped your handkerchief; he replied, the handkerchief may be d - d, he had not lost any thing. Then some people drove us about as tho' they intended to drive us down together; I believe they belonged to him. When we came about Woodstreet end, the prisoner began to cry China oranges or lemons, silberts, and such like goods. We took him to my lord mayor without any officer; after which one came.</p>
               <p>Q. from my lord mayor. Did you go along with the prisoner when I directed a number of persons to go with him to the hospital to see if the person there knew him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I did, and the wounded man singled out the prisoner from amongst about fourteen men, and said he was the man that did him the injury.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The goods mentioned were that morning safe in the kitchen, the tea chest stood on the dresser, the two candlesticks on the mantlepiece, the bonnet and apron being behind the door. I went out of an errand about eleven o'clock, and came back about a quarter before twelve ; I found the door open, and missed the tea chest first, and after that the rest. A friend of mine went with me to justice Gore for a search warrant; he went into a publick house, who saw Mr. Frances the pawnbroker, who told him he had got such a tea chest, so it came to be found out; I went to his house the next day, and found the chess to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060011"/> be mine.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner at the bar brought this tea chest to my house some time I believe in October, but can't remember the day; she said she was destitute and had a tea chest to pledge, and that she had a great many things to bring at times; she had two shillings upon it. I went to a publick house in the evening, and a man came in and said he had been in order to get a warrant to search for things stolen; he mentioned the tea chest, and I told him I had taken in such one. Then the prosecutrix came and owned it. The prisoner came again in November, and wanted to sell the chest; so I sent for the prosecutor and his wife, and had her secured.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you awake all the time you was at home?</p>
               <p>Becket. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Becket. I was all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise above stairs?</p>
               <p>Becket. No, my Lord, I did not. About two or three months before this, the prisoner at the bar desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060014"/> to see my apartment, and brought a candle, pretending there was a pannel loose, and he wanted to fasten it: I went up with him: My closet is a longish dark place: He went in, I did not, but I examined it since, and find the pannel fastens on his side and not on mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you in the closet last ?</p>
               <p>Becket. About three or four days, or a week before it was broke through.</p>
               <p>Q. After you found the house broke, what did you do?</p>
               <p>Becket. I examined into the affair, and found the prisoner had a man and a woman lodged in his garret, I went and knocked at the door between four and five o'clock, there was the woman lodger, who said she lived there, and the prisoner came from the door at the same time and said, what is the matter? there was also his wife. I said, who had broke their house into mine to-day? the prisoner said I don't know, I have nobody but a man and a woman lodger in my garret. I left him there, and found afterwards he was very flush of money that night, so I fetched a search-warrant the next day, and went to his house, which we searched and found both gold and silver, and after some time the leather pocket which had my silver in.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces of money were found?</p>
               <p>Becket. Silver and gold between 5 and 6 l. but I cannot swear to any of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the house he lived in where you found that pocket?</p>
               <p>Becket. It was, he has made doors from one to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose room is that which was on the backside your closet?</p>
               <p>Becket. He keeps it in his own hands, it is a one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. What description did you give of this pocket to persons you talked with?</p>
               <p>Becket. I have said it is a little coarse in the grain, it is not taken off so clean as sometimes leather is, and one side there is a speck or two of the grain upon it, I can pick it out from a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before my lord mayor you knew it because it was stitched with yellow silk?</p>
               <p>Becket. I said there's a place looks as if it was stitched with yellow silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell any body it was stitched with yellow silk ?</p>
               <p>Becket. No, I did not.</p>

            . I was present when Mr. Becket missed his money, about four o'clock in the afternoon he said he had lost 20 l. he lighted a candle, went up stairs and came down again, saying, my money is gone, and my house is broke out into Slow's: then I went up with him, he opened the closet door, and put down the candle, where I saw a hole big enough for two men to go through in the pannel out of Slow's passage into the prosecutor's closet.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the plaister wall?</p>
               <p>Newton. There was no plaister wall as I saw, only wainscot or boards nailed up against a post. We went to Mr. Slow's house and found his wife, and in a moment he came. We had a notion of a person that lives in the upper part of the house; they were ready to get a candle, then we went up there, and all was secure. When the search-warrant was got I was present at the searching of the house, none but the prisoner was left with me, who walked up and down for about a quarter of an hour, but nothing passed between him and me, There was a rattling of money up stairs, then he left me and went up and came down again, saying, it is very surprizing to me he has not been robbed before now. After that came the officer and Mr. Becket, and searched below, where Mr. Greenwood brought out a linnen bag, and asked Mr. Becket if that was his, he said no. In a minute after that, or less, he brought out that leather pocket and tossed it down, and Mr. Becket said, this is my pocket in which my silver was. After this we went to the Mansion-House to have a hearing before my lord mayor. The prisoner walked up and down, and seemed very uneasy, so I said to him, had not you better make it up with him, it is running a great hazard to go before my lord; he said, I'll do any thing to make Mr. Becket easy; said I, doubtless some of the money is embezzled away, give him the remainder: then he said, suppose I give him a note for the remainder. Presently after he said, if I do my character is blasted, and I may as well he hang'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this conversation?</p>
               <p>Newton. This was in the Mansion-House before we appeared before my lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by at this conversation?</p>
               <p>Newton. There were none by but he and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Newton. I live in Wood-Street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060015"/>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Newton. I am a breeches-maker,</p>
               <p>Q. When the pocket was found, did not he call his wife to bring a pair of breeches that it was taken out of?</p>
               <p>Newton. He did desire her to fetch a pair of breeches that a pocket was taken out of, but there was no proof it was that pocket.</p>

             for a search-warrant, and I, being an officer, went along with him and searched the house of the prisoner; we found between 5 and 6 l. in money, then I came down stairs and looked among some rubbish in an old trunk all rags and very ordinary stuff, there I found a little linnen bag, I was down on my knees, so sent it out by another man, which the prosecutor did not know. After that I looked farther, and found this leather pocket in that trunk, and Mr. Becket directly said he had it many years to keep his money in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention he thought it was done with silk ?</p>
               <p>Nash. He did mention that he thought it was done with silk, but when he came to look at it, he said that the place that he meant was a stain in the grain of the leather: The prisoner said it could not be Mr. Becket's, because it came out of his black breeches; they were fetched down, and no pockets were out of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else?</p>
               <p>Nash. No, I did not; Slow was in a great quandary.</p>

At last Mr. Nash said, here is a crease; then said Mr. Becket, that is the place I meant: I was very much in a flutter, and said I had a pair of breeches which I had lengthened: the next day, when I came to consider better, I found how the thing was, but then I did not.</p>

               <p>M. Eager. He said nothing at all to me, I never heard him speak, and went away with the money in his hand to the chaise behind me; I drove on to the house of Mr. Spires, about two or three stones cast from thence, and told the people. we had been robb'd by a footpad, and if they would pursue him they might take him; I could give no other description of him than that he had a very dirty shirt on; I was so much terrified, I did not mind his face, nor can I say the prisoner is the man: the people set out in about ten minutes after I had been robb'd in pursuit, and brought the prisoner in a our a quarter of an hour. I said to him, way do you throw your life away so? he said he had no work. but he would go to work; we went with him before the justice at Isleworth, and he there in some measure denied it. The justice ask'd him how he came by the pistol; he said he found it in a stable as he was cleaning it; he said we did not give him the money, but we threw it on the ground and he took it up.</p>

               <p>R. Hydeman.

We took him to the justice's, who ask'd him many questions; the prisoner said we dropp'd the money and he pick'd it up.</p>

Douglass was taken and brought into my shop on Saturday the 11th of last month ; it was a pattern of a surtout coat, outside and lining, ready to give to a taylor to make. I have nothing to say against Crawley.</p>
               <p>Robert Hall. I was standing opposite to the prosecutor's house, and saw Douglass stand at the corner of the window ; I saw him put his hand over and reach a parcel of black cloth, so I stepped over to him and took him into the shop. Mr. Sullivan was out at the time, but his wife sent for him, and he came. I had taken the parcel from Douglass, which Mr. Sullivan said was his property. After that he let him go, and in about a quarter of an hour after as I was going up the street I saw him, a sailor-like man, and a woman together, but lost fight of the sailor-like man and the woman, neither can I say it was Crawley. Crawley afterwards owned he was with Douglass; I there saw Douglass stoop down and pick up another bundle of cloth, so I went to him and took hold of him again; this was about 2 or 300 yards from the prosecutor's shop. I brought him back again to the shop, and shewed Mr. Sullivan that bundle, which he also said was his; this was the surtout coat. Somebody else had stopped Crawley, and he was brought to the shop, but there was nothing found on him. They were carried before the justice, where Douglass owned he took both the bundles of cloth in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Douglass's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from the custom-house about six or seven at night, and overtook Crawley and a woman together, who were cursing and swearing about some goods which she had in her lap; I went into a house and had half a pint of beer, and coming out again I saw the woman with a pair of breeches in her lap. Crawley came and gave me the things they have been talking of, and desired me to hold them, saying, he'd come to me in about three minutes; then that man came and took hold on me, and took me to the gentleman's house. Then the woman went off with what she had got.</p>

My watch is a silver one, and was hanging up in my room where I work last Saturday; I was told it was missing about eleven in the morning. The prisoner at the bar worked at the needle for me, though at the same time she was gone away: she left the door a-jar, which gave reason to suspect her. I handed some bills amongst the pawnbrokers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060020"/> brokers, and sent my boy to see if he could find her, which he did on the Monday following; she immediately confessed she had taken and pawned the watch to Mr. Gunston in Germain Street. I got a constable, and went with her; she asked for the watch, and it was brought out with the chain and seal on it; I found she had had nothing upon it. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gunston. The prisoner brought this watch to me on Saturday last in the morning between nine and ten o'clock. and wanted to borrow three guineas and a half on it; I asked her where she brought it from, and she said from her father in Piccadilly, that he had broke his leg, and if I disputed it she would fetch her mother; she went, but did not return. On the Monday morning I saw an advertisement, but before I could get myself ready to go as directed, the prosecutor came with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>My prosecutor offered me three guineas and a half to lie with me; I asked him for the money on the Friday night, and he said he had none, but bid me take the watch and pledge it for three guineas and a half, so I went and the gentleman stopped it.</p>

Some how this money was confistuated out of my pocket, it was in halfpence (nine shillings); I missed it in less than three minutes time, and was in company with no body but her; I know I brought it out of the house; it was lost when she made the second ance. She forcibly held me as an officer or does a man, so I went back again, but could not find her; the Monday I laid hold on her and her into publick house, where two men came and took hold of my collar, so she got away again, but was afterwards apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the trunk lock'd?</p>
               <p>Price. It was, and I had the key in my pocket. The prisoner and I lay together; I never knew him before he came there; I suspected him and took him up when I missed the trunk, which was on the Sunday morning. I had him before Justice St. Lawrence, but he would not confess; the Justice sent him to the Round-house; before he went in he turned his head, and said to Mr. Hall, I don't know what to do, I'd speak with you; then he said, I have made such a vow, for which I am d - d for ever. Then he said, one How fetched the trunk down, and he stood in Piccadilly, at the end of the street, and received it, and went to open it in a Court, and was not quick enough, then How opened it with a crooked nail; that one took the 36 s. piece, and the other the two guineas; then he went to Salisbury-Court, and lodged the trunk at a Green Grocer's all night; the next day he went to the Cross Key's in Wood-street, and sent it down to Stratford upon Avon, with the other things in it. I sent an evidence that is here, and it was brought up to town last Monday; there were in it, when it came back, five shirts, ten stocks, the silver snuff-box, two razor-cases, four razors, and the note of hand. The money and two shirts were gone. This How is out of the way and not to be found.</p>
               <p>Robert Hall. On Saturday the 25th of November the prosecutor complained he had lost the things mentioned, upon which I went up stairs to see if the trunk was not misplaced, but could not find it; after that Cross (the prisoner) and I went into the yard together; I said to him, I suspect you to have it, and if you'll confess it and bring it again, perhaps you may save your life; he answered, here is Archbolt, (a man that lay in the same room) it must be either he or I, but I have it not; I went for a warrant to take him up, he went out with a pretence to have his wig comb'd, and when I return'd he was gone; one Monday morning I saw him near Golden-Square and took him up; and had him before the Justice, he confess'd nothing there, we took him to the round-house; just before he was going in, he desir'd to speak with me; so we went on one side, he then said he had made so black an oath that he should be d - d for ever if he declar'd it; he pull'd the 36 s. piece out of his shoe and gave it me, (produced in court) and said it was taken out of the trunk, and that

At first he denied knowing any thing of either watch or money; then I desired he might be search'd, and there was found upon him one 36 s. piece, half a guinea, and 12 s. in silver. After some time he confess'd that he did the fact; at first he said a milkwoman had taken the watch.</p>

               <p>E. Waters. This was before we went to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he confess?</p>
               <p>E. Waters. He confess'd that he took the money and watch, that he had hid them on the top of the teaster of his bed; and if I would forgive him he'd send for them; I sent, and there were found ten 36 s. pieces, half a guinea, 12 s. in silver, and the watch; they are here in the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who heard this his confession?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was recommended to the prosecutrix to court and marry her by an acquaintance of her's, and was entertained by her with all manner of acceptance as such; I was in the house from time to time, and did several odd jobbs for her about the house. Ask her, whether she did not deliver that watch to me on the 9th of December when we had a rabbit for dinner, as a token of love.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. You hear what the prisoner says; what say you to it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He never proposed such a thing; he never made love to me, neither did I ever give him a watch. He was recommended to me as a shipcarpenter and joiner. The first day I ever saw him he was talking he wanted to buy a watch, and this watch being given into my care to sell, I shewed it him, but he only wound it up and delivered it to me again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask the constable what she said in his hearing about my courting her.</p>
               <p>Constable to the question. When I had him in custody the prosecutrix was asked, whether ever he put the question to her about marriage, and she said, no; but at last she said, I told him if he was a man suitable to my years, I should like him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the watch?</p>

I ran to the door and saw my man coming up out of the cellar ; I asked him if he had had any body with him, he said no: I thought I missed a small loaf of sugar from near the door; I went after the prisoner and took him with it under his arm; my man at that time called out, then the prisoner dropp'd the sugar down.</p>

               <p>Price. They are folding doors, and they were both open; this was on Saturday night; I carried the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor, on the Monday morning; there he pretended he saw the sugar lying on the ground.</p>

His back being towards the light, it is impossible for me to speak to his face; but by his shape and apparel I have no doubt of the prisoner being the identical person; I saw him go on the left hand side of my warehouse, and immediately came back again, there were some packs, intercepted my sight, that I did not see him for a very short space of time; he went out immediately, I went round my desk and came into my warehouse; and got my eye upon him again; the distance of time that I lost sight of him, was so short that it is impossible he could have any accomplice to give my piece to, I saw a piece under his arm when he went out; and he had it when I saw him in the street; I went and took hold on him within 30 or 40 yards of my warehouse door; whether I seiz'd him first, or the next evidence, I can't say; we took the goods from him. ( Produc'd in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value ?</p>
               <p>Tooke. It is worth 5 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody has it been since ?</p>
               <p>Tooke. It has been in my custody ever since; and I immediately set a mark upon it; the prisoner was secur'd, and committed from the time he went out of my shop, to the time we took him, which I apprehend was not above two minutes.</p>

               <p>Matthewson. I live about thirty or forty yards from his warehouse ; at last I saw the prisoner go in.</p>

               <p>Matthewson. I am; and he came out again without any thing; in about the space of a minute he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060028"/> went in again and brought out a piece of white stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Look on that parcel (produced), was it like that by the quantity and colour?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. It was; I ran down the street and collared him, and in the interim Mr. Tooke ran from his warehouse door to the prisoner, there might be about 2 or 3 feet distance between us and not above; I don't remember which of us took the piece from him, but we carried him back to Mr. Tooke's warehouse. Mr. Tooke sent for a constable and charged him with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Matthewson. He said a gentleman gave him three halfpence to go and take a piece of stuff that lay down there.</p>

               <p>I was coming along on my lord mayor's day a little in liquor, and a gentleman, very well dressed, told me, if I'd take that bundle which he had under his arm and carry it to the end of the street, he'd give me three pence to buy me some beer. Some of these gentlemen came and laid hold on my collar. The man was quite a stranger to me, he was just before me; he went away and they took me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthewson. Did you see any body before the prisoner when you took hold on him ?</p>

            . About the latter end of July there was a quarrel between the prisoner and the deceased, who passed for his wife; he was beating her own son which she had by her first husband, I saw it; he made the boy's nose bleed: she went to take the boy's part, and tore the prisoner's skirt off his coat. He raved sadly at her, and flung her down in the court; he kicked her over the face and stomach, and beat her very violently; she was cut, and bled sadly; I and some others helped her up, and begged of him to be easy ; but he said, d - n her for a bitch, he'd do for her. Four or five days after this I was in my own room, and they sent the girl to me to come to the prisoner and her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle. I live in <placeName id="t17521206-41-crimeloc209">Three Crowns Court, Whitechapel</placeName>

I went to their chamber (they had but one room), and the prisoner asked me if he owed me any money, and I said, no, you do not; then he cursed his wife, and said, that bitch says I owe you money; she replied, she said no such thing; he fell a raving at her, and went to the China, took a tea cup, and flung it at her head; he also flung other earthern things about the room, when she was sitting in the bed. There was a glass viol on the chimney, and I was afraid he'd fling that at her, so I took it and put it with some other things into a bason, and put the bason on the floor under the seet of the bed, and went to the prisoner and desired him to moderate his position, saying, he'd do her a mischief, and if he did he must suffer for it; I also said, see what a condition she is in (she was terribly mortified then) being bruised in her breast, neck, and eyes, from his beating her on the Sabbath Day, which I mentioned before. He cursed her and called her bitch,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060029"/> saying, she should not be there, and bid her get up and go about her business; she said, you rogue, I have no where to go, you have sold my things, where must I go? and besides I am not able to move, you have beat me till I am not able to stir. He ran towards his loom, (he is weaver, and his loom stands in the same room), but what he took up I cannot tell, though he seemed to take up something; I was affrighted and ran down stairs, and troubled myself no more about it. After this, on a Tuesday in August, (I cannot swear to the day of the month), it was in the afternoon I heard several high words into my own chamber, which was almost opposite; I heard her cry murder! I looked out at my window, so I went down stairs and to the house where they lived; I saw the deceased and the prisoner, the deceased being about five steps up their stairs from the ground; she had hold of a bag under her leg, like as if she was keeping it from him; he was pummilling her on her side with his fist, saying, you b - h, let go the bag; she said, I will not, you rogue you'll murder me, you rogue, for God's sake, don't beat me so; he kept calling her several out of the way names, saying, he'd murder her, a b - h. After this, he gave her a blow on the side, then he reached his right hand towards the head of the stairs, and took down a piece of timber ; she was sitting down under him like.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs do you think it was to the top into the room?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle. I can't say how many, the room is not very high; he gave her a blow with the timber, seemingly to me on the left side of the head. (The piece of timber produced in court about two feet and a half long, three inches by two the width and breadth. ) The use of it was to lay before the fire instead of a sender to keep the coals from falling out of the fire into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased a mind to fly from him either upwards or downwards?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle. She could not, he had got his knees under her, and he was leaning over her; she was but a very little woman. I called out when he struck her with it, you nasty rogue, you'll murder your wife, are not you ashamed to serve your wife so cruelly? When he gave her the blow she let the bag fall out of her hand, and it fell to the bottom of the stairs. Then the prisoner flung the timber to the bottom of the stairs, and came down from her and took up the bag, leaving her on the stairs. I took up the piece of timber directly; and called after him as he was going away, and said, are not you ashamed to strike a woman with such a thing as this? ke kept d - g her, and said, had a b - h, have I done for her ? The stick was all bloody at one end, I shewed it to five or six neighbours in the court. When I turned my eyes round the deceased was sitting on a bench at the house door, (whether she got there herself, or was helped, I know not), she was all bloody; she swooned away, so I went to her and took her by the shoulder, telling her she would catch cold in her head, being without a cap; I asked her where her cap was; she said she did not know. Then I got a pair of scissors and cut her hair off about the wound which seemed to be about two inches long; then I took her apron and bound it about her head, and took her to a surgeon in Petticoat Lane immediately, but do not know his name, which is about as far distant as from here to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she walk ?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle. She did, but she lean'd very heavy, and I help'd her along as well as I could; when she got there she sat down; when he touch'd the wound she swooned away; after she came to herself, he ask'd her if she was sick, she said, heart sick, and spoke very faint and low: He dress'd the wound, and prepared two bottles of stuff, one to take inwardly, and the other to anoint her head with ; one came to 8 d. and the other to 6 d. she had no money; I said to her you must go home and pull off that gown and pawn it; she look'd upon it, and said, it is all bloody, who will take it in; it was because I would not let him pawn this gown to-day that he beat me so. I help'd her home, she said several times going along that she was very sick, and her head was very bad; I left her with the neighbours at the second step going into the court where we live, and went to my own door, she was about 10 or 12 yards from her home. On the Sunday before she had this wound, I saw them going down the court in peace, and I ask'd her how she did, she said (meaning the former time of his beating her) that was one of his mad fears, but she hop'd he would be a good boy, and go to work and get it up again.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Where was you when the deceas'd cut my work out of my loom?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle. I don't know when it was cut out, I knew it was cut, and that was a fortnight or better before this wound was given; they had parted about that time, and came together again, it was cut but about two inches in on the left side.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060030"/>Q. from Prisoner. Did you see her strike me first?</p>
               <p>M. Oagle No, I never saw her strike you, I have seen her tear your coat and shirt in her own defence.</p>

            . I liv'd next door to the prisoner, and hearing a noise, I went to look into the house to see what was the matter; after that, in the afternoon, on a Tuesday in August, I saw the deceased on the stairs, and the prisoner standing over her and beating her; I ran back again, for I could not bear to see it ; then I went to my own door, and after I had been there a short space of time he came out with a long bag on his back and went down the court; soon after that she came with her head all bloody, and running down her face, calling out, Stop the rogue, for he has murdered me! he turn'd round at the end of the court and said, Ah, you B - h, I'll murder you! and away he went. She sat down on a bench, and Mrs. Oagle got a pair of scissors and cut the hair off her head, and while she was doing it the deceased fainted away; I did not choose to see the wound; Mrs. Oagle wash'd it with chamber-lie, and bound it up and went with her to a surgeon; and when the deceas'd came back she sat down on the same bench, I went to her and ask'd her how she found herself, she with a very slow voice answered, very bad, leaning her head against the wall, and said no more.</p>

            . The deceas'd was brought to the London-Hospital about the 13th of August; I am a surgeon and pupil there, and was there when she was brought in; she had a large wound on her head, and I dress'd it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts on the head?</p>
               <p>Benns. On the back part of her head; she had no bad symptoms at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any other wound?</p>
               <p>Benns. No, none but that; in a few days after she was seized with convulsions and other bad symptoms, which indicated extravasated blood lying on the brain, and the surgeons thought proper to trapan her, which they did; I saw the operation, and a small quantity of matter discharg'd from the opening which was made in her scull; and notwithstanding all the care taken to preserve her life, she died about the 27th of the same month. She liv'd about a fortnight there, and upon opening the scull after she was dead, a large portion of the brain was mortified, which confirm'd the surgeons, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Dodson, in their opinion; that the wound she had received was the Cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your opinion ?</p>
               <p>Benns. It was, my lord, there were all the bad symptoms that could be.</p>

            . I think he said, I have been killing Bott ; and another time he said I have been killing my wife, and swore in a reprobate manner that he had done it, and that there were three or four lord chief justices warrants out after him, but he had got clear of them all. My husband was above stairs, and I not giving credit to what the prisoner said, I call'd to my husband and told him; what the prisoner said; and the prisoner told me he owed my husband a shilling, and was going away, but he would give my husband a pot of beer and he must forgive him the shilling, and then went away. I inquired after the deceased, and at last found she was carried to the London Infirmary, and at last found she died there. Some time after that the prisoner was coming by my door, I seized him by the arms and call'd out, a Murderer! a Murderer! he got away from me, and I followed him a little way and describ'd him to two men, who brought him to my door, and I charg'd a constable with him.</p>
               <p>Barlow Seyer. I am a constable; the prisoner was brought to me, and I was charg'd with him; he cried very much, and behav'd well; I took him before Mr. Alderman Chitty, where Mrs. Oagle came and swore the same she has done here, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday morning I went out in order to take a walk to refresh myself, and coming home I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175212060031"/> was taken very ill with a swimming in my head; about eleven o'clock up came her son, he could neither stand nor go he was so drunk; I seeing that surpriz'd me, and talk'd to him very much for getting drunk on the Sabbath day; she took it up, and they both fell upon me as I lay down on the bed, at which I got up and struck the son, this was a week before this accident happen'd; I bid him quit the room and he gone, but he would not, and she said he should not go away; I tumbled him down the stairs as well as I could, and she took hold on my cloaths and tore them, and took two of my shirts and tore them all to pieces. On the Monday following she went out of revenge and said, D - n you, you son of a b - h, I'll be reveng'd on you, and took a knife and cut about four inches in my work, then she took the main body of the silk in the cane in her hand and went to cut it across, saying. I'll do you all the injury in my power, I sent for one of our master's journeymen in order to take away the work, who came and carried it away to his own house; then I took and knock'd down the loom and sold it, and went and got work abroad. When she found I had got work, she came and made a riot about the house, and turn'd me out of bread there; after that I got work elsewhere, so that she could not find me out: She came to me one morning betimes, and said, D - n you, you dog, if you will not tell me where you work, I'll knock your brains out, and took up a hair broom from behind the door and made a blow at me, I catch'd it with my arm and clos'd in upon her and gave her two blows, but whether over the head or shoulder I cannot tell; I gave her a push from me and down stairs I went, but whether the blow she received was with the broom or the edge of the stairs I cannot tell; but as to that piece of timber I never saw nor handled it, nor that woman, Mrs. Oagle, was never in the house or see any thing of it, that us'd to lie before the fire. She was a very troublesome woman, and lov'd liquor; her last husband was transported for thieving for her, and I would not go thieving for any of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him take it?</p>
               <p>White. I did very plainly; I was looking to see my lord mayor go by in his return from court; the quickness of the motion threw the handkerchief near as high as my head; I saw it fly up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner before or behind you?</p>
               <p>White. He was standing behind me, and I catch'd him by the collar, so he dropped it upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fall?</p>
               <p>White. I saw it before it dropped to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there much crowd near you?</p>
               <p>White. No, there were but few people near me besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he gone far before you seized him?</p>
               <p>White. He was not got above a yard from the place; I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>White. He said the handkerchief was hanging out of my pocket, and he took it out in order to give it me, being apprehensive I should lose it.</p>

               <p>Field. He said, sir, I was going to pick your handkerchief up to give it you; then the prosecutor took him to the Compter; the prisoner at the Compter said it was the first fact he ever did.</p>
