(<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he said that the office of Mr. Hodgson, the treasurer of Queen Anne's bounty, did not open until eleven o'clock, and that it would be an accommodation to him if I would take my bill out of that receipt, and give him the change—the amount of my bill was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took it of him, and gave him the difference—there must have been gold and silver among what I gave him—I cannot say what coin it was—it must have been the coin of the realm—I know I gave him even the fractional penny—before twelve I presented it at Mr. Hodson's office, in Dean's-yard, Westminster—I did not get the money—I was told that mine was the seventh application.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am treasurer to the Governors of Queen Anne's bounty. Mr. Thomas produced this receipt to me on 11th April, 1849—the incumbent of Minster, in Kent, was at that time entitled to the sum speci<lb/>fied in the receipt, as a half-year's dividend—I did not know at that time that the prisoner was not entitled to it—he is incumbent of Minster—any person bringing a receipt signed by the incumbent would receive the money—the prisoner was not entitled to the sum mentioned in the receipt on 11th April, but I did not know it at that time; I know it now, I had a certificate from the Registrar of the diocese of Canterbury—I received a letter from the prisoner about half-past ten o'clock that morning, desiring me not to pay anybody—the writing of the letter is similar to the receipts which I have had from him before—I have never seen him write—I have acted on those receipts, and paid money on them, not to him personally, but to persons who have brought them from him—I have here two receipts in his handwriting—I have had no personal communication with the prisoner on the subject of those receipts, only by writing—he has answered one letter of mine—I have that answer here—that is the only letter I had from him, except the one I received on the morning of 11th April—I can say that money was paid on these receipts—I never had any complaint from the prisoner respecting the money so paid—this letter came by a messenger—there is no envelope to it—my office opens at ten in the morning—that is the usual hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the Governors of Queen Anne's bounty. On 11th April the prisoner, for aught we then knew, was entitled to receive the sum named in this receipt—if nothing had occurred to prevent it I should have paid it—we have since paid the money to the sequestrators—I have never paid any of these sums to the prisoner personally—the first payment made to him was in Oct., 1847—he became Incumbent in the July previous—he was paid the half-year, due on 10th Oct., 1847—that was paid to his receipt, which is here—in April, 1848, another half-year became due, and for that half-year three receipts were presented; we paid one of the three, the first that was presented, the other two were rejected; then commenced a correspondence—Mr. Hodgson thought it a case that it was his duty to represent to the Archbishop of Canterbury—he did so, and at the same time he wrote to the Incumbent, and his answer is now in Mr. Hodgson's posses<lb/>sion—when letters are sent from our office they are put into the letter-box, and the messenger comes round at the close of the office, seals them, puts a stamp on them, and takes them to the post—that is the daily process—I am not able to say whether the letter addressed to the prisoner was put into the box—it was written by Mr. Hodgson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> The answer has not a post-mark on it—it seems to have been enclosed in the envelope, which most likely was put into the waste-basket—I can positively swear that money has been paid on each of these receipts to the parties whose names are written on the back—there is a set form for these things issued by the office—that set form is copied most accurately in these receipts, in every way—they purport to be signed "Richard Child Willis, incumbent," and in the letter to Mr. Hodgson be signs himself R. C. Willis—subsequent to that correspondence, which was in April, 1848, we have paid one receipt to Dr. Willis' signature; that was at Michaelmas, 1848—I can hardly say that in doing so we acted on that letter—that was merely an explanation of why he passed three receipts before, but at the subsequent Michaelmas another half-year became due, and we paid it to his receipt, not with standing he had presented three on the previous Lady<lb/>day—we acted upon the letter as coming from him, and we paid one of his receipts afterwards—this is the letter we received from him in April, 1848—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To C. Hodgson, Esq.,—Vicarage, Minster, 17th April, 1848. Sir,—I was exceedingly grieved to find by your letter, which reached me on Saturday evening, that you should imagine I had done anything by which you should have been the sufferer; I can assure you, Sir, such was very far from being the case, inasmuch as one of the three receipts you mention had been actually paid as the bankers can testify, though the party who banded it in with others was quite unaware of the circumstance before it was presented; the others I was assured would not be presented at all, being, as I told the tradesmen, and positively believing it to be so, wrongly worded; I could be far more minute in this unfortunate affair, but as you require a statement by Tuesday, and I am perfectly overwhelmed with duty, I find it impossible to add more at present. I am, Sir, with the greatest possible regret at what has occurred, your faithful servant, R.C. Willis"—this other letter is the one we received on the Wednesday morning, 11th April—I believe it to be in the prisoner's writing—I also believe these two receipts to be the same handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Tuesday evening, 10th April, 1849. Sir,—As I am a little recovering</p>

               <p>from a state of mind almost bordering upon insanity, I feel well assured that I have distributed to tradesmen more receipts for Queen Anne's bounty for the parish of Minster, in Kent, than one; I hope therefore that none will be attended to, for I have not been master of my own actions. I write this with the deepest concern, in much agony of mind. I have left Minster, nor will my health permit me to return. I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c., R.C. Willis.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in consequence of that letter that the receipt on that day was not honoured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can hardly say it was in consequence of that letter—it certainly was in consequence of this that Mr. Thomas's was not paid, only I should explain that before Mr. Thomas's was presented six others had been presented and refused payment by me—I have those receipts in my possession—this letter rather strengthened the information that had before reached us.</p>

On 19th Dec. this receipt was produced at my office, by a man, I cannot say his name; I gave him this check on the bankers of the Company—it is marked "and Co.," so as to make it payable at a banker's—on 22nd the prisoner came with Ludlow and a postman—I asked him what he had done with the letter—he said he had thrown it down on his desk, and thought no more of it till the next morning—I asked whether he was in the habit of throwing down letters that related to money on his desk, and taking no notice of them—he said no, he was not—I said he must see the necessity of making every exertion to find out who had obtained the letter—he said when he went to look for it the next morning, he could not find it, and had not seen it since—he asked to look at the receipt; I showed it him, and after examining it he said it looked very like an imitation of his father's handwriting—he then went away, on the understanding that he was to make inquiries whether any one about his premises had taken the letter—he said it could not be any brother of his—he came to me on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards, in the evening; he said that persons about his premises gave him a great deal of annoyance; that they were inquiring about, and watching about there, and it was doing him incalculable injury in his business; and if we would have those persons removed, he would guarantee that the money should be paid in—I told him the matter was in the hands of the solicitors of the Com<lb/>pany—I think he asked for the address; I gave it him; he was going to write it down, and he suddenly checked himself, and said his hands were cold, and asked me to write it down—I did not do so, but I mentioned where he would find them—I am not quite positive whether he had taken a pen in his hand—there were writing materials on the table.</p>

Q.</hi> What was the date of the last occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was on the Wednesday or Thursday after the Saturday; I think that would be 27th Dec.—it was not warm; it was Christmas weather—he said the reason he did not take notice of the letter was, he was busy—he said, in the course of conversation, that he saw the letter was not for him—I do not think he said that, when I asked him if it was usual for him to take so little notice of letters relating to money—he did not come to complain that the police were about his house talking to his neighbours and libelling his character—he said it was doing him an incalculable deal of injury in his business; he did not say "the lies" the policemen were telling about him; he said "those people" being about the premises, he did not say what people—he said he had got a clue to the person who had obtained the money, and he would guarantee it should be repaid if these persons were removed—I do not recol<lb/>lect his saying, that rather than submit to such annoyance and injury, he would pay the money out of his own pocket: he may have said that—John Humphreys was charged with this matter by the Company—I was a witness—Humphreys is not in the employ of the Company—I do not know that he has been paid anything—I paid him nothing but the check.</p>

I received a letter from the carrier of the Upper King-street district—the direction on it was, "Kelly, 24, Upper King-street, Russell-square"—the person could not be found at that address—I knew a Mr. Kelly, of 24, Gloucester-street, Queen-square—I took the letter there, and saw the prisoner—I presented it to him, and asked if it was for him—he opened it, and said, yes, it was all right—I left it with him—on 22nd I was present at the prisoner's place of business with Mr. Ludlow—Mr. Ludlow asked him if he had not received a letter that did not belong to him—he first said, "No"—he afterwards said, "By-the-by, I did receive a letter; I opened it, and put it on the desk, and have not seen it since."</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting last year as agent for Messrs. Kelly, the publishers of the "Directory." I got orders for five copies from the South-Eastern Railway—I was then living at No. 24, Upper King-street, Russell-square, and that was the address I gave—this is the account I sent in, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called for the payment of it—the last time I called, was on 22nd Dec., and a communication was made to me, which led to this inquiry—I had not then removed—I removed two days after Christmas-day—the reason the letter did not reach me was because it was addressed to Mr. Kelly, instead of Giles—on 22nd Dec. I was informed that the money was paid—I had not received it; I have now—this receipt is not my writing; I have no knowledge of it—I was at the office when the prisoner came there—Captain Graham asked him some questions—he certainly acknowledged having received the letter, but denied all knowledge of the money—this matter then came before the Magistrate, and Humphreys has been taken into custody—on 16th Jan, I met the prisoner opposite the Bank of England, between one and two o'clock in the day—he stopped and spoke to me—that was after there had been one hearing before the Magistrate—he asked me whether I had heard anything since the last examination—I said, "No"—he said, "Of course, in your position, I do not expect you to know much about it"—I said I had heard nothing since then; it was entirely out of my hands, and I had nothing more to do with it—he said, "I had much rather have been committed by the Magistrate than to have been remanded; I should have known what to do; I should have taken it to a higher Court (to the Queen's Bench, I understood him); but as I am remanded, I do not know what course they mean to pursue"—he said, "Of course, I know all about it; it was never intended to defraud the South-Eastern Company; it was thought the letter was intended for my father, Colin Kelly, and at this season of the year we thought to do him out of it, to have a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">spree;</hi> we intended to have paid my father in a month or two's time"—that was all that passed, as far as I can recollect—I had been at the examination to which he alluded—I had seen Thomas there—I said to the prisoner, "I understand the person Thomas, you alluded to as having received the money, was in court at the time"—he said, "I know he was," or words to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the 11th regiment Hussars. In Sept. last the part of the regiment I was with was quartered at Hampton Court—I had a small watch with a gold chain, and lost it, with a dark morocco case, from my dressing-table in a private room in the mesa-house—I had acquired that watch by changing it with a Mr. Joel for one for which I gave 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chain I gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—I gave notice in the regiment, and to the police next morning, that I had lost it—I did not see it again till about a month ago, when I found it in the possession of Sergeant Churchill, at Twickenham—I at once knew it to be mine—the prisoner was a servant it the mess-house—I cannot say she was there at the time I lost the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner anything to do with your room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing at all—each of the officers have one of the soldiers' wives to attend to their sleeping apartment—they have access to the rooms as well as the servants of the officers—there were not above a dozen persons in the barracks that would have access to the rooms—there were from ninety to one hundred soldiers in the barracks, but the mess-house is quite detached from the barracks—there were three soldier's wives who had access to that floor—I believe they are not here.</p>

               <p>9th Nov. the prisoner brought me a gold watch and chain—I cannot swear to the watch—it was of the size of this one—I do not recollect anything about the chain—I recollect having a chain in my possession, but do not recollect the prisoner bringing it—she brought the watch to me to sell—I asked her questions, to satisfy me that it was her own—to the best of my recollection, she said she had the watch from abroad—I cannot pretend to say now what she asked me—she said she had it when she came from abroad—I did not buy it the first day she brought it—to the best of my recollection, she asked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the chain to be a plated one at the time—I did not try it—I threw it on one side, and it lay in my drawer for a month, along with a lot of rubbish—I did not know it again till Lieutenant Garland drew the pattern of it; I then immediately told him about it, and traced the watch for him—I took this receipt from the prisoner—she sent the watch by her sister on 9th Nov., and I told her to send the prisoner, and she came the same afternoon, and that put me off my guard—I was not suspicious at all—she would not take the price I offered at first, and afterwards sent her sister to say she would take it—there was a dark morocco case with the watch, and a small gold key with it—the watch was out of order—this is the receipt she gave me—I wrote it, and she signed it in my presence—I paid her the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had sent part by the sister—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Windmill-lane, New Hampton, Nov. 9th, 1849. Received of Mr. Saunders 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Geneva watch and key. Jane Griffin."—I have no recollection of purchasing the chain—I have no doubt I did, but I looked at it as a common chain at the time, of no value, and therefore I did not name it—I afterwards found it in my drawer among a parcel of rubbish—it turns out to be a gold one, and worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do with the articles you bought of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold the watch to a person in London, among a lot of silver and old watches—the prisoner described herself as coming from Windmill-lane—that was when she first came—I sold the watch, in the case, to a person named Solome, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I ultimately sold the chain for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a person named Page, a butcher, in Twickenham, being perfectly unaware, that it was gold—I have no doubt this is the chain—I have never seen the case since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner first came a few days prior to 9th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when she came the second time I was satisfied about her—I had watched her about Twickenham—I was satisfied by her conduct—I had often seen her previous to 9th Nov., and after she called on me I saw her about Twickenham, and I saw her with persons I believed to be respectable—she stopped for a quarter of an hour opposite my house, and spoke to a man who I believe was butler to a gentleman at Twickenham-green—she had offered the watch for sale to Mr. Beale, a watchmaker, opposite me, and he said it was worth nothing, it was a mere toy—she behaved with no secrecy during these three days—she carried it about openly and publicly—it appears that it had been put up to be raffled for at Hampton—when she came to me on the 9th I was perfectly satisfied as to her honesty, from her conduct both in my shop and out of it—in my judgment there is no intrinsic value in the watch—it is gold—it did not go when I had it—there was no pivot to wind it up with—it has passed through three or four hands since I sold it—I understand there has been 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. laid out on it since—I have not seen many watches as small as this—I could not identify it again—if I were to see it with twelve or thirteen others I could not identify it.</p>

On 19th Feb., at seven o'clock in the evening, the deceased was brought there—she was in a state of partial collapse, and was bleeding from a punctured wound on the right side of the neck, about an inch below the jaw—she was very much exhausted—it was such a wound as might have been produced by a stab from this knife—it was about three-quarters of an inch long, and about three inches deep—she lived till the 27th—when she was first brought in it did not appear a mortal wound, on account of the slight bleeding—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of her body, and the cause of death was inflamma<lb/>tion caused by the wound—the wound completely transfixed the larynx, or gullet—it did not pass through the carotid artery, but so close to it that it was to be seen pulsating—there was an extensive abscess on the opposite side of the wound, which was the result of the inflammation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk at Worship-street police-court. I remember Mr. Hammill, the Magistrate, going to the London Hospital on 20th Feb., and seeing the deceased, Charlotte Lovee, there—there was an examination taken—nothing had been before said by the deceased as to her expectation of recovery—the prisoner was present—the statement was the result of questions by the Magistrate—I took it down from her lips as she gave the answers in the presence of the Magistrate—it was then read over in the prisoner's presence, and she then put her mark to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner the opportunity of cross-examining the witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and he did put one question to her—it was signed by the Magistrate in his presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you administer the oath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the presence of the Magistrate and the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">the statement was here read, as follows</hi>: "I am the prisoner's wife; I was married to him in 1832.

               <p>met him coming down the court with another man; I told him I had been to Arbour-square, and had seen Mr. M'Kenzie, to get a warrant for him; he said, 'If you want a warrant I will give you getting a warrant.' I afterwards went to a public-house, and had a pint of fourpenny ale with my husband, and we both went home together, and I got tea ready, and he went and bought a sweetbread and some wine, and I was frying it at the fire, and just as I was about to pour out a cup of tea he said to me again, 'Where have you been?' and I said, 'Why, Lovee, I will tell you the truth; you had beaten me so in the morning, that I really did go to the police-court for a warrant.' He said, 'Oh, you did go to the police-court, did you?' I said, 'Yes,' and I saw something go to the right side of my neck; I felt no pain, but blood immediately flowed from my neck; and as he was taking away his hand from my neck I saw the little white<lb/>handled knife in his hand, and I said, 'Oh, he has stabbed me!' and I ran into Mrs. Salmon's, and then to the doctor's, and then two respectable men brought me here in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. He fetched me some wine before he stabbed me,")—That was in answer to a question put by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the business of Mrs. Martha Phillips, a tea-dealer.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Rawson Clarke, of Drayton-villas, Brompton. The prisoner was in my service about twelve months—in consequence of suspicion, I caused her to be given in custody on 11th March—I sent for an officer—we proceeded to search her boxes, and in consequence of what took place she was taken to the station—I went there afterwards and saw these keys—the inspector said to the officer, "Take these keys to Mrs. Clarke's, and see if they will open any place"—the prisoner then came forward and said to me, "I hope you will forgive me, and think no more of it"—I said, "It is out of my power now"—I accompanied the policeman with the keys to my house—there were two keys on the bunch; each opened one of my wardrobes—I missed rather better than two yards of claret velvet—when the prisoner went to the station she wore a claret velvet bonnet, but I did not notice it—I have since compared them—they corre<lb/>spond exactly—I also missed two yards of black satin, in the piece, from the wardrobe—I matched what the officer found with mine, and it corresponded exactly, and particularly here where it has been cut(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am positive this bonnet was made of a part of this velvet.</p>

               <p>"No, I did not"—I said, "Have you a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in your possession?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Have you a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note in the house?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Have you any paper money in the house?"—he said, "No, allow me to go and speak to my wife"—I said, "No, I cannot"—I then sent for Wilson, and he pointed to Isaacs, and said, "That is the person who went with Webb and Graston to the parlour"—I asked which parlour, as there are two, and he showed me the public parlour, from which there is a door to another court—Isaacs was taken, but was dis<lb/>charged, the note has never been traced to him—it was paid to a Mr. Stevens, a publican, in the Curtain-road, and afterwards to the Bank.</p>

I went and asked Mrs. Slaughter if she had a servant—she said, Yes, and pointed out the prisoner—I said to her, "Did you have the ring?"—she hesitated some time, and then said she found itin the yard in some shaving—I asked her why she did not tell her mistress—she said she intended to keep it to see if there was a reward offered for it, as she found two or three once before, and had some reward for them—she owned before the Magistrate that she gave it to her father—her father was sent before the Magistrate but discharged.</p>

The two prisoners were knocking at the door of the Blue Anchor, loud enough to disturb the inmates—the house was shut, and there was no appearance of any light—they con<lb/>tinued knocking some time—I went and asked them to go away quietly—they told me to go to b—y—they continued making a noise, and singing as loud as they could—I asked them to be quiet, and they told me again to go to b—y—they continued a noise sufficient to alarm the neighbourhood, and they went <hi rend="italic">on at me</hi> down Chequer-alley, and there they both fell down through liquor—I assisted to pick up Thomas, and while doing so, William said, "Keep your bands off, you b——, or else I will give you something"—they then placed themselves against the wall, and commenced singing as loud as they could, and said, "There, you b——, we put you at defiance to touch us"—I then took Thomas into custody—William then ran at me, and kicked me in the groin, saying. "Thomas, I will stick to you as long as I have a drop of blood in me"—they both then seized me by the collar—I got away and sprang my rattle—William said, "You may call, you b—"—I went down the alley, drew my staff, and be ran at me, and as he ran I hit him on the arm—he then got both arms around my waist, and said, "Stick to him, <hi rend="italic">Tom,"</hi> and Thomas caught me round the neck by the collar, and we all fell together—while we were down, Thomas beat me with his fists, took my rattle away, and threw it up the alley—I cannot say how long it was they kept assaulting me—assistance came at last, and they were taken into custody—I have been attended by Mr. Mather for this injury, and am under him now—I was in bed a fortnight, and have not been able to do duty since.</p>

               <p>this is the note—I know it by this writing, and also by the name of "Clutton, Bristol," on it—Beck asked the prisoner where he came from; if he had tra<lb/>velled by the railway, as he bad a bag with him, and he said, "I came by the railway from Birmingham;" giving us to understand that he had come from Birmingham that morning by the railway, and a minute or two after<lb/>wards he said it was eleven years since he was at Birmingham—I cannot exactly say what he said that gave me to understand he had come that morn<lb/>ing from Birmingham by the railway—Beck said, "By rail?"—he said, "Yes"—I should say he gave me to understand it by his bag—he named Birmingham—he had a small bag with him, and an overcoat on, what is called a sack, and a thickish scarf round his neck—I did not notice his under coat—he did not undo his overcoat while at my place—Beck took him to the station.</p>

Coutts to get the money, and then he said he had been there to find out our address—that was not very likely—then Mr. Unsworth, who had not said anything all the while, said to me, "That is the biggest lie that was ever told, because we went up to Messrs. Coutts' in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and he told me parti<lb/>cularly to get the money for him, either in notes or in gold"—the prisoner afterwards said, when I asked how he became possessed of the bills, that he was taking a walk in Paris, and met a young man who bad these bills in his hand, and he was going to tear them up; that he went up to him, and told him it was a great pity to tear those bills up, he would go over to London, I do not exactly recollect whether he said he would deliver them, or get the money for them, but he said something to that effect—I then gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>more than once; it might be a week or ten days after the last transaction—Jones said, "Will you let me have any more money, Mr. Wyatt?"—Mr. Wyatt replied, "No"—Jones said, "The fact of it is you must, for taking indecent liberties with Tiddiman—Mr. Wyatt went to the cheffioneer, and brought out half-a-sovereign and some silver—I received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the rest was to be divided with Sullivan—I did not see it shared—I knew Laidler first of all—one evening I was at a ball, 1st or 2nd March, with Bennett—Sullivan and Jones were not there—Bennett said, "Now,<hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> here is a young man," meaning Laidler, who we met there, "and he has no objection to set the part of a solicitor for us, to intimidate the old man and woman out of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Laidler replied that he would do so—Bennett proposed that Jones should act as clerk to the solicitor—two or three days alter, Jones and Laidler went us to Wyatt's; (but a week previous, or perhaps a little more than that, I met Sullivan, and he said it would be a good <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> for any one to go and act as solicitor, as there was a woman in the case)—Jones and Laidler went to Wyatt's; I waited outside with Sullivan, by agreement—Sullivan told Laidler to go in and get some money, and said we would wait till he came out; and said, "Mind you don't come out without it"—Laidler came out and said he had got a sovereign, all he could get—Sullivan called him on one side, and whispered something to him—we went to a public-house, shared the sovereign, and parted—either the same night, or the next; we all met again, by appointment, at a public-house in Long Acre, and it was agreed that we should all go—Sullivan gave Laidler instructions to draw up an "I O U," for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided Mr. Wyatt had not got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ready cash in the house; which, after some hesitation, Laidler agreed to do, not willingly—it was drawn out for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first—I made no reply, I was picking some cigars out of a cigar-case at the back of the bar—I think the publican's name was Purnall—I then went with them to Mr. Wyatt's—I believe Laidler walked on first, before Sullivan, Bennett, Jones, and me—he stopped a few doors before the shop till we arrived—Jones and Laidler went in, and me, Sullivan, and Bennett remained outside—in about ten minutes Laidler came out, and said to Sullivan, "I have told the woman all about it"—Laidler said to me, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> you must come in"—I said I would not—afterwards, by the persua<lb/>sion of Sullivan, I went in with Bennett—Sullivan was outside; he said he would not come in—Laidler went back with us—he and Jones talked to the woman in private—I saw tears in Mrs. Legg's eyes, and heard Laidler say, "It is a case not fit for a woman to be mixed up in, and this is the young man that can prove it," pointing to me—Mr. Wyatt was standing by the parlour, at the corner of the counter—he could hear what passed—he appeared rather nervous—Laidler asked him for some money—I do not know how much—Mr. Wyatt replied, he had not got any—Laidler said, "Then I will draw up an 'I O U' for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—one of them, (I cannot say which,) said, "No, it shall be for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." an "I O U" was drawn up by Jones, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is Samuel Wyatt's signature to it—there were two "I O U's"—one was for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that Bennett asked for a sovereign—Mr. Wyatt said he had not got one, but he would see what silver he had—he gave Bennett 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave Laidler a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I do not think Mrs. Legg was aware that the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was given—we all left the shop, and found Sullivan outside—we all went to a public-house, and then to a coffee-shop, where Jones said to Sullivan, "We have been to the old man, and made him give us an 'I O U' for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Sullivan said, "Then, of course, I <hi rend="italic">stand in</hi>"—Jones and Laidler replied, "Yes"—next day I went to Wyatt's with Laidler, Sullivan, Jones, and Bennett—Laidler and Jones went in by themselves, the others</p>

               <p>Bennett, but he snatched the rest, and said, "We may as well have all"—they went away, and took the money and the "I O U"—this was on Saturday—after that my uncle became much worse, he kept his bed until the day the prisoners were taken—on the Monday afterwards, Jones and Laidler came about the middle of the day—my uncle was in bed—they inquired after his health—I said he was very ill in bed, they might satisfy themselves by seeing him, if they thought proper—they did so; he slept in the parlour—they asked me for some money—I said they could not have it, but if they would come next day we would see what we could do for them—Laidler said he was a solicitor—the "I O U" was pro<lb/>duced—I really cannot tell what was said about it, for it was produced so often, and so much was said about it—they said they would compromise the affair for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I think it was that day that Laidler said he had been to the Docks to pay part of the passage-money, and that Tiddiman might start by that vessel—he said it was a most infamous affair, and, if it got into the papers, would cause more sensation than Greenacre's murder—I then said something to Jones about some other case—Jones mentioned some name, and said it was a similar case to the person in question, but he got him through it—next day, Tuesday, Laidler and Jones came—they said they came for money, and they wished it very much to be settled—I said it was impossible, but I would give them part of it—Laidler spoke—I gave them a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and two sovereigns, my uncle's money—the "I O U" was mentioned—Laidler received the money—I will not be certain whether I gave it him, or whether he took it up—when he had taken it, he said, "We consider this as our fees; do not tell Bennett or Tiddiman we have received any"—he said they might think they were compromising the affair; and I think he said something about indicting them for felony, and having Laidler's name struck off the roll of attorneys—I said I would not—next day, Wednesday, Laidler and Jones came again—they came almost every day—they saw Mr. Wyatt in bed—Laidler said, could not my uncle grant me an undertaking to get the remainder of the money—he said he could not—Laidler said, if he would, he would take me to the Bank, either in his private carriage or in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would not, and they went away—next day they came again, and brought an "I O U" for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was thrown away and burnt, as a forgery, it was not my uncle's writing—my uncle's name was to it—Laidler asked me if it was my uncle's writing—I told him, "No," and he then burnt it—he said it had got into Bennett's or Tiddiman's hands, one of the two, I do not know which—he said they picked hit pocket of it, and they could sell it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; as any one would give them that for an "I O U" with Mr. Wyatt's name to it—he said to Jones, "If you will endeavour to get it back from them, I will give you a sovereign"—Jones said, "I don't require that, I dare say I can do it without"—on one occasion, Laidler said if the money was not paid, the Sheriffs officer would come and take the things away; to the amount, I suppose—on the Friday, Laidler and Jones came again, and saw my uncle in bed—I said I wished to settle altogether, for I was very much annoyed, and my business was injured, as I was obliged to shut my shop up as soon as it was dark, to pacify my uncle, who was almost in a state of madness—Laidler said, "You can keep open with safety till nine o'clock at night, as your house is protected till then"—he said he paid a man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day to watch the house, and pointed out Sullivan, who was coming up the gateway opposite—he sent Jones to fetch Sullivan, who came back with Jones—Laidler said he would not be answerable for my shop after nine, as his man went off then—they all three went into my uncle's bedroom—Sullivan only asked him how he did</p>

               <p>—nothing was said there about settling—as they went away they asked me if I could settle it—I said I could not, it was not in our power—they went away somewhere about one or two o'clock—Sullivan said, as he was going away, that my uncle appeared very ill, and it was a pity it could not be settled—then they left—about eleven o'clock, after the shop was shut, I was alarmed by a very great noise, as if the shop-door was beat with sticks—(they used to enter at the private door)—it continued two or three minutes—I did not go—I was in the parlour—I heard a voice call my uncle's name, and ask if he did not mean to open the door—it was not a noise as if people wanted to come in—I did not open the door—it frightened my uncle very much—next morning Jones came—he saw my uncle, and said he was very sorry to see him so ill, and of course he wanted money—I told him they would have had the money if it had not been for the riot the night before—Jones asked me if I would give him a paper to satisfy the others that he had been there, and what was the cause of their not receiving the money—I consented—this is the paper I gave him(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my writing—he then asked if I could give him some money—I afterwards gave him and Laidler 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Friday the 8th—he denied having been there the night before—I said it was of no use, for I heard their voices—he said they had nothing to do with it—(<hi rend="italic">paper read</hi>—"Gentlemen,—Through your coming last evening, my uncle is much worse; if you will let the matter stand over till Monday at six, the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shall be forthcoming, M.

Laidler then answered, "Twenty-four pounds"—I said, "Is that your demand?" and one and all answered, "Yes"—I cannot say whether Sullivan spoke, but several said, "Yes"—I said, "Who is the solicitor in this affair?"—Laidler said, "I am"—I said, "Are you a solicitor?"—he answered, "Yes"—I said, "Where are your cham<lb/>bers?" he said, "It is affixed either to the bond or the agreement," I do not know to which, "but you have my direction, for I gave it you"—I said, "I have lost it"—he said, "My chambers are at No. 5, Cecil-court, St. Martin's-lane"—I said, "Do you all expect something out of this?"—Sullivan said, "I do not," and left the parlour—he was stopped in the shop by inspector Pearce—two policemen who were behind the curtain in the parlour, came out, and took the other four into custody.</p>

BODKIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">is reply, contended that as this was a charge not of obtaining, but of endeavouring, by means of threats, to obtain, it was not necessary to show whose property the security was. See Reg. v. Clark, 1 Car. &amp; Kir.</hi> 421. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">hav<lb/>ing taken until Monday to consider the point) in giving judgment, stated that the question was, whether the indictment, which charged the prisoners with making the threat in question with intent to extort from the Prosecutor a valuable security, and did not state whose property that security was, could be supported or not. The statute on which the indictment was framed was 10 &amp; 11 Vic., c. 66. s. 2, which made it an offence to accuse, or threaten to accuse, any person of the offence specified, with a view or intent to extort or gain from such person any property, money, or security. The words of the statute were exceedingly important, because one of them, viz. "extort," had a certain technical meaning which was defined in 2nd Salkeld's Reports; and when a man was charged with extorsively taking, the very import of the word showed that he was not acquiring possession of his own<lb/>tion would be found in 2 Burn's Justice; and the language showed that it was not at all necessary that the thing extorted should be stated to be the property of any person, if it was wrested from the party upon whom the extortion was effected; and if that was the case, the present indictment was sufficient. In a case referred to (Reg. v. Norton) it appeared that the property was described in the manner contended for by the prisoner's counsel; but that was an indictment under another statute, which made it necessary that the party charged under it should actually obtain the thing sought to be obtained; that was not so in the present case, because, whether anything was obtained or not, the crime was com<lb/>plete; and whether the property belonged to the person threatened, or not, was quite immaterial; the offence was committed immediately the accusation was made with the evil intent stated in the indictment.</hi>

On Sunday morning, 31st March, I was with Burge, going into a coffee-shop in Holborn, facing Gray's-inn-lane—the prisoner and a female were standing talking just inside the passage before you come to the inner door—the prisoner said to us, "Where are you coming to?"—we said we were going in to have some coffee—the prisoner said, "You are not coming here"—we said, "Why not?"—the prisoner hit Burge, and said, "That is why not"—Burge's nose <hi rend="italic">sprung out</hi> with blood, and three more from the street came upon Burge—I said to the prisoner, "That was a cowardly action;" and he rushed upon me, struck me, and threw me down—while I was down, the female who was with him struck me on the head till it bled—while I was down, the prisoner's hand was in my pocket—I had two half-crowns and a crown-piece there—I felt his hand there, and I took hold of my clothes to prevent his taking my money—he took his hand out, and I felt in the pocket, and missed a half-crown—I had had my hand in my pocket just before, feeling my money—the half-crown was found at the station—I did not carry that half-crown to the station only the one that I had still in my pocket—the policeman came up while I was bleeding—I said I had been robbed of a half-crown—the prisoner was brought forward, and I said, "That is the man,"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man. In the latter end of Feb., I assisted the prisoner in emptying some cesspools at the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich—on 28th Feb., at twelve o'clock at night, I was there, and the prisoner also—we had two carts there to take away the soil—while they were being loaded, I saw the prisoner take six pieces of timber, and put them in a cart—they had been about eleven yards from where the carts stood—there was a stack of new timber there—these pieces were new, they were the out<lb/>side cuttings of the timbers, what are called slabs—I did not notice what kind of wood it was, I was a little way from them—the pieces were thrown in amongst the soil—the prisoner said he wanted something to help to pay us men for our labour—the carts went on to Plumstead—I did not go with them—I was there the next day after they were taken, and saw six planks concealed under some straw—I was there on the Sunday following—I did not see any planks there then, they were removed—I cannot exactly say when I made any communication to the police about this—I am no scholar at all—I told the police on a Friday, but I cannot say what Friday—I went to some premises belong<lb/>ing to the prisoner, and saw the six pieces of timber there—I pointed them out to the policeman—this is one of the pieces(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some of the others were about the same size, and some not quite so big as this.</p>

In consequence of a communica<lb/>tion from Adamson, I went with him to the prisoner's premises, in Church-street, Woolwich, on 22nd March—Adamson pointed out this piece of wood, and five others, he said, "These belong to the Arsenal"—they were in a dirty state, as if they had been in a soil cart; but it has been dry weather, and a great deal has been knocked off it now—the pieces were produced at the police-court, they were a great deal worse then—I took the prisoner on this charge—he said he came to meet the case—he said that all that he had taken away, he had a right to take, they were his property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am timber-master in the carriage department, at Wool<lb/>wich. I have understood that the prisoner was employed by contract to empty the privies there—I have looked at the six pieces of timber, of which this is one—I believe this to have been the property of the Government, and in the Arsenal—when I saw it before, it was in a dirty state—the prisoner had no authority or right to take away any timber, that I am aware of; none what<lb/>ever belonging to the carriage department—I know this has been in the car<lb/>riage department—I know it by the mark of this iron on it—here is "C.D. issued," and the arrow—the timber is selected that is required, and a clerk goes down to take account of it, and then this impression is made on it—I find on this timber the trace of the marks of this instrument (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—here are two marks—this piece was outside—Government sometimes sell timber—timber is sold with this mark on it, but such timber is unserviceable—this is not unserviceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There are periodical sales of timber, and at those sales this might have been sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might have been a possibility of a piece of this kind being put in, but I would not have done it—the prisoner has been a contractor a great many years, and his father before him—I do not know whether the prisoner has bought at our sales from time to time—I have seen him there many times, I suppose for the purpose of purchasing—I never saw him buy—I do not attend the sales myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of a Custom-house agent, and live at 57, Queen's-row, Walworth. On Monday night, 1st April, about nine o'clock, or a little before, I was in the Albany-road—I had come from the Old Kent-road—I had occasion to turn down the first turning on the right for a necessary purpose, and while I was there the prisoner came up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080150"/>
               <p>to me and asked what I was going to stand—I said I was not going to stand anything—she laid hold of my right arm—I told her to leave go—she then laid hold of me round the neck with both bands—I made an effort to get away from her, but was not able to do so—two men came up at the same time, and one of them said, "Halloo, old girl, you are drunk; why don't you leave the gentleman alone?"—I thought they were going to disengage her arms from my neck, but I felt one of the men put a handkerchief or cloth round my mouth—it had a very disagreeable smell of something, I could not say what—I then suspected their intention was to rob me, and I struggled and struck some one, but I do not know who it was—I had on an oil-skin cap, and the point of it covered my eyes over so that I could not see—it was pushed down at the time, by some one's hand I suppose—the handkerchief, or cloth, covered my mouth and nostrils—after I had struggled and struck somebody I received a blow at the lower part of my stomach, and after that I do not remember anything—I became insensible—I had three sovereigns and a half in my waistcoat pocket—when I recovered myself I was lying down on the right-hand path, and my money was gone—no one was near me then—no one could have taken my money before I met the prisoner—I am quite sure I had it safe when the prisoner came up to me—I noticed her dress—she bad on a dark dress, a dark shawl, and a black bonnet—I noticed her features and her voice too—I have heard her speak since she has been in custody, and I knew her voice again as well as the face.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080151"/>
               <p>—she had on a black bonnet—I took her into custody the next night—I told her that I took her for robbing a gentleman of three sovereigns and a half in the Albany-road, with two men, on the Monday night, between eight and nine o'clock—she said she was not near the place—I said "How can you say that, when I and serjeant Quinnear saw you go through the gate between tight and nine?"—(I have known her a long time as a common prostitute, I am sure it was her)—she said it was not her, she knew nothing at all about it, she went away along with a man to a public-house drinking.</p>
