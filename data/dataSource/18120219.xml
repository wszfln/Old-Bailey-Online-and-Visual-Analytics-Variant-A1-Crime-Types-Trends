               <p>Q. Was your house broken open open - A. Yes, on the 31st of January at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it quite dark then - A. Yes, it was quite dark; we had lit the lamps about an hour. A square of glass was broken in the shop window. The Bow-street officers brought the two men into my shop. The window was broken so that I could get my three fingers in; the handkerchiefs that laid near the place were moved a little of oneside; I had seen them there about an hour before that.</p>
               <p>- NICHOLS. I am a conductor of the patrol of Bow-street. I saw Parton go to the middle of Mr. Rogers's window; he put his hand against the glass; he went to the other side of the window, and then Green, he came; I passed the window and perceived the glass was starred. I saw the two prisoners go back again to the window, it appeared to me that Green had got hold of some of the goods; I found two knives upon him. Partons fingers were cut.</p>

            . Q. You purchased a score of coals of Messrs. Davey and Sawyer - A. I did; I saw the coals in the barge the Gilbert; I was determined to watch this barge in its way to Hammersmith; I went to Milbank on the 16th of January, they were to be sent me there were two men to proceed towards Fulham with this barge; I took a boat and went up the river towards Fulham I came up to the barge that I supposed to be the Gilbert at <placeName id="t18120219-2-crimeloc11">Wandsworth</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner so as to be quite sure of him - A. I did not know him before; I was quite near enough to know his person; I am sure it was him. There were two men besides Higginson on board the barge and there was a boat lashed to the stern part; I observed the two men, one held up a sack and the other put coals in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the boat - A. Nobody then; I saw one man holding up a sack, and the other man putting coals into it; that was on board the Gilbert; Higginson was one of these men, he was steering the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coals - A. The men went and moved the boat from the stern of the barge to the side, and put the sack with the coals into the boat. They got into the boat, and rowed off, and I after them. They put their boat ashore at Wansworth; we put our boat ashore likewise and attempted to go to the boat. My son and the waterman went to the boat, we attempted to go near the boat when on shore. They pushed off, and would not let us come near them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it evident that that was done for the purpose of avoiding you - A. It was, apparently. We pursued them all the way up to Chiswick; there I lost them; they were two hearty strong young men, they rowed away in a light wherry; I lost them on the other side of Chiswick.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the coals handed over the barge into the boat was the barge on the Middlesex side or the Surry - A. The barge was on the Middlesex side when the coals were taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was not that day the dark and foggy day - A. No, it was not; I could perfectly see the men.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other barges on the river at the same time - A. Yes, there were.</p>

On the 3d of this month, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190004"/>eleven and twelve o'clock I missed the table; I had seen it about half an hour before I missed it. When I missed it I pursued the prisoner, from information I went directly up the street, and into another street, through a court in Chapel-street, I found the prisoner and the table upon him; the prisoner was carrying it, he did not go any further; I halloaed out to him, and he stopped. I apprehended him, and here he is come upon that apprehension. The table is here at the door, my name is upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you written your name upon it before it was stolen - A. No, but I know the make of the table; it is not my own making, but I had observed the make before it was stolen. I know the table well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the prisoner when he stopped - A. I asked him how he came to do it; he said that somebody had told him to take it; he made some frivolous excuse. I hardly know what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the table standing at the door - A. No, rather round a corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is in Middlesex - A. Yes, in Shoreditch parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at all before - A. I believe I have seen him somewhere about. I have lost many things, but that is neither here or there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I humbly acknowledge the crime laid to my charge, but it was distress that drove me to it. I have a wife and six poor children, and I humbly beg for mercy. My wife and children have been removed to the workhouse since my confinement.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he been an apprentice to Salkeld - A. I understood so by Mr. Salkeld.

I find there were some wages due to him.</p>

            , a lad more particularly for the warehouse, a shop-boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the note placed that you missed - A. The twenty pound note, I never missed it; it was placed in the till for the general purposes of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your money that was taken in the shop put in the till - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put it in the till - A. About the beggining of November, about the 5th, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive the twenty pound note of - A. Of Mr. John Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Who in the house had resort to that till - A. Nobody but me and Hill and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up stairs into the prisoner's room, when was that - A. Upon the 2nd of February, when the wine was missed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up to the room of the prisoner did you find in the prisoner's room the same day the wine and the note - A. Yes; in the box I found the wine and in the drawer in same room I found the note.</p>
               <p>Q. How much wine did you find - A. Four bottles of red wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note in one of the drawers in the prisoner's room - A. Yes; he had a small drawer and a large one in a secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those drawers in the prisoner's room used by the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whose drawers were they - A. His own.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found them there was the prisoner with you - A. He was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he furnish you with the key with which you found them - A. Yes, he did, at my request. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190005"/>gave me up all the keys, he had every place in the room locked; he gave me the keys of the drawers and the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before you had proceeded to open the box had the prisoner said any thing at all about the contents of the box; he said he had opened the drawers and the box to me before. When I was searching for the wine I was only searching for the bottles, but finding no bottles in the drawer, he said here is only one more box which contains the clothes of my brother, who was called to sea; they were left off clothes; as he let the things in the box down I heard something scratch. I put my hand down and pulled out a bottle, I said, if this is the wine I have missed there are some marks by which I can describe the bottle, it is marked in the bottom in the hollow of the bottle with whiting, and if they are figured and numbered you will find I have not miscounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been charged before that time by the prisoner with having miscounted - A. Yes, I had, and then I proceeded to search the figures, and I found the four bottles, marked as I had described them.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were these four bottles in the box - A. About half way in the box between the clothes. Upon that he said he was ashamed of having taken the wine, and hoped I would look over it. I told him if every thing else was right I might overlook it, and merely discharge him. At that time I had not missed my note, I was determined to make a minute search, and then I examined the drawers, and in a little drawer of the secretary I found two twenty-pound notes and sixty one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe upon one of the twenty pound notes the name of Hall upon it - A. I knew it to be his hand-writing; he is a trustee and in the habit of receiving dividends for my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember Mr. Hall paying you that twenty pound note do you - A. I do, and the reason I know it, there is a calcution at the back, I thought I should always know the note again, I found other property in cash and goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. With respect to the bottles of wine they were marked at the bottom - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a peculiar mark done in chalk after you found that your observations were alive and you found the twenty pound bank note - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not resided in the house since the month of November - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken did you ever return to it to sleep there; have not you an intention to go elsewhere - A. I had. I did not intend to go back there since in the month of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have taken a lease of it since - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Three of your servants slept in it at that time - A. Yes, three when the prisoner lived there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Had not you and yours left that house without ever intending to return to it - A. Yes, we had.</p>
               <p>Q. You had left this man in complete possession himself of your domestic concerns in that house - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what quantity of smaller money you might have in the till when you put that twenty pound note there. Do not you know upon your oath, that he was in the habit of occasionally getting change for you at Child's the banker's - A. Yes he had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What power had he to draw any sum of money and to what extent of the till - A. To the amount of ten or twenty pound, he was not restricted to any sum.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the accounts of the state of the house was necessarily kept by him - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. And on his producing accompts and vouchers to correspond with them you thought all was fair till you found otherwise - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When the wine was found what became of it - A. It was sent to the Bow-street officer to the other house in Pickett-street, and he left it upon the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it again in Picket-street where the marks altered - A. They were taken off entirely of three, except in the holes of the bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. And the notes had a mark upon it by which you know it to have been received from Mr. Hall - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Here is from the beginning of November to the 1st of February you never saw this note at all - A. I did not; I was not in the habit of keeping the accompts myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not he have changed a large note for smaller notes since the 14th of November - A. In case of the delapidated state of our house our trade is very much reduced therefore since that time there has been a great quanty of small notes in order for change in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habits of lending twenty pounds - A. Very seldom; such a circumstance might occur.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems very odd that you should leave twenty pounds in the till - A. Because persons might pawn for larger sums, and so it might be useful for change.</p>

On Monday the 3d of February, I lost the watch between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop to look at some gold watches for his brother in Scotland he said; I shewed him several, and he fixed upon one for twenty-five guineas, a gold seal at two guineas, and a gold chain at four guineas and a half, and desired me to have them ready, and he would call the next day and take them with him; he left the shop, and within five minutes after we missed a gold watch, value seventeen pounds, suspicion immediately attached to the prisoner, and no man had been the shop from the time he left it to the time the watch was missed; I sent two of my young men after him to endeavour to bring him back, but without success. On Tuesday, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came again to my shop, saying, he could not receive his pay till the latter end of the month, when he would come and take the watch, I expressed some disappointment, and kept him in talk till one of my young men came in; I then took him in the passage behind the shop, and told him what my suspicions were, he denied having it, I told him I must be further satisfied that he had not taken it, he said he was going further, and he would call in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I told him that I could not suffer him to go without first being satisfied that the watch was not stolen, he went to the door of the shop, wishing to leave, I told him I could not let him go, and he walked a part of the way to the Minories, saying he had an appointment in East Smithfield, at five minutes after three. I took him into my uncle's house, and into their back room I left him while I went for a constable. The constable and myself, and one of my young men, went with him to his lodgings at St. Mary's Hill, Tower-street, where the constable said he must then search him; proceeding to do so, he let his handkerchief and his gloves fall out of his pocket, and laid them upon the table. The constable went immediately to take hold of the hankerchief and gloves, but he took hold of them himself, and put his hands behind him. While the constable proceeded to search his person, I told the constable he did not search the glove in the gentlemen's other hand, the constable went to take it, whereupon the prisoner tendered a watch to me, and said, there is your watch Mr. Wortner. It was the watch which I had missed, and which I can swear to.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday the 4th of March I was sent for by Mr. Wortner, it was Mr. Wortner's wish for me to go to his lodgings immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you examine first. - A. Because it was Mr. Wortner's wish for me to go to his lodgings. As I was searching him, Mr. Wortner noticed his hand, and said he had got something in his hand, and he presented the watch to Mr. Wortner and said, Mr. Wortner, here is your watch, he produced the gold watch, and begged pardon, and hoped that he would forgive him, at the same time I pulled out a gold seal that Mr. Wortner never missed. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch that I missed. He bought a watch of me some years ago, and he has been in the habit of coming to the shop for nineteen years. He is a lieutenant in the navy. He has left it about six month ago, as I understand, it is not the first thing that we have lost.</p>

After that Happy came and spoke to me in Skinner Street, he came to me again the second time and spoke to me, a little girl went out and Nias went after her just in Skinner-street, and just in Skinner-street, Nias gave a woman a piece of bacon, I ran after him and stopped him, I asked him what he was doing there, he got away from me, I lost him, and I apprehended him again on the Monday morning between the hours of ten and eleven in Swan-street, Shoreditch; I told him I took him upon suspicion of stealing some bacon, when I brought him to the Mansion-house, I told Mr. Sapwell that I had got a person that was along with Happy, and Mr. Cooper came out and said, he was one of the men that was concerned in this transaction.</p>

            . I am a butcher in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Westbrooke. - A. No further than seeing him with the sheep upon his back upon the 28th of January, he was running up Rose-street, with the carcase of mutton upon his shoulder, about twenty minutes past nine, I followed him through the market and Ivy-lane, he crossed Newgate-street, he went down Butcher-hall-lane, I stopped him at the corner of St. Ann's-Lane, I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said, a lad had given it him to carry, and he was going to follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lad. - A. No, he said, take the carcase do not take me; I told him he should take it back from where he took it: I met an officer in Butcher-hall-lane, I then gave charge of him; it was claimed by a young man in the employ of Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from Mr. Smith's shop when you first saw him with this carcase. - A. Mr. Smith's shop is in Cloth-fair, but he had taken it out of a truck in <placeName id="t18120219-11-crimeloc66">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was twenty minutes past nine. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man was publicly travelling with this sheep all through Newgate market. - A. Yes, he was, to Ivy-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went through a great part of the market. - A. He turned round by Mr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>Q. The sheep we know, eight stone is a considerable weight for a man. - A. We think it nothing in our business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Smith's house. - A. In cloth fair, but his cart was in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him how he came by the sheep, he said a lad had given it him to carry: was he employed as a porter to carry sheep. - A No, I have seen him lurking about the carts and waggons when I watched him before.</p>

            , my master purchased four carcases, they were in Newgate market, I was left with my fellow servant to get them in the truck, we got two of them in, and went to fetch the other two and missed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how long do you think you were gone. - A. I might be gone five minutes, and I sent my fellow servant in search of my master, to know if he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you saw the prisoner in custody. - A. It might be ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, I knew nothing of him before.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the carcase you saw, the same carcase as was in your master's truck. - A. Exactly, I have every reason to think so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go in consequence of the direction that is upon the back of that card. - A. I waited upon the prisoner at ten o'clock the next morning, I took a general assortment of what my wife was in the habit of working and selling. I selected the articles on the morning I went, I put them into a paper box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many articles you took. - A. I suppose from the quantity in the box, there must be about an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived at the house were you shewn into it. - A. Yes, into a parlour on the right hand side, without a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came to the door. - A. Mrs. Nissen. I began to open the box, she said she was very glad I had come in time, I shewed the articles, and she began admiring them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who had recommended you to her. - A. Not at that time; she selected what she thought was beautiful, she wished to take them to her mother, she informed me, and her sister; I opened more articles to her in the box, and she wished to shew them to her mother, she took a second quantity to shew her mother, she staid about the same time as she did the first, and returned; on her returning the second time, instead of coming to shew me the articles, to check, as she did the first, she came hasitly into the room, not coming to me to check the articles as she did the first time, but gathered all the articles with both her hands, that were laying on the table, or nearly the whole of the articles with both her hands, saying, Sir, we'll go into a room where there is a fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go immediately with her. - A. I remained to pack up what was on the table that I wished to put into the box again, she did not gather all. On my going into the room where she was, she seemed very much confused, and was shutting the drawers, she was throwing the articles about and shutting the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean throwing the articles about - A. The articles were laying about in a rough state on the table, and she was shutting the drawers; when I went into the room I felt considerably from such conduct, I said, Mrs. Nissen the articles ought not to be throwed about that way, they ought not to be pressed or soiled, they are not so saleable; she said, oh, they are not injured, and she began to select more of the stock than she had selected, she went through the whole that I had in the box, she examined the whole that I had in the box, and selected what she thought would suit her, to the amount of three guineas, and she paid me for it, saying that she should be a very good customer, and begged I would put the lowest price. I did. In noticing what she had taken, I noticed that I had another ruff similar to what I had sold her, in looking for it I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the ruff that you have charged in this indictment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ruff that you could not find, took by you in the box, when you came from home. - A. It was</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it after you arrived at Mrs. Nissen's house. - A. Yes, I had, I am positive of that. At this time I had nearly put the whole of the things in the box again, of the quantity of the things in the box, I thought it was not as full as it ought to be. I know I missed some children's bodies of frocks, and I afterwards missed a cap and two tippets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about it. - A. Nothing further than the ruff, I told her the fellow ruff to the one I had sold her, in looking for it, I could not find it, she called her sister to go into the other room to look for it, she came back, and said it was not there, I looked again through the quantity of goods I had, and could not find it, I thought it very extraordinary, I said to Mr. Nissen I was surprised, she had my card, she said she could not recollect the person's name that had given her the card. The prisoner told me that she was in the same line of business I was, and that she employed thirty hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You went home, and then, by your attorney's advice, you applied to Hatton Garden office. - A. I did, between two and three o'clock the same day, the 25th of January, I went with the officer and the warrant to the house, when I had got there Mrs. Nissen had left home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the articles that you supposed you had lost. - A. Not one, I searched the major part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search for them as long as you pleased. - A. The officers searched as much as they thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the articles that she had paid for. - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the whole worth of the things that you lost. - A. Three pound twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. I asked you, Sir, whether within this last month you could venture to name any person, your answer was this, I have done business for my Lord Warwick for that time. - A. On account of the Earl of Warwick, Mr. Bethbridge employed me.</p>
               <p>Q. For whom did you do any thing in this accompting way before. - A. Messrs. Coombes and Bailey a considerable time.</p>

            . Q. What are you sir. - A. I am an attorney. I live in Bedford Row.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended the examination at Hatton Garden. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did not that man just gone down, say that his wife packed up the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Was what Arundel said taken down by the magistrate, any thing. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. King, I ask you whether the prosecutor did not say to the magistrate when he was upon his oath, that his wife packed up the box the night before he took it. - A. So he positively swore, and repeated it again and again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did you yourself make any memorandum of it. - A. I have a perfect recollection of it. I made a memorandum of it in my instructions, it formed a part of my instructions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was this said in the course of the examination; you attended, did not you. - A. I did, on the examination; when he was giving evidence before the magistrate, he stated that his wife packed it up, assisted, and was present.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bolland. You have given first, the account that his wife packed it up, assisted, and was present. Now which of these statements did he make. - A. I am not certain, he either said that his wife assisted him or was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now I will call another witness.</p>
               <p>MR. LUKIN. Q. What did you hear the prosecutor say on the packing up the night before. - A. His words were, that his wife assisted him on the night before in packing up the box. I have no doubt of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it more than once. - A. I rather think he did. I have no doubt that he said his wife assisted him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You do not remember the precise words. - A. I remember the words, he said his wife assisted him. I believe it was in answer to a question asked by Mr. Alley, he said that his wife assisted him. I recollected it in drawing out the brief a few days ago.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, It is for you to say whether you will believe a witness like the prosecutor, who has been so materially contradicted by two respectable persons; if you think it necessary to call any other witness, I will go into it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The jury do not think it necessary to go into any other evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to Prosecutor) Did you ever prosecute before this. - A. Not for any thing stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever prosecute before this for any thing that was not stolen, how odd things come out. Did not you apply to the magistrate to have your wife and mother taken up. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190013"/>Mr. Bolland. Did you charge your wife and mother with having robbed you. - A. I mentioned it to the officers, my wife had been from home and had taken out a few memorandums.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you and your wife were not upon very good terms. - A. At that time we were not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been asked who employed you as an accomptant, when you originally came to town you lived with Messrs. Hankey, he failed. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you had to seek for another situation as an accomptant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bothbridge employed you to settle that accompt. - A. He did. Lord Warwick was the ostensible person.</p>
               <p>Q. You learned on Wednesday at Hatton Garden that Miss Goodwin had recommended you to Mrs. Nissen, had you delivered any cards to Mrs. Nissen. - A. Perhaps Mrs. Arundel had.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel.</p>

I have been in town I suppose about a twelvemonth, I obtained my situation at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190016"/>Post-office about ten or eleven months ago, during that time I have had very severe fits of illness, which the inspectors know to be true; I certainly have been very much distressed, and to add to my misery, I was threatened with an arrest on the part of my physician, and the consequences I knew if I was arrested I must lose my situation; I am willing now to make restitution to the best in my power, for property that has been purloined in that way; upon these considerations I hope you will take my case into consideration, and spare my life if it is possible. I throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house robbed - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Among other things was there a shawl lost - A. Yes, from Mrs. Harlows dressing-room.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means did it appear that the robbery had been affected - A. From various circumstances, it appeared that the thief found his way into the house the preceeding evening, and secreted themselves in one of the bed chambers, and when the family were asleep they stole the property.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the house had not been broken open - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But you found that some person must have been within - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of last month did any thing occur to you - A. On the evening of the 21st of January in consequence of what my butler told me, between seven and eight o'clock I searched the house, I found one of my rooms in the house fastened on the inside, a key which had been on the outside before was within, I addressed myself to the prisoner, supposing her to be on the inside, I had the door broken open, and found her in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then charge her with being the person who had robbed your house before, in the first place, did you promise her any favour, or threaten her if she did not confess - A. I did not, I was very anxious to know because, I did not know whom to suspect. I asked her whether that was the first time she came there with that intent, she said no, it was not the first time that she came there with that intent. I asked her whether it was her that robbed the house in November, she said it was, she told me that some of the things were at Chelsea. I accompanied Vickrey the officer to her lodgings, she took us to her lodgings, the woman of the house in which she lodged was there, and by her desire took us into a room, and there she produced articles.</p>

               <p>Tudor. It was not. It was about half past five as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false. I have a witness to prove where I was after I left this man.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Hungerford-street, in the Strand. I have known the prisoner five years, I never heard any thing against him in my life; he is a mattrass-maker and upholsterer; he brought his linen to my place to wash between five and six o'clock. It was between light and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a large bundle - A. No, it was nothing but a shirt, waistcoat, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live at that time - A. In King-street, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at that woman's house all the rest of the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Anderson's name is David - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 1st of November were you at home - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband possessed of a watch that day - A. I was myself. It was a silver watch, it hanged up in the room on the 1st of November, I had seen it in the room that very morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was it on the 1st of November - A. In a tea-chest in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of the day on the 1st of November had you seen the tea-chest - A. I had it in my hand at five in the afternoon, and at that time it contained, a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your room - A. The prisoner came into my room, she altered her voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in the house - A. She had been a few nights in the house. I lodged in the back parlour; the prisoner was an acquaintance of the person that had the back parlour, and I lodged in that room likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come in the back parlour - A. About five in the afternoon I had the tea-chest in my hand, I was going to unlock it, she brought an apron in her hand, and pressed me very much to pawn some property for her to pay her lodging that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn her apron - A. She pressed me very much and I wished her to be gone out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to take her apron to pawn for her - A. Yes, I did, I left the room and left her in it; she said she would not go out of the room for two hours; I said I should not be gone above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live - A. The house is in Coventry-court, in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. What pawnbroker did you go to - A. Mr. Hill in Rathbone-place, I pawned for her two aprons for nine-pence; I was not ten minutes gone. When I returned the prisoner was gone, and my tea-chest was gone; when I looked for it my tea-chest and the watch in it was gone; I never saw the prisoner again until the 14th of January; this was on the 1st of Nover; I was in search of her all the time. When I saw her she had been taken up for something else. I saw her in custody in Bow-street, then I made a charge before the justice. I gave half a guinea for the tea-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for your watch - A. Seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch worth five pounds - A. Yes, I had it above two or three years, and there were ten guineas in gold in the tea-chest and the other articles. I have never seen the tea-chest, the guineas, or the watch since; I lost all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of the woman - A. I am quite sure; I had known her a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose shoes - A. They were not my shoes. The shoes were hanging out of Mr. Colcock's shop, a shoemaker's shop. On Friday the 7th of February, at half past four o'clock, I saw them at the door, I said to the young man that was along with me, I think that woman is after no good, and I watched her; I saw the woman take the shoes, the moment she took the shoes, she put them under her coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What, they were hanging on the outside, were they - A. Yes. I went after her and took her into the shop of Mr. Colcock, I took the shoes from her, and gave them to Mr. Colcock; I left the woman and the shoes there, and came away. I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

When he went out in the night I followed him, he had this bag upon his shoulder; he had gone about fifty yards from the dwelling-house before I overtook him; I told him to come back. In searching the bag I found these eight cakes of soap.</p>

On the 23d of January the prisoner came into the coffee-room, and ordered tea; he paid for his tea, he ran away with the spoon and the sugar-tongs; I had seen the tea-spoon about two minutes before he left the room. I pursued him, and took him with the spoon and tongs upon him, these are the things, they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service - A. She was, four weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the property you lost in court - A. It is. I missed it on the 26th of January, it was taken from a drawer in the bed-room; the drawer was locked; I kept the key myself. The first thing I missed was my little girl's knife and fork; I asked her for it, she told me it was on the side board in the drawing-room; I looked, and told her it was not there. I insisted upon it being found. She then said, ma'am, I have taken it out and put it among some dirty clothes, if you had looked there you would have seen it. I saw the duster, but never thought of looking there for the knife and fork. She brought the knife and forward to me. I missed the caps on the Sunday; she said the had never seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray whereabouts did you find the things - A. At the pawnbrokers, they are here.</p>
               <p>- HONSEY. I am a pawnbroker. I produce some children's things, two frocks, a petticoat, three caps, four napkins, a pinafore, a shift, and a towel. I advanced twelve shillings upon them I believe the prisoner to be the person that pawned them; I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Robinson. Did you find any duplicates upon the prisoner - A. No.</p>

I lost it on Thursday last, I was down stairs in the kitchen, my wife came to the area, and told me a man had stolen a roll of oil cloth, and he had taken up Piccadilly; I immediately pursued the prisoner; I looked up Titchbourne-street, I saw him crossing from the right to the left, with the roll of oil-cloth on his shoulder; I immediately ran up the street, I saw the prisoner turn into Gibson's court, as soon as he heard my footsteps behind him, he threw the oil-cloth off his shoulder, and ran into Castle-street; I followed him, and just as I had got up to him an officer was coming up the court, and at the same time he run into the Constable's Arms. This is the oil cloth, it is my property, I am positive of it.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Peasegood. On the 10th of January, about one o'clock, Francis and Rochester came into my master's shop, and inquired the price of beef, and said it was for the ship, the ship was laying at Deptford, Captain Scolly, they agreed for the price, and said, they would come bye and bye, when the boat was up, which they did. They returned about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Salt come with them - A. No, Francis came alone, between four and five o'clock, he ordered me to weigh a quarter of beef, and take it down to the boat, the price was agreed for three guineas a hundred, I weighed it, and took it down to the boat at Execution Dock, it was two hundred weight, I delivered it to a black man in the boat, I never saw the beef again, nor the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Salt I suppose - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now whether Salt was concerned in this you do not know. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this beef to be paid for - A. It was not agreed, they gave their address, Scott and Palmer, 51, Great Hermitage-street. I parted with the beef, expecting to be paid for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect going to Mrs. Carver's house - A. Yes, on the 5th of December I went to Randall's shop at the Royal Exchange, I enquired if she sold Dr. Jebb's anti-billious pills, she said she did; I asked for a box, seeing where she took it from, I put my hand into the shop, and took two others, I asked her whether she had any more of the same sort, and assisted her in searching, she assured me she had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Mrs. Carver search for more - A. We did, both of us, but I did not find any more; I told her it was of consequence, and in my presence she marked the box as that we found. These are the three boxes that I received; I desired her to mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you thought proper to search the prisoner's house - A. Yes, that was on the 6th of December. I took an officer and went to the house, the prisoner was not at home; I saw Mrs. Collicott, and Miss King, I asked her if the prisoner was not at home, and I asked her if she sold these boxes of pills, she said she did; I assisted the officer in searching the house; I asked for a light, Miss King went down for a light, at the time that she left the room for a light, she had an apron on her, she staid about five minutes, and returned without a light, and without her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any thing produced in an apron - A. I accompanied Vickrey in the search, he left me about a second, he produced an apron, containing some stamps; I searched again on the 10th of December, I accompanied Vickrey and went into the back warehouse; I knew the circumstance of Jones of Bristol; I searched, and in the shop I found a quantity of pieces of paper with Jones, Bristol, upon it, I picked up a great many, and Vickrey picked up a great many.</p>

               <p>MISS KING. Q. Are these the kind of stamps that were in the house when Mr. Collicott was at home - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you assisted in putting them on - A. Yes, by Mr. Collicott's directions, he directed me to cut out the words Jones, Bristol, and to paste them on the bottle, and the vacant part to be filled up either by sealing wax or wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one found in your apron the same as Mr. Collicott directed you to do them - A. Yes, the vacant part is filled up with a seal, if it was a box instead of a bottle, it was filled up by pasting a label over it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came back to the prisoner's house on the 21st of October did you see these kind of stamps - A. It might be a day or two, but it did not exceed that.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was your attention called to them - A. By Mr. Collicott, he told me that he intended to make use of them in future, to the best of my recollection those are the words he used then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut them out of these small sheets for use - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you assist in pasting the stamps upon them. - A. I did, by Mr. Collicott's directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in that instance, as in others, cut out the centre, Jones, Bristol - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The genuine ones have a crown and a ring round it, with the duty - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Linley.) Have you the book of stamps here - A. I have the specimens taken from the books; these are part of the book of specimens.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a sheet of genuine stamps - A. It is. These are the stamps approved by the commissioners; and these are the first impressions made, which are reserved in our office as documents.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, look at these sheets, except in the centre part, Jones, Bristol, is that an imitation of the genuine stamp - A. It is a good resemblance.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were to see the whole of the words, Jones, Bristol, in the centre, instead of a crown, you would not take it for a genuine stamp - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If the centre is cut out, or a seal upon it - A. Then I should take it myself, when I compare them together, there is so little difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three, where there are labels, in the state in which they are do they appear to you to be imitations of the genuine stamp - A. A very good resemblance, it is such a resemblance as would impose upon any common purchaser, it might impose upon me, but on my examining these boxes, they have not the genuine stamps upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had not have been called upon to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190030"/>have examined them, if you had gone to have bought a box, you would have bought them - A. Yes, I should have bought them without a scruple.</p>
               <p>Q. Those parts that are exposed to the eye, would impose upon any ordinary observer - A. Yes, it would pass any where.</p>

I searched a room on the two pair of stairs, I found two pieces and a half of flannel more.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the prisoner's house - A. In Goodman's yard. The prisoner said, some man or men brought the flannel there.</p>

On the 7th of February, between three and four o'clock, I was awoke by my dog, in a yard that adjoins my premises, I got up and dressed myself, I saw a light going the road from Stamford-hill, I came to the front of the house, and called out watch; the person said it was not the watch, he said his name was Soul; I told him to stop at the back gate until I came down, I wanted his light; I let him in, and searched the premise, I brought a musquet with me; my fowls were placed at the back part of the coach house. When I got to the coach-house door, I found the padlock off, and the door pulled too by the string; I opened the door, and found the prisoner standing towards the front of the coach-house, and by the side of him was a bag, it was filled with fowls and ducks; we took him in custody; he made no resistance; I told him to stand still, I searched him. I brought him to the front of the house, the watchmen were there; I delivered him into the custody of the watchmen. We then examined the bag, there was, I believe, eight fowls and three ducks in the bag, and he had four fowls in his blue apron; the officer took them out; all their necks were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose fowls were these - A. Mine, I examined them all; I sould swear to them all.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop about a quarter of a mile from Chelsea. The prisoner came to my house on the 18th of January, at half past seven o'clock in the evening, he asked me if my husband was within; I told him he was not; he went out, and returned again in about five minutes; he asked me if he should leave the bundle; I looked at him, and said, yes, if he liked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the time - A. I never saw him to my knowledge in my life; he left me the bundle; he asked me if I would lend him a pound on it, I innocently let him ten shillings in halfpence, and ten shillings in silver, and he went away, and then on the Monday following he sent for four shillings more, I refused him. The officer came afterwards and claimed the bundle; Townshend and Perry came and claimed the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that came to you - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did it sell for - A. Twenty-eight pound eleven shillings and six-pence; Kitchener and Drouet said, as Hookey had not so much trouble as we had, there should be a pound a piece, four pound, taken out of the whole, that was to be given to a butcher coming to own the beast.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with the rest of the money - A. We went up to the Bull's head in the Layer; we all five met there, the money was divided; I had between five and six pounds for my share, Kitchener had the same, Drouet had more because he demanded a crown a piece off each man, he having come to own the beast; he took it of us three.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had Wheeler - A. Four pounds. Wheeler was one of the party, he took the beef to Leadenhall. All five of us went to Leadenhall, Mr. Terry was the salesman; the fat of the heifer Settree and me took it to Mr. French's, Barbican. When I was taken up I told the story equally the same as I have now.</p>

On the 6th of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to go up stairs to give some instructions to my cutter. When I came down then I discovered the prisoner coming out of my warehouse upon the first floor, she was making towards the second floor up stairs; I followed her, accusing her that she had robbed me. When she had got half way up she dropped a pair of blue cloth pantaloons; I picked them up and accused her with robbing me; she said she had only taken them to put some buttons upon them. On my looking at the pantaloons I discovered that there were no buttons off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190039"/>and I stated that as such she could not have taken for that purpose, but for no other purpose than taking them away. I immediately searched her, and caused her to go to the apartment that she occupied; the rooms that I appropriated for the work people to have rent free, for the sake of protecting my property, a kitchen, and a little room adjoining. I then ordered one of my servants to go up and tell her husband to come down, who was in my employ at that time; he came down, I told him of the circumstance, we went together into her apartment; I stated, before her, I had missed a number of other things, and as she had taken them pantaloons, I conceived that she had taken many others; and told her if she would give up the property, and tell me where it was, I would not prosecute her, or send for an officer, on account of her family. She stated, that she had never robbed me of anything else, and as such she could not give up any thing else. I went up in the shop and consulted with my brother; Wane came up in the shop, and told me that he could not get her to acknowledge to any thing, I then sent for an officer; he came, and I went with the officer into her apartment; he searched her, and while he was searching, she dropped a duplicate on the ground; I picked it up, and discovered it was a coat, pledged for one pound, at Mr. Fleming's in Whitechapel; she was then taken to the counter, and returning to search the apartment that she occupied, they discovered a new cloth great coat, a cloth pellisse, a pair of cloth pantaloon-trowsers, and a pair of cloth breeches; all these things were found there. In the evening I went to Mr. Fleming's, the pawnbroker, he sent up the coat, and looking over his books he discovered another coat. I found another coat there my property.</p>

Crane, in the jockey cart, covered them over with an empty sack; then the young man in the jockey cart went up Goswell-street Road, I went to Camden Town, there I saw the cart that took the corn away, there where black and white oats at the bottom of the cart. I am quite sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave the prisoner up - A. He had no business there at all, I had paid him his wages that night. I was disturbed about half-past three in the morning, I felt him get the breeches from under my head. I heard him unbolt the window on the justice, I pursued him and in the manger with my watch, ten shillings and six-pence, a three shilling piece, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190040"/>an eighteen-penny piece; he was searched, a bunch of keys and two razors were found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in your room - A. No. I put them under my pillow; before I put my breeches under my pillow; there was a carpet tacked up at the window instead of a sash, and that is the way he got in the room.</p>
               <p>- TURNER. I am a coachman; I was called up by Mr. Payne on the 15th of February, he called out watch, I went to the door, he said some person was in the stable. I went into the stable, I saw the prisoner by the manger, I picked up the watch, the money, and the handkerchief. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Between seven an eight o'clock my master paid me my wages; I owed a person three shillings, I went that night and paid him; I stopped till I got tipsey. I thought it my best way to go back to the stables, I laid in the hay-loft and went to sleep. I thought I felt somebody feeling about me, I got up and went down into the stable, and then somebody went through the door, and I not being sober I laid myself down in the stable until the alarm was. My master came down in his shirt, and a sword in his hand; he asked me what brought me there; I told him I would do him no injury, nor any one else; they searched me and found nothing; in the stable that I was sleeping in they found the watch, the money, and the two handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I purchased this cannon of a man of the name of Longrove, I have kept it ever since. I exposed it publicly in my shop for some months.</p>
               <p>- LONGROVE. Q. Where did you get this cannon - A. I was at the sign of the White Hart, Old Brompton, the prisoner was in there, he said I bought a cannon last night, it was to have been raffled for; it was put up for twelve shillings, and the person that put it up offered to sell it for nine shillings, not getting members enough he sold it to the prisoner for six shillings and a pint of beer, he said it was of no use to him, and that if any person in the tap-room would give him a shilling profit he would sell it for seven shillings and a pot of beer, they should have it. There were nine or ten people in the tap-room; it was handed about to me; I bought it, I gave seven shillings, and a pot of beer for it; I took it home that night and cleaned it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. About a twelvemonth ago. I sold it to Mr. Wilson; my son let it off in my absence, I sold it because he should do no hurt with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say when he bought it - A. He said he bought it at the Bell and Crown in Holborn a day or two before I bought it; I never heard any thing about it till the 7th of October last; I went into Mr. Wilson's shop to buy powder and shot. I told him exactly what I have told you, I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18120219-85-person766">Wilson</persName>
             I would produce the prisoner; I went to the prisoner, he said he was very willing to come forward, and he and I went the next morning to Mr. Wilson, he advised the prisoner to go down to Captain Lawson; the prisoner did; Captain Lawson was at Woolwich; I went to the Bell and Crown the people that occupied the house at the time it was to be raffled for, they were gone and left the house. I went into the country, Mr. Wilson wrote to me that I must return the one pound fifteen shillings. I have known the prisoner sixteen years, he is a very hard working man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The cannon is mine, it is the cannon that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This cannon was put up at the Bell and Crown Holborn to be raffled for, he offered it for nine shillings, I bought it for six shillings and a pot of beer. I brought it down to Old Brompton, I kept it in my possession four days; I offered it at the White Hart Tavern for sale; I told them there if any person would give a shilling advance they should have it, it was of no use to me; Longrove purchased it of me. He took it home that night. I heard nothing more of the cannon until it was owned by captain Lawson. I went to Mr. Wilson and asked him for captain Lawson's address; he gave it me. I went to captain Lawson. I have taken a great deal of pains to find out the man I bought it off. Captain Lawson came three times to me at Old Brompton, he said if I did not come forward and pay five pounds he would seek a recompence; he said the last time if I would come forward and pay the five pounds he would do away with the business.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This assertion is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I went with him; he got upon the box with me; he said I was to take up in Fenchurch-street; he said he had got a better situation than he had; he took me to the corner of <placeName id="t18120219-86-crimeloc506">Church-row, Fenchurch-street</placeName>

I went to the lady and there was no man had gone for a coach; I never saw him after till he was in custody at Bond-street watchhouse a month afterwards. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I was passing along Sun-street on the 27th of January about three o'clock I observed the prisoner with another suspicious character near Mr. Smith's door, the person that was with the prisoner snatched something when he came to the prisoner he gave it him, which the prisoner put under his jacket. I proceeded for about sixty yards, when I saw an opportunity I turned round and looked at the prisoner and the other man, they separated; I immediately crossed the street and seized the prisoner with the property in his possession, and with assistance I took the prisoner to Mr. Smith's house, where the stockings were stolen from. When I seized the prisoner he threw the stockings down, the person that assisted me picked them up.</p>

On the 23d of January about half after nine at night, I was setting in the backroom eating my supper, I heard something give a great alarm in the shop, I saw the back of a woman, I followed her; I thought she had something by her walking, as if she was heavy loaded; I followed her about ten yards from my shop; I asked her what she had; she had taken the whole fore-quarter of a sheep in her lap. I laid hold of her arm, she dropped it down, and laid herself down as if she was drunk. I took her to the watchhouse and gave her in charge of the officer of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did she take it from - A. A good way in the shop near to the door of the back room.</p>

            . On Monday, the 3d of February, between five and six in the evening, the two prisoners came into the shop and asked me to shew them some printed cotton; I shewed them some, and they bought some, Fowler paid for it; and shortly after I observed her draw a piece of print out with one hand, and the prisoner Morris received it under her apron. Soon after that they were leaving the shop, I immediately got over the counter and laid hold of her apron, and asked her how she came by that print. She told me she could not tell, she knew nothing at all about it. I sent for a constable and gave her in charge.</p>

I told him he should not have done that; he said my account was rather low, there is the entry there; he said he had entered two hundred pounds, I told him I wished he had not done that. I told him he must not enter monies to my account; he brought a stamp with him, and asked me to draw a bill of two months for the two hundred pound, which I did,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing further take place then - A. Nothing further; I do not think I saw him again until the 9th or 10th of January, he called upon me to give me the two hundred pound bill, he brought a stamp, and desired me to write a bill for one hundred more; he gave up the two hundred pound; bill, and I destroyed it - tore it to peices. These are the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. That check and that bill that you have in your hand now, was the check and bill that you drew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them to him - A. I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of its being made payable to Mr. Plomer - A. At his request.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of January, did you say he called upon you - A. Yes; the 9th or 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. I see, Sir, that check is dated the 9th of January, was there any reason for that - A. Yes, he desired me to date the check the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid that sum of two hundred pounds to your banker - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorize the prisoner at the bar to pay it - A. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Laws. You had cash at this house - A. Yes. I remember the prisoner a great many years at this house before I went to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you settle your accompt - A. Never, until my accompt came regular from the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. The impression of your mind was, at that time, your accompt was good with them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it, to see how it stood - A. Not exactly; I conceived that I had over-drawed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not have over-drawed upon them, not with the idea of over-drawing upon them - A. Not to my knowledge, I would not.</p>
               <p>(The bills read)</p>
               <p>MR. GATTY. You are a clerk in the house of Birch and Chambers, and have been so some time - A. Yes; and the prisoner has also been for many years past a <rs id="t18120219-92-deflabel546" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. When cash is paid into your house it will first come into the waste book; the waste book is the foundation of all other enteries. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the waste book, into what book will it next find its way - A. Into the cash book, and from the cash book into the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in the regular course of the business, no entry can find its way into the ledger that has not been in the cash book - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the ledger - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ledgers are there - A. There are four at this time, at that time there were three.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sometimes assist you by posting into the ledger - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that asked or unasked - A. Occasionally unasked when I was absent, when I came from my dinner I found him at the ledger; he then chused the last ledger, containing Mr. Vale's accompt. I remarked to him that it was rather singular that he should assist me in that one ledger particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. The clerk who holds the cash book calls, and the clerk with the ledger ticks it off - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that entry in the ledger ticked off - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When an entry is ticked off, what does that tick denote - A. It denotes that it has been called from the cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore after turning over the ledger in the morning, and it is ticked, you do not tick it again - A. No, we conclude it to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if a person had put it in the ledger the day before, and had ticked, it would not be ticked the next day - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your comparison of all your ledgers only takes place anually - A. Only annually.</p>
               <p>Q. Inasmuch as the clerk who holds the cash calls if there is no entry in the cash book, he could not call it - A. Surely not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your comparison of all your ledgers takes place at Christmas - A. At Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. If false entries takes place in the ledger it can only be found out at the ending of the ballance - A. Only at the end of the balance.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your balance last Christmass did you find there was something wrong - A, A considerable deficiency, it exceeded two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that did your house take a new set of ledgers - A. A new set of ledgers were taken, not in consequence of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You proceeded then to see how this could arise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, look in the waste book of the 10th of January, and shew how Mr. Vale's draft was paid; the 11th of January, it is my mistake - A. The 11th of January

            . I searched the prisoner, I found three ten-pound notes upon him, this fifty pound note No. 10,790, November 16, 1811, and another fifty pound; I have had the notes ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards learn from the prisoner whether he had put any other money into any one's hands - A. Certainly into Barratt's hands, one of one hundred pounds. I brought the prisoner up to London in a post chaise. Before I went from Barrett's house I gave him a caution not to say any thing. We used no promises or threats. After we had left Hithe we had some conversation respecting Mr. Gatty; he observed that had Gatty looked at him he might have discovered who it was that had done the deed. The prisoner in justice declared that Mr. Bolton had nothing to do with the transaction.</p>

            . I am the head of the bank note office.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the practice of issuing bank notes at the bank - A. We never issue two genuine bank notes of the same number and date.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, Q. to Mr. Gatty. Did you take an accompt of the balance of Mr. Vale on the 19th of December - A. I did. I handed the paper of which I took the accompt; fifty-three pounds four shillings and seven-pence; 20th of December, one hundred and thirty-five pound and a fraction; on the 21st two hundred and seven pounds; on the 9th of January one hundred and twenty-one pounds; at one time the real balance was against Mr. Vale, upon the 2nd of January the balance was against him fourteen pounds fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have investigated Mr. Vale's accompt - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the real state of Mr. Vale's accompt on the 11th of January last. Do you find any other entries to his credit, for which there is no voucher whatever, particularly to the extent of eighteen hundred pounds, sixteen hundred pounds, besides the three hundred, whose entries are these - A. Upon the 11th of November an entry of cash two hundred and thirty pounds made by the prisoner for which there is no entery made by Vale, it is in the hand-writing of the prisoner, this is ticked, as if there was an entry to compare with it in the waste-book. There is no such entry in the waste-book. Upon the 2d of October there is two hundred pounds, entered by the prisoner, a man, to Vale's credit, marked likewise; there is no credit for that in the waste-book or cash-book. June 28th a similar sum to Vale's credit, two hundred pounds, for which there is no credit in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of the prisoner's business to pay checks when brought in by customers - A. It was not a part of his business, but he might do it for other clerks that were absent or employed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his regular business - A. The cash-book, which is copied from the waste-book.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Vale. You have heard the clerk state several sums of money to your credit, had you or not any other person that paid this money in for you - A. Not in these instances, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 11th of November there is a credit given to you of two hundred and thirty pounds, look at your banker's book do you remember the prisoner coming to you in November - A. I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the entry on the 11th of November two hundred and thirty pounds, was that paid in by you - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner about that time - A. He called about that two hundred and thirty pounds, and said I have placed cash, mentioning this sum, to my accompt and asked me for a draft for the money back, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that occur in several instances - A. Much in the same way.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 23.</p>

I told him to get out of the way, and with another shove drove him into the room; the passage is about six feet square; there were two women sitting in the parlour at a table, and I then endeavoured to shut the street door on purpose to secure the party that I suspected were in there, there being something under the door; I could not do it; Nathan turned round and halloaed out some expression in Dutch, which I did not know the English of; I immediately heard a violent bustle over my head. I took a light from the table and made towards the foot of the stairs; I saw a light in the one pair room, I observed a man coming out of the room; I halloaed out fall back immediately; before he could turn round I was upon his back, and he went into the room from whence he came. When I got in the room the door being very narrow, I stood in the centre of the door way, and put the candle down, and called

            , a man who was below to aid and assist me; he came up, and we shut the room door. I then asked the prisoner Solomon if he knew any thing of the other two men; there were three persons in the room; Dearing was sitting on a chair: I asked Solomon if he knew how they came there; he said, he did not. I then asked Dearing how he came there; he said he had come to Mrs. Solomon, and she bid him go up stairs; I then asked Greaves how he came there; he told me that he was an acquaintance of Dearing's, and met with him by the way, and accompanied him there; I then addressed myself to Solomon. I thought it very extraordinary that these men should come in his mother's bed-room, and he did not know any of them; I then asked him if his mother was at home; he said she was not: she had been out on a visit some hours, he had but just come home from his master's; he was an apprentice; I told him it was extraordinary if he was an apprentice that he was always there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes; since the 1st of January; he is always there. The owner of the house has abscouded ever since the 2d of January for a barrel of mustard that was stolen; I then secured the prisoners, got assistance, and took them to the compter. I saw Levy there, I ordered him to aid and assist me; the prisoner Dearing was endeavouring to get out of the door; I pushed him back again, and tied Dearing and Greaves together; I then went and fetched the three reams of paper which were laying at the foot of the bed; I asked Solomon if he knew how that paper came there: he said he knew nothing at all about it; I produce the paper; I went to this house in consequence of information that two men had just gone in the house with a large swag.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same paper that I missed; I have got the following number, and the number preceding; I have a note from Mr. Cripps at the paper-mill. This is the same make and the same date and exact quantity that I missed.</p>

The prisoner came in the accompting-house, and introduced himself as Mr. Ray's son; he said he was come to look out some leather for his father, Mr. Ray. Mr. Ray has been a customer to our shop many years, the reason that he asigned for his father not coming himself, was, that he was dangerously ill; he said he wanted two hides of Russia, and two skins of Morrocco leather, and he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value - A. About four pound, he said he had not got the book, upon which Mr. Ray's accompt was kept, but Mr. Ray never sends the book except when he comes himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he afterwards come to your house - A. Yes, on the 11th of February; I let him have four hides of Russia then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the father - A. On the 11th of February Mr. Ray made his appearance; I told him I was glad to see him look so well, as I had been informed he had been extremely ill. We apprehended the defendant about a week after the 11th, and took him to the compter.</p>

               <p>JOHN JENKINS. I am a porter to Mr. Willan, the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth-street. I got acquainted with the prisoner at the Crown, in Lad-lane, I have known him about four years. Upon the 24th of January, about a quarter past two in the afternoon, I saw him at the Crown, in Lad-lane, he said he wanted to speak to me, and we went round into the back room; he said he had got some bad tokens to dispose of, with that he took two out of his pocket, and we talked a bit together; I asked him whether that was all he had, he said he had got one more, he gave me them in my hand, the three; I asked him what he asked for them, he told me I should have the three for seven shillings; I kept them some time in my hand, and I staid at the table; he put his hand in my pocket, I had some silver in my pocket, he took the silver out and spread it upon the table, thinking his tokens were there, I do not believe he meant to take the silver, the tokens were not there. I took the money up myself, and I told him he should not have the tokens at all. I came out of the Crown public house, and walked on towards Guildhall, and he with me; I was going to the Hall, and he came on to me; and nearly opposite to Guildhall coffee-house I saw two officers standing at the Justice-room door at Guildhall, and then he turned round and went back, and I after him; I catched hold of him and pulled him down, and the officers came to see what was the matter; we were both down together, and I found the tokens in one of the officers hands. I gave charge of him, and told the officer that this man wanted to pass bad money; they took him in custody, but I believe they found nothing more upon him. I gave the tokens to Porter, the officer, the three that the prisoner gave to me.</p>

I am a marshalman of the city of London; me and my partner were standing at the Justice-room door, I saw a struggle at St. Lawrence's church; we went to it, and Tickner said this man was offering bad money, and he gave me three three shilling tokens. We took them up to the Justice-room and searched, and found nothing more upon him. We asked how he came by them; he said he had them of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190048"/>one Macdonald, he said he would be at Newgate at three o'clock.

               <p>Q. Had she made any application to you prior to this A. No further than drinking tea with me and inviting me to renew the intercourse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Young by when any thing of this passed - A. No. She would not go out at this time, and I was obliged to go out and leave her in one of my rooms, and I locked up the warehouse, and went out; she would not come out; I staid out till eleven o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Q. to Whiteman. Can you recollect who were the persons that were married that day. How many are married in that church in the year - A. A good many.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say you know the man very well, has he or has he not been with you; I ask you whether you could or could not remember whether he was married at your church - A. He is a parishioner of the town of Birmingham, he has been several times in our vestry-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not, again and again, spoke to you upon the subject of this marriage, and asked whether you could or could not recollect whether he was the person that was married at your church with this woman - A. He did ask me once, and but once, and I told him directly: I know you very well, but I do not know whether it was here, or it might be in Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. How often can you recollect that he has been at your parish vestry-room - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you allow it, or is it the custom for persons who are not your parishioners to come to your vestry-room - A. No; it is not; he never came at any period but it was about the business that this book concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it in all - A. I cannot say, it might be four or five times; he brought other gentlemen to look at the book.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago had he been before Christmas - A. I do not recollect, he was there before Christmas; he has been at my house two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a private acquaintance of yours - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to your house for - A. He came to ask my daughter if I was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him yourself - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you see him at your house - A. He came to ask for the book to see the names in it; he never saw it at my house, but at the vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before Christmas - A. Never before Christmas; the first time he came about the books; he applied to the Rev. Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live at Birmingham - A. No, but I have been there repeatedly, several months together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his character at Birmingham at all - A. It is improper to say things of a man's character, which we do not know is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not the honour of his private acquaintance at Birmingham - A. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say he has come to your house for the purpose of making enquiries respecting the book, and that book not being at your house he has gone to the vestry to see it - A. This he has done four or five times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. You know of course the nature of your oath - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were married in 1787, at what time of life have you arrived to - A. Forty-eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Quite to years of discretion, you have learned your catechism, you read the bible and go to church - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe in God, and you believe in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190050"/>future state of rewards and punishment, and have read the Scriptures, I take it for granted - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. So then your poor wife at Birmingham was upon her death-bed, and you travelled up to London, and met with the woman at the bar, and took a lodging, your poor wife requiring the solace of your duty, and you spending your time with a prostitute - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home to Birmingham, and when was it your poor wife died - A. The 3d of June, 1810.</p>
               <p>Q. And you continued on this intercourse with the woman up to the time of her decease - A. Up to the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I put one plump question to you in Christian charity, I caution you before you give me your answer, in the presence of God I ask you, and in the presence of your country, is it or is it not your handwriting to the register of St. Bride's - A.

             in the register of St. Bride's is not my handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I caution you that I will prove this - A. It is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met this woman in the street first - A. No, I did not; I met her in St. Paul's Church.</p>
               <p>Q. What, talk to her in St. Paul's church - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your attachment to her take place in St. Paul's, where you first found her - A. I followed her home from St. Paul's church to No. 12, Fetter-lane. I had not been to that church to prayers, I had just come from a place of worship.</p>
               <p>Q. So coming from a place of worship you followed her home to Fetter-lane - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to her in the street - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What religion are you, for God's sake - A. I do not know any name I can give to my religion.</p>
               <p>Q. Thanks to God, I hope no other man is of the same religion - you followed her in the house without having spoken to her before was the door of the house open - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her or her sister first - A. Her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before your intimacy took place with her - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the intercourse take place with her - A. On the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. In Fetter-lane, at her sister's house - A. I am not sure it was in Fetter-lane, I think they were removed to St. John's-street while I was in Birmingham. I lived with her there one month, and then went down to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I think you said you were very angry with her for having married in your name - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were shocked at her profligacy - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you - A. I am a jeweller, I make imitable diamonds.</p>
               <p>Q. What, mock diamonds to cheat the world with - A. My warehouse is 53, Great Bartholomew-close, my manufactory is in Birmingham; I employ seven or eight working under my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. So then after this woman told you she had married in a fictitious name you took her down to Portsmouth with you - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you at Portsmouth took her to her own brother, and I tell you here he is, a respectable tradesman at Portsmouth as your wife, and requested that he would receive you as his brother-in-law - A. I suffered her to introduce me to her brother, and I kept up the delusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, did not you yourself say that you hoped he would have no objection to you as a brother-in-law - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in that habitation as the husband of his sister - A. About ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Received as a brother-in-law - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Received the same at her mothers - A. We were not at all with the mother.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after you left Portsmouth you returned with this woman to London - A. I came to London, and went down to Birmingham, and left her at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you came to London and took a room in Mitre-court - A. Yes, Mrs. Currie's, a fruiterers and oyster shop.</p>
               <p>Q. She fitted up a room - A. No, it was not fitted up at all, it was only took to deceive Mrs. Currie; I put a bed in it in order to deceive her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live with her as man and wife - A. I think till the 20th of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. She had a child afterwards and you thought it time to be off - A. I was two months at home on account of my wife's illness.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did his mother live - A. In Old-street, opposite of St. Luke's church.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you were always ready and willing to pay for the maintainance of this poor orphan - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No action has been brought against you to compel you to pay - A. That was brought for the premises, the rent; for the old woman told me she would never take any rent of me, therefore she never made any demand; she made a demand of rent before the action was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you object to paying that demand - A. Yes, my lord, but my attorney paid part of that demand in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your attorney - A. Mr. Draper.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Draper was desired by Mr. Alley to go out of court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Mr. Harmer is here, I cannot ask him to go out of court. When were you first introduced to Mr. Draper - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Draper being desired by you to call upon the mother to propose that if she would forego the claim for the rent you would not prosecute her two daughters for a conspiracy - A. I did not; I did know of the conspiracy at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if ever Mr. Draper has said so he did it without your direction - A. Certainly, if he did it at all he did it without my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not hear that he went to the mother of these people with a warrant upon the indictment to take them in custody if they did not accede to the proposal, and forego the action - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190051"/>never did hear so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night they were taken in custody - A. Not the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever corresponded with the prisoner - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she often been with you - A. About four times.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been once to her and she four times to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever copy a letter for her to write - A. Never, nor any other document.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever dictate to her the form of any letter that he was to write - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to any body that you took care that she should not have your letters, but that you took care to manage well to have letters of her's - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you or have you not said that you took care that she should have no letters of yours to shew, or any thing to that effect - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have not you said that you took care that you would have letters of hers - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You again deny it. Now I again caution you and tell you that I will call a witness to contradict you if you again deny it; have not you said that you took care to have her letters, but you took care she should have no writing of yours to produce - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever propose to her that she should write a letter to you declaring to you that she was not married to you, as your reason that it might save you from a prosecution for bigamy, because the thing was wispered about among your wife's friends - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the question - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you have been subject to a prosecution if the fact had been so discovered - A. Assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that you left London upon the 7th of August in the year 1810, and did not return for two weeks - A. I did not return till the 28th, I was not in town on the 9th or 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where you dined on the 9th - A. At home, at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. With your poor wife that is gone - A. Yes, with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any body here that dined with you that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with two persons that went with you within ten miles of Birmingham. Are they here to-night - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first apply to them to come here to day - A. About a month back.</p>
               <p>Q. As a Birmingham man doing business, you went backwards and forwards continually - A. I came about four times a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually go yourself to enter your name or send any other for you, for the clerk to put it down, so that it will not appear in your own handwriting that you went down at that time - A. It will not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had a friend that you wished to accommodate in the coach I suppose you would not object to enter his name as Thompson that he might be well accommodated - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never entered a name of Thompson for any of your friends for whom you took a place to go in the country - A. I have for my wife, not for any male friends. Yes, from Birmingham not from London; I had a servant that lived with me about six years, and her name was put down with mine when we came to London together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has she lived with since your wife's death - A. With Mr. Griffiths, a surgeon, No. 2, Tooth-place, Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she lived, and with whom, since your wife's death - A. After I gave up house-keeping she went to live with her father; she lived with me after I gave up housekeeping till the month of August, and from that time till she came to live in London I had seen her two or three times: she went to see her father about seven or eight miles from Birmingham.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she continue to live with her father - A. About a week, and then she went down to Sheers Hill in Staffordshire, about twenty-three miles from Birmingham; I understood she was there about a fortnight or three weeks or a month, then she came to Birmingham and waited my return, and then she came to London with me in September in the coach in a very ill state of health; she went the very same day to Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live now - A. In the very same place.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the register book of St. Bride's, and tell me whether you think it is his hand-writing - A. From the knowledge I have of his hand-writing, I think there is no doubt but it is hand-writing, I have no doubt, not the least in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. Is not the letter T perfectly unlike his handwriting - A. He has made the T to differ in all the times he has wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Q. But as to the letter s, which is a blotted letter, is there any other letter which is like his - A. Then I do not think much like it; I think it is really his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether there is any other letters like his besides the s and n, is the i like - A. The i is not like exactly it is not so much like his general writing as I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the o like - A. I think it is like his general hand-writing.</p>

I really believed they were man and wife, I gave them my blessing.</p>
