               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor; the prisoner came into my shop the 17th of July, about six in the evening, and asked for a pair of buckles at three shillings and sixpence; I went to the other side of the counter to get the buckles, and he came from the side where he stood where the watches, were with his hand in his breeches pocket; he took the buckles out of my hand, and put three shillings and six-pence into my other hand, and went out directly; I immediately suspected him; I went on the other side of the counter and missed a silver watch; I directly ran after him and got sight of him; I saw him run down Craven-street about three doors from our shop; I called out stop thief; he was stopped and brought back; I did not see him stopped; the watch was not found upon him; it was brought to me by

               <p>I have the watch; I picked it up and gave it my husband; I picked it up in my master's area, No. 29, Craven-street, in the Strand, I found it in four different parts, it was on the 17th of July, about a quarter after six; I was sitting in my master's kitchen, and heard the cry of stop thief; I looked up and saw the watch drop down the area out of a person's hand, but I could not see who threw it down; my husband was sitting with me at the table, and I took the watch and gave it to him; he went out immediately to see who it was that threw it down; the boy was just then stopped; they took him up the street; the prisoner was the boy I saw taken; my husband brought the watch back again, and in the evening Mr. Morris called upon me in my husband's absence, and he took it home with him.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the watch that was brought back again? - Yes, it was the same my husband brought in first, and Mr. Morris took it away, and carried it to the Justice's; I have had it ever since; I took notice of it before I gave it to Mr. Morris that evening; I am sure it is the same watch I first picked up.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you the name and number of the watch in your book? - No, Sir, I took it in change; I do not deal in watches; I have but two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan. Who do you live with? - I live with Mr. Brown a wine merchant; I know the watch again; it was scratched E. F. or E. J. I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not R. J. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the scratch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you correct in your recollection what the scratch was? - It was E. I. or E. F. I cannot tell which, but I am sure this is the watch; I observed bruises in the watch towards the hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Should you have known the watch if it had not been for the letters that was scratched upon it? - I should.</p>
               <p>Then without these letters you would have known the watch again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you at all sure what the letters<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300004"/> scratched on the inside were? - I am not sure any more than I think it is E. F. or E. I.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Morris. What was the mark of the watch that was lost? - I. R. to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>I. R. or R. I. - I. R.; I never looked into the watch before; I did not know it by the mark.</p>
               <p>By what did you know it? - We had but one silver watch in the shop, that was an old watch that had been worn; I did not know the maker's name.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Morris. How long have you had the watch that was lost? - About two months; I had not entered the marks in any book; I have looked at the mark on the inside of the case, R. I. and that is all that I know it by; it was the name of the person I changed it with; it was scratched on the inside of the case.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch now, and see if it is the same watch? - Yes, it is the same; I went to No. 29, in Craven-street the evening of that day, and received the watch from Mrs. Smith, and carried it the next day to the Justice's; I kept it separate at that time; I am sure that is the watch; I gave it her back again; it was the same Mrs. Smith gave me that evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan. When did you see this watch previous to its being lost? - I saw it in the case before I went out; I went out about three.</p>
               <p>Your shop is pretty well frequented? - There were several customers came in, in the course of three hours; I changed it with

               <p>What had he with him? - I was coming from the Victualling-office, and I saw the prisoner and another coming over the hill; and I suspected him; having I verily believe this bag at his back; I crossed first one way and then the other, that he might not observe me; when he came near to me I caught hold of him by the collar, and seized the bag, says I, you have got some tobacco; I saw the seal upon it, it was just such another seal as this; I told him he had stolen it; says he, that man gave it me; I wish you would run after him, no, says I friend, that will not do, I shall take care of you; I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did shew you another man? - Yes, the prisoner began to struggle; and another man came and assisted me, and took him and the tobacco to the Custom-house, and delivered it to Mr. Hart, and weighed it.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you seize this for? - Being run, and having no certificate.</p>
               <p>What was the weight of it? - Twenty pounds; by the late act of parliament it is liable to seizure if above six pounds.</p>

               <p>How came you to take it from him to carry? - He was to give me sixpence to carry it into Ratcliffe-highway; but now I find it was a fixed thing, as he saw the man, and knew him; he owned at the Justice's that he knew the man.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. Did you know the man? - Yes, I knew him to be about the quays as well as this man.</p>

               <p>Did you turn from her? - Yes, and the mean while I turned, she took a piece of lace; I was obliged to turn my back to her to get the pen; she then said, she would not give me any more than a guinea for; I then looked in my box, and missed a piece of black silk lace.</p>
               <p>How much might there be in this piece? - Twelve yards; the prisoner said, she would give no more than a guinea; so missing the pice of lace, I said, if you will stop, I will see if there is any thing here that will do for you; I looked in one box, and then in another; she went away and got two doors from us; I went after her, and said, you have taken a piece of lace, and she said, she had no such thing about her, and while

            ; I can swear to the writing; the one I missed first is marked P. R. she dropped two, but I missed only that one; I know the pattern; we had only one of that pattern, which made me miss it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever examine to see if the other was missing? - I did after we had been at the Justice's; the second card of lace was in the shop that morning before the prisoner came, and we had sold none that day; we sell it for three shillings and four-pence; it costs us two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Was it an old house keeper? - I fancy we have had it about a twelvemonth; the other was twelve yards, valued at twenty-pence per yard.</p>

               <p>Nor in the shop? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Was she so long in the shop as twenty minutes before you followed her? - I dare say she was.</p>
               <p>Yours is a pretty large shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people were backwards and forwards in the shop? - There were two people, but they were gone, besides Bartlet and South; the customers were gone before I shewed her the lace.</p>

               <p>Then of course you went out almost immediately after? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now I wish you to swear positively, if you chuse it, and recollect that the life of that woman depends on your answer perhaps; will you venture to swear that the lace did not fall from the counter? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Did you see it drop? - No, I heard it drop, and that is sufficient.</p>
               <p>A pretty common lace for a cloak is it not? - It is not a common ordinary cloak lace.</p>
               <p>Is not it a very usual cloak lace? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now how many thousand yards like that do you think I could purchase in the street where you live? - I cannot say to that pattern.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they both common laces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not they both remnants? - We do not look upon it as a remnant; there are different lengths.</p>
               <p>How much is there in a piece? - There were thirty-three yards of this originally; now there are twelve yards, a proper quantity for a cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you take this to be a whole piece? - Sometimes we have them in twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath do not you know it is not a whole piece, look at it, has there been none cut from it? - It may be cut.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has it not been cut? - I am not sure, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath has it not been cut, and do not you know it has? - I have not cut it myself.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath are not you sure it has been cut? - I told you I cannot tell nothing at all about it; I cannot take my oath to it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know it has been cut by the inspection of it? - It may have been cut.</p>

I lost them in the day time, from a little parlour at the front of the house; it was about three or four in the afternoon; I came to town to see my brother, who lived with a gentleman in Brompton-row, and to get a place; I was walking up the Hay-market as fast as I could, and a short fellow overtook me; he was an entire stranger; he said he came out of the country; I had not been in town two hours; I came from Great Brampton in Essex; I was in town once before, three years ago; the short fellow came up to me, and said, Sir, do you come out of the country? I said Yes; he said he came out of Nottinghamshire two days before, after some parish business; and he was going to his attorney's to receive one hundred and twenty guineas; and near the upper end of the Haymarket he ran and picked up something, which he said he thought was a garter.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him what it was? - No, he said it of his own accord; I said nothing; he said it felt heavy; he run pretty brisk about thirty yards before me; I thought he was gone away from me; he appeared quite like a countryman, with a great coat and a flapped hat on; after he took it up he stopped till I came up to him, and then he said, it does not appear like a garter, it seems heavy; and he said, when we come to a public house we will go in and see what it is, it is a poor prize that will not bear a pint of beer; we went on, and when we came to a public house, says I, here is a public house, we may as well go in there, for I am very dry; no he said he did not chuse to go in there, he would go to a house right over to his attorney's, where he put up when he came to town, to receive his money; he took me up several turnings to a public house which I since found to be the sign of the Vine in Vine-street; when we came in there the prisoner sat in the parlour, seemingly doing business in his pocket-book, writing; and he did not seem to take any notice of us, or we of him; we called for a pint of beer when we went in, and he sat a while, and after he had done he asked if either of us two could give him a wafer; and we told him, no; then he went out under pretence of getting one; he was gone the space of two or three minutes, and while he was gone this short man pulled out a long silk purse, and untied it, and at one end of it there were some papers, and he took them out, and asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300010"/> to read them; he said he could not read; and I read them, and one of them was a bill and receipt for a brilliant cluster diamond ring; the receipt was this, I remember the words, Received of Mr. Smith, a brilliant cluster diamond ring, value two hundred and fifty pounds some odd money, but I do not know what; after I had read it this prisoner came in, and the short man would not believe my reading it, he thought I must be mistaken; the short man seemed very much surprised and overjoyed, and asked the prisoner to read it; he read it the same as I did; and he seemed to be very much overjoyed, and asked the short man whether he was to give me any of it, and he told him, yes, he had agreed to give me part of it, for he said if he had not picked it up I should; I told him it was a thing of great value, and a thing of consequence, and it would be advertised; and the prisoner said, no, we had no occasion to be afraid of that, for it was Saturday, and could not be advertised before Monday; and I told him the person that lost it had an undoubted right to it, and the prisoner said sho, sho, you need not disturb yourself about that, cannot you keep your own counsel; I shall never speak of it to be sure, says he, for I am a capital distiller, and do not do it out of any regard to money; then the prisoner asked this short man whether he was agreeable to give me part of it, and the short man said, yes; then the prisoner asked the short man how much he would give me; then I said I did not care what he gave me, if he gave me five pounds I should be content; then the prisoner asked the short man if he would leave it to him, and he would do justice between us both, so the other man agreed to it; and he said, let the prisoner say what he would it should be right; then the prisoner said, the man that picked up the ring was to have one hundred and fifty pounds, and I was to have one hundred; then the prisoner asked this short man if he had the money, and he said no, he was going to his attorney to receive one hundred and twenty guineas, and if I and the prisoner, whom he then called a gentleman, would stop a quarter of an hour, he would go over for it, the prisoner said he was in a great hurry to go to Weston about some business , but he would stop a quarter of an hour; accordingly this short man went out of the room under pretence of getting the money; he was gone nigh a quarter of an hour, when he returned he said his attorney was gone to little Chelsea, and would not be at home till eight at night; and he said he asked the attorney's lady whether she could let him have the money out of her private purse, and she told him no, she had not so much money; then this short man seemed confused, he said what am I to do now? I want the ring for a friend in Nottinghamshire, a very particular gentleman, he said he did not like to part with the ring, for it would be of more service to him than ten times the worth of it; then the prisoner says to him; Sir, will you trust me with the ring; and he said to the prisoner that he would; accordingly he gave him a direction where he pretended to live, at No. 20, Old Bond-street, a capital distiller.</p>
               <p>What name did the prisoner call himself? - He said his name was 
               <persName id="t17860830-5-person96">
                  George

            ; then the short man gave the prisoner the ring; and after that the prisoner asked me what money I had in my pocket, I told him but very little, and was loth to part with it; and he said, I must give him all my things, and in particular my money, as a token of my honesty that I would not go to demand the ring before the short man the next morning; I gave him six or seven shillings, I do not know which, I kept back 1 s. or 18 d. the prisoner wanted more, and after he found I had no more money, he said there is your watch, that will tell up; and he wanted my buckles; I delivered my watch and buckles, they were silver; I had my other clothes tied up in a handkerchief like a bundle, and he wanted them.</p>
               <p>Did you give him them too? - Yes; that bundle contained the things in the indictment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300011"/> and my silver stock-buckle was in my pocket, I gave him that with my money.</p>
               <p>Court. He asked for the bundle and you gave it him? - Yes, he asked for it.</p>
               <p>And you delivered it to him? - Yes, He did not get the things off my back; after he got all my things I was quite confused, and wanted to go out of the room; I attempted to go out; and he desired me to keep back; he wanted to know what I meant by going out; after that he wrote a kind of an agreement that I should not prosecute him, and bid me set my hand to it.</p>
               <p>Then at his desire he told you to sign it? - Yes, he said you must set your hand to this that you are not to come to demand the ring at my house in Old Bond-street before the other man comes; says he this paper is because neither of you two gentlemen should not bring me into trouble about it; the short man made a mark.</p>
               <p>Then he did not use the word prosecute? - No, that we should not bring him into any trouble; after we had signed the paper the short man went out, and I went out, and left the prisoner in the room; and I took out my buckles out of my shoes; and the short man took out his metal buckles out of his shoes, and bid me put them into mine till the next morning; the prisoner said he would send my things to his house in Old Bond-street, and I should have them again the next morning, and the short man was to give me the money the next morning, and he was to keep the ring, I was not to have the ring at all; if he was not there, I was to stay till he did come; and the short man said he could bring the money in the morning; all this was done in the parlour.</p>

               <p>What is your silver watch worth? - About four pounds, the silver shoe buckles ten shillings, the stock buckle two shillings, coat ten shillings, almost new, the shirts I value at five shillings, they were worth all the money charged; I went away with the short man, and he told me he would take me into my path again; he took me to Piccadily, opposite St James's church, and there he ran away without speaking a word; he ran across the road; and then I suspected I had been robbed; he ran into a gateway, and I saw no more of him from that time to this; I went to No. 20, Bond-street, but no such person lived there; I enquired for one Mr. Bearcroft a distiller, and the people were milliners, and they told me there was no such person in the street; I went by the place several times, and then I looked for the public house several days, and at last I found it, and they told me these two men had been there two or three times before, and had taken several people's property from them by the same method.</p>
               <p>The people of the house told you so, did they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. This house ought to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>How came this man to be taken? - I mentioned it to Mr. Hunter an inspector, who went to the house, and threatened to take away their license, and so the prisoner was taken at his own house, and dividing a Scotchman's pack; on the 5th of August, Mr. Lucas the constable came down to me into Essex, and brought me up; I saw the prisoner at Litchfield-street-office the next day; I knew him as soon as I saw him; I am sure and positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. When the short man made his escape, did you come back to the public-house? - I went immediately to No. 20, Bond street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he left his buckles in the bundle? - The short man had the buckles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not advise him and his friend to have the property advertised? - No, upon my oath, I mentioned it to them, it was all I had in the world; I have been five or six years getting them; I have nothing but what I have on.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say but what I did before the Justice, that going out of Mr. Plowden's house at night I discovered a man going towards Queen-street with a large bundle, which then appeared to me to be a black; he threw it down, I came and took it up, and took it to my cousin's, and told him it was a parcel of my clothes, and I would call for it in the morning; I afterwards heard of the robbery, and was in hopes the things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300017"/> would be advertised; I was not sure they were Mr. Plowden's things, but not finding them advertised, I began to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, as to character I know there were several people who would have attended, but I told his mother and several more people that it was unnecessary.</p>

               <p>I lost my pocket book on the 17th of July; I went to the Bank to receive a dividend of thirty pounds; I was paid in a thirty pound Bank note, and when I received it I put it into this book, my banker's book, where I keep my running cash, and I put the book in this outside pocket, with my hand over it for fear of having my pocket picked, going from the Bank; after I got seven or eight yards from the front of the <placeName id="t17860830-10-crimeloc51">Change gate</placeName>

               <p>Court. If you put your hand so instantly back into your pocket, I should think you must feel his hand? - No, Sir; I drew my hand out and put it back again directly, and the book was gone that instant.</p>
               <p>Did you feel the hand at all or not? - I did not feel the hand.</p>
               <p>You felt or saw nothing till you missed the book? - I did not; after I had got the book from him, I said, now, what have you to say for yourself? why, says he, I found it; aye, says I, so you did, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300019"/>What did you draw your hand out of your pocket for? - It was a very warm day; I drew my hand out to cool it.</p>
               <p>Was your handkerchief in that pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not draw out the book with your hand? - No, I can make a safe oath of that; I am very clear in that.</p>
               <p>But in the act you describe of just raising your hand, and putting it immediately back again, how could there be time for any person to get that book out and you not feel it? - I apprehend he knows his business very well, what I may say, a good workman; I have two witnesses who saw the transaction, and they went with me and took him before the sitting Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel You walked from the Bank to the Change? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you stop at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw the prisoner standing by you when you missed it? - I saw him close to me; I did not stand still, nor he did not stand still; no person was near me on the side where he was.</p>
               <p>What is the reason you apprehend he knew his business? - Because he was so sudden in his motions.</p>

               <p>Relate particularly all that passed at the time it was hired? - He hired it for the term of three weeks or a month; he said, he was going round the north.</p>
               <p>To make a tour? - I think he said so.</p>
               <p>Relate as nearly as you can the particulars of what he said to you? - For that time he was to pay me at the rate of five shillings per day; and I have never had the pleasure of seeing the post-chaise since nor him till I was indulged by my Lord Mayor with seeing him in the Poultry compter; he had hired one on the 10th of July before that; he had brought it home and paid for it.</p>
               <p>How had he been first recommended to you? - From the Saracen's-head, Aldgate, where he lodges; he said, now I have paid you six shillings a day; I shall want another post-chaise in the course of ten days or a fortnight, you will not charge me so much for that, as the time is longer.</p>
               <p>(Going to look at his book.)</p>
               <p>Were the memorandums you are going to look at made by yourself? - Yes; it was the 10th and returned the 16th, seven days, he paid six shillings a day for it.</p>
               <p>When he came to you on the first of September, did any particular conversation pass between you? - Nothing, but he desired the chaise to be fitted up with pistol holsters and a net to the roof; I told him it was not customary to furnish them with pistol holsters, he said, he must pay for that.</p>
               <p>You understood it was to go a tour through the north of England? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300022"/>Did he say so? - I think he did; to the best of my recollection he said, round the north; but that was no part of the contract for the hiring the chaise.</p>
               <p>When was the chaise delivered to him? - The 1st of September; that same day he sent a pair of post horses from the Saracen's-head.</p>
               <p>From that time you never saw any thing of him or the chaise till he was taken up? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect particularly as to the time he was to have the chaise? - To the best of my recollection it was positively three weeks or one month.</p>
               <p>Then it was to be returned in the course of that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never found the chaise since he was taken up? - No, Sir, I have never seen it since, nor do not of my own knowledge know what is become of it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the prisoner say any thing about it? - No, Sir, I never was in his presence; I only had just a view of him at the wicket at the compter.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure he is the person that hired the chaise of you? - Yes, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>You had seen him before? - Several times.</p>


               <p>There was no agreement to sell the chaise to him or any thing of that kind? - There was no positive agreement nor any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation of that sort? - He said, now suppose I have a mind to buy this carriage, what might be the value of it, I said, I do not know exactly, but I suppose fifty guineas; that was not the post chaise he was to have had; for unfortunately for me another gentleman had that post-chaise, and went a tour to Margate, and did not return at the time he intended.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to what you said? - He said, he should see when he came home; he did not make any particular answer; I do not recollect he made any answer.</p>
               <p>Did you part with the chaise to him in any expectation of his becoming a purchaser? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>By what name did he come to you? - By the name of Harrold; I knew him by that name and no other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What book is that you have in your hand? - It is called the hire book.</p>
               <p>Will you be so good to favour me with a sight of it? - To be sure, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are the places turned down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This is your regular day book to enter things hired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is one entry of a chaise called Onslow's, seven days at six shillings per day crossed out; your entries were made at the time I suppose that the things were hired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On the second entry, the words that follow the word day are written upon an erazure? - Yes, he was called Mr. - at the Saracen's head at first, then the second time he was called Mr. Harrold.</p>
               <p>Then there is inserted the additional name thus, supposed to be Semple; now, upon your oath, when was this written, which is written upon an erazure, I mean these words, his name supposed to be Semple? - I think it is three quarters of a year ago.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I have done it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to stand by that that you have sworn? - Yes, that that was put in about three quarters of a year ago.</p>

               <p>Do you mean now again to swear that three quarters of a year ago you wrote these words, his name supposed to be Semple? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>It has continued then in your book for three quarters of a year? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was originally written there? - I believe there was a name of Mac something.</p>
               <p>What was that Mac something? - I do not know I declare to God.</p>
               <p>First you wrote Mac something? - No, Harrold first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300023"/>That stands distinct from it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then at the bottom there is this, five shillings a day - his name supposed to be Semple? - I heard it was the Marquis of Carmarthen at one time; it was one name that I put down, but what the name was I do not know; it was not the right name; I was informed his right name was Semple.</p>
               <p>So this you wrote three quarters of a year ago; by whose advice and recommendation and information? - I was informed by a man at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Favour us with that man's name? -

               <p>How long ago have you conversed with him about the defendant? - I believe it is about three quarters or a year ago.</p>
               <p>Now state to my Lord and the Jury what that conversation was.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no right to ask him that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to ask him what he said to Sadgrove about Major Semple and the post chaise, about three quarters of a year ago? - I told Sadgrove that he defrauded me out of a post chaise, or robbed me of a post chaise, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Sadgrove that he was a d - d scoundrel, and he had got a good new post chaise of yours, and that you would arrest him for fifty pounds if you could find him? - Certainly, as a distressed tradesman I wished to recover my property.</p>
               <p>I ask you now, Sir, upon the oath you have taken, will you venture to swear you did not tell Sadgrove that the prisoner was a d - d scoundrel, and he had got a good new post chaise of yours, and that you would arrest him for fifty pounds if you could find him? - I do not know that I ever said such a word.</p>
               <p>You will venture to swear that you did not? - I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect asking Sadgrove where you could find him to arrest him? - I do not know that I used that word.</p>
               <p>Would not you have arrested him then? - I do not know whether I should or not.</p>
               <p>Had not you it in contemplation to do it? - No Sir, I do not know that I had any intention.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not look at the effect or consequence of your answers, but give a fair and manly answer.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Did you never deliver a bill to any man? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Not to the prisoner? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Be careful, Mr. Lycett; do you swear that positively? - I swear that positively; I am as careful as you are.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sue out a writ actually against him? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Nor you never mentioned arresting him to Sadgrove? - I do not believe I ever mentioned such a word to Sadgrove; I am pretty sure I never did.</p>
               <p>The first post chaise he had of you was a common hack post chaise? - It was a middling chaise.</p>
               <p>Now this was a better one, not one that you would let in common hire? - I should not let it to every body; I should let it to a gentleman like you.</p>
               <p>I am much obliged to you, Mr. Lycett, I am sorry I do not happen to live at your part of the town, or else I might be a customer; this second post chaise had pistol holsters? - It had; they were put in by the direction of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>It had a net and a top? - There was a platform.</p>
               <p>Did you put these to it after it was bespoke by the prisoner? - No, Sir, I fitted some things up to my own fancy.</p>
               <p>You did not usually let post chaises with platforms? - Yes, Sir, frequently.</p>
               <p>Had this chaise ever been let before? - The carriage had.</p>
               <p>Had the carriage in the state in which it was delivered to the prisoner ever been let before? - No; I built it on purpose to let out on hire, to go on a job, or any thing of that kind; my servant delivered it, and he will prove the delivery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300024"/>Of your own knowledge you do not know to whom it was delivered? - I do not.</p>
               <p>The value of it was about fifty guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told me just now, before the prisoner went away, before the carriage went from your possession, he talked about buying it; he said, suppose I should have a mind to buy this carriage what may be the value of it? - He did it in a kind of air.</p>
               <p>He did not do it so vulgarly as you and I should have done? - No, no, he was a great deal more polished than either of us; I beg your pardon though, Sir.</p>
               <p>I am not angry with you, Mr. Lycett; his polish to-day will not hurt him, he will not be convicted to-day because he is a polished man, or a man of fashion; now Mr. Lycett, you have said that he said, suppose I have a mind to buy this carriage what may the value be? - I did; and he said he should see when he came home.</p>
               <p>You expected him to be gone some such matter as three weeks or a month; if he had returned at the end of two months, and given you the fifty guineas, should not you have been pleased? - I should have been better pleased than I am now.</p>
               <p>You would not have thought he had broken any contract with you; you say the first chaise was out seven days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did that hire come to? - Just six shillings a-day.</p>
               <p>Do you remember receiving any other sums of money or bank note from the prisoner besides the payment of that chaise? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never receive a ten pound bank note? - No, I never saw any bank note; I have seen him pull out his purse with an air; he seemed a man of great consequence and property.</p>
               <p>He seemed what he was then. - I never received from him the sum of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>At the time you saw the defendant he was in custody? - Yes, he was in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Had you then seen Mr. Feltham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have read a deal of stuff in the papers, charging this gentleman with a great many misdemeanors; the papers you know were full of the major, but now they have got the death of the king of Prussia, and Mrs. Nicholson to work upon, probably they will leave off the major; however Mr. Lycett, you know now that he was charged with a great many misdemeanors? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Who carries on this prosecution? - I do not know; my pocket suffers for it.</p>
               <p>I was in hopes Mr. Feltham's pocket suffered for it? - He may have a super-fluity of money; but I hope I shall always be able by my industry to punish a character of this kind; I think I am doing good to the public.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the words at five shillings a-day written at the same time with the first part of this entry? - That was all but the name of Semple.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now my Lord, I say that upon that spot after the word day once stood or upon return to be paid fifty guineas; I say that no single name, Mac Carty or any thing else ever could fill up that place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lycett. Hand that paper up to my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let us have a peep at it first.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lycett. I do not know that you have a right to peep at it before my Lord.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow looks at it and gives it him back again.) Now you may ask my Lord whether it is evidence; my Lord I submit that the words originally stood there; I could write them in that space myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lycett. Can you? Why you can put it in, in a nicer manner than I can, I am but an aukward hand.</p>
               <p>Court. There does not seem room for so many words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Yes, my Lord, these words, or return fifty guineas.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The erazure is not the whole length of the line, the erazure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300025"/> seems to me to go from the word day to the letter B.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It seems to have been fresh done, and it is sworn to have been done three quarters of a year ago.</p>
               <p>Court. That last is a fair observation to go to the Jury; the other is a mere suggestion of your ingenuity, you have been measuring the words to see what could have been written there; you stated it first a little too much, and now you have narrowed your supposition to fit the place.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is a few lines he sent me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are totally immaterial; and only go to confirm that he had a chaise.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have some notion his hand writing can be proved, you will observe it says a carriage, in does not say his carriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No, nor there is no date to it, so it may relate to the first carriage.</p>
               <p>Court. (Looks at it.) It is totally immaterial.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner, sent to Mr. Garrow. I am desired to ask you whether the platform for this carriage was not made from the measure given you by the prisoner to suit his own trunks? - No, Sir, it was not made; it was a second-hand thing, I do not think it was, it was a great deal too big.</p>
               <p>Was it made to fit, was it reduced to the size of his trunks? - I do not recollect that it was; I rather believe it was altered to fit his trunk, not made.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that the chaise was intirely new, and that the wheels had never been out? - I do not know that I did; if I did I must tell him a story.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear you did not? - I cannot swear I did; I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>As a serious man upon your oath did not you tell him that it was intirely new, and that the wheels had never been used? - I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I am sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. You should answer with a little more respect to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have not treated you rudely, and I am glad the Court take notice of you; have you never to any body declared that you would arrest him if you could find him? - As a tradesman, not knowing what to do, I should have been glad of my money.</p>
               <p>Would not you arrest him now? - I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>Have you never told any body that you would? - I might.</p>
               <p>Do you believe you did? - I really believe I did.</p>
               <p>How long ago do you believe you said that? - God knows; I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you say so at Knightsbridge? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you would swear to your debt and hold him to bail? - I said nothing about swearing to my debt.</p>
               <p>Did not you say that if you could find him, you would arrest him for the debt of fifty guineas? - I do not think I said the debt of fifty guineas.</p>
               <p>Did not you say if you could find him you would arrest him for the debt, is that your distinction? - I am not so experienced; I told people so.</p>

               <p>Then you did so intend? - I talked of it.</p>
               <p>Did not you intend it? - I do not know whether I should or not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell people you should do the thing you did not intend to do? upon your oath if you had known where to have found him three quarters of a year ago, would not you have arrested him? - I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>What makes you think you should not? - Because I never arrested a man in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever prosecute a man before? - Yes, I did a Jew some time ago in this court; I am not fond of arresting; I believe I might tell people so, I dare say I might.</p>
               <p>I am desired to ask you this question,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300026"/> whether if other persons had not applied to you, you would have brought this prosecution? - I really believe I should have done it chearfully.</p>
               <p>Is not it by the desire of others? - I do not know that I am to be led.</p>
               <p>Is it not by the desire of Mr. Feltham? - No, Sir, I do not know that it is; I have been exceeding happy in having Mr. Feltham's assistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you apply to any attorney to take out a writ against this man? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Court. I have one question more that I wish to ask you, and you will be so good to recollect as correctly as you can at the distance of time before you answer it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say the chaise was hired at five shillings a day, you understood it was for three weeks or a month? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the price of the chaise was mentioned, was any thing said supposing he should keep it beyond the three weeks or a month, what was to be done then? - I am sure nothing of that kind was mentioned; I am positively sure in that respect; there was nothing passed of that sort.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever watch me any where? - Watch you! I have set my servants to watch you.</p>
               <p>Did not watch me into a public house? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had not you taken instructions then? - No, Sir.</p>

            , about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>What day did you deliver it? - I cannot directly say, it was about a twelvemonth ago.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a chaise was it? - A post-chaise.</p>
               <p>What sort of a post-chaise? - A new one.</p>
               <p>Where did you deliver it to Deacon? - At the door.</p>

               <p>How many? - Two.</p>
               <p>Who is Deacon, do you know? - He is a post-chaise boy, and drove for Mr. Bolton at the Saracen's-head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agar. This you say was a new chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether this chaise was bought or lent for hire? - I understood it was hired.</p>
               <p>From whom? - From my master.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for your master to let new chaises out to hire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any alteration that had been made in the chaise? - No great deal of alterations.</p>
               <p>What were these alterations? - They were baggage boards to put on before to put a trunk on.</p>
               <p>Were not they on before they were let to the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>That is what you call a platform then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any holsters made in this chaise? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Which does your master let generally to hire, new or old chaises? - Both.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect ever hearing him treat respecting the purchase of a chaise? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What did he come about to your master? - About hiring a chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know nothing of that but from your master? - No, the first time he came I heard him say he wanted to hire a chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you see him after that? - Yes, several times.</p>

               <p>Did you go for any chaise? - Yes; the 31st of August to Mr. Lycet's, for a post-chaise; a gentleman's carriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300027"/>Who was it delivered to you by? - By that lad.</p>
               <p>Who sent you? - My master; I put to my horses, and I took it to Knightsbridge; there I took up a single gentleman.</p>
               <p>Should you know that gentleman? - I cannot be any ways positive to the gentleman; that may be the gentleman; but I cannot be positive to him; I drove him to the Crown and Cushion at Uxbridge; and he ordered a pair of horses; and I went with him then to the Duke of Portland's; I do not know the name of the place; I waited for the gentleman, and brought him back to the Crown and Cushion; then the gentleman took a fresh pair of horses, and where he went I cannot say; I can no way s be sure as to the gentleman; I did not see him out of the carriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is all you know about it? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you seen that gentleman before? - I drove him once to Barnet; to the lower Red-lion; he did not get out of his carriage, but had horses put on and went off immediately; as to his person I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. How long before had you drove him to Barnet? - I cannot pretend to say about how long; it might be a month or three weeks, but justly to the time, I cannot be sure; it was the same gentleman.</p>
               <p>Why do you say so? - Because my master told me it was the same gentleman I had driven to Barnet.</p>
               <p>Who did you go to at Knightsbridge? - To a hair dresser's shop on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Do you know the name of that hairdresser? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know him last August was a twelvemonth? - He was a customer of ours at the Saracen's-head.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Major J. G. Harrold, I think he called his name.</p>
               <p>The other lad was a lad of yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You sent him for a chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who ordered you to send him? - This gentleman.</p>
               <p>When the chaise came who went into it? - It did not take up at our house.</p>
               <p>Court. But are you sure he ordered you to send a pair of horses for the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To whom? - To Mr. Lycet, a coach-maker.</p>
               <p>Where did he tell you he was to be taken up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where did the horses drive him to? - To Uxbridge, I think it is so entered in my book; I have the book here; it is my entry; here is the whole account while he was at our house; and here is the bill.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Silvester reads.) A chaise to Barnet? - Yes, he had that before; he had a chaise to Barnet before from the same coachmaker.</p>
               <p>Who drove him to Barnet? - I cannot recollect; I believe it was the same boy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you keep carriages yourself at the Saracen's head? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Do you let them occasionally for a fortnight, three weeks, or a month to job? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any to let at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that if a customer of yours had wanted a job carriage of yours, you could have supplied him? - Yes, I shewed mine to the gentleman, but it was not good enough; I went with him to Mr. Lycet's because ours was not good enough.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him when he hired the second chaise? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to look at any chaise? - I went with him two or three times at the first.</p>
               <p>Do you remember going with the prisoner to look at a chaise to see what it was worth? - No, I do not recollect his asking me to go at all.</p>
               <p>You did go there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember telling the prisoner afterwards that you thought fifty pounds was not a great deal too much for it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300028"/> that he might venture to give it for a carriage that was pointed out? - I do not recollect it, he might ask me some questions upon that head; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect such questions or not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Are you confident he did not? - No, I am not confident he did not; I have no knowledge of any such thing happening.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to the prisoner that night you looked at the carriage, and did not you tell him it would not be dear at fifty pounds? - That was the former carriage, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him after having looked at a carriage? - I never, Sir, passed my sentiments on the value of it; no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with him to Mr. Lycet's to look at a carriage, a post-chaise, and did not you tell him it would not be dear at fifty pounds? - I cannot charge my memory that I said so; I do not recollect that I gave him any answer; I certainly never put any charge or value upon it; I never heard any talk of buying a carriage.</p>
               <p>You did not offer Lycett fifty pounds? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a direction pinned into this book on a slip of paper, who gave you that direction? - In that first account when he had a chaise to go to Barnet he borrowed two guineas of me in addition to his bill, and I begged he would write his name in the book, as I did not know him but by his discourse; and he wrote his name in that place where it is scratched out.</p>
               <p>Who wrote this direction? - I wrote it; he paid me six guineas.</p>
               <p>Who told you this direction you have written here? - He wrote only J. G. Harrold.</p>
               <p>Who told you to add the other? - I believe by the communication and talk with this gentleman that he was an esquire, and came from the Hague in Holland; I unstood him many times that that was his title and that he came from there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How often did you go to the coachmaker's? - I might go two or three times.</p>
               <p>Did not the first chaise come to your house to take me up? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect my taking you to look at a chaise which I told you I had some idea of buying, and shewed you a chaise before Mr. Lycett? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went with me for that purpose, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not I ask you if you thought the chaise dear? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did I ask you that question? - Perhaps you might ask me.</p>
               <p>Did not you go for the purpose of giving your opinion upon that chaise? - No, Sir, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, this is our case.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Semple, now is the time for you to make your defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, before he is called upon for his defence to the facts, I think it my duty to state to your Lordships, some observations upon the law of this case; upon which I shall take the liberty to submit to the Court, that he ought not to be called upon for his defence; because, in point of law the facts supposed to be proved against him, taking them all to be true, do not come within the cases that have been decided to be felony: the leading case on this subject is the case of Aickles; that is the last decision on the subject, and if I can distinguish this from that case, and antecedently from all those that case has noticed; then I trust you will be of my opinion. The old question was, whether, where a party who gave his property out of his possession, parted with it voluntarily out of his possession, into the possession of another, and that property was converted to the use of the person to whom it was so given, whether that could be a felony; and cases arose, that induced the Court and Jury to believe, that the possession was obtained merely colourably, that it was obtained with a felonious intent; therefore these cases were referred to the Jury; I resort to Aickles's case, because it seems the strongest;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300029"/> your Lordship knows the old case of a man that hired a horse to go to Surry, he did not go there, he instantly sold the horse, that was left to the Jury, it was a felony; for they were of opinion, that he got the possession of it with that intent; Aickles's case, you know, goes one step further; the note in that case, charged to be stolen by the defendant, had been put into his hands for the purpose of discounting it, it was to be paid over to the prosecutor, and out of which the defendant was to have his share, he carried it away with the leave of the proprietor, he never discounted it, but carried it to his own house. In all these cases the party never had the legal possession of the thing that was delivered to him, but upon an express contract which he broke; I take the liberty of saying, that this case is by no means like it; in this case he does it upon a contract that is by no means proved to be broken, it was in his option to compleat it or not, taking it in the strongest case; he hired the chaise for three weeks or a month, not to go to any definite place, not to perform any definite journey; the witness has loosely said, he understood he was going round the north, but that was no part of the contract; he was to pay a stipulated sum, then there was a time during which he had an entire possession of this, and during which he was to have the entire dominion of it, and he must have been answerable for damages, if any had arisen during that period. I am now puting out of the case, that which I dare say your Lordship expects me to say a word or two about; that is the idea of buying it at fifty-two guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. That contract is not proved, the witness has denied that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I say that having the possion of this for three weeks or a month, he has not broke his contract, taking that contract to be so; if this party originally when he had taken possession of the property, had an honest intention to restore it, and afterwards had adopted a felonious intention, however his necessities afterwards, or his dishonesty might stimulate him to adopt a felonious intention, and he converts it to his own use, it will not be a felony; because, he must at the time he got possession of it from the proprietor have the felonious intent; he was for three weeks as much the owner of it as your Lordship is of your coach that you came here in to day; then I admit that one day before the end of the month, his necessities, or his bad mind, drove him to commit a felony; I say, he got this first honestly, and afterwards adapted it to this dishonest idea, and converted it to his own use; I do not desire in this case to go beyond bounds, what the witness took to be the contract, was the hiring for three weeks or a month, but he has admitted that there was a conversation about the price.</p>
               <p>Court. I think I should stop you in this part of the case, for this clear reason, you are now stating it to be a question, whether the witness has or has not proved a different contract, that is a question which the Jury, and not I, must decide; I give you my opinion that supposing they are of opinion that the witness has proved a sale of the chaise, I shall certainly direct them that in point of law it is no felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. One little step further, if you state to the Jury that if the witness has proved that it was a contract with an alternative, either to pay fifty-two guineas or return it.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall leave it to the Jury what the contract was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And that if they are satisfied that there is an alternative, there is no felony; but you see in this stage not having the honour of knowing your Lordship's opinion, if you agree with me; that if the contract was in the alternative; I hire this chaise, I pay you five shillings a day for three weeks or a month; I feel some difficulty in arguing it beyond the stating it; your Lordship sees, supposing a case to stand this way, for I really find it difficult to amplify at all on that position; A. B. goes to a coachmaker's and hires a chaise for three weeks or a month, and suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300030"/> he says, it is a pretty good chaise, if I should like to buy it whereabouts will be the price? and the owner says, the price will be fifty-two guineas; suppose A shall say, I will see about it when I return; the party who gets it has an opinion to do one of the two things; in that case I do not know how to argue about it, than merely to state the position; the man has the thing; if he pays the money it is his own; if he keeps it and does not return it, then it is the subject of a civil action.</p>
               <p>Court. You are asking the Court to give an opinion on a case that is not before them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I put it thus, that there was conversation on the subject; but I shall take the liberty in two or three words to bring back my first position to your Lordship's recollection; I say, that in all cases that have been recited, there has been no intermediate time; here there is manifestly three weeks or a month, during which time no felonious intent is proved to operate; therefore as I am sure your Lordships will not make a new case, I doubt not but you will save the defendant the trouble of stating his defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agar. I am of counsel also for the defendant, and I shall take the case in the strongest point of light in which it can be viewed, and I think this to be one of the most extraordinary efforts to convert the subject of an action at Westminster-hall into an indictment at the Old Bailey that ever was attempted; my Lords, the doctrine contended for, goes to the most dangerous extent, for it lays down this position, that if a man hires or agrees for a commodity, and keeps it one moment beyond the time stipulated, he may be indicted for a felony; it lays down this monstrous position, beyond the time stipulated; the same doctrine will hold as if a year! the law can make no discrimination with respect to the time; my Lords, I submit that the utmost that can be proved against my client is, that he has kept the subject he has contracted for beyond the time understood by the parties for which the contract was made; that is the strongest case, and I contend that no case goes yet to prove that position; that where any person has been guilty or has been supposed to be guilty of that fact, that it is felony; my Lords, I would ask the learned counsel for the prosecution, whether Mr. Lycett could not now commence an action in Westminster-hall, against the gentleman at the bar, and recover the price of the chaise from the time of the hiring to this time? I would ask whether he has not that adequate remedy in a civil action which is the properest for him to have recourse to? with respect to these cases that have been cited of constructive felonies, (but which I should be far from subscribing,) the evidence in those cases have uniformly proved it out of the power of the party hiring, to restore the property in the same situation; in the case of the horse, which is the most analagous, it is materially different, for having once sold it, it was impossible to restore it; now with respect to the present case, it has not been proved that my client has not now the chaise in his possession, and before he was taken up had not used it according to the terms of contract; and therefore without taking up any more of your Lordship's time, I should humbly presume, that such an indictment as the present cannot be maintained.</p>
               <p>Court. You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Silvester, I believe the Court has no doubt, I am clearly of opinion that the Court is bound by the determinations in former cases, and supposing the Jury to be of opinion that the hiring was, as stated by Mr. Lycett, in his first account of the transaction, and that that hiring was originally made with the felonious intention of getting this property into his possession; I say, supposing the Jury should be of that opinion; I can see no difference between this case and that case of the King and Pares; it has been argued, that it would be extremely dangerous to hire any thing if this doctrine was to prevail; but if the party antecedent to any prosecution returned the property, that would be decisive evidence, that there was no felonious intention; and even if he did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300031"/> return it; still the question is open to the Jury, under all the circumstances, whether the hiring was merely colourable, or whether the possession was originally acquired with a felonious intention: if there was a bona fide hiring, the keeping it beyond that time, will not constitute a felony; on the other hand, if the Jury should in the result be of opinion, that there never was a bona fide hiring, but that the prisoner made use of the pretext of hiring fraudulently to obtain the property of another man to his own use, there it is a felony: and I think by the cases that have been lately decided, both of the King and Pares, and the others that have been decided on the authority of that case, the law is now settled; and I have not subtlety enough to distinguish this case from those.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I am entirely of the same opinion, and that it must depend on the decision of the Jury, whether there ever was a bona fide hiring or not: that case has been alluded to of Pares; I happened to be one of the Judges that heard that case a good deal debated, in the time of my Lord Chief Justice De Grey, (at his house I think it was) and the unanimous opinion of the Judges was, at last, that the direction that was given to the Jury by the learned Judge who tried the prisoner, was perfectly right, and that if the Jury were satisfied and convinced, from the circumstances in evidence, that he went with a guilty mind to obtain the horse, for there was the great argument, why the horse was delivered to him, he did not in truth and in reality, strictly speaking, divest the owner either of his property, or his possession; but that does not take the decision from the Jury, for it is for them to consider, whether they are satisfied that the contract was meant fairly, or whether it was a colourable thing for the obtaining the horse: the last gentleman, Mr. Agar, observes a difference between this and Pares's case; the supposed colourable hiring was to be determined in a day; he was to ride this horse on an expedition into Surrey, and to return the same day, the distance not being such as to prevent it; where is the distinction, if the fraudulent intention is the same, as to the time, if he had hired it for two days, or a week; obtaining the possession with the same fraudulent view and design, the law must be the same: the guilty mind is the same, that which is the foundation and constitution of all felonies is the same in the one case or the other; Mr. Agar distinguishes this from the case of Pares, for he was proved to have sold it, to have disposed of the horse; whereas in this case the prisoner is not proved to have sold this chaise; there is no proof of that kind; Mr. Recorder has said very truly, that if at a distance of time he had kept it, and supposing he had staid out six weeks or two months, and when he came back, he had offered to have returned the chaise again, certainly that would have been an evidence of an honest intention at the first, that would immediately turn the intention of a fraudulent design; but in this case a man hires a chaise for a month, take it at the utmost, and a year passes, very near a year, eleven months, and the man is not heard of, nor is the chaise heard of, when he is at last taken, and is under the charge of stealing this chaise, is the chaise forth-coming? does any one know where it is now? therefore that in my apprehension will be for the contemplation of the Jury, whether this man has not disposed of the chaise, and converted it to his own use; and therefore that will lead you back to the time of obtaining it, whether he did not obtain it with intention to steal it; therefore it is for the consideration of the Jury, whether this is not equivalent to that, that the prisoner at the bar has disposed of and converted it to his own use; then you are carried back to the instant of time that he obtained possession of it, whether it was not done with that intention; if that is the opinion of the Jury, this is a case that falls directly within the case of Pares: there is a case in Keeling, where a person took a lodging in the house, and afterwards, while the people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300032"/> were at prayers, robbed them; the charge was for a burglary, the Court held this, that obtaining possession by fraud was a burglary; another case, a man ordered a pair of silver candlesticks, when they were brought he sent the man back for something else; the Court held it was a felony, though in that case the delivery was in expectation of being paid money for it, and there was a colourable sale, and a bill of parcels left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. They were taken from the bar of a coffee-house, I remember it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Now, Mr. Semple, if you have any matter to state to the Jury you may state it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to Mr. Lycett's and hired a chaise, and paid him; I mentioned, that I wanted to purchase one before I returned to the continent; he shewed me one at fifty guineas or thereabouts; it was not finished; I told him, I would shew it to somebody; I got Mr. Bolton to give his opinion of it, which he did, and said, it would not be dear; I told Bolton afterwards I had fixed for the chaise, and desired him to send horses; the chaise was sent for and brought; at that time Lycett asked me about how soon I thought I could pay him, I told him in a year, and not sooner; he then asked me for some few guineas to pay the expences of fitting up; I asked him how much would do, and he said, five or six guineas; I gave him a ten pounds note in his own shop; I was at his house after the chaise was away; here are witnesses that will prove some facts.</p>

               <p>Mr. Agar. Do you recollect seeing the prosecutor at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a conversation he had with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the subject of that conversation? - He came to my house to enquire after the Major; the Major lodged at my house; it was the latter end of September, or some time in September; he asked me for the Major.</p>
               <p>Court. What Major? - Major Harrold; I told him, I did not know where he was, for the Major left my lodgings which he has not paid me for, nor I do not know when he will; we went into the parlour, he told me the Major had a carriage of him; that he had not paid him for it; he said, the carriage was fifty-two guineas; he said, as I understood it, that the Major was to have it upon trial for some time; and if he approved of it, the price was fifty-two guineas; if not he was to pay him so much per day or week.</p>
               <p>Court. Is Mr. Lycett in Court? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Stand by, and attend to what this man says.</p>
               <p>Did he mention his intention of suing out a writ against him, what more did he say? - I could not give him any information where he was, and therefore nothing more could be done in the business; I told him, if I found out where he was, I certainly would let him know; I saw the Major in town; I waited upon him for my money; I called on Mr. Lycett, and told him the Major was in town, but when I came to look for him he was gone from that lodging.</p>
               <p>What did Mr. Lycett say? - He said, he would be much obliged to me for the information if I could give him any.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Lycett say any thing respecting what he meant to do? - If he could have found him he would have a writ for him.</p>
               <p>Did he say so? - Yes, Sir, that it was his intention to arrest him.</p>
               <p>When was this? - I cannot justly say to the time; I did not take any particular notice of the time; Mr. Lycett may have the letter which has the day of the month and year.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that Lycett said he had a carriage of him? - He told me he had had a carriage of him, for which he was to pay him fifty-two guineas, if he approved of it; if he did not approve of it I imagine he was to pay him so much per day or week.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing respecting wronging him? - I sent him word he was in town; he said, he would be glad to find<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300033"/> him; I told him where the lodging was; he went I believe to the publick house and waited for him; he told me he did; but whether he did or no I cannot say; he went to find out where the Major was, that he might have a writ for him to arrest him.</p>
               <p>He said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where do you live, Mr. Sadgrove? - At Knightsbridge; the gentleman lodged with me; I never received a halfpenny from him or any other person; there was a lawyer came with his father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Ask him if that was me? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Agar? - No; somebody came with the Major's father, I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>You was not anxious to imprison the defendant? - My sum would not do it.</p>
               <p>Then Lycett told you this man had a carriage of his which he valued at fifty-two guineas, how long was he to hire it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you understand him that he had purchased it or hired it? - I understood he was to have it upon liking, and if he liked it, he was to keep it, and if not, he was to pay him so much per day or week; I have not received a halfpenny from any body upon my oath.</p>
               <p>As to your part, yours was so much of a debt that you did not attempt to indict him? - I did, I went to Hick's-hall.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Was you advised by anybody to indict me? - Mr. Feltham's brother, I think he told me he was his brother or his brother-in-law; he came and fetched me to go to Hick's-hall; when I came they told me mine was a debt, which I knew before.</p>
               <p>Court to Lycett. This man says, that you told him that the prisoner had had a carriage of you, and had not paid him for it, that the price was fifty-two guineas, if he approved of it, if not, he was to pay you so much per day or week; is that true, did you say so to Sadgrove? - No, my Lord, I told him that he had hired a carriage of me; I believe I might mention that he had intimated as much, and asked the price of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell him it was agreed that he should have it for fifty-two guineas? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You are sure you never told him so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - I do.</p>
               <p>Was the truth so, was that the agreement between you and the prisoner? - He never had it for a bargained price, nor he never had it at his option, nor I never told Sadgrove so.</p>

             states to you that he is a coach-maker in White-chapel, and also lets out carriages for hire, &amp;c. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added) Gentlemen, the prisoner is indicted for feloniously stealing and carrying away this chaise; that he took the chaise, that he had the chaise delivered to him by Lycett, and that it has not been returned to Lycett, is clear beyond a doubt; so far the facts are not disputed: the defence of the prisoner is, that though he had the chaise delivered to him, yet it being delivered to him by the owner of that chaise, and the property being transferred to him by the owner by sale; it was entrusted to him, and can only be converted into a debt for the chaise: if the fact was so, it would be a good defence in point of law; it may be dishonest from the probability of never being able to pay, if they had obtained a bona fide sale from the party to whom the property belongs; but it certainly is not a felony; for it would be of dangerous consequence if there could be any doubt about that law; but it is very clear in many cases, that though the actual manual property may be in the owner, yet in several cases it may be construed to a felonious taking in the party. The question for your decision upon this will be the intention of the parties, the prosecutor and the prisoner, at the time that the actual corporal possession of the chaise in question passed from one to the other; for it seems to me it is upon that, that the law of this case must depend; if it was understood between the parties, that the one was to become the purchaser, and the other the seller, though the chaise was carried off and never paid for, though the consideration was never paid, there is no pretence to call it a felony; and if you can be of opinion, from the circumstances proved today, that that was really the case, you will have no difficulty in acquitting the prisoner: on the other hand, if you believe what is said by the prosecutor, that the prisoner hired the chaise for a limited time, and carried it off altogether, and that although the prisoner has heard in the course of this trial, and though his counsel knew before-hand, that it would be very material to account for this chaise, yet it is not accounted for at the distance of a twelvemonth! that is strong evidence for you to presume that the prisoner converted and disposed of this chaise in some way or other to his own use. The charge then of the prosecutor is, that hiring this chaise for a limited time by the prisoner, and his converting it to his own use instead of returning it. Now if there was a bona fide hiring on the part of the prisoner at the time, if he really took the chaise with intention of returning it, and of paying for it at so much a week, or for the purpose of paying for it in a limited time; though afterwards he by necessity, or from a wicked disposition, had converted it to his own use, yet still that conversion would not be a felony; because by the bona fide contract at the time of delivery, and by the delivery by the rightful owner, he would have acquired lawful possession of the thing; and therefore though afterwards he abused that trust and that possession, it would not be a felonious taking in the first instance: but if you are of opinion that the hiring was only a pretence made use of to induce the owner of the chaise to part with the possession, and without any intention ever to restore it, or pay for it; in that case the owner never does part with the possession; for he has agreed to let the prisoner a qualified use in the thing, under a certain sum to be paid for it, and the prisoner having no intention to make use of that qualified possession, cannot by that means obtain it. If therefore you are of opinion that the prisoner bought the chaise from Mr. Lycett, though he has never paid for it, and has acted fraudulently and improperly, if you think that he actually bought it, and there is an actual sale, and an actual agreement, and that Mr. Lycett trusted him with the chaise, and so parted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300035"/> with the possession of it, you will acquit the prisoner; if you are of opinion that such was the intention of both parties at the time, though he might afterwards make a fraudulent use of it, it is not a felony: but if you believe Mr. Lycett's evidence, and think the hiring was only a colour to obtain possession of the chaise with a fraudulent intention to convert it to his own use, and not to return it to the owner, in that case I do not hesitate to tell you to find the prisoner guilty; because I do it in the presence of one of the most respectable authorities in the law, who will correct my opinion if it happens to be erroneous: if you are of opinion that the hiring was never intended as a bona fide hiring, in that case the prisoner is guilty in point of law: You will ultimately decide the question upon the evidence that has been laid before you, which it is your particular province to judge of, and upon which I shall not give you any direction, you are the proper judges of the evidence, and according to the opinion you shall form upon the facts as I have stated them to you, you will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty, according to the circumstances of the case.</p>

            , otherwise Harrold, otherwise Kennedy, you stand convicted of felony, what have you to say why this Court should not give you judgement to die according to law?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, before the prisoner is called upon to answer that question, your Lordship knows that the scope of my duty can be very small indeed, and I dare say that you expect I can be addressing the Court for no other purpose than that of arresting the judgment: I think it my duty to inform your Lordship that I am not going to make any such motion: I am only going to ask a favour of the Court: and my humble application is only this, that the judgement against the prisoner may be respited till the next session. My Lord, with all humility to, and with all satisfaction at the very solemn deliberate judgment which was delivered on this cause, I beg leave to point out some small circumstances, which, though possibly in my own judgment they could not vary at all this from the other cases, still as this case has struck some persons, and as the prisoner is extremely anxious, as no failure of justice can happen, I am sure the Court will forgive me for saying a word: The case against the prisoner is, that the Jury have found that he possessed himself of the chattel mentioned in the indictment with a felonious intent: I am at a loss after that finding to state any thing on the subject, but this observation has occurred, that in every other case of this kind there has been a palpable, clear and explicit evidence before the Jury, of which no man could doubt, that the felonious intention had possession of the man's mind at the moment he obtained the property of the prosecutor; for unless they found that at no one period from the moment of his obtaining the possession he had his mind free from the felonious impulse, they certainly could not find him guilty; for if this man got the possession honestly, and with a fair intent, and if he afterwards adopted a felonious one, then it would not be a felony: In all the other cases, as in the case of the horse, there was a palpable piece of evidence to go to the Jury, that he must in the nature of the transaction have got it for the purpose of stealing it, and therefore there could be no doubt on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300036"/> the subject. In the case of Aickles, (which I never like to travel beyond) the instant he got possession of the note, he did not do one act towards discounting it for the proprietor, but he instantly converted it to his own use; but here unquestionably there is a certain period in which the defendant might have had an honest intention: My Lord, I sit down after assuring your Lordship that I just mention this at the earnest entreaty of others, not from my own judgement, and I take the liberty to intreat that sentence may be respited until the next session, not to take the opinion of all the Judges, but at the earnest request of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Agar. My Lord, I beg pardon for troubling the Court with a very few words in addition to Mr. Garrow: In all those cases that have been cited there has been some direct, positive, absolute conversion of the property to the use of the person: now the direct and positive evidence of conversion in the present case as far as any positive evidence goes, only proves a fact which, prima facie, is strictly legal and just, namely the hiring and taking a post chaise, therefore the only ground on which a criminal intention may be presumed is the not returning the chaise; now I apprehend the Jury cannot infer a felony from such a circumstance, and no felonies have yet been so inferred, for that would be to make the Jury arbitrary in every respect, and they might by extending that power infer a different crime, the crime of murder or any other: My Lord, the next ground of observation that strikes me is this; this is a crime which is specifically ascertained by the legislature, and in the statute of the 30th of Geo. the 2d, against the fraudulent obtaining possession of goods, the legislature certainly had this particular specific crime in view; the crime which has been proved against the prisoner at the bar is precisely and specifically the crime provided for by the statute of the 30th of Geo. the 2d; being so provided for, I apprehend it cannot now be construed to be a felony: There will in future exist no such crime as that of fraud; for this doctrine, the doctrine contained in this case, I will assert goes the full length of this position, the abolishing of all frauds and converting them into felonies. I therefore humbly hope that sentence shall be respited by this honourable Court till the next session.</p>
               <p>Court. This wears a shape, if one can put it into any regular shape at all, it seems to wear the shape of an application to the discretion of the Court, for it neither wears the shape of a motion for an arrest of judgment, nor can it wear the shape of a motion for revision of the verdict of the Jury. Every judicial decision must be governed by fixed rules, and some reason must be found to induce the Court to comply with the motion, and to prove that some end may be answered, which may account for that compliance: Now by the mere abstaining to pronounce sentence, no end could be answered at all, because between this session and the next, there is no mode in which the case of the prisoner could undergo any revision, or reconsideration; if the motion therefore means any thing, it means in indirect terms to call on the Court to reconsider the opinion they have pronounced in point of law, and to call in further advice, to which in cases of doubt we have the opportunity of resorting, which is the opinion of the twelve Judges. With respect to the case of the prisoner now at the bar, although no case has come within my knowledge which has appeared to me more free from legal difficulties, taking in all former cases; yet I feel peculiar satisfaction in recollecting that I tried the prisoner in the presence of one of the most learned and experienced judges, and best lawyers in this kingdom, a man deeply read in the law himself, and most intimately acquainted with all the decisions of the Judges; I say, it gives me much satisfaction to my mind that he was present; though if I had been unfortunately deprived of that assistance, and that sanction, I should have felt no hesitation in my own mind; but I had his private assurance before we closed that case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300037"/> that he had no doubts on the subject. The objections that have now been taken, seem rather to arraign the judgment of the Jury, for it is perfectly in the recollection of the Court, and of every person that attended to the trial, that the question, whether there was originally a bona fide hiring, or whether there was a felonious intent at the first in the prisoner, was wholly left to the Jury; then it may be doubted whether the Jury have formed a right judgment. In this, or in any other case, if there is reason to believe that the Jury have formed an improper judgment, on a question which they were competent to decide, the only redress is by application to the sovereign, to do away the effect of such a verdict; for the circumstance of a motion for a new trial is I believe without a precedent; however I think it justice to the Jury to declare, that I was most perfectly satisfied with their decision on the question, for the weight of evidence was powerful indeed, from all the circumstances of the case, that there never was at any moment an intention in the prisoner to restore that chaise to the owner; for it rested with the prisoner who has been in custody a considerable time, to have shewn any one period in which he had made a lawful use of that chaise; and at the distance of a twelvemonth he did not offer any particle of evidence, to shew that there ever was a moment in which he made use of that hired chaise, and in which it might be presumed he had an intention to return it; or to draw the least line in order to enable the Jury to judge whether he ever had any intention but a felonious one. The ingenuity of man is not sufficient to distinguish this case from those that have been repeatedly decided: it is sufficient to say, that all the objections that have now been mentioned, arising from the act of parliament for obtaining goods or money under false pretences, and the difficulty of drawing the distinction between frauds and felonies; all those general arguments have been fully considered by the Judges, in the decisions that they have lately made, and in justice to those decisions it is but right to add, that there are former decisions which go nearly as far: what my opinion would be if the law was not completely settled, it is not necessary to say: I can see no distinction, and that learned Judge whom I have mentioned could see no difference; therefore we considered ourselves bound by those decisions; and it would not be treating the Judges with respect, unless we could state some ground for a possible distinction. I am therefore satisfied, that no good judicial purpose could follow, by postponing the sentence. There has been one ground that has been stated, which I reserve for the last, and I mention it least it should at all mislead bystanders; for I think one of the positions laid down by the Counsel dangerous to men of the prisoner's description; because, when they adopt dishonest intentions they may be too apt to weigh, how far they may go consistent with the law, in what they may be secure, and what evidence will be necessary to convict them. The position I mean is this, that the Jury cannot presume a felony from such a circumstance as that of not returning the chaise, and that no felonies have yet been so inferred: I take the law to be directly and flatly the contrary, and in nineteen cases out of twenty the verdict is found upon presumptive and not upon positive evidence; and the highest crimes, not excepting murder itself, are perhaps of all others the most frequently convicted upon circumstantial and presumptive evidence only; for a chain of evidence that hangs well together, carries a much stronger conviction to the mind, than the positive testimony of a witness, of perhaps doubtful character; therefore felonies, even of the highest nature, are every day inferred from circumstances that go to the fact of the case I think it my indispensable duty to pronounce upon the prisoner, that sentence which the Court is of opinion his case justly merits; and if he has any hopes to mitigate that sentence, that application must be elsewhere: I am far from wishing to be understood as recommending that application, or as entertaining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300038"/> the least idea of its success. It now becomes my duty to pronounce on you the sentence that ought to follow on the verdict of the Jury: you have been convicted upon evidence -</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I only beg to observe, I believe it will be in my power to prove the prosecutor perjured; I have already one affidavit to that purpose; I have an affidavit of one witness, with whom Mr. Lycett has had a conversation concerning the sale of the carriage.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court have no power to revise the verdict of the Jury; we are not competent or impowered by the constitution, to enquire into any fact subsequent to that verdict: Your proofs must be laid before your sovereign, for his mercy. Your peculiar situation is very different from that of those unfortunate wretches who generally appear at that bar: A man in superior rank of life, who has had the education which you appear, both from your demeanor and the circumstances of your case to have received; and a man who enjoyed the advantages of associating with persons of rank and character through many years of your life; these, far from being circumstances of mitigation, I consider as great aggravations! When men, in the rank of gentlemen, possessing the means of education, and the benefits of society, which you have possessed, are led either by profligacy of manners, or a depraved mind, to throw away all those advantages, and to put themselves on the level of common offenders; it is fit that they should receive as exemplary a punishment as the law can in such cases inflict. The sentence of the Court upon you is, that you

               <p>Had the man any weapon? - he had a pistol, and as soon as I gave him the money, he went off instantly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the chaise with Mr. Hathaway, when he was stopped; at the distance of about two hundred yards, I perceived a carriage stopped in the road before; at the bottom of the hill; this was nearly the top of the hill; it was about a quarter after seven in the evening; the prisoner came from that carriage; when he came up to the head of my horse, I perceived a very small barrel pistol in his pocket; I quitted the chaise and jumped out on the near side, before he stopped it; I jumped out as soon as ever I perceived the pistol; I had hold of the reins that stopped the chaise; on my jumping out the highwayman insisted on my getting in again.</p>
               <p>Did you get in again? - No, I said, I would not; and he pointed the pistol in this manner to me; and I had taken up some stones; there were plenty in the road; and I told him if he did not take away his pistol, I would throw stones at him; he had a large silk handkerchief; Mr. Hathaway remained in the chaise, and attempted to reach the reins; in the mean time he demanded his money, and robbed him; I heard him demand his money, with the expression of come d - n me your money; he then insisted on having my watch and money; the coach was behind, in which my wife and Mr. Hathaway's wife were; I tossed a guinea across the horse, which sell on his hand; it fell to the ground; he says, d - n me Sir, what do you throw it on the stones for? I insist on your picking it up; he did not pick it up nor I; he then rode to the coach, which I suppose was one hundred and fifty yards distance from us; he told me I might pick up the lousy guinea myself; he then robbed the coach; I followed him towards the coach; when he turned round and saw me following him, he shook his pistol at me, and he says,</p>
               <p>"come on, come on, d - n</p>
               <p>"me, come on, I am double armed by</p>
               <p>"God;" this transaction took up about five minutes; he rode down the lane and returned to pick up the money that was dropped in the coach; that was a quarter past seven; it was full day-light; there was a silk handkerchief round his neck, and sometimes it was reached up to his mouth but no higher; it was once or so off.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity during this time of observing the man's person so as to know him again? - I had as much opportunity as I have of seeing your Lordship; I have every reason to believe the prisoner at the bar to be the man; yet I do not swear to him positively.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you saw him? - It was eight or nine days.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, my Lord; I believe I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Where? - At Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before so as to know his person? - No; it occurred to me then that I had seen him before; I saw him seven or eight days after; he was then in custody at Bow-street; I was more flurried and discomposed when I saw him at Bow-street, than when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300044"/>Did you know him immediately? - Yes, I said then, and swore, that I really believed and suspected him to be the person that committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Now from what you have seen of him now, and since, and the time of the robbery, can you say whether it is the man who robbed Mr. Hathaway or not? - I would not wish to be positive to any part of the time.</p>
               <p>I do not wish you should be more positive than the conviction of your own mind enables you? - It was with reluctance I agreed to the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. Probably so; but however, though it is a painful duty, it is a duty to prosecute offenders, and to give full evidence upon that trial, but to be sure in that situation a man cannot be too cautious not to go beyond his certain knowledge; therefore the question to you is, whether you are perfectly satisfied in your own mind that he is the man? - I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt at all of it? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Who were in the coach? - Mrs. Hathaway, Mrs. Wheatley, Mrs. Hathaway's nurse, one Mr. Mason, and two young ladies; the coachman was brought to Bow-street, but they said, his evidence was not material.</p>
               <p>Why were not the parties that were in the coach brought here? - They never attended any time.</p>
               <p>Court. Their knowledge might be material one way or the other; they might be able to say one way or the other, they certainly ought to have attended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, there was a coachman that was present at the examination, he took upon himself to say, I was not the man, and Mr. Hathaway likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wheatley. The coachman could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. As you went afterwards to the coach where the ladies where, certainly you had an opportunity of seeing his face? - The same Sir, that I have of you now, for afterwards returning from the lane, he got off from his horse, and turned back and spoke as he got on the horse directly, and said, d - n me I will mark you.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Wheatley had given information of the robbery, and said, that Shepherd was the man that robbed him -</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Wheatley. How is this? - Coming home, we stopped at Shepherd's-bush, and whilst we were there the patrol came, and I only described the man to the patrol, and they said, they supposed it to be Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. In consequence of this information I looked out for Shepherd.</p>
               <p>How long after did you see the prisoner? - I think it was on the 8th of August; that was a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Where did you take him? - In St. Martin's-lane, in a public house.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what he was charged with? - Yes, he denied all knowledge of the robbery; I searched him; there was nothing upon him that answered to any part of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Did you find any pistols upon him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Wheatley. Was there any thing lost but money by any of the parties? - A locket, but it has never been found.</p>

               <p>Court. I could very much have wished that the persons in the coach had attended, for it is right all persons should attend.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. Sir Sampson desired both the gentlemen to enquire of all the parties in the coach, whether they could give any account of the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, my Lord, I am quite innocent of the robbery that is alledged against me.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it necessary that the coachman should have been examined, he is much in my favour.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Wheatley. Have you any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300045"/> particular knowledge of the prisoner by his voice? - No.</p>

               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said, he was the person that stole my great coat, and begged I would let him go; he said, the horse belonged to a timber merchant and wanted me to leave it behind; but I said, they should all go together; I know nothing more; I saw the prisoner at Ryegate; the prisoner said, he had lived with the clergyman of that parish; passing along in a field, he said, he saw some horses, he said, them do not look to be nice horses.</p>

I said I could write my name, not very well; then they asked me to write my name; I did so, and they left the pot of beer, what they did not drink to me; and they went their way; I wrote my name upon a piece of stamp paper, which the farmer had out of his pocket book, and a little brass ink-horn, which he produced and wrote with.</p>

               <p>Court. You wrote your name upon this paper at their desire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you read the paper first? - I did not; they desired me to sign my name, and I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Write your name on that sheet of paper; take your time.</p>

               <p>Was any body present with you and Brown when this happened? - There was a great many people; and there was the waiter a little crumped back man; they call him my Lord; he stopped up stairs a very little bit, when he brought the beer up stairs; their tap-room is down below, and there is some seats up at the door where people sit down; I do not know whether he saw the bargain or not; there were a great many people, but I did not know one from the other; the farmer and this prisoner went off both together the same way; and I staid at the bridge till near twelve o'clock, waiting for Kipping.</p>
               <p>How came Brown to leave you? - He went away with the horse.</p>
               <p>How came the farmer to sell his great coat with the horse? - He said, he was going to walk into the country.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it? - It was a smallish long tailed black horse.</p>
               <p>A goodish saddle and a very good bridle? - I did not notice it particularly.</p>
               <p>What sort of a great coat might it be? - It was a lighter coloured than mine; I did not see it open; it was tied up.</p>
               <p>Did not Brown open it to see his bargain before he paid for it? - He did not open it before me; he bought it all together without looking at it.</p>
               <p>What might the bridle and saddle be worth, think you? - I am not a judge; I did not see the great coat opened.</p>
               <p>Should you know the bridle and saddle again? - I think I should know the coat; I do not know whether I should the bridle and saddle.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew the coat to this man? - (The coat produced.) - This is much the colour; but I am not sure; it was a lighter than mine; I believe this to be the great coat, and it was inside outwards.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnold. That is the coat you found on the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a very good great coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where is the bridle and saddle? - Here is the saddle.</p>
               <p>Court. Colley, look at the saddle? - I think, I am pretty sure it is the same; I remember the marks on here; yes, here are a cypher and letters.</p>
               <p>How came it that the farmer refused ten guineas for the horse alone, and took ten pounds fifteen shillings, for the horse, bridle, saddle, and great coat? - He did not offer the horse alone; he offered the horse, bridle, and saddle.</p>
               <p>You did not say so at first; what may that saddle be worth? - I am not a judge.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnold. What is the saddle worth? - I suppose half a guinea; I do know the value.</p>
               <p>Baldwin. The saddle, stirrups and all, I should suppose to be worth a guinea; the stirrups are plated; the great coat is worth half a guinea at least: the saddle cost two guineas and an half, without the stirrups; I have had it a year and an half; and I gave twenty-five shillings to the best of my recollection for the stirrups.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What would you give for the saddle and stirrups now? - I would give a guinea and an half for it now.</p>
               <p>Court to Colley. Did you find Kipping that day? - No, I did not; I went two or three different times for him, but I did not see him; I sent my little boy to him, and he left word with the other watermen that he should not do me any damage; he said, I owed him thirteen shillings.</p>

               <p>Did he at any time send to you for a pocket book? - He did; here is the letter he sent to me; the prisoner sent for me on the 5th of August; he was in the Poultry-compter; I went to him; he lodged with me at the time; he desired me to go and take the key of his room door, and the key of his box; and to take a green pocket book out of it; and that there was a paper there that his life depended on; accordingly I did so, and carried him the pocket book; and he said, it is very happy I gave him the pocket book; and I came away; before I came away, he took out the paper; I did not read it, nor see him read it; it was about the length and breadth of a receipt; he did not shew me the paper; I should not know it again if I was to see it; that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was present when he sent you for this book? - There were two or three prisoners that were in the same room; he was in a little room; I suppose, I did not stay above ten minutes with him either time; as to swearing to the book or the receipt I cannot; I have only known the prisoner three weeks when this happened; he was always in at ten o'clock; I know nothing of his character.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner lodged with you till he was taken up? - He was taken on the 4th; that was on the Friday; he wrote to me on the 5th; that I believe was on the Saturday; I put down the day of the month because he desired me to take particular notice.</p>
               <p>When did he desire you to put down the day of the month? - The very day that I came to him; he desired me to take notice of the day of the month that I brought his pocket book; he never was out of his lodgings before nor after past ten at night.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to recollect where he was on the Sunday before that? - No, my Lord, not in the course of the day; he was always at home at night; and came home on the Sunday night; I suppose it might he past nine, as high as I can guess; I cannot particularly say to a quarter of an hour; but he was in before ten.</p>
               <p>What house have you? - A house with three rooms at six pounds a year; he rents the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He told me when he came to lodge with me, he was a gentleman's servant, and I having been a gentleman's servant myself; I lived with the Marquis of Rockingham about ten years ago; and at Wimbledon I lived with him seven years; I was footman to my Lady; I went down to Wentworth with him, and to Little Harriden; that was the very time when they left that house on Parson's-green, before they went to Mr. Rush's house at Wimbledon.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnold. How far is Ryegate from Westminster-bridge? - I suppose twenty or twenty-one miles.</p>
               <p>What time on Sunday was it you saw the prisoner at Ryegate? - At a quarter past ten at night; for I supped with him.</p>
               <p>You walked out with him there, and spent the evening with him? - Yes; he left me; and I supposed he was going to the parson's; I had just nearly done supper when he came in; and he eat his supper, as I was eating mine.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Only by seeing him that day.</p>
               <p>Who was with you that day at Ryegate? - Only the people of the house, and the person that supped with me; he was a passenger; I did not know him; I was at the Swan at Ryegate.</p>
               <p>When did you miss your great coat? - On Monday morning the 31st, at five o'clock; I saw no more of the prisoner; he was gone.</p>
               <p>Court to Bruce. Do you still say that he was at home a little after nine on Sunday evening? - I did not say that; I said, on the 5th I had a letter from him.</p>
               <p>I ask you where he was on Sunday? - I never said when he came home on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Was that true or not? - No, my Lord, if I said so, I said wrong.</p>
               <p>How came you to say wrong upon your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300049"/> oath; I asked you where he was expressly on one Sunday, you told me that you did not know what became of him in the day, but that he always came home in good time of a night; you said, he came home on the Sunday evening at a quarter past nine; I asked you ever and over again, if you was sure of that; you said you was? - If I said that my Lord, I said wrong; but what I meant was, that on the 5th I had a letter from him.</p>
               <p>Then you will not say now, what hour he came home on the Sunday night after you have heard that witness; was he ever out before the night before? - Before the night before the 5th, he never I did out of my house; he came home about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that the Sunday before that he came home before ten? - Not the Sunday before I will not; the 4th was the only night that he laid out.</p>
               <p>Then where was he on the night of the 30th? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>If he never was out you can tell he was at home? - He was at home on the night of the 30th; the 30th! oh, I beg your Lordship's pardon; I cannot tell where he was; I believe he was in the Poultry-compter on the 30th.</p>
               <p>I mean the 30th of July? - He was at home that night.</p>
               <p>Was he at home before ten that night? - He was; I do not remember any night of his laying out; but I do not recollect the days of the month; he was not out any night but the night before he sent me the letter.</p>
               <p>You stick to that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was yours? - Between a light and dark horse, about fourteen hands high, about five years old; I set him at fourteen pounds.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I always receive the recommendation of such a respectable Jury with great attention and with great respect, and generally I receive it with satisfaction; but the present case is attended with peculiar circumstances; for the verdict you have found after some consideration, has confirmed the opinion which I clearly entertained before; that the whole of his defence was a wicked scheme by a corrupt perjury; therefore if I carry your recommendation to the King, I wish it may be deliberate, and that you will let me know what reason I shall give his Majesty 
for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The reason why we recommended the man to mercy, we were not quite sure with respect to the receipt.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am patrol and watchman of St. James's, Duke's-place; I had an information on Monday, to the best of my knowledge, the 24th of July, that there was a cow to be brought into the parish; I suspected it was stolen; I watched during the night for this cow, and I gave a signal to this watchman; nobody came; on the Tuesday following, I had information it was to be bullocks; and not a cow; on the Wednesday morning, as near as I can recollect, about a quarter after four comes a man to the watch-house to me; in consequence of which I went round the parish to see, and found nobody on the Wednesday morning; presently there came to the watch-house a constable that was coming round, and said, Stewart, start up, the bullocks are coming; this was a quarter before four; then I run, and I saw them directly, and I saw the prisoners driving two bullocks in Houndsditch; there was two men and a boy; Lee was on the pavement on the right hand side, and Seaton on the left hand side, and Connoway was in the middle; the three prisoners were the people; I never saw them before; I ran up directly and laid hold of Lee, Connoway ran away; he over run me; Seaton was stopped by the constable and another; the other made his escape from us; we gave charge of the bullocks, while we took Lee and Seaton to the compter; as soon as we had delivered the prisoners to the compter we came back and too the bullocks down to Whitechapel-market, to see if any of the butchers knew to whom they belonged; and they were known to belong to Mr. Hill in East-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>What did you with them after that? - We went down and knocked at Mr. Hill's door; he sent up his son to see if they were his, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Seaton. Did you see me driving bullocks? - I saw no other person in the street; at the same time he was on the left hand, and Lee on the right hand, and Connoway in the center; I first saw Lee with the bullocks in Church-row.</p>
               <p>How near was he to the bullocks? - He was standing still; he stood still a very little space; he walked off; he passed me twice; the bullocks were standing still all the while.</p>
               <p>Did you see Seaton at this time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see the boy? - I saw him rest himself, and sit down at the corner of Church-row, when I first saw the bullocks.</p>
               <p>How near the bullocks was he sitting? - He might be fifteen or sixteen yards off; he sat there till about a quarter before four; they all three joined together; I first saw Connaway at half past three, sitting with the bullocks; he sat there till about a quarter before four, then he got up and brought the bullocks out of Church-row; I saw him go to the bullocks and drive them into Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>At that time were any of the other prisoners there? - They were both there then; I did not see Lee come back; I saw the boy get up and drive the bullocks; I did not see Lee nor Seaton at the time the boy sat down; but at the time the boy got up; I did not see Lee at that time.</p>
               <p>At the time the boy got up did you see Lee there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see Seaton there at that time? - I did not; when I saw the boy with the bullocks, I ran back to the other officer, and so lost sight of them for a short time.</p>
               <p>When you first came back again where were the bullocks? - When I came back again the bullocks were going up Houndsditch; Connoway was walking in the middle of the road behind the bullocks; it might be a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners then? - Yes, I saw Lee and Seaton, both of them.</p>
               <p>Where did you see Lee then? - Lee was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300051"/> upon the pavement on the right hand side of the way going up Houndsditch; he was walking the same way with the bullocks; he was behind the bullocks some distance, about twelve or fourteen yards; we stopped them directly.</p>
               <p>Before you stopped them did Lee say any thing or do any thing that shewed whether he was driving the bullocks or not? - Not one single syllable in my hearing.</p>
               <p>What had he in his hand? - Nothing in his hand of a weapon.</p>
               <p>What had the boy in his hand? - I did not see any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>You did not see Lee do any thing then, but walk along the same way the bullocks went, you did not hear him say any thing? - Not any thing; Seaton was on the left hand side of the pavement walking the same way as the bullocks.</p>
               <p>How far from them? - Much about the same distance as Lee was on the other side.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - No, nothing; I neither heard him say any thing, nor saw him do any thing.</p>
               <p>Lee and Seaton did not attempt to run away? - No, the boy did.</p>
               <p>Did you at all see the prisoners speak to one another? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Not at all? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>While you were taking the prisoners to the compter, did Lee and Seaton talk together? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing from which you could discover whether they knew one another? - I could not see any thing; they denied any knowledge of one another.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason from what they said or did, to think otherwise? - I had not.</p>
               <p>How soon after the boy was taken? - In the course of a week after; I am quite sure he was the same boy I saw with the bullocks.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoners were examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear them say any thing about this matter? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Seaton. When he stopped me ask him whether there was not a man ahead? - I saw no other person.</p>

               <p>How far is that from Church-row? - I dare say it is two hundred yards; they were standing there.</p>
               <p>What were they doing at the corner of the Minories? - They were standing leaning against a post, one on one side of the way and the other on the other; they were not together; I saw them do nothing at that time; I went round the parish, and I met Lee in Shoemaker-row; he came directly after me; he went down Houndsditch; I followed him, the bullocks waited in Church-row, and the boy sat down there till the watchmen went off; when the watch went off at four o'clock they all three went into Church-row, and drove the bullocks out.</p>
               <p>Did you see them drive the bullocks out? - Yes; when I came back the boy was standing at the corner of Church-row; I saw him go up to the bullocks, and they came out.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other two prisoners at that time? - Yes, at the corner of Church-row; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Was Stewart there? - No</p>
               <p>Was not Stewart there when the boy drove the bullocks out of Church-row? - No, I did not see him there; I ran and called Stewart, and we both of us came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300052"/> and some of the watchmen; we got a-head of them and came in front of them; they were all three behind the beasts in the middle of the coachway; they were all three together: I had drove Seaton into the pathway; says he, when I laid hold of him, I am not driving the bullocks; the boy ran away, and Lee and Seaton I held fast; they neither of them attempted to run away.</p>
               <p>Did you see them speak together? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any of them speak to the bullocks, or see them do any thing to the bullocks? - No, only Connoway had a stick in his hand, the others had none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Seaton. Ask that man when he stopped me if I was not on the pavement and whether I did not call out, why do not you stop that man a-head? - No, I did not see any other man in the place.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Monday I was in Smithfield-market; a butcher's boy came to me; his name is Joe; and I went with him to the prisoner Seaton's house; it was about twelve; when I came there the prisoner Seaton said he had a cow to sell; I asked him to let me look at it; he said, he could not let me see it, because he had not got it at home; and he promised he would bring it to me on Tuesday morning; I never saw him no more till the Tuesday night, after I was in bed, much about nine; then he came to my house with another young man with him.</p>
               <p>Who was that young man? - I believe it was the prisoner Lee.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was him? - I will not take upon myself to be positive it was him because I had been asleep; and he told me he could not bring a cow, but we will bring you two bullocks in the morning; I told him, if he brought the two beasts in the morning, I would shew him a person that would buy them; on the Wednesday morning they called me up between three and four; they came and called me, one of them.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - It was that young man in the white coat, Seaton; he said, they were coming, where will you take them to; I asked them if they was not afraid that the beasts would be stopped before they got as far as Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Where were they to take them to? - They promised on the Tuesday night they would bring them to me; I told them in Spital-fields I would shew them a man that would buy them; I asked them if they were not afraid of their being stopped before they came there; and they said no, for the man that was with the beasts had a note in his pocket; I went on the Monday night before; after I saw this young man that came, and he promised he would bring me a cow, I went to the watch-house, and it was Levi's night the constable, and gave the information to him.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Levi? - I have known him a great while, ever since I can remember.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give him any information before this? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened you to give him this? - Because I thought they were not honestly come by; I went to the watch-house, I did not know justly that that was his night up-my oath.</p>
               <p>How came this boy to offer the cow to sell to you? - The young man that saw me in Smithfield-market offered it.</p>
               <p>How came they to pitch upon you? - I cannot tell; I went there to see the cow; I do not know.</p>
               <p>Are you used to buy these things? - No, I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Who is that young man? - A butcher that lived in Whitechapel, he asked me if I knew any body that would buy them; I told him yes; when I first went I intended to buy cow.</p>
               <p>How soon did you change your mind? - That night when they did not bring the cow.</p>
               <p>Did you get up and go and tell your friend Mr. Levi that they would bring two bullocks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300053"/>Did not Mr. Levi tell you that two bullocks were twice as good as one cow? - No, he did not tell me any thing but that he would be out in the night; he never mentioned any reward to me, nor I to him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not it settled what share you was to have of this reward? - Upon my oath there never was a word mentioned in my presence about a reward.</p>
               <p>Then without any expectation of a reward you got out of your bed and told Levi?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Seaton. I have two witnesses that this man wanted a guinea not to appear against me; and then he came to ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Is that true? - No, there were two people several times at my house, and I denied myself; I went with Levi to shew him where the bullocks were; I went to the prisoners when they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Seaton. Was you before them or behind them when we were taken? - I believe I was behind them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Now that gentleman swears that there was nobody else by; he owes me a spite because I used to watch at the Custom-house, and he had some stolen tobacco and I watched him to the ale-house.</p>

               <p>Who were they? - I should know them; if I saw them; they were the prisoners Lee and Seaton; they came to ask me if I wanted to buy a cow; I am a butcher, and I was to let them know on Monday; they told me they would pay me for my trouble; I did not know it was stolen; I went back to Smithfield and saw a young fellow at Smithfield, and told him about it; that was Nathan, and I went with him into Rosemary-lane, and I saw the two prisoners up a court close to the Blue Anchor; they said they should bring her up on the Tuesday morning; I know no further about it.</p>
               <p>Dawson. This man was in company with two more at the door whom I could not see when I went out; now they were saying to each other, that this man could say something in evidence that would discharge the three prisoners, or on the other hand could say something that would convict them; at least I heard the other man say, that this man and this had been at the watch-house with Levi the constable and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300054"/> the patrols, and that Levi had observed to the other that there was a premium of forty pounds each for stealing bullocks or sheep.</p>
               <p>Court to Solomons. Is that true? - No, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did any such thing pass as has been now stated? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation with Levi before these men were apprehended? - None at all upon my oath; I never knew a word about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. Was what was said in this man's presence? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with that man that was brought in just now? - No, please you my Lord, none at all.</p>
               <p>Dawson. Prior to the conversation they had, this man told me himself that a man that is in the yard was at the bottom of all this business, and that it was in the power of this man to assist the prisoners or convict them; he told me had employed them to steal the bullocks, and what they were to have for them, and every thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 10th of August the woman prisoner brought a silver watch to our shop in Tothil-street, Westminster, and asked for three shillings on it; I told her that I had no objection to it, provided she would tell me whose it was, for I knew it was not her's; she stood confused for two or three minutes, and then said, she would go and fetch the person who sent her with it.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to the prosecutor; on Thursday the 15th of August the prisoner and two women came into our shop, and asked for some Irish cloth; they laid out one pound one, and eleven pence; there was a quantity of Irish lay on the counter, and the prisoner seemed to have one in his hand longer than I thought he should; I did not see him take it, but I saw him have his hand on a piece of Irish after that they bought the cloth; they paid the money; he took his hand away at the time I saw him; I did not see him take the piece; I saw it lay on the counter afterwards; but after they were gone out, not seeing the cloth I had a suspicion; I immediately ran after him and took him with the piece of cloth in Chiswell-street; he had the cloth in his apron; Mr. Kilham lives in the cloisters, and I immediately ran for him; he was not in the shop at that time; the piece of linen was brought back, it was Mr. Kilham's property; I know the mark of it.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I cannot recollect what he said when he was taken; when he was carried before the Alderman, he said, the apron was laying on the counter, and he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - Not to my knowledge; I did not perceive it.</p>

               <p>Wilson. I did not bring the linen back; I have it not in my possession; I detected the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is the same piece? - By the private mark.</p>
               <p>But you did not look at the mark in the street? - No, but it had some dirt upon it I believe; I cannot say to any particular mark that there is upon it, any farther than that I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into this man's shop, with my wife and another woman; I was not so sober as I should be; we bought seventeen yards of white cloth, and seven yards of other; I took them up; I thought they were mine; if I had any intention to defraud this gentleman, I might have been out of his sight far enough before he took me.</p>

               <p>Court to Wilson. Did the prisoner drop the piece? - I believe he did; I did not see it upon the ground; I did not pick it up.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you seized the prisoner was there any struggle? - The prisoner made a wrench to get from me, and we both fell into the kennel, the other shopman came to my assistance and he took the cloth; the things he bought were all together, and he had that with this stolen parcel; he had both together.</p>
               <p>Were they tied together? - They were not tied; the parcel that he had was tied.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300067"/>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. After I said to him he should have considered his family before he took the cloth, he said these words, that it was either his own foolishness or his folly in taking this cloth, and he deserved to be hanged for it.</p>

               <p>Court. Open the enamels? - I have no knife. (Opens the enamels.) If you take my magnifier and take it at three inches: - here is a piece I have found in the prisoner's possession; I have another piece in my pocket that will match it; that will appear to any gentleman of judgement that that was one piece that flew from the other; this is the small piece which I have in my possession; when the enamel is poured upon a sheet of copper, and not properly cooled it will fly; I reckon myself a bit of a mechanic; and I know what can, or what cannot be done.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is the value of that enamel, of all that you found there? - I value them at ten pounds; some I sell for a guinea, some for ten shillings, some for seven shillings, and some for five shillings per ounce.</p>
               <p>How are these pieces used? - They are ground in an agate mortar, and then they melt it and put it on the gold; by twenty years practice I brought it to bear, to make ruby, and every colour; sometimes I have two guineas an ounce; here are a number of different colours; I dare say here are two hundred ounces in the parcel that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300069"/> I found in his lodgings; I have a cabinet with fourscore drawers in it, and a bureau, and when I came to take his pocket book I found a drawing of this key. (The drawing produced by the officer.) And he took a copy of all my secrets or receipts which were kept in my cabinet, so that he must have been there for a long time, I am very happy to get it again, or else I should have been ruined.</p>
               <p>You was pretty careful of the key? - Yes, I never let my wife have it though she is a gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>(The drawing handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. This is a drawing that any workman might make a key; have you a partner? - Yes, he is concerned in the enamel.</p>
               <p>Are these valuable, or might they be thrown away? - Some I do not put much value upon, that - that is of some value to be sure, which I sell at ten shillings an ounce; it gets red in the fire, like a ruby, and never loses its colour any more; now this is a remarkable thing, it appears to you to be blue, but when it is enamelled it is a fine purple red; it is made from gold, and struck into it in such a manner that when it comes to be put on gold it is a fine purple red; it is worth ten shillings an ounce; that I sell it for to workmen; the prisoner has numbered almost every paper here to correspond with the receipts in the book.</p>
               <p>How long has this man lived with you? - About half a year; he ground the materials, charged the furnace, and poured it out when I knew it to be ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Dovey do not be angry with me because I am only going to say one word to you, and that is, another time when you come into a Court of Justice, do not presume that every man in it means to insult you; I should be very sorry to insult a man of your ingenuity.</p>

               <p>Had there been any discourse about finding it? - None at all, the little man, which I think is Patch, said I will agree to let him have a hundred pounds; I will go to my banker's directly, I hope you will be here when I come back, I will not be long; he was not gone two minutes, and came in, and said his banker was not at home, his banker's clerk was; and he could not have the hundred pounds that night, but he would bring it the next morning at eleven o'clock; I then got up to pay for my pint of beer; my hands were very cold, and I took a canvas bag I had, and shook my money loose in the window; I had five guineas, one half guinea, four half crowns, and a sixpence; I took it out to look for a sixpence, because my hands were numbed; the prisoner, after I gave the waiter the sixpence, came up to me, between me and where my money lay, and asked me to sign my name to a piece of paper in two or three folds folded up, which I suppose was the same piece of paper; the other man had been writing; they were all three in the room; then the waiter went out after I paid him; I wanted to get my money to put into my bag; the man that sat writing, whipped up and shut the door; the prisoner stepped up to me, and asked me to sign my name to the paper, and I refused it; he directly took the pen from the other man, and insisted upon my signing it; he did not explain what the paper was; I did not know what to do; I wrote my name on the paper; I did not know what I wrote it to, nothing was read to me; then I got up to go out; the prisoner says to me, give that man your money that lays in the window; I answered no; he then says go and take it; accordingly the man that I took to be Patch took it; he came behind me, whipped up my box, and this man, and the other man came behind me, keeping me from following them; the man at the bar put his hand upon the back of the man that had the box, and bid him run off with the box; and the prisoner and Patch ran out together, the other man followed; I run to the window and took up my hat, and cried stop thief, but nobody came to my assistance; I lost sight of them; I put the parcel which I had in my hat, in my waistcoat pocket; I went to the Green Man and Still, where I lodge; I went to a friend that I deal with.</p>
               <p>What became of the paper you signed? - They took it with them; when I got to my friends in Carnaby Street, I opened the parcel which was tied in three different knots, and I found this ring.</p>
               <p>Did you give the ring to any body that is here? - No, I went to Justice Bond's at Bow-street, and gave a description, and the prisoner was taken some time after, about three weeks ago Mr. Lucas knows.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300071"/>Did you at any time part with your goods on any occasion, either for a ring or any thing else? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you consent either to their taking the box or the money? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are positive you did not give your box as security for your producing the ring, or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the same man? - I am sure this is the man that pushed out Patch with the box, and bid him run off; I have never seen him before; I was with him a quarter of an hour; he was taken the 22d of July.</p>
               <p>That was four months after; can you undertake to swear positively to the person of a stranger at four months distance of time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You was not willing to lose this purse? - No, Sir; I stooped to pick it up, but a hand interposed.</p>
               <p>When you came into this cold room, where you wanted to warm your hands, where there was no fire, what made you stay? - I staid to drink my beer; I never said a word about his going to his banker's.</p>
               <p>If the hundred pounds had come, you would have received it, would not you? - Yes, I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did this box of your's stand, when the man was writing? - At the door; it stood close by my foot, and Patch far opposite me, the other two men sat opposite me.</p>
               <p>You was not afraid of losing your box? - I was not careful enough at that time.</p>
               <p>I seems the ring was of too much value to bring here? - I do not know the value of the ring.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you to be a very good ring? - I did not understand it.</p>
               <p>What would you have thought it worth? - I thought nothing of it; I carried the ring to Justice Bond, and it was given to a man named Morris.</p>
               <p>But what directions did you give him? - This Morris sent me a letter to come to the office in Bow-street; and I went to attend an appointment from a letter; there was a Mr. Morris; he took us to another house; there was a man that was to produce the property, not the man that took the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Morris got the ring under pretence of getting your laces? - Morris is an attorney's clerk; he said to the man, I will draw up an agreement if you will sign it; we staid till near four o'clock, and the haberdasher persuaded me; accordingly my box was brought in, and I looked over it, and cast it up, and found it thirty pounds deficient, in case my laces were not cut; some of them appear to be cut; when I said there was a piece of nineteen yards wanting, then they brought me in nine pounds worth of lace more; then there wanted twenty pounds; I gave the ring up with that view, to have my property; I was to have received all my property; the paper I signed, was to say nothing about it, provided I got all my property within five pounds; the haberdasher advised me.</p>
               <p>Was Morris acting for you, or for those that had your laces? - He was acting for the rogues.</p>

               <p>Court. If it is subject of criminal enquiry, it must be made out, and there must be a warrant for taking him up? - The haberdasher said, the best way would be for me to employ an attorney; and the attorney came there by the desire of me and the haberdasher; the haberdasher carried me to the attorney, and Morris was his clerk.</p>

               <p>You found at last, you had twenty pounds worth missing? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Taylor; on the night of the robbery, I was in the house when the three men came in.</p>
               <p>Do you know them again? - I know one of them.</p>
               <p>Which is that? - Wood; some time after, one of them went out of the tap room; then after that I went to the door, and I saw three men come out, one of whom had a bundle.</p>
               <p>What did you go out of the door for? - For the air; it was a very hot night; the maid was at the door, and she ran in and came out again in a great hurry, and ran down the court after them into the Strand; when I came up to her she was staggering, and I secured Wood; I am sure he was one of the men that was in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What distance was you from the door in the court when the man came out? - I suppose about three yards, or thereabouts; I had been standing in the court about eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen you mistress go to the cook's-shop? - No, I do not recollect it; I had seen none of the men; I was standing right before the window, with my back to the window.</p>
               <p>Now, if any body else had been standing at the door and talking together do not you think you should have heard it? - I did not hear any body; the girl was standing there at the same time I was.</p>
               <p>How long might she be standing there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did the girl when she ran in tell you what she ran in for? - No, she was on the opposite side of the court by the cook's shop.</p>
               <p>I thought you said she was standing by you? - She stood beside me some time; she did not explain why she stood there; then she went to the opposite side in an instant, I saw three men come out, and the man with the bundle went first.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300075"/>Did they run very hard up the court? No, they did not till they got clear of the door, then they ran pretty smartish; Wood was searched in the watch-house, and a pick-lock key was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you leave the three men in the tap room when you went out? - I left two men in the house.</p>
               <p>Did not you see your mistress come out and go to the cook's shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see your mistress go out before you went into the court? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Jury. How far had the men got from the house before they ran? - I dare say they were over twenty yards before they made any great run; they walked pretty smartly, but did not run.</p>

               <p>I apprehended Lenham; he was very inquisitive to know the business; the next morning taking him up to the Justice's he complained of being hungry and dry, and I gave him some bread and cheese and beer; he asked me if it was Tanner's affair; and here is the arm that was taken off Tanner.</p>
               <p>Sayre. He had a false arm when I took him; I thought it had been a real arm at first.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. Did you see the arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER LENHAM'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They took me out of an alehouse; they said, they wanted me; they kept me in the watch house all night; in the morning the gentleman gave me a pennyworth of beer and an halfpenny roll; I asked Blacketer, he said, if I tell you, it must be a secret, it is about Tanner and Wood's affair; the maid said, at the office, if I was the person I had a brown coat on, with white metal buttons; I know nothing of the affair; I do not know the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER TANNER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>They took me to Bow-street; and the woman, the maid, and the man too said, they did not know me, then I was taken to Justice Hyde's, and they said so there; I pulled off my arm, and then the woman said, she believed I was the person by my arm; the woman would swear to any man with one arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. What is the value of the things that are lost? - I suppose not less than fifty pounds; they did not leave me a second thing.</p>

            ; I lost a quantity of callico from my bleaching grounds; on the 2d of June, at five in the morning, I went down the field as I generally do, and ordered up those goods that I wanted up first; I missed one of the pieces, in consequence of missing it, I enquired of my people;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300076"/> three weeks after I lost three pieces more, and I applied to the public office; on losing the three pieces, I advertised the prisoner on this occasion; two or three days after I missed the first piece, I had occasion to take some of my women to go to the hay fields, and in consequence of some conversation I had some suspicion of the prisoner; I advertised him; then I went to Bow-street, and about a month ago, I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; the prisoner desired to speak to me, and 
he related to me how he took this piece away.</p>


               <p>Did you threaten him or promise him? - By no means whatever, he sent for me voluntarily himself; he began relating the story where my piece was; he was very sorry, and that he would tell me of the others; he then told me, he had sold it to Mrs. Daly, a woman with one eye; I went to Mr. Bond the magistrate, and he said, if it would be of any service letting the prisoner go with us, as he had informed us it was somewhere in Rag-fair; we found it in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Was there any of your property found in consequence of any information you had received? - There was no goods found in the house, but there was a gown found that was pledged.</p>
               <p>Was that gown any part of the callico that was lost? - I am sure of that, for this reason, I can shew you the original pattern, whereby I distinguish it. (Produces the gown.) This piece and this piece only taken away, is the only piece in the world, I will venture to say, that is to be found in this state.</p>
               <p>You will venture to say there is no piece of that pattern? - No, I will venture to say so; this gown is a part of the property I lost, I know that; the reason why I know it to be mine is this, this piece is without either green or blue in it, the original pattern is what we call chintz, which has both green and blue in it, and if that had been left with me then it would have had both green and blue in it; I first saw this gown at Bow-street; I saw it afterwards, only within this month.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the confession reduced into writing? - Yes, it was, but he would not sign it himself, but Mr. Bond said, he would sign it, and send it here himself.</p>

               <p>Was the prosecutor present when they were delivered to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the things that were delivered to the constable the same that was in the bundle of the prisoner? - Yes, here is the bit of gauze that was found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor's wife. Where were these bits of gauze? - They were in the cupboard wrapped up.</p>
               <p>Can you know these pieces at all? - I swore to them being my own.</p>
               <p>What do you know them by? - I know them by my wrapping them up; I know them to be my own.</p>
               <p>Can you know them that were not in the bundle? - I know I had a piece of gauze hung over the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Suppose the man had any other gauze before in his pocket, how would you know yours from that? - It would be impossible.</p>
               <p>Were they such pieces as this that you lost? - They were, and I suppose them to have hung over the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the first place, I was in Fleet-market, going to buy some fruit, for my daily labour, and a man came up to me in Fleet-market, and asked me to carry a letter into Fleet-street, and he would give me sixpence; the door was open; I asked for one Mr. Williams, a taylor; I went and knocked at the door, three men came out; I went in; I saw nobody in the room; I turned to come out, and the prosecutor came and knocked me down; he fell upon me; he let me go; then he called out stop thief; Mr. Young and Mr. Jackson are in the yard; the two men that followed me; nothing was found upon me but the two keys; I knocked at the door going in.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is Young or Jackson here? - I do not know; Young never went to the Justice's with me, nor never came to Court with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is a turner; he lives at No. 6, Stone-cutter-street; the prosecutor has been enquiring every day what reward he should get to hang me; and that gentleman told the people that if he did he would give it my wife for a present.</p>

               <p>Did any of them offer any violence to any of the parties in the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>It was then dusk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you light enough to know any of these persons? - Not positively; I think I could tell Batt's person very well; I think he was the man that first passed the coach; I took notice of his size and his air; I did not see his face, but as to his person I think I could be positive; the man on my side had a handkerchief over the lower part of his face, so that I cannot know him for certainty, and the other I did not see that was the other side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Was your watch ever found again? - Yes, the next day; a gentleman overtook us at Kilburn turnpike, that was Mr. Drake, the foreman of the grand jury; he asked us if we had been robbed; he took our description and went to Bow-street; and in consequence of that the watch was brought the Saturday morning; I did not see the watch till the next morning; it was then in the possession of Sayre; they sent to Mr. Robins and me, but we were both of us out; the three prisoners were then in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner Batt's Counsel. If I understand you right, you know nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300082"/> of Batt but by the size of his person? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not he a common size man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The person you suppose to be Batt, did not use any ill language? - No, he did not speak to us at all, and whether he had a pistol or not, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Then there was no particular sort of incivility or violence? - No violence or oaths, he put his hands in our pockets.</p>

               <p>I was so frightened I did not look at the man I gave my purse to; there was very little money in it, and my cloak was taken some how or other; my cloak was found again; it was a black mode cloak, with a lace, and a pocket handkerchief; the handkerchief was found and the cloak; the purse and the money; the men were remarkably civil for thieves.</p>

               <p>In consequence of that information what did you do? - Macmanus, myself, Sayre and Carpmeal went to the pawnbroker's in Holborn, and took these prisoners in custody.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It was between ten and eleven on the Friday, we put them in a coach, and took them to Sir Sampson's; I cannot speak to the property that Sayre found; I searched Batt, and I found a silver watch; I searched White, and I found this metal watch upon him, and this purse and seal, and this ribbon.</p>
               <p>What watch is it, a gold watch, or a metal one? - It is a silver gilt one I think.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoners say any thing material on their examination? - Yes, Batt did.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He owned to the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to them of favour, if they told the truth? - No, my Lord, none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Batt. Yes, there was, my Lord, by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Was Lucas present? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Who was present? - Nobody but me and him; I was very much in liquor, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Court to Lucas. Was this man in liquor when he was examined? - He did not appear to be in liquor; after he had been examined before Sir Sampson, and had confessed the robberies, he was alone with the clerk.</p>
               <p>Was he alone with the clerk before that? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Was what he confessed, reduced into writing? - Yes, it was, I witnessed it, and I believe I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Endeavour to recollect yourself, whether any thing was said by any person to induce him to make this confession? - No, Sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>The confession handed up to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that, is that your handwriting? - Yes, it is; I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300083"/> and the magistrate sign it; it was made apparently to me without any condition.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was you standing by Batt, close to him the whole time? - Yes, I was close to him all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body speak to him during the time? - Upon my word I did not.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know from White, that that was his lodgings? - No, I believe the landlord is here that let him them; there we found his pistol, and these eight balls upon the top of the bed; nothing else that is mentioned in this indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. What is it a fainting fit? - No, it is not, it is the cramp which seizes every limb and nerve in my body; I do not drop, if I sit down, I recover in about two minutes; I got to my own door; it seized my hand in such a manner, I had not power to knock; I called out, and the first person that came by was the prisoner, and two more with him; I desired him to knock at the door for me, for I was going into a fit, instead of knocking at my door, in my distress for me, he was at my pocket taking my watch.</p>
               <p>Why was you sensible? - Yes, I am always sensible, though I cannot speak perhaps; I was sensible though I had not the use of my hands; as it is coming on I can speak, but afterwards I cannot; as it happened I had my right hand at liberty immediately, by the surprise, I look upon it; he was at my fob; my watch was taken out; I felt his hand at my pocket; I caught hold of the end of my chain, and the chain broke, he held the watch and I the chain; I have had it ever since. (The broken chain handed up.) After the chain broke he turned away and ran down Chancery-lane; he ran against a post, which I look upon it knocked him down; I was present when he was searched; there was nothing of my property found on him; there is a lamp just by our door; I never lost sight of him till he fell down; I did not see him reach any thing to any body; I am sure he is the man, or else I should not have prosecuted him; I never saw my watch since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Blades, I begin what I have to say to you, with informing you that I know enough of you to believe that you will say nothing but what you think to be true? - I would not; I know the Court too well; I would not swear to him without I knew he was the man, for five hundred watches.</p>
               <p>Was you standing with your face to the door? - My face was on one side.</p>
               <p>That part of Chancery-lane is by no means light? - There is a lamp at the corner of the house; there is a shop between our passage door and the lamp.</p>
               <p>Is it that part of Chancery-lane which projects over? - It is above that.</p>
               <p>How many moments do you think this was passing, for it could scarcely be a minute? - I cannot tell; I had not at first the use of my hand.</p>
               <p>How long do you apprehend it was from the time that you first found the hand at your watch before you had the use of your hand? - A very short space; he had got the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>How long have you been subject to this misfortune? - For near seven 
years.</p>


               <p>You will excuse me asking you whether on that evening you had been drinking? - Nothing to do me hurt, I had sat down in no public house whatever; I had been at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300095"/> the Mansion-house about business for the Sheriff, and had been drinking two or three horns of porter.</p>
               <p>Had you dined at the Mansion-house? - No, I had not; I had drank nothing at all before that evening.</p>
               <p>Then upon an empty stomach you had two or three horns of porter? - No, I had no empty stomach; I generally have a pretty good dinner.</p>
               <p>Had that liquor made you a little groggy? - I was not groggy at all.</p>
               <p>It put your blood into rather a quicker circulation than usually it is in? - It did not.</p>
               <p>I do believe you are a very sober man? - I can drink a glass of punch or any thing.</p>
               <p>Have you found that liquors have affected you at this time more than if you had not drank? - No, I cannot say that it does.</p>
               <p>You have no experience either way? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When you have a fit after a little liquor you have less possession of your intellects than when you have been quite in your sober senses? - I always am in possession of my senses; I never found any difference; I always have my recollection; it has come upon me in the night in my bed, when I am as sensible as I am now.</p>
               <p>This was between nine and ten? - It was; it was not a light night, and no moon; it was a fair night.</p>
               <p>Was you afterwards with your son at any public house that evening? - The constable and my son came.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your son's saying, do not press my father to drink, for he has had rather more than is good for him already? - I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any office here? - I have been <rs id="t17860830-57-viclabel302" type="occupation">door-keeper</rs>

               <p>I am constable; I was sent for that night to take charge of the prisoner; I searched him, and found nothing upon him that Mr. Blades owned, from the first to the last; I was in company with him an hour.</p>
               <p>In what state did Mr. Blades appear to you to be at that time, as to intoxication or otherwise? - I thought he was at that time rather the worse for liquor, and what confirms me in that opinion is, the same night as we were coming from the compter with the prisoner, Mr. Blades said coming home, you shall have some beer at the Four Kings; I objected to it; it was my night to be up at the watch-house, and I wanted to go home; we went in, and Mr. Blades called for a pot of beer; there was myself, Holmes, a brother officer, Mr. Blades and his son; the pot of beer was drank out in six or seven minutes; Blades said, we will have another; I objected to it; then he said, you shall have a glass; we had a glass apiece, Mr. Blades's face was towards the bar, and I says to his son, your father is a little in for it I believe, is not he.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by that phrase? - Being in liquor; his son made a reply, my father is in liquor, do not let him drink, but I dare not speak to him; when I first saw him I thought him in liquor, my reasons were, the man was searched once before I came, as they told me; when I came he was searched again; Mr. Blades was not satisfied, and he was searched a third time, and by Mr. Blades himself; and from his mode of acting (I have seen him before several times) I judged him in liquor, not so much disguised as a man that could not walk, but as a man that seemed merry in liquor.</p>
               <p>A man that was less likely to take particular notice that if he was not in liquor? - I should imagine so.</p>
               <p>Court. When the son said, that his father was in liquor, do you think that he heard him? - I do not know, he made no answer.</p>

               <p>I am another constable of the same parish of St. Dunstan's; I attended to take the prisoner to the compter, with Mr. Gray, Mr. Blades and his son.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300096"/>From your observation of Mr. Blades, did you take him to be in liquor? - I rather thought he was.</p>
               <p>Did you take him to be in full possession of his sober senses or otherwise? - He was very forward in liquor; I went to the compter, from thence to a public house in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Your own opinion was that he was forward in liquor? - He was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he give you at this time any account of his robbery? - Yes, he told us in the coach that he was robbed, he said, he desired the prisoner would knock at his door in Chancery-lane, for he found the fit was coming on him, and he said, at that time he lost his watch; he said, the prisoner pulled it out of his pocket, and that he was never out of his sight, and that he had his chain in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before that time? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court to Grays. Did Blades give the same account in your presence? - He did; he was telling the company at large.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Which way did the two other persons run? - He ran down Chancery-lane, they must run up; they did not go down the street; but I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Had you any thing to drink at the compter? - Nothing.</p>

               <p>Then how came that expression into your head? - It was a mistake; I watched them down Bishopsgate-street, as far as I could see them; I went to tell his father, but he was not at home; I thought he was in company with a bad man; I told his mother, he had a trunk under his arm; he took out a knife and opened it; and there was an old mop, an old shoe, and some bits of mortar.</p>

I told them I was a poor hard working man and did not know how to get a bit of bread, and begged of them to let me go about my business; the other man that is absent, took hold of my pocket on the outside, and said, you have money, do not stand hesitating and they said, we will have your money or your life; I told them, I owed money to the baker at the shop, and I did not know how to get a morsel of bread if I did not go home and pay it; but they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300104"/> would have my money, and I took out a shilling and gave it to the other man, and the other man took that, and then they said, that should not do, they would have more; then this prisoner at the bar had another shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you give it to him? - He took it out of my hand; they heard somebody coming, and they ran off as fast as they could, and I heard the watch cry ten, and I ran after them as fast as I could, and cried out murder, stop thief! and the prisoner was taken; I did not see him taken; he was taken about five hundred yards off;

               <p>Did you know his face? - Yes, I knew his face and his dress; he was much in the same dress as he is in now, and an old hat with a hole in the top.</p>
               <p>You take upon you to say that is one of them? - That is the man, he cannot deny it.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker; on Saturday the 19th of August about ten, I had just done work, and I heard the cry of murder, stop thief; I was in my own house; I live within about two hundred yards where the robbery was committed; I went to my door and I saw the prisoner running with another man; I pursued them, and had like to have overtaken them at about fifty yards; but the prisoner turned round with a bludgeon that he had, which is in Court, and made a blow at me; he missed me; I followed him again, and just by the turnpike, I hallooed out, stop thief, and Gadsden was standing just by his door; he keeps a cook's shop, and is a stone-sawyer; Gadsden stopped him; I laid hold of him; I was close to him; I saw him throw away the stick about twenty yards before he came to the turnpike; the other man ran up towards Hyde-park-corner; I could not run after them both; my house is at Pimlico; he took to the left, and this to the right; the other made his escape; we took the prisoner to the Shakespear's-head, Pimlico; after we had taken him into the public house, in a few minutes somebody told the prosecutor he was there, and when he came in there were twenty or thirty people; it was a house where there are pay tables of bakers and carpenters, and I asked the prosecutor if he had not been robbed, and he said, yes; I asked him, if he should know the man amongst us all, as there were so many of us together; and he pitched upon the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at all pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300105"/> him? - No, he was sitting down the same as any gentleman here, and nobody pointed the prisoner out to him.</p>
               <p>Was there any hint or intimation given him that he was the man? - Not to my knowledge, for I did it to know whether he knew it was the man.</p>
               <p>Who picked up this stick that was thrown away by the prisoner? - The watchman, and he brought it to the pubblic house sometime after the prisoner came there, but I cannot say how long; I saw the prisoner throw it away.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 19th of August, about ten, I heard a great noise of stop thief, stop thief, close to the turnpike at Pimlico; I live within two hundred yards of the gate; I saw the prisoner just before me on the full run; he was in a light coloured coat, the same as he has on now; I caught the prisoner on the left hand of his collar, and laid hold of his wrist, and took him to the Shakespear's-head, a public house; Stent was close to him, in the twinkling of an eye; I sat down in the box with the prisoner; the watchman was in the house; I would not give him to them, and the prosecutor came to the corner of the box and sat in the box; and said, that is the man that demanded my money or my life; he might have been three minutes in the house, and I was set down by the prisoner holding his collar; the prisoner answered directly, I own I am guilty, I had a concern in the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was not there something said, to encourage the man, or induce him? - No, I heard nothing of that kind; the prisoner said, I own I had a hand in the robbery, and had got part of the money; the public house was full; there might be twenty or thirty; they were all men; I did not see any women in the house that night.</p>
               <p>Had you the man by the collar or the wrist when the prosecutor came in? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Court. That was hint enough? - I might take him about four hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Court to Stent. You know this spot where this robery was committed? - Yes, there was lone house, and the prosecutor told me it was just by that lone house; the prisoner was running beyond my door; he was got but a very little way before I took him; there was no other person but him, and a man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body running but this man? - Nobody at all, they were both before me, and when we came to the corner of the street, there the prisoner told me he threw the shilling away, and the other man turned towards Hyde-park.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I do not know the prisoner; only that night I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran out of doors to see what was the matter, and I went to the public house, and Mr. Stent went into a public house called the Shakespeare's head; he was set down at the corner, and said to the prosecutor, are you the man that was robbed; and he said, yes; then Stent said, d - n you that is the man, pointing to the prisoner; the prosecutor said, yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Stent stand forward.</p>
               <p>Truss. From that, this gentleman Stent took and examined him, there was nothing upon him, not a stick; from thence he was taken into the parlour; I went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor go in? - Yes, and there after they had set down a few minutes the prosecutor said, that if the man would confess he would forgive him; if he would give him the two shillings, and give the watchmen something to drink, he would let him go about his business; upon that, after a few minutes, the prisoner said, he was the man that did the robbery; then I went with him to the watch-house, and there they told him that the man that was concerned with him was to be found at Westminster; I went with the prosecutor and the prisoner, to look for the other man; and I said to the prosecutor before he went in, now you had better go along with Wall, and see if you can see the other man that robbed you; he said he would; there was a man a drinking, and he immediately challenged a young man that was there eating his supper, and he said he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that was? - No, but it was a different man from the prisoner; he swore down blank to him, that that was the man that robbed him;</p>
               <p>What he was positive about it, was he? - He was very positive about it, strictly positive.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I said I thought it was a pity, without he was really positive in his own mind, to go to swear to the man; and Mr. Stent said the same, that he did not believe he was the man; and that he thought it was wrong of him; but he stood to it for sometime, till such time as the landlord and landlady stood up, and said they could prove that that man had but just left work, not above a quarter of an hour; and they could send for his master, and prove him to be a very sober, honest young fellow; upon that he said, he believed he was the man, and went off from it, and went into the other houses in Westminster.</p>
               <p>When was it that the prosecutor fixed on the prisoner? - When Mr. Stent said d - n me, that is the man that robbed you.</p>
               <p>Court to Stent. This young man says that the prisoner was taken into the parlour? - He was taken into the tap room first, and when the prosecutor said he was the man, he was taken into the parlour, and sat down.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say, that if the man would confess and give him two shillings, he would forgive him? - He did not say any thing about confessing; but he said, if he had his two shillings again, he did not want to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Let me understand you clearly; did any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300107"/> thing pass from the prosecutor, either in the tap room, or in the parlour, that implied he was doubtful that he was the man? - I pitched upon him, the moment he came into the tap room at first; I asked the prisoner if he had any money, he said no.</p>
               <p>This man swears that in your presence, and hearing, the prosecutor wanted to induce this man to confess? - I told the prosecutor, says I, if there is another confederate with him; for he told me himself, that the other man brought him into the premunire; that the other man took his part, that he should have been beat; he told me he took lodgings at the Three Tuns, in the Broad-way, and paid a shilling a week for his lodging.</p>
               <p>Court to Truss. What are you? - A hair dresser.</p>

               <p>How came the prosecutor to see the prisoner first? - The prosecutor came into the house where the prisoner was; and this Mr. Stent shewed the prisoner to the prosecutor; he asked the prosecutor if he was the man that was robbed; there was several people in the room; they made room for the prosecutor; the prosecutor said he was the man that was robbed; says Stent, d - n you, this is the man that robbed you, pointing to the prisoner; or you are the man that robbed him, or something to that purpose; the prisoner was then taken into the parlour; and I heard the prosecutor say, he would freely forgive him, if he would pay him the two shillings he had been robbed off, and pay the expences of the people that were there; the prosecutor said, he did not want to hurt him, if he would give the two shillings back, and treat the watchman, and discharge the people.</p>

               <p>What did he do? - He took my pockets that were underneath my head.</p>
               <p>What was in your pockets? - Nothing but my spectacles, one guinea, and two shillings, wrapped up in a paper; he took the guinea and the two shillings, and left the spectacles; when he had taken the money, he sat down again by my bedside; I heard the other men, and saw them go out of my room, and into my master's room.</p>
               <p>Had you any light at this time? - When they had done with my master, one of them came back and said, where is the tinder box? the prisoner never moved from my bedside; he never went to my master's room; I told him the tinder box was on the chimney place below; then one of them went down and struck a light; the prisoner staid with me; I was never left; then the man brought a light into my room; the man was not disguised at all; he was dressed in a white flannel waistcoat, with sleeves; the other man went away with his light; the prisoner still staid with me; I never was left; they came back to my room, and brought the light, and this man said we have done; and they came round to my bed's feet, and they all went away together; they went down stairs, and let themselves out at the front door; I take it altogether, first and last, I had the opportunity of observing this man seven or eight minutes; I took particular notice of him; my eye was never off him; and there was a great sash thrown up, that was never down; it was star-light, but no moon.</p>
               <p>Look round at the prisoner, and tell my Lord and the Jury, whether you are sure that is the man? - I am sure of it; I have no doubt of it; I had so much clear sight by the light of the candle, that I could not mistake; I described the man next morning to my master; I told him he was black complexion man, broadish face, and thickish body; I described his dress the next morning to my master; I saw the prisoner again at Mr. Wilmott's Office; the house was broke open on Wednesday, the 16th; I came to town on a Tuesday, to Mr. Wilmott's office, a fortnight after, and saw him, and knew him directly; he was sitting with the two other men that were taken with him; there were several other people in the room; nobody pointed him out to me; I picked him out from the rest; he had a blue coat on, and a striped waistcoat; I knew the face of him, and desired Mr. Wilmott to strip him into his flannel waistcoat, with sleeves.</p>
               <p>Did you know him then? - Yes, that was the very same dress he had on when he came and sat by my bedside, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Had you then, or have you now, any doubt of his person; is that the gentleman? - He is.</p>
               <p>Court. During this time, did he say any thing to you? - Only one word, he bid me lay still, I screamed.</p>
               <p>You were abed at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you jump out of bed at that alarm? - I was going to sit up, but they pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Did he permit you to turn and look about? - Yes, he never confined my head at all.</p>
               <p>This was a star-light night you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a tolerable clear night? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Could you see any thing by that light? - Not perfectly without a candle.</p>
               <p>Suppose the candle had not been brought, could you have sworn to him without that light? - No, I would not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever look at his face? - I could not keep my eye off from him; he never offered any violence.</p>
               <p>Did he say nothing to you? - He only said when I screamed, do not scream, for there is more at the ladder foot.</p>
               <p>I only give you this caution, that you are aware that this man's life may rest upon your evidence; after that, look at the man, and see if you are sure? - Very sure, I have no doubt about it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300109"/>Was there any thing in the course of that night, that can prove it to you what time this happened? - As nigh as I can guess, about two, because my master got a light and went to look, and it wanted ten minutes of three; that was twenty minutes after the prisoner left my bedside.</p>

               <p>What time were you alarmed? - About two.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you heard or saw? - The first thing I heard, was a noise and rumbling of some sort; then I heard the woman halloo out; there was nobody else in the house; we sleep in two rooms on the same floor; I got out of bed with intent to lock my door; two men rushed into it before I could get it locked; then I made for the bed again, and one of them tumbled atop of me, and I had a scuffle with him, and the other struck me twice on the head with a stick; then they tied my legs and hands; they tied me with one of their garters, and a piece of packthread; one of them said, let us get a light from below stairs; they took six silver tea spoons; one pair of silver tea tongs; a pair of stockings; a silk handkerchief, and a gown; they went out at the front door; and they left me tied as I thought, but then I dare not stir; they left this stick under the bed of Mrs. Griffin; as soon as they were gone, I got up.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - When I got a light, it was almost three; it was more than half past two when they went away.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing at the window of the woman's chamber? - A ladder; it came from Enfield; it is a mile, or rather better to Wynchmore-hill; only two men came into my room.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Griffin describe to you, who had been in her room? - One, she said, sat by her all the time; she gave me a particular description of him; I went to Enfield last Sunday morning; it was ten days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Who did you find at Enfield? - I was drinking at a publick house with another man, and I saw the prisoner and another man talking in the street; he was then dressed in a little flannel waistcoat with sleeves, a white one; he was talking to a shoemaker; in consequence of that, I came up to London to Mr. Wilmott's, and got a warrant on suspicion; I went down with the officers, and took him into custody last Monday at Enfield; he had the same dress on; he put on a coat I believe, before he came out of Enfield; I brought him to Mr. Wilmott's office; she came on the Tuesday morning, and saw him in that dress; there were about a score in the room; she picked him out, and she said she would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was you undoing your arms and legs? - Oh, Sir, I presently undid them, in the manner they tied them.</p>

               <p>Was he pointed out to her? - He was not; she said that is the man that robbed my master's house, but he was not in a coat, he was in a white waistcoat; then he pulled off his clothes, and stood in the white waistcoat; and the woman said, that she was still positive that he was the man, and remarked, that he had a round hat cocked up on the sides, and his hat corresponded, with that he was committed; I am constable of the parish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Counsel. If this man is convicted, do your expect any reward? - Certainly, Sir, what the Recorder allows me, I certainly shall expect.</p>
               <p>Do you know how much that money is? - There is forty pounds; there were three more, and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Then there are five of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you found him with a hat, this hat was a round hat, turned up on each side? - Yes, I have seen many such.</p>
               <p>How many? - I dare say I have seen hundreds, and I have seen people in white waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Is it not a common dress for labouring and working men to wear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did the man that tied you, continue with you? - One stood with me, but I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Griffin. Before you went to town, did you know what coat the man had on at Enfield? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you seen nobody that had seen the prisoner before he went to town; had you been told he borrowed a coat? - Yes, since I came to town, I did not hear before I came there.</p>
               <p>Did you hear he had borrowed a coat before you had looked at him? - Yes, before I swore to him; I cannot tell who told me; they were talking about it? -</p>
               <p>How many men came into the room with light to you? - One, only one.</p>
               <p>Then during the whole of this time, did you see only two men? - When they first came in I saw three, but afterwards only two.</p>
               <p>Was the light that was brought to you at two different times, brought by the same person, or by two different persons? - By one person only.</p>
               <p>Did you see enough of that man to be able to swear to him? - No, I could not; it was only one man; it was the same man that brought the light both times; my master came into my room as soon as he was gone; and he went and called this man; he brought Arnold home with him.</p>
               <p>Did he bring any body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, are you sure he brought nobody in the house that morning but Arnold? - Not all at once; he brought this Mr. Oliver, then Mr. Arnold; and he looked up and down the house to see if there was any body in the house; then he asked me if I could stay by myself, and I staid by myself till he went to Mr. Oliver's, and after that, Mr. Batchelor came up with him.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Oliver come? - No, not then; they found me in the house up by the fire place in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>How did you know it was three? - I saw them, one stood with me.</p>
               <p>Did they all three come back again? - Not in my room, one came back to call the man that stood with me.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was brought in? - A pretty large candle.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Threescore and three.</p>

               <p>Did you see his wife carry his dinner to him that day? - He comes home regularly to breakfast and dinner every day; I saw him come home to dinner.</p>
               <p>What makes you sure it was Tuesday night? - The child being ill; I knew the child was dangerously ill in the day time.</p>
               <p>How old is the child? - Nine or ten months; it suckles, but the woman had been out at the harvest, and over heated her milk, and we thought the child was going to have the measles.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the child? - The mother of the child came to call my children to go to gleaning with her children, but she could not go because her child was ill;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300112"/> I did not know the speech of the woman till I asked what was the matter; I went to bed at half after ten without a light; the prisoner answered me as he lay in bed, I said Mr. Staker, is any thing the matter with your family? he said no,

Mrs. Morris is very skillful about children? - Yes, Mrs. Morris is the first, and Mrs. Staker is the second; they occasionally attend my children; it is a nurse child, and does not suckle; I generally put my children to Mrs. Staker, because she can give suck, and Mrs. Morris cannot; my child was ill the 16th of August; I am sure of the day; I cannot read or write, but I made my son put it down; Mrs. Morris must hear what past; I screamed out, and Mrs. Staker spoke loud; I cannot tell when it was that I heard that Mr. Richardson's house was broke open.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you the Gentlemen of the Jury, this indictment charges the gentleman at the bar with a capital offence; and when you see such a prisoner, standing in such a situation, I have no doubt but you expect that there is something peculiar in his case; and if you do form at this moment such an expectation, with respect to this case, I do assure you, you will not be disappointed; for it will call for your most serious and careful determination; you have just tried and convicted a man * upon a constructive felony, a felony committed by a stretch of ingenuity: Gentlemen, the present case is a clear and plain felony, about which the law is clearly understood, committed however by a stretch of ingenuity not very different from the other; for the other was the stale practice of ring dropping, and this is the stale story of playing at A. B. C. Gentlemen, you will have no question at all to try in the result of this business, but whether the prisoner now at the bar is the person that committed the robbery imputed to him by the indictment; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300114"/> that the felony has been committed, and that it has been committed under the circumstances I shall state to you, will be beyond all possible question, and the only question for your determination will be who committed it. Gentlemen, the prosecutor of this indictment is a Mr.

B. C. Gentlemen, this sort of game called A. B. C. is shortly this, one party marks a letter under a pot or bowl, or something they are drinking out of, that is covered, and you are to guess; the poor gentleman, the prisoner, he lost all his money had but very few good guesses; upon which, he went out, staid a few minutes, and came back again, and then lost all that; then he applied to his new friend, the Major, to lend him a little, and he lent him thirty-two guineas, out of thirty four, that was soon gone, and he applied again; the Major had only two left, he took them, and held them in his hand looking at them; they were his two last guineas; says he, these are all I have got, no, I cannot spare these; upon which the prisoner at the bar (which makes this a capital offence, as my Lord will tell you) snatched these two guineas from him, swept the other into his hands that lay on the table, and he and the other man ran away: Major Welch immediately said, he had been robbed, and wanted somebody to assist to pursue them; the Major knew nothing of this town as we do, for you seldom get much assistance in those houses to which the sharper himself conducts you; however, in short, Major Welch saw no more of this man at the bar for a considerable time, four or five days, but when he did see him, he saw him under these peculiar circumstances; he had not compleated all his business at the Treasury, and he was attending there again, and he saw him sitting in an outer room; he will tell you upon his oath, that he instantly recognized him, he spoke to him, and charged him with the robbery, but the prisoner was very angry at the charge, and they went before Sir Sampson Wright, where the Major positively persisted in making it. Gentlemen, as far as the Major's positive testimony can go, there can be no doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, as far as human recollection can go, whatever may be his character or appearance otherwise; and I shall also call to you General and Major Cunningham, and they will tell you whether they know the prisoner again, and it seems they took some notice, because one said to the other, I wonder who Welch has got with him. Gentlemen, if it should appear to you on the evidence that I have stated this case too strongly; if I have stated to you one fact, or half a fact that cannot be proved to your satisfaction by witnesses, you will not take any thing for proof merely because I have stated it; but you will try this man as you do all others, by the evidence and not by any thing that we say to you; if you find him guilty, you will pronounce him so; if you have any doubt about his guilt, you will acquit him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What is your profession? - I am a private gentlemen; I was a Major in the North Carolina regiment; I have been in England since last January; I have been soliciting in the Treasury for three or four months, that occasioned me to attend there very frequently; I used to attend in the outer hall, which is the same hall where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300116"/> I saw the prisoner; General Cunningham is likewise an American General; he and the Major had likewise business at the Treasury, and used to attend frequently there also, almost day by day; I had received three hundred and four pounds from the Treasury, and I lodge at No. 4, Clerkenwell Close; General and Major Cunningham lodge in the same house.</p>
               <p>How lately before the 10th of August, had you received any of that money? - I really cannot recollect the day, it was about a fortnight before I was preparing to leave this country; my family lives in the Bahama islands, in New Providence.</p>
               <p>How soon was you to go? - In a few days.</p>
               <p>Had you taken your passage? - I had, in the ship Lightening.</p>
               <p>What happened to you on the 10th of August? - I had been out bargaining for some clothes and things for the use of my family, as well as I can recollect, it was about six o'clock; I was returning to my own lodgings, and I met with this gentleman, he called himself Mr. Miles at that time.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - It was Thursday, the 10th of August, I met him just at the corner of Mutton-lane, adjoining to Hatton-street; Sir, says he, I think I have had the pleasure of seeing your face somewhere; I said perhaps you might; the next thing he said was, how is General Cunningham, and Major Cunningham; I told him they were very well; says he, I have had the pleasure of dining with General Cunningham in New York; says he, he was with Lord Cornwallis in America; I told him he was; says he, will you take a walk somewhere, and drink a glass of something or another to a public house; I told him that I was very sickly, and I did not wish to drink any thing; but he says to me, if you will go and drink a glass of something, I will go with you to see Major Cunningham; by his being acquainted with General Cunningham, he over persuaded me to step over with him to a publick house, opposite to Hatton-street; it was along Hatton-wall; I do not know the name of the house; there were coaches stood in the yard; there we had sixpenny-worth, or a shilling's-worth of rum and water; while we were drinking that, a stranger came in, and pulled out some papers, which seemed as if he had some intention to game, but I did not pay the least attention to what their game was.</p>
               <p>Did they converse together? - Yes, they did; then we walked away.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain what you mean by it seeming like gaming? - There was money produced from their pockets at the table.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the fact, whether they had any money there besides the paper? - Yes, they had.</p>

               <p>What sort of money was it, that was produced? - It was gold.</p>
               <p>Was it produced by one or both of them? - By both I believe, but I am not sure; I am sure it was gold.</p>
               <p>Why did it appear to you, that there was gambling going forward? - I really looked upon it, that they might have been acquainted for any thing I knew.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by either of them, that induced you to suppose they might have been gambling? - No, Sir, but by their actions, pulling out papers and gold.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by papers, bank notes? - They did so appear to me, but I did not take one of them in my hand; it appeared to be bank notes.</p>
               <p>Then when you said paper, you meant bank notes? - Yes, Sir, it appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass in conversation, that induced you to think they were gambling? - Nothing that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long did you continue in conversation after the third came in? - A few minutes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be there together? - About ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Mr. Bachellor; I asked him his name at that time, and he told me it was Miles; his being acquainted with General

             made me ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300117"/> his name, to tell the General that I had seen an acquaintance of his.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the liquor? - Why I really think he did.</p>
               <p>You did not? - No, I did not; we went to my lodgings, No. 4, Clerkenwell Close; he went to see General Cunningham; when we came there, just as we came to the door, the General and the Major were going to take their evening's walk; we met them right upon the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner speak to his old friend the General? - No, he spoke to me, says he, as long as they are going to take their evening's walk, I will not interrupt them; they went out, and we two went in together; I went into the room to get a little money to pay for some things I had prized in Holborn; the prisoner went in with me; I took the money out of my chest; the prisoner saw me; it was in a purse; I have the purse in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell the prisoner what sum of money you was going to take with you? - No.</p>
               <p>You told the prisoner you was going to take some money? - Yes, to pay for something I had priced; I took thirty-two guineas in one purse, and I had two guineas in a leather bag; the purse with the thirty-two guineas was in my chest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner see you take this money out of the chest? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you count the money? - No, it was in the purse.</p>
               <p>Then if I understand you, the prisoner saw you take the purse up, and put it in your pocket? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long might you continue in the room? - But a few minutes; we went out, I was in a bad state of health, I could not walk, upon which the prisoner said, let us call a coach, there is a stand of coaches on the green; and he called a coach, and we both got into the coach; the prisoner told the coachman to drive to the old Bell, in Holborn; there we got out; I was going into Holborn to pay for the goods; the prisoner paid the coachman; then the prisoner asked me to walk in, and drink a glass of something with him; we went into a little room on the ground floor; it was a little room across a little court.</p>
               <p>What side of the gateway? - It was the right side of the gateway; he called for sixpenny-worth, or a shilling's-worth of rum and water, I do not know which; while we were drinking that, and after we had been in the room a few minutes, in came this same man that was with us at the first house, or another.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say it was the same man or not? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you think? - I rather think it was; when he came in, the two gentlemen got to gaming; they had chalk, and a mug, or a quart pot.</p>
               <p>Who had the chalk? - I really cannot say which, it was in his pocket; they made A B C, under a pot; it was not the thing that we had our drink in; I am sure it was a pot, about a quart pot.</p>
               <p>Court. How did it come there; was it sent for by either of them? - I really do not know; they took the pot, and they set upon a particular letter.</p>
               <p>Who made the letter? - I am not positive which of them made the letter.</p>
               <p>What letters were made? - A B C.</p>
               <p>Where were these letters made in chalk? - They were on the table; then they pulled out their money, and were gaming; and they put the pot on one or other of the letters; and the other party was to guess what letter it was, if he guessed right, he was to win so many guineas; if he guessed wrong, then he lost.</p>
               <p>How many letters had they on the table at one time? - All three.</p>
               <p>Were they to guess as to the whole three, or one at a time? - One at a time.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, they were to shift the pot from one letter to another, and if they guessed the right letter that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300118"/> was under the pot, they won? - He that put the pot down was not to look till he guessed.</p>
               <p>Was he to turn his back? - He was to turn his head away on one side, and not to look till he had guessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did the same man always keep the custody of the pot; or did they alternately change the pot and guess? - The prisoner was always on the losing hand; there was six or seven guineas at a time staked; then they doubled their stakes; he still continued losing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see money pass between them, when they lost? - Yes, their money constantly lay on the table.</p>
               <p>As the betts were made and lost, did you see the money constantly paid? - Yes, it was always paid.</p>
               <p>Did you always see the prisoner pay the money to the other? - Yes, Sir, he moved it from his heap, to the heap of the other.</p>
               <p>How long might they go on at this rate? - It was but a short time.</p>
               <p>How long? - I do not think it was above eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they double their stakes every time they played? - I cannot say that, but I am positive that they doubled them towards the last; the prisoner, as I observed, was always on the losing hand; he lost all the money he apparently had about him, and he went out of the house for two or three minutes; when he returned, he produced guineas in plenty, twenty or thirty, or more; when he came in this time, he lost that at two or three guesses, at the letters again; he then asked me to lend him some; I lent him the thirty two guineas at twice or three times, as he asked me; that was all that was in that purse; he lost that, and says he to me, you have some more money; then I took out this little leather bag out of my pocket, and I told him I had but two guineas in it.</p>
               <p>Did you take it out of the bag? - I took it out of the bag, to convince him that I had no more; he snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did you lend it him? - No, I refused it; says I, Sir, this is all I have, and I cannot spare it; he snatched it out of my hand; says he, this will do; there lay all the money on the table, that they were both gambling for; then he swept all the money off the table into his hand, and put it into his pocket; I am sure it was the prisoner that did it, and they both made to the door together; they went out to the door; I stepped to the door as quick as I could; I met with the landlord at the door; his name is Garwood; I asked him which way those men went; he said, he saw no men; that was instantly after they went out; I told him I was robbed; I never stirred any more after him that day; it was very late.</p>

               <p>Court. How late was it? - I really cannot recollect, it might have been seven, or half after.</p>
               <p>How long do you think you was in the company of the prisoner? - I dare say, first and last, it was an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity during that time of observing his countenance and person? - I had certainly; and riding in the coach, and going to General Cunningham's together, and in the house where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see him? - I gave information next day at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - I searched after him on the Friday, and the Saturday; and the Monday following I had occasion to be at the Treasury to see my agent; I was just going off there, I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>In what circumstances, and where did you see the prisoner on that day? - I saw him in Whitehall, in the Treasury office, in one of the outer rooms; I stepped away to him; I immediately knew him as soon as I saw him; I spoke to him, Sir, says I, I have seen your face before; I am acquainted with you now.</p>

               <p>Are you sure now that at the time when, he so talked big and high, you had said no more to him, than what you have stated? - Yes, Sir, I am, I called him on one side, and I mentioned it to him, and asked him if he would be so kind to give me my money again, and I would say no more about it: he then told me he had some business at the Treasury with Mr. Rose; but I will not wait, says he, I will go to the Justice's with you immediately.</p>

            's; I informed Sir Sampson how the matter stood, and he took bail for his appearance on the Wednesday following, at eleven o'clock; we met there; then the prisoner came, and then he was bailed to take his trial here.</p>
               <p>Be so good to look at him, and tell us upon the oath you have taken, whether you have any doubt that that is the man that got your money? - Not any at all.</p>
               <p>Have you ever entertained any doubt? - Not at all, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, prisoner's counsel. When you came to the Treasury, you went up to Mr. Bachellor, and told him that you knew him, and you took him on one side, and told him, if he would return the money, you would say no more about it; he told you that would not do for him, he was in the employment of government, and he had some business with Mr. Rose; I believe he was pretty riotous, and insisted that you should go to the Justice's? - He was very willing to go.</p>
               <p>Did not he insist on your going to the Justices? - He said he would quit the business with Mr. Rose, and go to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Did not he insist on going? - He seemed very willing to go.</p>
               <p>Did not he take you by the collar, and desire his friends to assist in taking you to the Justice's? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Who went to the Justice's, you and he quietly? - There were two other gentlemen went along with him, and two of my acquaintance followed behind.</p>
               <p>He did not tell you that his reputation was at stake, and he insisted on going before the Justice, to clear that character up? - No, Sir, he did not mention any such thing to me.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, Mr. Major. - He said, I will let my business alone, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300121"/> drop my business with Mr. Rose, and will go to the Justice's with you.</p>
               <p>Why you know it was his offer, not yours; you would have dropped it? - No, my dear Sir.</p>
               <p>Do not call me dear Sir, for I hate the expression. - I would not have dropped it, we got to high words, then he said, I will quit the business I have with Mr. Rose, and we will go to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>You told the story exact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean accurately to say, that that man was bailed? - He was bailed.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to entrap you, now I will caution you. - He was bailed to meet on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Court. What was done that time? - There were gentlemen that came and bailed him before Sir

               <p>Who went for him? - I went for him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Was the waiter examined on the Monday? - Yes, Sir, he was.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to tell this gentleman, that it rested on your evidence singly? - I mean my acquaintance that were on my side.</p>
               <p>What business might you be before you was in the army? - I was a gentleman always, I had a fortune.</p>
               <p>Was you any business? - No: I meant on my side of the question, I did not mean of the prisoner; I went for the waiter on the Monday he was examined.</p>
               <p>What did he say?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to what he said.</p>
               <p>Major Welch. Sir Sampson asked me if I knew of any body, and I said the waiter; he sent me for him.</p>
               <p>How came you then but a few minutes ago to tell these gentlemen there, that there was nobody examined on Monday, on your part? - I fetched the waiter, and produced him as a witness to prove whether he knew him or not.</p>
               <p>How could you tell these gentlemen, that there was nobody examined on your part on Monday? - I understood or meant by it, that there was none of my friends or acquaintance examined at that time.</p>
               <p>How came you, but two minutes ago;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300122"/> to say there was no man examined on your part? - Because there was none of my acquaintance; this waiter was a stranger to me, Sir Sampson Wright sent for him, and I went for him.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was about six, I think you say? - Yes, Sir, as near as I can tell, or between six and seven, I am not positive, I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that man before in all your life? - Yes, I have, I think.</p>
               <p>You did not know where Mr. Miles lived? - I did not ask his name when I saw him in the Treasury-office, but I did when I met him.</p>
               <p>How came you to lend him thirty-two guineas? - Upon account of his being acquainted with General Cunningham, and dining with him at New York, and his being a particular acquaintance with Lord Cornwallis in America.</p>
               <p>It is very odd you did not introduce your good friend Mr. Miles to General Cunningham? - I thought he was better acquainted with him than I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not reckon the waiter a witness on your part? - No.</p>
               <p>That was what you meant, when you said there was no witness on your part? - Yes: I did not fetch him of my own head, the Justice told me: I had seen the prisoner at the Treasury before he accosted me in Mutton-lane.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am positive of it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I commanded the militia as General; I bore that rank in the provincial army.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Major Welch? - In the year 1779: we have both been some time in England, and had business at the Treasury, and lodged at the same house. On Thursday the 10th of August, about five in the evening, I met them at the door, as I was going to take a walk with my cousin Major Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Who did you meet? - Major Welch and another man; Major Welch turned about, and spoke some words, the stranger spoke nothing; I cast my eyes steadily on the stranger, I saw something lusty and brave in the man, which drew my attention and after we went out of the door, I said to Major Cunningham, what good looking man is that with Major Welch? and we took our walk, and returned in the evening; I saw Major Welch that evening and on the Wednesday following, I waited on Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body at Sir Sampson's that you believed to have been at your quarters? - Yes, Sir, I saw the prisoner; he was not pointed out, but I cast my eye round, and said to my cousin, that is the man that was at our quarters.</p>
               <p>Will you be so good as to look at the prisoner, and tell us now whether you have a recollection of his person? - Why certainly he has all the appearance that that man had that passed into my quarters; but the time was so short, I think I must reflect on myself, if I should so far fix it, to ground a charge improperly against a man; but he has certainly all the appearance that that man had.</p>
               <p>Then I am to understand that you do not swear positively that he is the person? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it? - In my own mind I certainly do; one man cannot appear to me so like another as that person does; he had a hat in his hand, I did not see whether it was a round or a cocked hat; I did not see him more than two or three seconds; the Magistrate to the best of my recollection did not swear me, but I gave the same evidence as I give to you.</p>
               <p>You was not bound over? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it was near five? - Yes; I cannot say whether it was half an hour before, or half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where is your relation the major? - He is at home sick, he does not know the prisoner.</p>

You told him there were several people would have assisted him? - Yes, there were enough to assist him, there are nine or ten coaches go from my house; I did not serve the people with liquors, I came out of the cellar fetching up some liquors, and I saw him in the parlour, and he called me in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Can you recollect the hour? - As near as I can guess, it was near five, or thereabouts, more or less.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Major Welch being at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - A lustyish gentleman came in with him; the gentleman called for a shilling's-worth of rum and water; when I took it in, there was a third, he paid me for it, and I came about my business: I saw no more of them till they went out; they came out into the yard and parted.</p>
               <p>Who came out and parted? - The last man and Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Where was your master at that time? - In the opposite room.</p>
               <p>They shook hands and parted, did they? - Yes, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Who was this lustyish gentleman? - They call him by the name of Horne.</p>
               <p>You know him, do you? - I have seen him before.</p>

               <p>Does he frequent the Bell? - No, Sir, not often: the other gentleman's name is Wright.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him often there? - No, Sir, I cannot say I have.</p>
               <p>Have you seen them there together? - I have.</p>
               <p>What did you see on the table when they were all gone? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Any chalks? - No, Sir, there were no chalks.</p>
               <p>Who paid the reckoning? - That third person, I told you.</p>
               <p>You do not upon these occasions trust? - We do as we please.</p>
               <p>What became of the third gentleman? - I do not know, I did not see him go at all: Major Welch spoke to my master; in the course of five minutes, Major Welch returned to the room, after he had parted with that gentleman, then he turned about, and came to the door, and as he was standing at the door of the room, he beckoned him over.</p>
               <p>You was examined in Bow-street? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did they take your examination in writing? - Sir Sampson took the whole of it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are the waiter? - I am.</p>
               <p>You know the two men who were with Major Welch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon the oath you have taken, was that gentleman, Mr. Bachellor, one? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Look at the gentleman. - I have looked, and I am ready to take my oath that is not the gentleman, nor he never was in our house before, nor I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300124"/> saw the gentleman till he sent for me about this affair at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He is not at all like Horne perhaps? - Not at all in person, nor like the other man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What o'clock was it? - To the best of my remembrance it must be about five.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am sorry to take up the attention of the Court a single second longer than is necessary; but being placed at this bar in the situation I now stand, charged with a fact I am not guilty of, I hope I shall have the indulgence of the Court and the Jury, and I have not the least doubt but I shall receive that justice which I shall be found to deserve. I shall be much obliged to your Lordship to order me a little wine and water, I am very faint.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. If you are faint, the Court will order you a chair.</p>
               <p>(A chair ordered for the prisoner.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner was with me from about half after four till five, on Thursday, the 10th of August; I am clear in my recollection of the day, because it was the day for the election of directors for the newly incorporated society for directing the fisheries: being myself a director of the society, and having taken in parliament an active part in the business of the fisheries, I arrived in town about eleven on that morning, Mr. Bachelor called upon me on business of a public nature: I told him, I could not attend to him at that time, as I was preparing to go out, but I should be glad to see him at half after four; I was detained by the society till a quarter before four, I returned to my own house about four, and went to dinner, and I had nearly finished my dinner when Mr. Bachellor came; there was a gentleman with me at the time, who was secretary to the society, his evidence and the evidence of my servant, will, I should suppose, corroborate my own.</p>
               <p>Jury. We do not put the gentleman on his defence, we are all satisfied.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer belonging to the India Company; I was ordered to attend by one Mr. Barley, to watch the warehouse where the chest of tea was placed: about a quarter before three, the prisoner came whistling in, he passed me twice, the third time he came to the chest, it was piled three high, there was another stood by the side of it, the top chest was open, and the third time he put his hand and took out some tea; the chest that stood by the side he put his foot on, to reach the tea from the upper chest, he put it in his coat pocket, loose as he took it, after he had done that he put the lid down again very carefully, and walked about three yards, and then I collared him, and he said, for God Almighty's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300125"/> sake, let me go! I shall lose my bread: and so shall I, says I, if I let you go: I took him down to the compting-house, and there he was searched by Mr. Howell, and the tea taken from him, it was hyson tea, I saw him with his hand to his pocket, to throw out the tea, and I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Mr. Barker, was you here last session? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know the prisoner? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Barker, did not your rubber down prevent your going out Crutched-friars way? - No, I never was refused going out that way.</p>

               <p>The first time the prisoner came into the warehouse, he came in whistling? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he see you? - No, he did not, nor would you neither, if you had been there.</p>
               <p>Where was you hid? - I was behind six chests.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this great quantity of tea? - Two shillings, weighing six ounces and a half.</p>

               <p>But you said just now he had promised her forty-five shillings? - She said, you have promised me forty-five shillings, upon my word and oath; ask the woman herself, if she has a mind to say so.</p>

               <p>Levy. I never spoke a word to you.</p>
               <p>Court to Aquilard. Relate what this man said? - I went to my butcher's to order some beef, and this man was there, and a parcel of Jew people, and he came round, and said, if you will take the trunk, he said, if you will give us something for our trouble and make it up; I said, I cannot say any thing about it, and the trunk was sent to my house the next day; the Jew constable asked me if I would take the trunk and give the woman something to make it up.</p>
               <p>Levy. As I stand here upon my oath, I never offered to the gentleman; there was a wedding in Duke's-place, at the butcher's; I was employed as constable; the gentleman came and ordered some meat; says he, have you found any thing of the box? says I, no; says he, if I could but get the box, I would no hurt any body.</p>
               <p>Did not you say what Mr. Acquilard has said? - I did not say thing at all about sending the box, for I did not know any more than he what was done with the box.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was any body else that you know present at the time? - There was the butcher's man I believe that I believe brought the trunk.</p>
               <p>Court. If there was a second witness that is present, I shall order this man to take his trial for perjury? - If I was to be hung up now directly, it is false what the gentleman has said; I shall speak the truth, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Court. Who brought this man here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Turnbull. When there was an examination yesterday before the Grand Jury we found this constable was not with us on the back of the bill, and this gentleman wished to have him, as he knew something about the box.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, this woman came to me the first time; I was washing myself, and the turnkey says to me, there is a black woman enquiring for a prisoner; she went away, and came back with Levy; she said to me, if you will give me forty-five shillings, the money my master lent me to buy my clothes, I will not trouble my self about you, or else I will hang you; I never exchanged two words with the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Levy. Upon your oath, who took the trunk to Mr. Acquilard's? - Upon my oath, I do not know; I do not know the butcher's boy.</p>
               <p>Daniel. The constable told me he knew the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Court to Levy. Who was the man that was with the prisoner? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know the man that took the trunk? - No, my Lord, I do not, if I did I should have told; I never wronged nobody of a farthing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, but his counsel declined examining him.</p>

I do not know whether any body answered, but immediately one of them took my shoe buckles out, and then my knee buckles, which were silver; they said I should meet two more of their companions, and I had the presence of mind to ask them what I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300129"/> say, for they had got my all, and they told me to wish them a good night, and they would let me pass; I got up and went to Stepney, and got four or five men armed, with lanthorns and candle, and went in quest of them till near one in the morning, but found nothing of them.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A very fine moon-light night; I believe it was full moon.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of these men so as to know them again? - Yes, the shortest of the prisoners, Greenough, was the man that held the cutiass.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Positive, very positive; I will give you a reason; one of them says, b - st him, he sees us, he will betray us, cut off his head; in giving them the money, I dropt the half guinea, and one of them says, the b - g - r is dropping the money, cut off his head; from that time I shoved up my hat, and I never took my eye from Greenough; he had a very bright cutlass in his hand.</p>
               <p>Were your eyes fixed on the cutlass or the man? - On both; he did not offer to strike me with it.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say positively that he was one of the men? - Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other prisoner? - I have my doubts about the other.</p>
               <p>How soon after were they taken up? - I believe it was near a month; I gave information on the Friday following at Mr. Justice Wilmott's office; none of my property was ever found.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear to a man that you never saw before, and seeing him in the hurry of this transaction to swear to him at a month's distance? - My Lord, I can; I described him the very man he appears at the bar; I also described him at Justice Wilmott's office; before he was brought to the bar, I described him.</p>

             and I told him to demand his money, or some such a word.</p>
               <p>What else did you say? - I said no more; he made an uproar, and did not consent to give it; Thompson said some word; he made an uproar, and I happened to have a stick in my hand, and I hit him with the stick, and Thompson shoved him down; then Mr. Thompson took his watch out of his pocket; then he took his shoe buckles out of his shoes, and I took one of his knee buckles, and he gave Thompson his money; after that Mr. Greenough said to him, as you go you will see two more of our comrades; and says the gentleman, what shall I say to them? says Greenough, tell them how you have been used, and they will not do any thing to you, but let you pass.</p>
               <p>What weapons had you? - Greenough had a cutlass, and I had a stick; a man came up while we were robbing him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300130"/> and Greenough said, if he made any disturbance, he would cut his head off; he did not meddle with him; the man went on about his business; that was just as we were taking the buckles from him.</p>

               <p>What became of the watch? - That was sold in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Who to? - To one Mrs. Levi in Frying-pan-alley, Petticoat-lane, and the shoe buckles, the knee buckles were pawned by Greenough or Thompson.</p>

               <p>Armstrong. My Lord, they are such sort of people, they never will bring a thing to light; they go into the smouch pot; I spoke to her before this youth was taken up, but she said, she knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Have you never said that Bentley was one? - I think he was the person, I said, I had my doubts about him.</p>
               <p>Then your certainty with respect to Greenough arises from the information of Brown? - No, my Lord, because I positively swore to him.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I take notice of this before you give your verdict, to shew how extremely uncertain the evidence of the prosecutor is; there before the Magistrate, fixing it on Greenough and Bentley, and now coming into Court and upon the evidence of the accomplice changing his account, and fixing it on Greenough only, this changes the degree of his certainty, with respect to Greenough.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I cannot fulfil my duty, without reprehending very much your conduct in this transaction; if this man Brown had not been taken up two or three days ago, before the trial of these prisoners, you might rashly have taken away the life of a man that you now believe to be innocent, that is Bentley; you therefore were very rash in positively charging a man against whom you cannot now support that charge, and that rashness has been the means of discrediting your evidence, with respect to the other prisoner, of whose guilt there is not much reason to doubt.</p>

             were there together, they were endeavouring to persuade her to have a fine ell-wide muslin, and to make it the contrary way; the prisoner said, she would endeavour to make that do; we had a very fine piece of ell-wide muslin; we could not find it; my servant came to me into the compting-house, and asked me if I had seen the muslin that day, I told him I had; I examined the wrapper in which it should have been, which was the wrapper I opened, it was not there; I examined several other wrappers; I then accused the prisoner immediately with the thest; she moved about a yard and a quarter from the muslin; she stepped to the counter, took up three pieces of muslin from the wrapper, gave them a shake, and pulled the other from under her left arm; I examined the wrapper particularly, and am sure it was not there; she had a black cloak on, and the other three pieces fell on the floor with the piece that had been missing.</p>
               <p>Was the situation of her body in such a direction that you could see the piece fall from under her arm? - Yes, I can swear to that; I saw it with my own eyes; I am very sure it did not fall from the counter; she was very dextrous in taking it from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>In the dropping of it, did she employ one hand or two? - She took it from under her left arm; I think she pulled it with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Do you speak with certainty as to that fact? - Yes, I believe I can; I believe she threw it down with her right hand; she was charged with the constable; I took the piece up immediately. (Produced.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300132"/> There are eleven yards of it; I did not know the quantity when I was at Guildhall, I thought it had been eight yards; there is my private mark, which is E. H. five quarter; it is a very particular fine one; we had never another of the same quality; that was the reason it was so particularly enquired after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This was the finest piece you had in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called your attention to it and that of the shopman's, by being dissatisfied with the fineness of all the others? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cloak had she on? - I cannot tell the length.</p>
               <p>Cannot you distinguish a long cloak from a short one? - It was a middling sized cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the terms in which you accused her of having robbed you? - I told her, I believed she had got a piece of our muslin, on which she came to the wrapper.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she took up the other pieces? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do remember her saying, I dare say, Sir, if you examine accurately you will find it? - She did say something to that purpose; she took them up in a very confused manner.</p>
               <p>She had not at that time gone out of your shop at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any stranger in the shop? - No, none at all; there were more than thirty different pieces of muslin in the wrapper; I looked them over very minutely, I suppose we were five minutes looking them over, two or three of us; she wished to go very much.</p>
               <p>What family has that woman besides that infant that is at her breast? - She said, she had four children.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Messers. Railton and Woollett; the prisoner came into our shop at about quarter past six, and asked for a yard of yard and half wide muslin; I asked her to walk in, and I would shew her some.</p>
               <p>When she came in was the other servant in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Before the other servant came into the shop, was there any of the property about the counter or loose any where? - Only that wrapper which I took down to shew her; I shewed her a piece which she did not think fine enough; the other man was not then come down; I shewed her another piece; she thought it was too thin, she said, she wanted it to work; I shewed her another piece, and the other man came down into the shop, and she said, she did not like the price.</p>
               <p>Was your back turned to this woman at any time while she was in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Is your fellow shopman here? - No, he is not; I had no conversation with the other man; he stood by; he asked her whether an ell-wide muslin would do, and he would shew her one; and we looked for it in the wrapper and could not find it; it was a particular fine piece; I took out the pieces, one by one, and it was not in the wrapper, and the prosecutor looked there too; I am very sure I examined the wrapper before I examined the rest; I never left the woman by herself near the counter; she was a yard and as half from the counter during the time we were looking for the muslin; at first when she came into the shop she was close to the counter; as we could not find the muslin, we called our master out of the compting-house; he said, he saw it just before he went up to tea, in the wrapper which I opened first; the prisoner then said, you have no muslin that will do for me; and the prosecutor said, no, but he missed a piece of muslin, and rather suspected she had got it; she said, how can you think I have it, when the young man has not given me an opportunity of going near the wrapper? then she immediately stept up to the counter, and laid hold of three pieces of muslin out of that wrapper with her right hand; she immediately shook them, and said, I dare say we can find them, and she dropped them down, and immediately I saw the muslin drop from under her left arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300133"/>Did she appear to you to lay hold of the muslins that were under her left arm at all? - She put her right hand across her break very quick, and took the muslin from under her left arm.</p>
               <p>Are you satisfied you saw it fall from under her left arm? - I am sure I saw it; I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From the time this woman came into your shop, to the time this was missing, did any other customer come in? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; what they have said, they have sworn wrong.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Did you feel your watch go? - I did my Lord.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch, with a silk ribbon, with a cornelian seal mounted in gold; I made a catch at her, and was immediately attacked by the men, and they beat me from my hips to my head; in the dark entry, there was a ladder, which I got under, and with much difficulty I got up, and saw the patrol, and cried stop that woman, she has robbed me of my watch; and he immediately stopped her.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of the woman at all? - I did for a minute.</p>
               <p>Now the woman that robbed you, was the same woman you saw at the Bull's-head? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>When you was pushed in the court, where was the woman? - Behind me.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - No, it was a very dark night, but I could see the silver case of my watch as she drew it out of my pocket; I could see her gown perfectly clear, the same as she had on when at the Bull-head; it was a dark cotton, and a dark ground.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cloak? - I think a black silk cloak.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it to be the same woman that you saw before? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did she speak to you when you was in the court? - No, they immediately committed their depredations.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the prosecutor in liquor? - I was very sober.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was yours? - By the mark and number, that were upon it; I asked him how he came by it, he said he kicked his foot against it in the street.</p>
               <p>What became of the sugar after? - It was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. I am desired to ask you Sir, whether it had not occurred to you before this to have some conversation with the prisoner, about an intercourse between some of your servants, male and female? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you a nephew? - Yes; the prisoner said to me there were such things going on in my house, that he thought it was a shame.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he descended rather more to particulars, and described that there were intercourses between the men and the maids, that were not very fit? - He said there were.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300135"/>Do you recollect his adding to it, that he was reluctant to state to you who the parties were, because he knew the men would be revenged of him on some occasion? - He did.</p>
               <p>I put all these questions to you with all the expectation that your answers warrant? - You shall have an answer.</p>
               <p>Did you take any steps to enquire about it? - I did not, because I did not believe it; I rather think since, he said so to cloak his design.</p>
               <p>Court. That is your suspicion, Mr. Hawes; we take the substantive facts: In what way was this sugar kept; was it in your mill; and if so, how was that mill guarded from the street? - It is in a room over the mill; far from the street; the prisoner said, he stumbled over the sugar, and was going to take care of it for me; but he was taking it a different way; there is no way of getting at the room where those sugars were kept but by coming over the gate; I have two dogs and no man upon earth dare venture but one of the family, and any of them may come at any time; it is not very difficult to get over the gates, except the dogs; the doors were locked over night, but every man knows where to find the keys.</p>
               <p>Then any of your men, if they had been so disposed, could have got into those rooms? - They could; a ladder was set to go into my hay-loft over the stable; whoever took the sugar must have gone out of the window through the hay-loft.</p>

               <p>I came home at eleven to my master's house, and rang at the gate; he answered me himself from the inside; I went to the door of his dwelling-house, thinking he might let me in; I waited there a quarter of an hour, and then I went to a public house, called for a pint of beer, paid for it, and drank it; I said, some of the men may be locked out as well as me, and I went again to the house, and spied this sack laying down; I took hold of it, and the ladder fell, and I took it up and went down Swan-street; I was going home to my wife, and the patrol took me; some of his men had thrown this out, and they were all Germans.</p>

               <p>You will not swear that; do you mean to swear that you do this without fee or reward, and for the good of your country? - Yes, I do swear that.</p>

               <p>You swear that? - I am employed by nobody.</p>
               <p>Nobody knew before-hand of your doing this? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Nobody promised to give you any thing for it, or to pay you any expences? - No, my Lord, I had no promises from any body.</p>
               <p>Nothing at all? - No; my expences I expect, that is all.</p>
               <p>Did you prosecute Cole for nothing? - The gentleman paid me my expences.</p>
               <p>What did he pay you? - He allowed me a crown a day, but I did no know he would pay me any thing.</p>
               <p>Do not you expect five shillings a day from the Solicitor of the mint on this prosecution? - I do not know, Sir, if he pleases to give it me.</p>
               <p>Do you expect it, Sir? - I do expect it after the trial is over.</p>
               <p>You did not know what a piece was? - No, I did not know what he meant by it.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then upon the former trial you did not swear what a piece meant? - I do not know; I cannot say whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Do you believe you did not? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Since you have been transported how often have you been examined as a witness?</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. I object to that? - I shall not answer without my Lord tells me so.</p>

In about five minutes came Roach and another man in the passage, and they seeing some people standing at the door, turned back; I searched Roach, and in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found five shillings and some good silver; in his breeches pocket I found two; and this five shillings I took out of Abrahams<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300138"/> breeches pocket; Mr. Sargesson who was by, said, search him as well as the others.</p>

               <p>Did Powis give that money to the prisoner? - Yes, I saw him give it; the prisoner went into a back room, and brought the halfpence tied up in my handkerchief and gave them to me; I gave them to Mr. Powis; we paid our reckoning and came away, and the prisoner came along with us over Moorfields; then that Mr. Johnson, that he said made the halfpence, went by us in Moorfields, and the prisoner said Mr. Johnson was worth three hundred pounds a year, and then the prisoner run away, and I thought he was gone to give information against us for buying the half-pence, and I carried the halfpence to the headborough; there was twenty-six shillings and ten pence halfpenny; all that I did this for, was to get the prisoner away; it was fixed on purpose by the inhabitants, because he owned to me he robbed a vessel of one hundred and seventy pounds, and my back door lays at stake.</p>

               <p>Did either of them appear to be much hurt by this fighting? - I cannot say, because Harrison had been much beat and bruised before he began to fight with Stone; he had been beat in the building; he had been fighting before with one Walters, not with the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I live in the court; when I first went up; the noise brought me out; I saw two men fighting; Neale and the deceased; Harrison appeared to have been down; he staggered, and bled at the noise; his lip was thick; he appeared to be fuddled, or badly beat, or both; the prisoner Neale and he, as far as I can remember, closed together, and fell down, and I think Harrison was undermost; the prisoner then turned, and was on his hands and knees, and seemed bleeding much; I know Neale; I knew the other by sight; it was not Stone; they wished the man to get up again; and asked him if he would fight any more.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I think he said, yes; I said, he should not; I thought he was fuddled, and would be killed; I wished to take him away, but the other people said, he should not; I do not remember hearing either of the prisoners open their mouths; I took him up, and was taking him to the pump to wash him, and he fell down, but whether he was struck down or pushed down, or tripped up, I cannot say, but he fell from me, I cannot speak with certainty by whom; it was behind me, he fell down; I believe they asked him if he would fight any more, and I think he said, yes; I cannot speak with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300143"/> any precision afterwards; my wife hearing there were some words, between the other joiner and me, she endeavoured to get me away, and I endeavoured to push her away, and I asked them what they would do with the man, as I understood they had been beating him before.</p>

               <p>I live in the court, I saw them coming into the court, and the deceased seemed to be very much beaten, or very much in liquor, or both; as he came into the court, he was either pushed down or fell down; I did not see distinctly; I saw Neale and Harrison come into the court stripped to fight.</p>
               <p>Did they fight? - They did; the deceased seemed very incapable of fighting, either by being very much beat, or by being in liquor; I saw a great number of unfair blows struck by Neale, striking him when he was down, and coming behind, before he was ready to fight.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw him strike him when he was down? - I am sure I did; I was at a one pair of stairs window all the time; I had been exceeding ill for three or four days, and I asked my wife to let me go down, but she locked the door for fear I should get into any trouble; I could not bear to see the foul play; I saw the man after, he had many blows; Mr. Rutherford went to attempt to take him away, but he could not; I saw one of the joiners or carpenters strike at Mr. Rutherford; but he did not strike him, and his wife came and got him away; then the deceased came up the court, holding his hands before his eyes, and Mr. Neale came behind, and struck him, and knocked him down in the court with a very violent blow; he had a very violent fall backwards with his head to the ground; I said to my wife, the man's scull is fractured, let me go down, but she would not; the others said, Mr. Neale, you seemed more to blame than him.</p>
               <p>Who were the others? - I know none of their names.</p>
               <p>Was any blow struck after this blow? - I do not think there was; the man got up and went to the bottom of the court, and rested his head, and bled for ten minutes before any body came to him; the deceased fell with his face to the ground by that blow; there were several women that saw the same, and said, it was a shameful fight as ever they saw.</p>


               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are you a bit of a boxer yourself? - I do not know; I do not like fighting; it is rather too hard work; but if I am too much imposed upon, I do not like that.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary; I saw the deceased on the Friday following this affray; I was called to him on the Wednesday first; I did not see in what state he was on the Wednesday; I understood he was under the care of some young man, some sea surgeon; on the Friday I was called to him, and attended him to his death.</p>
               <p>What state did you find him in on the Friday? - He was in a very violent delirium and fever; a very strong delirium.</p>
               <p>Did you examine whether he had any wounds or bruises, or what that fever had been occasioned by? - The next day I had his head shaved in order to apply a blister to his head; that was on the Saturday; I examined his head, and there was a slight wound on the back of his head, but there appeared no considerable bruise, but one near his eye; there was some blackness; extravasation, but of little consequence; the wound did not appear to me to be dangerous; for my own satisfaction as well as for that of the deceased's friends, I called in a surgeon of eminence, Mr. Minors the father was called in, who examined his head with me; I was rather of his opinion before; that strengthened my opinion.</p>
               <p>What was the opinion you formed of that man's case? - My opinion is very doubtful, as to the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Are you of opinion that the fever and the delirium were occasioned by the wounds and bruises he received? - That is doubtfull to me; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300144"/>Have you any clue to lead you to any other cause of the fever? - Only what I understood from the friends of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Did you examine whether there were any other considerable bruises about his person? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The man was not in a state himself to give you an account of his complaints? - Not at all, from the time I saw him he was very delirious, and continued so.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Monday following, I think.</p>
               <p>Have you a real doubt in your mind what that fever was occasioned by? - There is a probability it might be occasioned from intoxication, from passion, from anger; or it might be from the falls he received; it is very doubtful to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. I take the case to be that the cause of the death must be proved and drawn from a variety of circumstances; the Court are to form their judgment from the evidence they have heard, and if they are of opinion that the death arose from the ill usage given by that prisoner at the bar, certainly the fact is proved; the fact is to be proved from the result of all the evidence, duly weighed and adjudged upon by the Jury, the Jury are to judge for themselves; suppose a surgeon was to say, where it was manifestly clear that the injury was the occasion of the death, that he was of opinion it was not; is that to blind the Jury? they are not to be hood-winked or blinded; though not persons of professional skill, they are endued with common sense; therefore if they, on the whole of the evidence, are of opinion that the death arose from the prisoner, there is the proof of the fact; the charge in the indictment is certainly murder, but as to the mode of proving it, there is no certain rule laid down in that case any more than in any other; it arises from the whole of the evidence, upon which the Jury are to exercise their judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am very happy to have the opinion and assistance of one of the most able and experienced judges of the law in England; I have no doubt that that fact or any other, may be collected, either from positive testimony, or any other evidence; for instance, if a man is knocked down, his scull fractured, and his brains coming out at the time, I want no surgeon in such a case.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to have Mr. Minors here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Surgeons are called only to assist your judgment, they are not the people to determine this or any other case; you are to exercise your own judgment.</p>

               <p>I knew the deceased Harrison; I was very intimate with him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him on the 24th of July? - I lodged in the next room to him; he was as well as ever I knew him to be; he appeared to me to be in perfect health before that day.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to see him at all, in the morning of the 26th of July? - No, Sir, I did not, he went to work at six o'clock, but the day before, he was in good health, I did not see him that evening, but I saw him the next morning.</p>
               <p>In what condition was he the next morning? - Most dreadfully bruised and cut.</p>
               <p>Where did he principally appear to be bruised? - In his face and head; on the Friday morning following he was taken with a delirium, between two and three in the morning; it was on the Tuesday morning I saw him; I saw him once or twice after, but not to ask him any questions.</p>
               <p>Did he from the Tuesday morning keep his bed? - Yes Sir, he was never out of the room to my knowledge, from the time he came home, till he was carried out.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Monday evening following.</p>
               <p>When you saw him first on the Tuesday morning, were several bruises visible then?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300145"/> - Several, particularly about his body; I had an opportunity of seeing his stomach, when his shirt was open, and he was very cruelly bruised.</p>
               <p>Did the bruises that were visible about his head and face, disappear before his death? - No, Sir, they looked worse and worse, he looked abundantly worse when he was dead than before; I was present when Mr. Gadd was there; I called Mr. Gadd; I was present when his head was shaved; it appeared to me that his wounds were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>I want to ask you the facts that you saw; Mr. Gadd tells us that he saw only one wound upon the head, and one bruise on his face; was the appearance the same to you? - There was one wound when the head was shaved, that was not visible to me before, on the back of the head; I think there was a bruise under one of his ears, and one of his eyes.</p>
               <p>Were there any other bruises visible? - His lip was cut very much.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Gadd. In the examination of his head, you spoke only of one wound? - There was a wound on the back part of the head, and a contusion on the temple near the eye; I do not recollect seeing any more wounds; I did not examine the body at all; his head was not opened in my presence.</p>
               <p>Court. From that blow, though the outward wound might not be mortal, may not a violent blow produce a concussion of the brain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not the back part of the head, a likely place to produce that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does not a concussion of the brain frequently remain for a considerable time after the blow happened, without any dangerous symptoms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then is not the first symptom, that of a strong delirium? - There are generally some lethargic disposition, by the pressure on the brain; he appeared to be sensible on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>In case of a concussion of the brain, would he be likely to be free from those symptoms, from the Monday to the Friday? - From the blow I have heard described, I should hardly think it possible.</p>
               <p>Was there any lethargic symptoms on the Friday? - He was so exceedingly delirious, there was no forming a judgment.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Berry. Do you know whether the deceased slept much from the blow till his death? - He did not appear to sleep sound, he appeared as if he were asleep, but at the same time he could listen to every thing that was said, though not sensible to give an answer to the questions that were asked him.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon; I was called in to examine the body of this man, after his death.</p>
               <p>Did you make that examination? - I did.</p>
               <p>Relate in what state you found the body? - I was called in on a Friday, he died on a Monday.</p>


               <p>Court to Mr. Wilson. When was the day of examination? - On Wednesday the 2d of August, the surgeon was called in then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vickery. I do not recollect the day.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the body of the deceased then? - I found several bruises on the back part of the head, and one wound quite through the scalp of the scull.</p>
               <p>Was it a large wound? - Not very large.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any other bruises about him? - There were some on his neck and back.</p>
               <p>Any on his face? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did you observe or examine his breast or stomach? - There were none; the wounds and bruises were on his head.</p>
               <p>Did you examine and search for any fracture of the scull? - There was no fracture.</p>
               <p>Did you make a compleat examination of the scull? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I cannot assign any particular reason why I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300146"/>Is not it necessary in order to ascertain whether there had been an inward concussion of the brain that occasioned the death, to open the scull that would ascertain the fact? - Not always; it may.</p>
               <p>Then from the exterior and superficial examination that you made could you collect the cause of the man's death? - From having heard the previous symptoms -</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You must speak from the appearance? - From the appearance of the head, and my own observation, I should have thought it very probable that the man died of those blows, had I not heard of one symptom.</p>
               <p>But not certain, none of them that you could pronounce mortal? - Certainly not; oh, no! surely not.</p>
               <p>In addition to the inspection, the man having taken to his bed from the morning he received these bruises, and being seized with a strong delirium early on the Friday morning, joining these symptoms in addition to your inspection, what opinion should you have formed, as a medical man? - The very same opinion I had at first; that they were conjunctively a very probable cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said something of one symptom? - If I had not heard any one of the previous symptoms, from the inspections merely I should have thought they were the cause of his death; I heard that he was delirious; I never saw him alive; I knew nothing more than what I heard from the man that keeps the house; my opinion is not altered by any symptoms I have heard, but rather confirmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This case differs from that; in the dispute between Stone and the deceased, it does not appear that Neale was there; how then can he be aiding and assisting, if the Jury are of opinion that Neale gave the blows and not Stone; they appear to be in evidence two compleat separate and distinct transactions; then the question is, whether the blows and wounds charged to be given by Stone in this indictment can be transferred to Neale; or whether the blows given by Neale, Stone not being present, occasioned the death.</p>

               <p>I know the two prisoners; they are carpenters; they work at the building at Somerset-house; I was at the Coach and Horses; I went there at four o'clock, and while me and my partner were there, Harrison and they came in; the dispute was concerning a wager; they were settling it, and a gentleman's servant seemed to come to mitigate it; there were some few words, and the gentleman's servant offered to fight any man for twenty guineas, and to give him five, and to Stone he said, he would tie one hand behind him.</p>
               <p>What passed with Harrison? - Harrison called them a parcel of thieves; and through that a scuffle ensued between him and Stone; they had two or three falls, and Harrison kept Stone down by the hair of the head till he was released; then they got up again, then they were down again, till the matter was settled, and they left off fighting, then they sat down and drank together.</p>
               <p>Which of them had the worst of it that time? - I cannot certainly say.</p>
               <p>Did you see what happened between Neale and Harrison after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the quarrel between Stone and Harrison? - About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Was the quarrel between Stone and Harrison all completely over? - Yes, and they had drank together; then the gentleman's servant offered to fight, and Neale and Harrison fought a little while in the room, then they went out in the court; Harrison the deceased and this gentleman's servant said they would fight any man in the room.</p>
               <p>Did the servant appear to have been drinking? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300147"/>Did you see Neale and the deceased fight when they went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The deceased was pretty severely beaten by Neale, was not he? - No, I wished them not to fight; Neale was not able to stand against such a man as Harrison was.</p>
               <p>Was not Harrison in liquor? - They were all in liquor; Neale was in liquor; Neale was obligated to fight him, or else he would have licked him.</p>
               <p>Mind what you say? - My account is authentic, and the real truth; Neale did not wish to fight him; he would fight after the gentleman's servant had offered twenty guineas to fight; they said they would fight in another room.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that Neale did not beat Harrison very much when they fought without? - No, Sir, he did not beat him, what was hurt was through falls.</p>
               <p>Did not Neale strike him? - Undoubtedly, when they were fighting; he would have fought again; he never struck him to hurt him; I do not think he did; his hurt was through falling.</p>
               <p>Who gave him those falls? - Neale and he in scuffling fell down together, and he held down Neale by the hair of his head, and apparently would have smothered him; the blood gushed out of Harrison's face; that was through the falls I look upon it; when they fell there was no knowing which would fall to the ground first.</p>
               <p>Which had the better of the fight? - Harrison was too strong for Neale by much; if it had not been for the tumbling, and nobody knew which would fall first.</p>

               <p>Which was the stoutest man of the two? - The deceased I suppose was able to fight two such as Neale, a very powerful man; they had several falls in the court; I do not know there was a blow given that was the occasion of his death; the deceased shewed very foul play; the foulest play that could be; they struggled together; the worst fall was at last, and I did not know which would come to the ground first, till Harrison slipped undermost; they were hanging together; here is a person present that laid Harrison down to take his breath, and he jumped up and put himself into a position to fight, and then he received one blow more, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court. Harrison had had two falls before he fought with Neale? - I did not see him fight.</p>
               <p>Was not he very much in liquor? - I believe each party was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was Neale in liquor? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I believe I am.</p>
               <p>Are you sure? - I am.</p>
               <p>Was not Harrison in liquor? - He was; he would not let the people alone; there was a person present that trod on his toes and spit in his face to fight, and he would not fight; I only just went out along with Neale; I did not meddle with any body, but came up when he was down; he was an entire stranger to me; I never was in his company before in my life, nor the other party neither; I work for Mr. Lewington opposite Somerset house.</p>

               <p>Did you examine his head and face? - I examined his head, the result of that examination was, there was a slight wound on his head, and the man was in a putrid fever; the man had no injury, that I thought would be of any consequence for surgery, and therefore he was more a subject of physical assistance; what might be the cause of it, I know not; I believe I told Mr. Gad the same; it is your business, it is none of mine.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what offence? - For robbing my grounds of a piece of callico; I saw it since at Bow-street, about a month ago; I think this to be the same I lost; because there never was any but that one piece in that state, it was unfinished when it was taken; it was a pattern peculiar to myself, it was without blue or green in it, there was enough to make four gowns.</p>
               <p>Was you present when this prisoner was examined in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she say there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was she sworn? - She was.</p>
               <p>I submit we cannot hear what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot receive in evidence any thing she has said on oath.</p>
               <p>Philpot. Her examination was taken in writing, she did not sign it, she denied it all; as she was going in the coach, she said she new Venner, and would tell the whole in Bow-street; she said the piece was brought to her in her own dwelling; I made her no promise, she said she bought two pieces of him; I cannot say the sum; I took out the pattern and she said that was it; what she said she gave, was not above a third of the value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you remember any conversation about a person of the name of Fiddle? - Yes, she was bound over to prosecute this woman; but we cannot find her; the prisoner said she did not know it to be stolen.</p>

               <p>I went to the prisoner's house to get a piece of sattin, to seat a pair of breeches, and whilst I was there, Bet Fiddle came in with a black silk handkerchief, and she asked the daughter to buy a remnant of cotton, and it happened to be callico; she pressed her to buy it, and says the daughter, where did you get it? says she, I bought it of a fair hair'd man, from on board a ship; then the mother came in, and she asked her to buy it, and offered it her worth her money; says the old woman in answer, where did you get it? I have bought it, says she, of a fair hair'd man that duffs on board a ship; it measured nine yards and three quarters, and she asked her, what she asked for it, and she gave her eighteen shillings, and sixpence was spent in a quartern of brandy; she paid seven shillings and sixpence in silver, and half a guinea; I did not drink a spoonful of brandy; I would not give above half a crown, or two shillings and four-pence a yard for it; I thought it a fair price as a smuggled remnant; I never saw her wear it but once; I do not know what became of the rest; I think there might be four yards left, after she had a gown made; one colour is red, and the other purple, and it is grounded with pepper and salt colour; I could tell it without seeing it; I am sure that is the pattern, upon my oath, if I was never to be delivered of what I am carrying; I would have bought it myself if I had the money.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in company with the prisoner when the prosecutor was carrying this brandy on his head, he was coming across the street, the officer followed him in, he got as far as the bar, and he looked under his left hand and saw the officer, and he asked him if he had a permit, he immediately answered, d - n your blood what is that to you? accordingly the officer said, he would be satisfied before he would go out of the place; accordingly the man said, did he know who he was; and the other told him he should know before he went out; the man that had the cann on his head went towards the back door, that goes through; the officer immediately got with his back to the door, the man came towards the bar again; all this time he would not suffer the officer to look at it, and the officer stood over his head and reached out his rule, and tasted the brandy, and told him not to go out till he was satisfied; all this while he made opposition, and would not suffer the officer to examine; then when the prosecutor said, have it he should not, he would lose his life first; the officer stood at the door, and was trying to keep him from going out; when he could not, he kept hold of the cann<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300153"/> with his right hand, and wanted to drag him from the door; in consequence of this the porter gave him a blow, and struck the officer and brought him with his knee to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that he struck the officer? - Yes, I do mean to swear it; the officer fell down upon his knee, he recovered again, and the man struck at him again; the man said, if I cannot get it out from you, I will throw it a-top of you, and he took it and poured it over the excise officer, and it ran down in this manner, and he says to me, what are you about, cannot you assist me in my duty; I went and took the cann off the man's head, and saved about one half of the liquor; then immediately he told him he had fire arms about him, and he caught hold of him, and said if he had not the liquor, he would use him as he pleased; the man made a blow at him, the prisoner stood by, and missed the blow, and the pistol went off at that time.</p>
               <p>Could not the prisoner if he had been determined to shoot at him, have hit him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Parry make use of abusive language to the prisoner? - He did, he d - ned his blood, and said he knew he was an impostor; he told him at first, if he had not a permit, he would seize it for the King; when he found he could do no more, he was determined to spill the liquor; when the liquor was all running over, it was not till then that he produced the pistol; and even then, Parry aimed a blow at him again; he said d - n you, if I cannot get it from you, I will throw it over you; he held it on his head, and fell tapping it upon his head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then he did not throw the cann down? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he threw the liquor over his head and the cann? - He said, he would keep the liquor on his head, but he kept the cann on his head, the cann was taken off by me, he did not throw it down at all."</p>
               <p>To Parry. You are a servant to a brandy merchant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Richardson and Stephenson.</p>
               <p>What passed at the time you met with Gastineaux? - I went to dinner about a quarter I believe it was before two, and when I came back Mr. Richardson ordered me to take some brandy to Mr. Gurney's; when I got to Gurney's house, I saw two men come after me into the house; the prisoner is one, and Gastineaux was the other; I had not a permit with me, I just turned my eye round, and I heard somebody touch the cann with a stick, and the prisoner asked me what I had; I told him what he had no business with; he said he insisted on knowing what I had, I asked him particularly whether he belonged to the Excise, and to shew his deputation, and he said his name was in the Excise, and was well known there; when I insisted on seeing his deputation, Gastineaux said he was an officer; I was in the house; I told him I did not care what he was, he insisted on having the liquors, and I told him I should go home with the liquors again to my master's for a permit; I went up a passage in the house, with an intent to go home, and Gastineaux ran under my arm and stopped me, and brought me back again to the place where I stood first; I do not know what words passed particularly, but some words passed; I told him if he had a mind to seize the liquor on my head he might take it down, he wanted me to put it down; I told him I would not, Gastineaux clapped himself a second time against the door, and got hold of my collar, and tore my jacket, and then he gave a push against me till the cann fell down flat to the floor.</p>
               <p>Did the cann fall down? - The cann fell down.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure the cann fell down? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Was the liquor spilt? - The liquor was spilled in the passage, some of it fell in my shoes, and some might fall on Gastineaux.</p>
               <p>Jury. All of it? - No, I should think not, because it was in a five gallon cann.</p>
               <p>Before this happened had you poured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300154"/> any of the liquor over any person? - No, I did not; I could not say the liquor did not go over him, the cann fell down by his pushing between him and me, I had some of it over me, and he might have some of it; I did not pour the liquor wilfully over any person.</p>
               <p>Did you by accident? - I could not see the cann; it might, the cann being full the passage was narrow; I was looking at the brandy, and Gastineaux stood against the door, and at that time I heard somebody behind me cry out mind; I turned round, and as far as I can tell, I saw the pistol within a few inches of my body; I never touched the pistol; I dropped down on one side, and in that instant the pistol went off, and wounded my fore finger of my right hand.</p>
               <p>Describe in what manner you dropped down? - I turned round in the twinkling of an eye, and dropped on my left hand flat to the ground, and had this right hand up, and the pistol went off, and wounded the hand that I held up.</p>
               <p>Is what you have told us all that passed before the pistol went off? - It is.</p>
               <p>Did you pour the brandy upon him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you knock him to the ground; - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you attempt to strike him? - I did not, I am sure of it, and another thing that the prisoner said, that I dammed his blood, that is not true; I am not a man given to swearing.</p>
               <p>Court. You swear positively that you neither struck him, nor attempted to strike him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Nor had hold of his clothes, nor any thing of that kind? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How many persons were present? - Several.</p>
               <p>Did the pistol hurt any body besides yourself? - It hurt one

            , it lodged in his side; I think he is gone to sea.</p>
               <p>It would have hit you, if you had not dropt down? - Certainly Sir.</p>
               <p>Did Gastineaux say any thing in the presence of that man, after he had shot at you? - I cannot say any thing to that.</p>
               <p>You did not hear it? - No Sir, because I was not there, after I took him to the tap room, I went to my masters.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that nobody took the cann from your head? - I am sure of that, the cann fell quite to the ground.</p>
               <p>Did Gastineaux fall down at all? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of it, not before the pistol went off.</p>
               <p>What made him fall down afterwards? - I took hold of him, and he fell down, and begged of me not to kill him, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Before the pistol went off you made no attempt to strike at Gastineaux? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing, when the cann fell down? - I fancy I did say something to this purpose, now you have done a fine job; I had my head down, looking at the brandy, and it was something of those words.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish I should ask this witness any other questions? - Yes Sir, one half of the liquor I saved and is in the Excise Office now, and if it fell off, it is very odd I should.</p>
               <p>Court to Parry. What sort of a cann was this? - A five gallon copper cann, narrow at top and broad at the bottom, as they have them at the distillers.</p>
               <p>How high is it? - About fifteen inches high, very broad at the bottom and narrow at the top.</p>
               <p>Did it fall on the mouth or the bottom? - I did not observe that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw part of this transaction at Mr. Gurney's house, on the 3d of May, as near as I can recollect, about half past two I came into Mr. Gurney's house; when I came in, I saw Gastineaux the Excise Officer, and this prisoner standing before the bar, before the porter, with a five gallon cann on his head, which I was told had liquor in it, the Excise Officer said, have you got a permit? he said I have, but I have it not here; he went into the bar, when he had been a little while in the bar; the Excise Officer said to the porter, there you may stand as long as you please; a little while after Parry said I will go, you may follow me; the Excise Officer went after him, and said you shall not go; and then I heard the falling of a cann; it certainly was the falling of a cann by the noise, I heard not an uncivil word spoken by the porter; I heard the cann fall with a considerable noise, I am sure by the noise it must fall, it could not be set down by any person; when I came to the corner of the passage, looking round, I saw the Excise Officer hold a pistol at the porter and fire it off, and by the position I stood in the ball must have passed within a foot of my body, and it went through the coat and grazed the side of a man that belonged to the India Warehouse, his name is Jones, and it lodged in the side of Turner, Gurney's man; Turner said immediately I have got it, he was immediately carried into the bar.</p>
               <p>At the time you saw Parry, was he in the position of a man striking him? - He was not; I could not see in the passage, because I was in the bar, when I ran to the corner of the passage I saw him holding the pistol in his hand.</p>
               <p>Could you have seen Parry attempting to strike him at the moment he fired the pistol? - I certainly could; at the moment he fired the pistol, there was no attempt to strike him.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this did you hear Gastineaux say any thing as to what he had done? - Yes, I went up to him, and I said, you have shot a man, says he, I did not intend to shoot the man I have wounded, I intended to shoot the porter; he has often used me ill in the streets; sneered and laughed at me, and bid me defiance; the prisoner was present at the table in the tap room and heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. After the cann fell, when you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300157"/> went to the corner of the passage and looked round, what did you first see? - I first saw the excise officer close to the porter, and holding something to his side, which I did not know was a pistol till I saw it go off.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Mr. Gurney's on the 3d of May; I came in just as the officer and the porter came in together; I happened to hear some words from the officer to the porter; I stood by them to listen, by the porter, I mean Parry; the officer asked the porter, what he had got there in his cann; he said, it was not material to him; he said, he would see, and he tasted it with his gauging rule, and he put the rule into the cann, and said, it was brandy; well, says he, I shall seize it; very well, says Parry, if you will go with me to my master's, you may see the permit; words passed; they waited a little time; one said, I insist on having it, and the other refused taking it down, and said, he should not have it; then in a little time, the porter attempted to go out at the door, and told Gastineaux that he might go with him if he chose, and Gastineaux made no reply, but slipped by him and put his back to the door; Parry desired to have liberty to go out of the door; the other refused it; there was not a single word passed by any person but themselves; I saw them myself, I stood in the passage and had a fair sight of them; then I saw the pistol taken out and held in his hand, then somebody that stood by me said he was going to fire.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass before you saw the pistol? - Only the porter desiring to go out, and the other told him he should not.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing happened at all, I do not mean words? - Nothing at all, then the man stooped and spilled some of the liquor, the porter saw the pistol and stooped down to save himself, then the liquor fell off at that time; whether Gastineaux had a hand in it or no, I cannot say; the door has no glass in it.</p>
               <p>Did the cann fall off his head, or was it taken off his head? - I could not see that, the passage there has no light in it, at least the shutter was up; I could not see whether it fell or whether Gastineaux put his hand on and took it; I heard a noise, a kind of a bump; it gave a rebound.</p>
               <p>What passed when you saw the pistol produced? - Nothing at all, but only he fired a pistol as soon as ever he drew it; I saw the porter stooping, or otherwise he would have had it through the side of his head, and he shot his finger; there was a constable in the tap room, he called out, who fired this pistol.</p>
               <p>Did you see Parry strike? - There was no striking or any thing of the kind; if Parry had struck I must have seen it; I mean to say upon my oath, he did not strike him, nor attempt to strike him.</p>
               <p>Did you see Gastineaux come down on the ground with one knee? - I did not, I am confident if Parry had attempted to strike him I must see it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Gastineaux say any thing afterwards in the hearing of this prisoner? - Not any thing material in the passage; M'Gowan was th10e nearest to him; he was the only assistant he had.</p>
               <p>What did you hear Gastineaux say in the tap room? - He said, he fired the pistol, he said, he did not mean to wound or shoot any one that had been wounded, but the porter.</p>
               <p>Court to Parry. I think you say that after the dispute about going out, when the officer insisted he should not go out, that you saw the officer take out a pistol? - I did.</p>
               <p>And, if I understand you right, you say, that nothing happened between them, except that dispute before he took out the pistol? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Then you describe it as if the liquor had been spilled, and the cann fallen or taken off when the porter stooped to avoid the pistol? - It appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the pistol before the liquor was spilled? - I did; it appeared to me that the cann was on his head, when the pistol was in Gastineaux's hands; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300158"/> the pistol before the cann was off his head.</p>
               <p>You say you could not see whether the cann fell off, or whether Gastineaux took it off? - No, I could not, because there was no light but the reflection from the area.</p>
               <p>Then there was but little light in the passage? - Very little light.</p>
               <p>And it is owing to that I think you said, that you could not distinctly say whether the cann fell or whether he took it off? - It was; there were people stood there, and one had a better opportunity one time than another.</p>
               <p>How could you see whether Parry struck Gastineaux or not? - Oh, it was light enough to see all that; the cann was on his head till the pistol was taken out, then when it was held in this manner, Parry stooped down; I could see the cann on his head when he stooped, because I was not four feet off, it was the moment he stooped that the pistol went off, and then the cann must fall, and the liquor be spilled in the same moment.</p>
               <p>Was M'Gowan between you and him? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was he at that time? - He was in the tap-room, or by the bar which joins to the tap-room; for there were nobody in the passage but Gastineaux and Parry.</p>
               <p>I think you said he was near him, as the person assisting him? - That was when he first began to talk, but in the passage there was nobody but Parry and Gastineaux: M'Gowan was near the bar, but I did not see him in the passage;

            ; two men were enquiring what he had on his head, and they desired him to let them see, the prisoner was one of the men, and the other was the Excise-man; he dipped in the rule to see what it was, and I believe he said it was brandy, there were more words; I returned into the tap-room again to my company, then I heard the porter say, good bye to you, or something to that purpose, and he went out to the passage, and went to go out of the house, and went to pull the door open, and the Exciseman got between him and the door, the porter could not get out, and the Exciseman caught hold of his coat, and tore his coat, and gave him a twink, and with that struggle the cann fell down; I am very positive the cann fell off his head, I am quite sure nobody took it off.</p>
               <p>Had you seen Parry pouring any of that liquor over Gastineaux before he took it off his head? - No, I did not, I must have seen it if it had, it fell off his head in that struggle, the porter looked to the ground, and spoke something I do not know what, it was then the pistol went off, some person cried out, but I did not see the pistol till I heard the report; the porter heard the person cry out, and he looked at the Exciseman, I saw the porter drop down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300159"/> the ball of the pistol went through my coat.</p>
               <p>Did Parry offer to strike Gastineaux before this? - No, never, I must have seen him if any blow had been struck, or if he had been brought with his knee to the ground; I do take upon myself to say, that he did not strike him in the passage, nor before the pistol went off, nor even attempted to strike him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Gastineaux say any thing afterwards in the presence of the prisoner? - I heard him say in the tap room when they were both taken, that he was the person that fired the pistol, and what he had done he could justify, or stand by, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after the cann fell to the ground before the pistol went off? - Almost directly after, I suppose within a minute.</p>
               <p>Did the cann fall down in the porter dropping to avoid the pistol, or did it fall off before? - It fell off in the struggle before, as I said before, with that jerk.</p>
               <p>Then it was off his head at the time he dropped down? - Yes.</p>

You have been convicted on very clear and satisfactory evidence certainly, of a perjury which in its nature must have been wilful and corrupt; there is no doubt of it, and arising from a desire that this man should have escaped the hands of justice: the offence of perjury is one extremely dangerous in its nature, and cuts up all the bonds of society by the roots; takes away the confidence between man and man, upon which the lives, liberties, and properties of all the subjects in the kingdom must depend; and it tends directly to obstruct the course of justice, and destroy the due administration of the law; it has also this further mischievous tendency, that when given in behalf of prisoners on their trial, it tends to destroy the sanction of an oath, and the confidence that a Jury ought to pay to fair and honest witnesses; for all these reasons it is an offence extremely dangerous to society and the public; therefore the sentence of the Court is, that you be</p>

               <p>"Prisoners at the bar, you have all</p>
               <p>"been convicted upon satisfactory evidence,</p>
               <p>"and by the verdicts of very merciful</p>
               <p>"and attentive juries, of crimes</p>
               <p>"which the laws of your country have</p>
               <p>"thought necessary to punish with death;</p>
               <p>"the dread of that punishment, the respect</p>
               <p>"due to the laws of God and your</p>
               <p>"Country, and even the dreadful examples</p>
               <p>"which have been held forth to you</p>
               <p>"by other unfortunate and wretched sufferers,</p>
               <p>"in situations similar to yours,</p>
               <p>"have unhappily for you been insufficient,</p>
               <p>"to produce that effect on your minds,</p>
               <p>"which should have deterred you from</p>
               <p>"the commission of those crimes which</p>
               <p>"have brought you into a like unfortunate</p>
               <p>"situation: It would therefore</p>
               <p>"be in vain for me to expect that any</p>
               <p>"thing I can say to you would make a deeper</p>
               <p>"impression on you than those repeated</p>
               <p>"examples. It therefore only remains for</p>
               <p>"me (after earnestly praying that the little</p>
               <p>"time which now will be allotted to you to</p>
               <p>"live, should be so employed as to secure</p>
               <p>"that pardon for you hereafter, which</p>
               <p>"you cannot hope to receive here) to</p>
               <p>"proceed to the last and most painful part</p>
               <p>"of my duty, in pronouncing on you the</p>
               <p>"dreadful sentence of the law, which is,</p>
               <p>"that you, and each of you, be taken from</p>
               <p>"hence to the place from whence you</p>
               <p>"came, and from thence to the place of</p>
               <p>"execution, there to be hanged by the</p>
               <p>"neck until you are dead: and may the</p>
               <p>"Lord have mercy upon your sinful</p>
               <p>"souls.</p>
               <p>Received Sentence of Death, 15, (viz.)</p>
