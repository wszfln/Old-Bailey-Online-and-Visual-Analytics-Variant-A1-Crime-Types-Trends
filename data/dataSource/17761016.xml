               <p>Tell my lord and the jury what passed about your advancing 2000 l. upon India warrants, I believe? - It was; I believe it was about the 3d of last-March, but I cannot charge my memory to the day, but I have a paper in my pocket which will I believe inform me; the prisoner married the daughter of Mr. Fuller, who I have known many years; he was a bookseller, but has left off that trade and is now a stock broker; he has bought and sold stock for me, and is an old acquaintance; Mr. Fuller told me his son was concerned very capitally in the drug and watch trade, but the business he came on was to desire me to advance 2000 l. upon India warrants; I told Mr. Fuller, that I did not understand these kind of things; that I never saw one of those warrants in my life, but that I had a tenant, a Mr. Maud, a grocer in Carnaby-market; that I did imagine they were something in the way of tea warrants, and would call upon him; Mr. Maud told me India warrants were very good things, and that money was frequently advanced upon them; I got Mr. Maud indeed to go with me on the Monday to look at these warrants; it was on the Saturday preceding that they applied to me; we went to the Antelope tavern, I think, but no warrants were produced then; I had some Scotch Air bonds by me, I carried nineteen in my pocket, which I left with Mr. Maud, and desired him to look over the warrants, and if he found them proper to give the bond to Mr. Fuller, who was likewise present; Air bonds bore at that time, I believe 6 l. premium; I left the business at that time with Mr. Maud and Mr. Fuller; I was very easy about Mr. Fuller; he has had 4 or 5000 l. of my money at a time; I heard no more of it till the Wednesday morning following; Mr. Maud sent his nephew and the prisoner, and Mr. Fuller along with him; they had not sold all the bonds; Mr. Fuller said, if he had sold the whole in one day it would sink the premium, but he had sold 500 l. Air bonds at 5 per cent. premium; they said they would go to Mr. Dornford's a wine merchant, who they said had advanced money upon these warrants, and when they had sold the rest of the bonds they would bring me the warrants; Mr. Davis told me, that his warrants were in Mr. Dornford's hands, who wanted his money, and that he borrowed the money of me to take the warrants out of Mr. Dornford's hands.</p>
               <p>Had you any note, or any acknowledgment from the prisoner? - Not till a day or two afterwards; I believe not till the whole transaction was settled, three or four days, or a week afterwards; the note was given for three months, that note is destroyed.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - For 1900 or 2000 l.</p>
               <p>The supposed value of the bonds? - I suppose so; I waited frequently upon the prisoner in Charterhouse-square; I be spoke indeed a watch of him, I begged he would be punctual to the time, for I could not let my money out any longer; when the three months came he could not let me have it then; he said he was going into Scotland and had a great deal of money due to him, and that if I would let him have it for three months more, he would certainly pay it at the end of that period; I told him the warrants he had lodged in my hands were things I did not understand; he had delivered the warrants to me.</p>
               <p>What number? - I don't know; I said you must give me a power to go and claim these goods, and have them sold.</p>
               <p>You have got the warrant in your hand which is the subject of this indictment, be so good as tell us the number of that? - 540.</p>
               <p>What is the lot? - 934.</p>
               <p>Now that he delivered to you as an East India warrant for the delivery of these goods? - Iimagine so.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I will not take upon me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160010"/> swear that this is the very identical thing that was in my custody; they were delivered at three different periods.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say that you cannot be positive that that was the warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>But something that he represented as a warrant he gave you? - These sort of things to be sure I had of him.</p>
               <p>Did he at that time give you any list of the warrants that he delivered to you, or any acknowledgment for the money under his hand? - Here it is (producing it).</p>
               <p>That is his hand writing, is it? - To be sure it is.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after the note was given that he delivered these warrants? - Certainly before, for he must take the lists from what he left.</p>
               <p>What time was it, in March, April, May, or when? - I received three different parcels at three different times, which I apprehend was in the month of March.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. That list you received from Davis? - I did.</p>
               <p>When did you receive it from him? - This was a second engagement after the note of hand was given for three months, the 25th of June 1776.</p>
               <p>Did you upon the receipt of this deliver up the note he gave you in the March preceding? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any note from him then? - Ie ceived that.</p>
               <p>Any other paper? - No; there is a power in that to sell these goods.</p>

               <p>Did you or not find it necessary to have these warrants indorsed, and what happened upon indorsing them? - As I take that engagement, it meant if he did not pay the money I was to sell the goods at the time; I asked Mr. Hodges, who keeps a lottery office the lower part of my house in Pall-mall; as he often goes to 'Change I mentioned the transaction to him; I gave him a couple of these warrants, and asked him to enquire if they were good; he brought them back to me, and said they were good, but they ought to be indorsed; that when they were indorsed he would carry them all together and examine them; I applied to the prisoner for them to be indorsed; he said he would bring the broker to indorsed them at any time.</p>
               <p>Did he say who was the broker? - Barbaud: I went to Mr. Davis's house and desired he would get them signed; he said he would bring the man, but he never did; I told him he used me very ill, there was no difficulty in bringing the broker to my house; he at last appointed a coffee house at Charing-cross, and there they were indorsed; I did not go with them myself; I said I did not like coffee houses, I would not go among a mob of people; I sent

               <p>Was this warrant you have produced one of those that were so indorsed? - I cannot say; all the warrants that I had at that time in my custody were, except two or three that I have at home in the name of another broker.</p>
               <p>All that are contained in that list in the name of Barbaud were indorsed then? - They were.</p>

               <p>"lot 934, Sticklack 43. 16 s. 8 d." was one of the warrants that you received from him or no? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>What did you do with all the papers that were purported to be signed Barbaud, which you received from the prisoner? - I locked them up in my strong box.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver all you received from the prisoner to Hodges? - I did.</p>
               <p>You received the warrants first of all from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had them in your custody some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you first deliver them to? - Mais to be indorsed.</p>
               <p>When he brought them back, what did you do with them? - Locked them up for some time in my box, and then delivered them to Mr. Hodges.</p>
               <p>All of them with Barbaud's name? - I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you by that paper? - Certainly Davis gave it me, if it was one of those that Davis gave me.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you by it to-day? - I had it of Mr. Chetham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. Who did you receive it of? - Mr. Sims.</p>

               <p>Have you parted with them to any body else to look at them or examine them? - Yes, I have to Mr. Rutt, a stock-broker in Birchin-lane; he had them for an hour or more out of my custody.</p>
               <p>When had he them? - I believe it was in the month of June or the beginning of July.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you give them to him? - To ask him if they were a proper security.</p>
               <p>And what Mr. Rutt did with them you don't know? - He brought them to me again.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver them to any one else? - I have shewn them to different people.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Drybutter at any and what time apply to you about India warrants? - He did some time in July last; he desired that I would see some East India warrants indorsed; I was to go to a coffee house that same evening to see this warrant indorsed; I think it was Old Slaughter's coffee house in St. Martin's-lane; I was to meet a Mr. Barbaud there in company with Mr. Davis; Mr. Drybutter delivered me the warrants; I went to Slaughter's coffee house ; Mr. Davis only was there at that time, and he appointed another day; Mr. Drybutter spoke to me again and said, Mr. Barbaud will be at the Golden Cross coffee house at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you at Slaughter's coffee house? - He said something or other detained Barbaud; Mr. Drybutter gave me the warrants, and I went afterwards to the Golden Cross; I was introduced to Mr. Slop and Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>You did not know either Barbaud or Slop? - No, the prisoner at the bar said, this is the gentleman; he did not call him Barbaud; I produced the warrants, and Mr. Slop took them and inspected into each before he indorsed them, not only that, but he returned three, which he said were not to be indorsed in the name of Barbaud, and which, I believe, Mr. Drybutter has now in his possession.</p>
               <p>How many were indorsed with the name of Barbaud? - I cannot say; I did not inspect into the contents of them.</p>
               <p>When they were so indorsed, what did you do with them? - Returned them all together to Mr. Drybutter; Mr. Davis went with me to Mr. Drybutter, and I left him and Mr. Drybutter together.</p>
               <p>Did Davis say any thing to Slop? - He did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160012"/> not say any thing to Slop; he said, this is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>But the first time you went to Slaughter's coffee house, you went expecting to meet Barbaud? - Yes; the person that was to indorse the warrants.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the Golden Cross say any thing of Barbaud, or mention his name? - I asked him if he expected to see Mr. Barbaud; he said, he supposed Mr. Barbaud had business in the city, but he should see him that day or in a day or two, and he would appoint a time.</p>
               <p>And when you came into the Golden Cross, Charing-cross, he said, this is the gentleman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You don't know how many were indorsed by Slop? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did Davis at that time when you met him in the coffee house at Charing-cross, inspect these warrants? - He gave them to Slop; I apprehended Davis did not inspect into them, or else he must have seen that three warrants were not to be indorsed by Barbaud, and he would not have presented them to Slop.</p>
               <p>How came Davis by these warrants? - They were put upon a table, and he gave them, I believe, one by one to Slop.</p>
               <p>Did he give them separately or all in a lump to Slop? - I think separately.</p>
               <p>But he did not inspect them? - I do not recollect that he did.</p>

               <p>Mais was there all the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Look at that, is that the warrant you indorsed? - It is; I then went home, it was too late to go to Mr. Matevia's service; in the morning when I went I called Mr. Clarke, Mr. Matevia's book-keeper aside, and told him what I had done.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Going on of nineteen.</p>
               <p>Was you a clerk at Mr. Matevia's office when Mr. Davis came to enquire for a clerk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you been a clerk there? - Not quite a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Davis had a character of you from any body? - I don't know; he did not tell me he had; Mr. Clarke told me Mr. Davis had spoke to him.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in his service before he asked you to do this job for him? - I was not in his service when I did it.</p>
               <p>Then this was by way of essay, to see whether you was fit to serve him? - No; he wanted me very much, I could not leave my place directly.</p>
               <p>You made an agreement with Mr. Davis at what wages to serve him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long before this? - I cannot say how many days.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards go to live with him at all? - Yes, on the 17th of July.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the business you have given an account of? - I do not remember the day of the month when I signed the warrants.</p>
               <p>How many days or weeks do you think it was after you had done this business, that you came to serve him? - It may be a fortnight or twelve or nine days, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>You say this broken piece of paper the gentleman produced to you just now, is the very paper that you saw Mr. Davis write the name

               <p>Did you ever see an India warrant before this? - I have, but I never inspected into the clerk's signing them.</p>
               <p>You understood the nature of India warrants? - I was not conversant enough in it readily to fill up one.</p>
               <p>But you knew enough of warrants to know that it was necessary to indorse the warrant in order to entitle the person that was a bearer of it to the delivery of the goods? - I did not know about the indorsement so much as I do now, I knew it was some form.</p>
               <p>But you knew it to be a necessary form; you never saw one forged before I dare say? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you give him any advice, or say any thing upon the occasion? - He expressed an uneasiness at the part he had taken, and asked me if he run any risque; in the manner he related what had passed, I really did believe it was a mere matter of form; that the fact was as Mr. Davis had stated it; that the warrants were real, and that the name of Barbaud's not being upon it was an omission, as he had represented it to Slop, and that the consequence of Slop's indorsing the name of Barbaud would not be detrimental to him.</p>
               <p>So you told him it was a mere matter of orm and could not be detrimental to him? - I told him, that from the manner of his relating it, I thought it a mere matter of form.</p>

               <p>Look at that? - (the forged warrant) I think it is something like his hand writing.</p>
               <p>You have often seen him write? - Very often indeed.</p>
               <p>You think that is his hand writing? - I think it to be so.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Is it all together like his hand writing? - I cannot absolutely say that it is his hand writing or all together like it, it appears to me to be like his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Do you mean his common and usual manner of writing? - I cannot absolutely say that it is his hand writing, but I think it is.</p>
               <p>You have seen Davis write very often? - I have.</p>
               <p>Then you, who are a man of business, must be so conversant with his hand as to perfectly understand whether that is like his hand writing? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160016"/>May be you may have seen him write, or have received letters from him? - I have seen him write and received letters from him some time ago.</p>
               <p>You are well acquainted with his hand writing? - I am.</p>
               <p>Then I should think you would not pause upon it, but boldly pronounce, that this is his hand writing? - I do every thing but swear to it.</p>
               <p>Have you any particular meaning when you lay an emphasis upon the word something? - I have this meaning; that I cannot absolutely swear to a man's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Then you are doubtful? - I am not.</p>
               <p>It is a very plain question I ask you; if I was asked the question you are, I would say I had no meaning at all in the word something, to distinguish it from being very like, I would say that, or else I would say, that I delivered the word something, meaning to imply in it some degree of doubt; now is it one or other of these you mean? - I have no doubt that it is his hand writing; I meant by something, that I would substitute something; not to say that it is absolutely his hand.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Was you not formerly in partnership with the prisoner? - I was.</p>
               <p>You have often seen him write then? - Very often.</p>
               <p>COURT. Would you be willing to swear to any man's hand writing? - I would not indeed.</p>
               <p>Would you swear as much to this as to any other man's hand writing that you had not seen write the thing? - I would.</p>

             from giving evidence against the prisoner at the bar at this trial?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ever speak to you about it? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you yourself any conversation with the prisoner upon the subject either before or after? - Not till after.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any conversation with the prisoner about Slop upon any occasion whatever? - I was with him one evening at Newgate, it was on the Friday evening in the last sessions; Mr. Davis desired my brother to give a character for one 'Squire Vaughan, who was to come to town, and who had sent his servant to take lodgings for him; when the maid servant came to me I did as my brother desired me; that evening I was with Mr. Davis, he informed me, he was exceedingly sorry he had deceived me, or to that purpose; that there was some scheme that had been in hand and he found it was frustrated; I was much agitated about it; he then told me, that the house that I desired my brother to give a character for, was for two men, who had taken it for the purpose of conveying Slop away, but not, says he, as I know any thing of it myself, but two men came to me at the prison about it, two rascals he called them; he said he knew nothing of what their scheme was, but only under some pretence to serve him they came to him.</p>
               <p>He did not approve of it? - No, he seemed concerned that I had been imposed upon, and seemed much concerned that they had taken the steps they did take, and appeared as if he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, the defence that I can make is, that I did not know that the warrants were forged; Mr. Drybutter said, that he had shewn the warrants which I had delivered to him to several persons, and at last he testified his uneasiness; he said he was afraid I had deceived him; I told him I had not, I had received them from another person, and the warrants that I had, I knew were good, and they may be agreeable to the list that Mr. Drybutter has shewn, but I am sure the warrants I had were good; and there is Mr. Dornford the wine-merchant knows very well that I dealt in drugs, and that I paid at that time a large sum; about 4000 l. for these warrants; I deposited 2000 l. in the hands of Mr. Dornford, he has got them now, and the other 2000 l. worth I borrowed money now and then upon, when I wanted money to apply to my business; I borrowed money upon these from Messrs. Smith and Payne several times, and from other bankers, and I redeemed them when they desired I would; the warrants that I left with Mr. Drybutter, were certainly not forged, or else I am deceived in 2000 l. myself; Mr.

               <p>What has been his general character for these last six years? - Exceedingly good; I have myself known instances where he has interfered in the support of his family in a most exemplary manner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a merchant, and live in Philpot-lane, Cannon-street; I have known Mr. Davis above ten years, his character has been always very good; I had such an opinion of him that I have frequently lent him money and assisted him from time to time in the course of these years that I have known him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Slop? - I know so much of him as this, that he was clerk with a brother-in-law of mine where my son was apprentice, he happened to mention this affair; and I saw him once upon 'Change, there were a knot of people gathered about him, and he appeared to be in a good deal of displeasure, and I heard him say he would hang him if he could.</p>
               <p>You are positive of that? - I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner has always-bore a very irreproachable character? - Yes, and I have lent him considerable sums of money upon warrants at different times; I lent him about 13 or 1400 l. upon 2000 l. worth of warrants, and have them in my hand to this time, and they are very good I believe.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Had you known Slop previous to this time? - I had.</p>
               <p>You was not in conversation yourself with him? - No; I heard him talking with other people.</p>
               <p>Are you any relation to the prisoner? - None at all.</p>
               <p>In no shape? - In no shape in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was mentioned by Drybutter at the beginning of the trial, that the prisoner told him you had these very warrants in your possession? - I know nothing of these warrants, I have warrants in my possession to the amount of about 14 or 1500 l.</p>
               <p>You have nothing to do with that transaction with Drybutter? - No; Mr. - my relation, bought a great number of goods for Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you remember about Midsummer last delivering any warrants to the prisoner that you had of him? - It was very frequent to deliver warrants, because as these warrants were deposited as the goods were sold, the money was paid and the warrants delivered.</p>
               <p>Whether about Midsummer last you delivered 2000 l. worth of warrants to the prisoner by way of changing the security, because he represented to Drybutter that he wanted to discharge your securities, and therefore, borrowed this money of him; now whether you at that time did or not deliver out 2000 l. worth of warrants will make a great difference in this business? - I don't recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>You must recollect if, he redeemed 2000 l. worth at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you had the warrants in your custody of Davis's? - For these two years they have been changed.</p>
               <p>Have you received any since last Midsummer? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all you have now in your hands, you had in your hands; before Midsummer? - About that time I suppose it may be.</p>

               <p>I am a merchant; I live on College-hill.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Davis? - Between seven and eight years; I knew him while he lived with Mr. Andree: I had the greatest opinion of him, and had a particular friendship for him from his well known character, from being anxious to see him prosper in the world; I have had frequent connections with him till within some few months that I have not seen him; his general character was of the best, and such as I should always be happy to have among my acquaintance in every respect; I came voluntarily to appear in his favour; I was not subpoenaed.</p>

               <p>What has been his general character during that seven years? - I formed it upon my own private opinion, his general character has been a very honest worthy man, I was glad and desirous, when I broke off the brokerage business, to be in connections with Mr. Davis, on account of the fairness of his dealings, the decency, the honesty I perceived in all his transactions, almost a determined scruple upon every thing that did not appear fair and evident in trade, whenever he did not see any thing clear and fair transacted; I have had not only goods that I purchased for him at the India company, but I have had many and many opportunities to re-purchase goods bought by others and by himself upon warrants; these warrants have continually proved very good, and have never made the least demur in any thing; I must own when he got into the watch-making branch he was out of my line; I have trusted him with a thousand pounds at a time, and would at any time have willingly done it; I came voluntarily, but could not bear to see him in this situation without informing the court of his character.</p>

               <p>After Mr. Justice BLACKSTONE had summed up the evidence, the prisoner addressed himself to the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am informed there is an evidence ready to be examined in my behalf that has not yet been called upon; he was in the country and is just arrived; he will prove how I came by the warrants; his name is Larpell; he is at Snow-hill, I have sent for him; he will prove I received the warrants of one Evanson, who, it is reported, upon my being taken, drowned himself.</p>
               <p>To Mr. MATEVIA Do you know any thing of the payment of these warrants, and how they came into Davis's hand? - I know nothing of the warrants; I have paid warrants for him, and he has given me money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I said from the anxiety I must be in through my unfortunate situation that I had this warrant of Mr. Matevia, I did not mean so; I am deceived in these warrants, and your lordship will find so; I had them of one Evanson, who, when I was taken, drowned himself; I did not pay him the full amount; I paid him as much as I could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did Evanson live?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In Tower Royal.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what time did you receive them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I received these warrants about the middle of June from his clerk at my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day did you receive them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came early in the morning; I could not accommodate him then with the money he wanted; I gave it his clerk in the afternoon; the clerk's name is Larpell; I believe there was a person at my house at the same time that can confirm it; I gave him about 14 or 1500 l. in the afternoon, part of which I borrowed of a Mr. Northy.</p>
               <p>COURT. You made an application to the court last sessions to put off your trial upon account of the absence of a material witness, Mr. Lloyd; Mr. Lloyd has only given you a character by hearsay, you never mentioned this witness then?</p>

               <p>I have nothing more to say than that though my heart shudders at the thoughts of the sentence which your lordship is going to pass upon me; yet, what am I more than my fellow companions in tribulation? will your lordship suffer me to lay my unfortunate case before you in a few words?</p>

               <p>If justice condemns the action, I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts that it does not my intentions, for I did not intend to deceive any man; I intended to have paid my prosecutor on the 28th of last month, and in order so to do, to have gone to Scotland to receive a sum that was due to me, sufficient for the purpose: were my intentions to deceive, I should have had art enough to have made it appear otherwise before your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury - if instead of fulfilling civil engagements to the amount of 10,000 l. which I have paid the greatest part of; which my credit (which I was very tenacious of) would not have been hurt if I had put it off - I paid 10,000 l. as appears by this book, which I humbly submit to your lordship, and Mr. Smith my banker, who is here, can confirm it, perhaps it may be immaterial - if I had intended to deceive, I should certainly have reserved a sufficient sum to secure to myself greater peace than I now enjoy; for I might have gone off with a much larger sum than 1900 l. in the course of four months after I received it, and I should not have suffered myself to be taken in my own house by Mr. Drybutter, a very little man, who I could have put down with one hand; he took me in my own house, where the greatest opportunity was offered me for escaping - I might say a great deal more, but it would be an intrusion upon your lordship's time.</p>
               <p>I beg that in the midst of judgment you will remember mercy, and suffer the cries of a helpless mother, a loving wife, and my helpless children to have access unto your ears: then the blessing of them who are ready to perish, will fall upon you; for my own part, I shall ever pray that the same mercy that has often been extended by your lordship, may be extended to you when you shall appear before a much more awful tribunal than I now have the misfortune to appear before.</p>

I told him she was; he asked me how long she had been in bed? and I told him according to the time; he sat down in his chair and pulled his garters off, and then got up and gave me a kiss; I asked him what that was for? he said, there was no harm in a kiss; I said, yes, there was, as he had got a wife; he then asked me if it was agreeable to me to go to bed with him that night? I said, I should agree to no such thing; he said, if it was not agreeable to me, there was no harm done, and he wanted to be rude with me in the kitchen, he put his hands up my coats; I struggled with him, and told him, if he meddled with me I would cry out; I told him I took him to be a gentleman, and I found him to be a rogue; I bid him let me alone, or I would make an outcry, and desired him to go to bed to his wife; he lit his candle and went to bed: I sat till the gentleman came home, and then I fastened my door and went to bed; I got up the next morning as usual, lit the fire and got breakfast, and packed up my things, intending to go away after breakfast; my mistress was in the kitchen; I said, madam, I am going up stairs to look up my things, I am going away; this might be about half after nine, breakfast was over; she made me some answer, but I don't know what she said; I went to my room, looked up my things, and put them up into two bundles; I thought after I had looked up my things I would make Mr. Dixon's bed; I made the bed, came down with the chamber-pot, and went up again with the pot and put it in its place; coming out of the room, I met my master in the landing-place of the stairs, he took me in his arms; I said, what be you going to do with me? he said, no harm; upon that I cried out murder; he carried me up stairs into the second room, my mistress's bed-room; I struggled with him from one bed-post to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160028"/> other; I told him I would die or lose my life before I would yield to him, and I would cry out again; I struggled as long as I had any strength in me; he took me by the two shoulders with my hands behind me, and threw me down upon the bed; after he laid me on the bed, I cried murder, and struggled as long as I could, till I went into a fainting fit; and then he lay with me.</p>
               <p>You recovered from the fit? - No; I could not assist myself, I was still in a fainting fit ; I could not get from him; then he lay with me; I felt him in my body, and felt something come from him, but I know not what.</p>
               <p>You mean to say you felt his private parts in your private parts? - Yes; and something came from him; after he had lain with me, he violently ran his hand up my body; I felt his hand and fingers in my body, he hurt me very much; I shrieked out, and said, I was almost dead; after that, he went down stairs, and I went into my own bed-room; I was almost half an hour in my own room fainting away; I was obliged to pull my linen off, and afterwards put a cloth.</p>
               <p>For what reason was you obliged to pull your linen off? - Because it was so bad with blood; after I had pulled my linen off, and rested a bit, I was ready to faint away; I got down stairs by the bannisters of the stairs, and went and got a drink of water, and then went into the kitchen, and sat about eight minutes, and then he came into the kitchen; he had two gentlemen in a little room with him; I did not see the gentlemen, I only saw their cloaths; he said, Bet, go fetch me some sugar; I said I would not; he said, I should; I said, there was some sugar I had bought of my own, he might have that; he said, that was not enough.</p>
               <p>Were the gentlemen gone? - No; they were in the place; he insisted upon my going for the sugar; I told him I did not think I was able to go so far, and I could not go; he insisted upon it I should, and gave me some money to go for the sugar ; but in my fright I did not know what he gave me, whether a sixpence or a shilling.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, I went for the sugar, and put it down on the dresser; the gentlemen were in the passage; I gave him the change.</p>
               <p>How far did you go? - A few doors up; I don't know what sugar I brought, whether a pound or half a pound.</p>
               <p>What sort was it? - We generally had seven-penny, it was the same I imagine; just as I delivered the change my mistress came in, and a gentlewoman with her, I was crying; she asked me what I was crying for; she said, my eyes were almost out of my head; I said, because my master would not let me alone; I asked her to let me go to a neighbour's house for half an hour, because my master would not let me alone; she gave me leave, and I went to Mrs. Bolton's, she had washed for us; I went into the room crying, the other lodgers came into the room; seeing me crying, Mrs. Bolton wanted to know what was the matter; I would not tell her till they were all gone out of the room; Mrs. Bolton desired to know what was the matter; after I had cried a great while, I told her my master had ruined me, and desired she would go for my mistress; she sent for her; I had a fit which held me an hour; three or four people could hardly hold me; when I came to myself, my mistress sat by my side in a chair, and she had brought a woman with her, to hear, I imagine, what I said; the woman of the room was there all the time; my mistress said to me, Now, Betty, tell me the whole truth what has passed; tell me whether or no your master has been great with you before this; I said, my master never said nothing to me in his life, nor never kissed my lips, nor did any thing bad to me till last night; I said, madam, last night I sat up for Mr. Dixon; you know I always sit up for him of a Friday night.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her what you have told us? - The same story; I only told her that he had ruined me, and what he had offered the night before; I mentioned nothing to her of my linen; she never asked me any such thing, and I never resolved her; I thought she might stop my linen; I told my mistress what passed the over night, as I have told now; there was one thing I forgot before, when I went up with Mr. Dixon's chamber-pot, as I was on the stairs, I heard the street door shut; my mistress went out.</p>
               <p>This is what you told your mistress? - No, I did not tell my mistress all this; I told my mistress he had ruined me, and what had happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160029"/> over night, and what had happened in the morning; and she went away crying, and said, she would hear no more of it; I told her I would swear a rape against him; after she went out, my master came into the room; he pulled his-hat off, and flung at me, and hit me in my eye; I was on my knees on the ground, just come out of a fit, and a woman was holding me; he threw his hat at me, and called me b - h, and said, he had done so and so with me; he said, he had lain with me against my consent; he said, that it was not above three inches in, that he could not get me with child, and that he put his hand into my body; I have three witnesses here that heard it; but he said, I might do as I had a mind; I replied, I would swear on Monday, and would swear nothing but the truth; upon that he went out of the room; I was in fits almost all that day till night, when night came, I came out of my fits and got better: I desired Mrs. Bolton to go to my mistress for my things, if she would not let me have my wages; she went, and she would not let her have them; I said, I must have them; if she would not let me, I must have them by help; she said, if I could go she would go with me; I went with her, and told my mistress I was come for my things, and my mistress said -</p>
               <p>Was your master there? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must not tell what your mistress said when your master was not present? - I came out with my things, and brought them to this woman's house; none of my friends knew what had happened, I said nothing about it that day; I went to my aunt the day after, she lives in Suffolk-street in the Borough; I said to the woman, if I was able to crawl, I insisted upon going to my aunt's to let her know the affair; she got a man, and he and she went with me to my aunt's; when I came there, my master's brother-in-law was there.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I never heard his name; I had seen him a great many times before; he was telling my aunt the story about my master and me, and wondered my aunt had not heard it; I came in while he was telling my aunt the story; my aunt said, this man tells me you have been great with your master, if you have, I will not encourage you in my house, it cannot be a rape, and desired me to tell her the story; I told her what happened on Saturday; I was very bad, the walking made me worse; they led me out of the kitchen; I said, Aunt, what is the matter with me, I am worse than I was, it seems as if my inside was coming away from me; she bid me not frighten her; upon that, she said she would not encourage me, she could not have the trouble of it: my master's brother wanted a coach to carry me to my master's house; I said, I would not go to my master's house, I would die first, and he ordered Mrs. Bolton and the man that went with me, to take me to my master's house; I said, I would not go; he said I must, and they got me into a coach and ordered the man to drive to my master's; when I came there, I could neither stand nor walk I was so bad; I desired the young man that carried me in, to go for a doctor, to see what was the matter with me; with that a doctor came who is a quaker, a Mr. Vaux; when he came, my master called him into the little room, what he said, I know not; when he came out, I was ordered to go up stairs, and the doctor had me into the bedroom to see what was the matter with me; I said to the doctor. I was very much hurt and injured by my master; that I was a poor woman, and hoped he would do justice on both sides; he told me I was very much hurt and swelled, and I was so; he told me not to fret myself and grieve, for he would get me well so soon as he could; he gave me medicines to cure me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were the medicines to be taken inwardly or to apply outwardly? - To take inwardly; he gave me medicines two or three times a day, and then he said he would give me something for my fits; I had fits all day on Sunday and Monday; on Tuesday I was better, but could not assist myself to make water or any thing; I had a nurse to sit up with me on Tuesday and Wednesday; on Wednesday the doctor came to see me, and said my swelling was better; all the while I was in the house he attended me two or three times a day; he was with me once or twice a day from the Sunday night till the Thursday; on Thursday he brought a doctor to see how I was, and to take me away to a lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160030"/>Who was that? - Mr. Grindall; he looked at me, but never said any thing to me how I was; after he went away, now says he, young woman, I will take you away to a country-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must not mention what he said? - I was carried away to Walworth</p>
               <p>What day was that? - The Thursday another doctor came, and dragged me down three pair of stairs; after he left me another strange doctor came to me; I was had away from my master's house by a doctor grown out a little in his back, I never saw him before; he said I must go, and dragged me down three pair of stairs to the lower pair of stairs; I said he would kill me; my legs were under me, sometimes before me, and sometimes behind; the coach was standing at the door; they put me into the coach and carried me to Walworth, and my mistress went in the coach to see where I was ; I was there a week, and the doctor that took me there attended me twice or three times a day; I had a nurse to attend me; I was very bad, and did every thing under me; I could not help myself the least in the world; I was there a week ; I was light headed; he gave me medicines, and at night stuff to make me sleep, but I never slept six hours while I was there; he gave me physic several times, and when it worked me he came to me at night and said I was thoroughly cured and well, that that was all he wanted; I said I was very bad ; he said you must go from this place; he told me my master was to come in the morning to let me know I was not to be any longer in that place; the next day he came again and said, if I was bad, I was bad; if I was well, I was well, but I must go out of the house, and the woman must get me out how she could; the woman told him they that brought me into the house must get me out; he said, he did not know that: the woman said, I must go to the hospital; he said, he did not know that, that he would not do any thing, and she might put me where she would; my mistress came the next day and my master's brother.</p>
               <p>Don't tell what passed between your mistress and you. Did you see your master again? - No.</p>


               <p>How long did you stay in that house? - A week, then I was sent to the hospital with the fits, and was weak and bad in my inside.</p>

             came in? - I was in my own room, and my door was open; I saw this young woman come up stairs; my room is up three-pair of stairs forwards; she came up crying; I said to Mrs. Pratt, what is the matter with that young woman? by that time she came to the top, I heard her stamp with her foot and shrick, I followed her into the room, and asked what was the matter?</p>
               <p>Whose room was she in? - Mrs. Bolton's; I said, what is the matter? the young woman saw me, and said shut the door and let nobody in; I said again, what is the matter? Mrs. Bolton laid her hand on her, and said, what is the matter? then I went down into my own room; a little after Mrs. Bolton came down and spoke to me, and I went up into the room to her.</p>

               <p>When did you first hear of what has happened to this unfortunate young woman? - To the best of my knowledge it was the 23d day of the month; I think it was on a Monday;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160033"/> I believe it was the Monday se'nnight after it happened, then I heard she was at her master's house; I concluded I should not go there to see her till she was moved; I found she was at Walworth ; I heard that from a woman she had lived with before; I went that night with her late mistres's mother and a relation of mine to Walworth to see her; when I saw her, I asked her how she did? she told me she was very ill; I desired her to relate the whole affair to me; she told me her master treated her exceeding ill, and ravished her; that the night before he committed the rape, while she sat up for the lodger and her master, her master came home first, sat down by the fire, undid his garters, and got up and kissed her; that she resented it, and he said there was no harm in a kiss; she said there was, as he had a wife of his own; that after that he put his hands up her petticoats, and she struggled with him, and then he went to bed; that she got up in the morning and did some of her work, and intended to go and pack up her things, and go after she had made the lodger's bed; that she went up with the chamber-pot, and that as she came out of the room she met her master on the stairs; that when she went up she thought her mistress was up stairs, but she heard the door shut afterwards; she told me her master had ravished her, and told me the particulars; I examined her, and according to the appearance I saw, I think she had been used extremely ill; this was on the Tuesday se'nnight after it was done, according to the best of my rememberance.</p>
               <p>What were the appearances from whence you concluded she was used very ill? - From the outside appearance, she seem'd to have received bodily hurt, she seemed exceedingly sore and inflamed.</p>
               <p>JURY. How long have you known this young woman? - I have known her ever since she was about five or six years old.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing whether she was subject to fits? - I never knew her having any thing, but once a fainting fit upon a fright, her mistress's child appearing to be almost dead.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunities of being with her much? - Not very much; her father and mother left her very young; she was bound out by the parish, and then she went to service; she was bound out to a relation; I have enquired at the places I knew she had lived at, if she was subject to fits, and cannot find that she has had more than one.</p>

               <p>I live in the house with Mrs. Bolton; I was in my own room; I heard a noise; they said Mr. Arnold's maid was in fits; I did not go up directly; I went up afterwards and she was out of fits and on the bed; I saw her linen; she told me her master had ruined her, and told me in what manner he had served her.</p>
               <p>In what manner did she tell you he had served her? - That he had run his hand up her body, and after that was concerned with her.</p>
               <p>How did her linen appear? - Very bad; I thought there was blood upon her linen.</p>
               <p>Any other appearances but blood? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Where did you see this linen? - Up stairs at Mrs. Warton's house.</p>
               <p>The linen she had on? - No; the linen she pulled of; it was brought there.</p>
               <p>JURY. How high is the house you live in? - Four story; I live in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. GRINDALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I think it was on the Wednesday after the Saturday that this thing is said to be done on, that I was desired by Mr. Vaux to meet him to examine the young woman who lived at Mr. Arnold's; I did meet him, and went up to the bed-room where she lay and examined her thoroughly, as much as possibly I could; I was surprized to hear what she charged her master with, for I never saw in my life less reason to suppose a woman had been injured; and as to the hand, so far from the parts being sore, or being hurt, there was not the least swelling, the least inflammation, not the least discolouring; there was not the least reason to believe she had been so treated, as there must have been matter from the sore; upon passing my finger the passage was so narrow as scarcely to admit it; the parts did not seem the least torn.</p>
               <p>As these were the appearances, what was you called in for? - Mr. Vaux, who is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160034"/> Quaker, thought from the young woman's charging her master, that somebody should be called upon to give affidavit; he agreed with me, that the fits were all that was the matter with her, and that a little country air would do her good.</p>
               <p>He agreed with you in the appearances? - Yes; I afterwards went to St. Thomas's, and examined her with Mr. Smith and the sister of the ward, and my assistant; we all agreed upon the appearances; she was brought into St. Thomas's last Thursday was three weeks ; I have no reason to believe any thing had been done to her; I thought on one side from the appearances that she had been scratching herself with her own nails; there appeared a scratch that was not there when I first saw her; there was no appearances of swelling or inflammation; there was at that time two or three streaks of blood on her shift, as if made with her finger stroked down.</p>

               <p>I belong to a ship that laid along side of the William and Elizabeth: I heard a noise on Sunday was se'nnight on board the William and Elizabeth; I went on board and called to know what the matter was, it being quite dark, though I don't recollect the hour; the prisoner jumped up, and said, he belonged to that vessel; I asked him what he could be doing there at that time of night; he struck at me, and endeavoured to knock me down, but I escaped that; he had some bedding lay at the door of the cabin, and said it was his own, and he should take it on shore; I was not able to stop him; I followed him, and watched him; he struck at me for so doing several times; he went on shore with it; I followed him at a proper distance; when I saw him pitch the load off his shoulder, and Baker came up, I told him the story, and he was secured.</p>

               <p>I am footman to Mr. Dickinson: I was standing behind the coach at the time the robbery was committed; a man came on the left hand with a crape over his face; he called three times, Stop, coachman; there was another on the road with a crape over his face; the man on the left hand opened the door, glass and all; the man on the right stooped down in order to look into the coach, but did not open the door; the man on the left hand asked for watches and jewels, the other for their money; I observed them all the time; I looked on the left hand side, and observed the man's face as plain as possible for any man to see another's face through a crape; but I will not positively swear to the features of that man that stood on the left hand, he appeared to me to be pale, long-visaged, and pock-frettened; I could not distinguish the colour of his eye-brows, but believe him to be the prisoner Ogilvie, from the circumstances I have mentioned, that he answered the description of the idea I had formed to myself; I will not be positive that Ogilvie is the very man, but I believe he is; I took much more notice of the man who was on horseback on the right hand, and who stooped down by the window; I am positive that is Dover; I am more positive to him than I could be to the other, because as he stooped down, the crape hung loose, and there was a wind at the same time which blew it away from his face, so that I had a full opportunity of contemplating the features of his face for upwards of two minutes; I was ordered by the man on the left hand to look back; I put my hand upon the back of the coach, and instead of looking back, I turned my back to the man on the left hand, and looked stedfastly at the man on the right; I am positive that was Dover; after they had robbed the ladies they rode off, presently afterwards Mr. Elliott came by on horseback; I made signs to him that those two men that were riding off were the men that had robbed the coach. Dover had on a brown close coat with a red collar, had his hair clubbed behind, and had a yellow metal buckle in his stock; Oglivie had a brownish coat, I took it to be a frock, it was made in a frock fashion, and something of a brownish collar.</p>

               <p>Was any body with you? - Only my own child, which is about seven years old; I endeavoured to fasten my door; as I pushed the door I felt them pushing the door against my face; I saw a great light, I heard many feet, I turned to go into bed again and there was a man close behind me, when I got into bed he covered the cloaths over my head.</p>
               <p>So that you could not see what passed? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did more than one man come into your room? - I don't know that there did at that time; there were more came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>You did not distinguish that man that followed you? - I did not see either of them; the man spoke to me, I begged of him not to use me ill; he said he would not, and bid me lie still; that man asked me how many maid servants we had? I told him one; he asked me where she lay, which I likewise told him; in a little while after that I heard my uncle cry out, murder.</p>
               <p>Was this man in the room all the while? - Yes; as far as I can guess by his talking to me; then more people entered the room, I saw none of them because I still kept under the cloaths; they brought the maid down and made her get into my bed; when I heard my uncle cry murder three times, I begged they would not use my uncle ill; the man promised that they would not, but money they wanted, and money they must have; he asked me where the money was kept? I told them my uncle was a very close man, and I did not know where he put his money; they all but one man left the room, and I did not hear any thing of them for some time; they came into my room a second time and searched my drawers; they took a canvas bag out of my bureau with half crowns and other pieces to the amount of 8 l. they are not mentioned in the indictment; then they went into the back room, and broke open and searched all my boxes: my lord, I forgot one thing; just after my maid came into the room, I saw that my watch was gone from my bed; the man that stood by my bed had taken it; I had desired them before not to take my watch, and he promised me he would not, but he did; after they had been searching some time I heard a great noise in my uncle's room; I again begged that they would not hurt him, for he was an old man; the man told me they were only a tying of him; a voice in the passage asked us if we lay still, the man had stept out of the room at that time; I said we did; they said, if we put our heads out at window they would blow our brains out; they endeavoured then to lock me into the room, they fastened the door between my room and my uncle's, but I pushed the bolt of my own door, which prevented its shutting; they turned the lock and left it so, then they left the house; a very few minutes after they went my uncle called for assistance; I went to him, his hands and legs were tied so tight I could only get in the points of the scissars to cut them; I found his head was very much cut and bruised, and he had lost a great deal of blood; I gave information at Sir

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Bean and Mrs. Dicker; I was brought down into Mrs. Dicker's room on the 25th of August, between one and two o'clock; two men came into the room where I lay; one desired me to get up and go to my mistress; I pretended to be asleep, and made no answer; he held the candle to my face; he desired me a second time to get up; I sat upright in my bed; he bid me put my cloaths on; I put one my petticoat; he looked over the bed and looked stedfast at my face, but did not speak; he held a sword in his left hand and a horse pistol in his right hand; he bid me get up twice.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity to observe the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you know him again? - I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him since? - I have not seen him since; I got up and was going out of the room; there was a man with his face covered; he asked me if any body else was in bed besides me; that is the same man that held the candle to me; I told him there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160047"/> nobody in bed besides me; the man that had his face covered desired me to walk down stairs, and the other man that stooped down by my bed said, that if I did not go down it would be worse for me; I went into Mrs. Dicker's room; then one of the men desired me to go to bed to my mistress; as soon as I was in bed they covered me over with the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Then you saw nothing further, did you? - No; I heard my master call out; I heard them come and search the drawers, but I saw nothing; after they were gone I went to fetch a candle, and Mrs. Dicker in the mean time got my master untied; it was almost three when they left the house.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Brentford is your master's house? - The first house on the right hand from Kew-bridge.</p>

               <p>What time in the morning was this? - When we got there it was near six; after we had searched his cloaths we were willing to secure him before we did any thing; he was obstreperous and knocked one of the officers down, he was knocked down and then secured; in his fob I found a piece of string, I pulled it out, there was a piece of lead at the end of it; in his breeches pocket I found nine shillings; one being marked, the magistrate ordered it to be kept and the rest delivered to him again; the shilling that has been produced here is the marked shilling I found upon him; in the side-pocket of his breeches were these six picklock keys (producing them); in his coat pocket I found this cord with a piece of lead at the end of it about a pound weight, which would knock any body down (producing it); in the same pocket, I believe, there were eight or nine, or a dozen balls, besides gunpowder; in the closet which he wanted to make to, I found three pistols (producing them); one was loaded with three balls, another with two, the other pistol was not loaded; in the same closet I found a bunch of picklock keys, (producing them); this is the contents of the two pistols (producing the charge as drawn).</p>

               <p>Have you any thing more to say than what Mr. Clarke has said? - Yes; when Mr. Clarke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160048"/> and Mr. Bond took away the prisoner, they left me, Bryant, and Jealous at the house, to see if we could find any thing that would lead to a discovery of Mr. Bean's robbery, or of any accomplices; after they were gone I went into the yard to a place where they keep fowls; I saw a padlock upon a place that we had not looked into; I went into the house and asked the prisoner's wife where the key of that padlock was; Harding kept the house; they told me there was a key, and the girls looked about for it, but they could not find it; I opened the door with a crow, and found in it a large sack with a parcel of picklock keys and counter pieces, and a pistol, and another bag with another pistol in it (the two pistols produced).</p>
               <p>(The piece of brass found in Mr. Bean's room, which was the guard of a pistol, did not appear to belong to any of the pistols produced.) And here are the rest of the things (producing them); I can say nothing further.</p>
               <p>Can Bryant say any more than you have? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I sent to the sign of the Ship at Strand on the Green for change of a guinea; they sent me this shilling; I had not a shilling or a sixpence in the world before.</p>
               <p>To CRAINE. Whether you had ever seen the man with the crape, or the man that held the candle to your face before? - No, not that I know.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner one of them? - I cannot tell; the man with a crape on his face was a tall lusty man *.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner answered that description.</p>

               <p>All the tools and utensils that were found are implements for coining; the flasks are used for casting (describing the manner in which it is done); the faceing sand is a finer sort of sand, used after the impression is made upon the mould, to fill up all the interstices of the sand, in order that the cast may come out smooth and free from spot or blemish; the buff leather which was found, was for the purpose of giving the metal a polish before it received its colour: it appeared to me when I first saw these flasks before the magistrate, which was a long while ago, that the mould was at that time very damp, and from the circumstance of its being damp, I am of opinion that it must have been used for casting within a short time, perhaps a week, of the time when the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>What were the scales for? - For weighing the quantity of metal, I believe; there was a large quantity of charcoal, a stove and furnace fixed, with two melting pots in it, a quantity of copper, a pair of sheers, this pot (producing it) was on the fire with the pickle in it, but the fire was out; here is another piece of metal found in some part of the room, I cannot justly say what part; a sieve, scissars, a cork, and every thing that can be used in that way (the several articles were produced in court).</p>
               <p>What do you call that metal? - It is to melt down to make counterfeit shillings, they call it cicil; I believe there has been some pieces cut out of it.</p>

               <p>Do you know of a box left there? - I know nothing of Yardley; there was a box left at the bar; a man came and enquired for it, and said it was marked J. Y.; I looked, and it was so marked; I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You kept a public house in Golden-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This box was left in your custody? - It was left there, I don't know by who; I never saw the man that left it; it was left in the care of my wife.</p>
               <p>COURT. How did you know who to deliver it to? - He told me the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Yardley? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. So a box is left in the bar you don't know by who; it stands in the bar where any body might see it; and you deliver it to any body that mentions the mark of it? - There is nobody admitted into the bar but my wife and myself.</p>
               <p>Where do you live now? - I keep the Crown ale-house in Cock-lane, Spital-fields.</p>
               <p>Was you ever taken up for this? - No; I never was in custody in my life for any thing.</p>

               <p>There was no particular mark upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>You are positive Moore and M'Loughlin are two of the men that stopped you? - Yes; Moore was the man that robbed me; they were taken in about five minutes after; Moore had a brown linen apron on.</p>

               <p>There was a great alarm in the field? - Yes; I was not by when M'Loughlin was taken; I was close by when Moore was taken; he came walking up; he had his apron on.</p>

               <p>Did you take any notice of the skins? - No, none at all; she asked me what sort of sheep they were, how good they were; I said they were middling sort of sheep; she said she bought them of a drover, one Pinnick; she asked me what I thought she gave a piece; I said I did not know; she said half a guinea; that she had paid him a guinea, and was to pay the rest another time.</p>
               <p>What might be the worth of them? - About nineteen shillings, or a pound a piece; she is a cook's shop woman, and sells meat about in a basket; I lived with her two years.</p>

            's on Saturday, was one of those stones you sent home on Friday? - Very well; I knew it by the colour of the clouds and the size, and there was a piece slit off, which I have here.</p>
               <p>Are those marks which enable you as a man of skill in your own business to know perfectly that stone again? - I should; the stone was too thick, it is usual to grind a stone down that is too thick, but my instruments were in order for it, and therefore I slit a piece off; here is the piece I slit off (producing it; the pieces matched exactly).</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>That is an operation that I suppose happens in the cutting of every thick stone? - Not very common; I had some work that was harder than this to do, and I slit them off; the general operation is to grind them down.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are other cornelians that are of the same colour? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>And as to the clouds, they are, I believe, in all cornelians? - Some make no appearance of any clouds.</p>
               <p>The generality of cornelians have clouds? - In general they have.</p>
               <p>And they are very similar? - They might to people that are no judges; but to people that are, they are very easily distinguished; I could pick this cornelian out of a thousand.</p>
               <p>As to the size, I suppose that is a common size? - No; the prosecutrix is very particular in having them cut to this size; this is a very particular shape, and you see it fits the pattern it is made to go into exactly.</p>

               <p>I am a constable at Covent-garden Theatre: upon Friday between five and six o'clock I took Mrs. West upon the stairs of the two shilling gallery; when I laid hold of her, I said, you must come along with me; I suspected I should find something upon her; I took her down to the office and I searched her, and found upon her a guinea and about thirty-six shillings, and this stone; I put it all into my handkerchief, and laid it upon a table: justice Addington sat that evening; he bid me go down to the Theatre, and enquire whose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177610160072"/> pocket had been picked; I went, and called out, this gentleman came; I desired him to go down to the office; as soon as he saw the stone, he said, that was the stone, and that he had lost a guinea and a half; I found but one guinea upon her, and about thirty-six shillings in silver; she was asked how she came by that stone, she said she had had it about three months in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he asked me if the stone was mine, I had a stone in my pocket at the same time which he did not produce; I asked him to let me see the stone; he did not let me see it.</p>
               <p>Smallwood. She said she had had this stone three months in her pocket; the lapidary was sent for, that was on Friday night, he was not at home then; upon Saturday she never said a word about any stone at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had a stone in my pocket, and if he would let me look at it, I would tell him whether that was the stone I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Smallwood. She had no other stone.</p>

               <p>I was going up the stairs; I saw the door-keeper Baker ; I picked up one cornelian stone; I looked at it; there was a woman coming down stairs ; the gallery was so full I could not get in; I was coming down to the pit; I had the stone in my hand; I saw a man before me pick up three stones and a half guinea; this fellow came up, and took hold of me, and asked me what I had found? I said, a cornelian seal, but he should not have it; he took me to Sir John Fielding's office; the woman is not here that saw me pick it up; for when I told her that I picked up the seal, he immediately seized her as well as me; I have no friends here; I only came from Sir

               <p>Jury to WILSON. Did you see the prisoner as you was going up stairs? - I believe she was the next person to me, there was another woman pushed very much to get past me; there was another woman with her that was somewhat taller; I rather pushed her back; and she went next to my wife, who was along with me; the tall woman laid hold of my coat about the breast to pull me back; and then the other woman laid hold of my wife's shoulder.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Moonlight; I had a great opportunity of looking at the prisoners while they were robbing the other persons; I am certain Harding the tall man was one; I had been in his company two or three times before, and had seen the horse he rode on, therefore I knew him; I have seen the horse in James-street, Kensington.</p>

             Sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of September about six in the morning I was at the taking of the prisoners; they were apprehended in a house, which I was informed was Harding's, on Strand on the Green, which is between Chiswick and Kew Bridge ; Harrison was in bed in the left hand room, and Harding in the right hand room; in Harrison's room, underneath a hat I found this pistol loaded (producing it); I asked him before I found the pistol, who that hat belonged to? he said it belonged to a friend in the bed where he was; I found two small balls.</p>
               <p>[The loading of the pistol and the balls were produced.]</p>
               <p>HALL looks at the pistol. I believe this to be the pistol I had with me in the diligence when I was robbed: I have the fellow to it here (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This robbery was committed in January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of Harding till September? - I saw him once since at Tattershall's selling two horses; the engraver's name has been erased out of the pistol.</p>
               <p>COURT. The name and place of abode was on the pistol?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, and is on the one I have produced; they are made to unlock each other; they are a key to each other.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take him up when you saw him at Tattershall's? - I had rather he had fell into other hands: I said nothing to him.</p>
