On Tuesday evening, 16th March, I was in John Street, Minories, about 7.45—I saw Lynch there driving a one horse van containing wool—Hooper was walking by his side—I followed them into Trinity Square—Hooper stopped at the corner on the pavement, and Lynch drew his van over on the opposite side against the square and stopped, and then came back and commenced talking to Hooper—Hall then came up with another load of wool upon a van; bales of wool—he stopped at the corner of Cooper's Row and got down—he had some conversation with the</p>

               <p>others for about a minute, and then Lynch came over and drove his van away, and Hall followed with his van—Hooper got up on Hall's load behind as the van was going on, that was in Trinity Square, and after going 30 or 40 yards round the dark part of the square, Hooper pushed a bale off into the roadway—I had to come over the gate where I was, and when I came out Hooper was off the van, about 2 yards from me—I took hold of him and told him I should take him into custody for stealing the bale of wool—he said "You have made a mistake"—I took him to the Seething Lane Police Station—I afterwards went to Brewers Quay, Thames Street, which is the wharf where they were taking the wool to be put on board a ship—Lynch was there, and Hall came down with his van while I was there—I told them I should take them into custody for being concerned with an<lb/>other in custody in stealing a bale of wool in Trinity Square—they said they knew nothing about it—the bale is 3 cwt.—in the direction in which they went they were not going direct to Brewer's Quay; they ought to have gone straight down through Cooper's Row to the Tower, instead of that they turned round to the right—they both lead to the same point, but the usual practice is to go straight down, and they went round the square; it was rather darker that side than the other—I knew Hooper, and therefore I followed him.</p>

I live at 139, Burbige Road, Peckham—I have been nearly eighteen years in Mr. Kemp's employ as clerk—on the death of Mr. Karslake's clerk I acted as head clerk to both him and Mr. Kemp—about eleven months ago the prisoner came into the employ as second clerk, at first he was paid soemthing like 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for about two months, and after that he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had a separate room and a desk in that room where he sat when he had writing to do—the blotting paper and desk belonged to him—I knew that Mr. Karslake had an account at Child's and that he was in the habit of drawing his cheques on blue draft paper—I did not as a rule fill up the body of the cheques for him to sign, I have done so—Mr. Karslake was not in the habit of putting the words "the sum of" on his cheques, I never remember his doing so—I should think I have not put in those words when I have drawn cheques for him—this cheque was first shown to me on Tuesday, 16th February—when I was passing through my room I showed the prisoner the cheque and said "This is the forged cheque"—I took the cheque back to Child's directly—I was not aware that the prisoner was married—no portion of this cheque is my writing.</p>

K. K. on it—I never remember his pointing it out to me or my destroying it—I was not the worse for liquor on 16th February—the day I was taking the cheque back to the bank I might have had a glass of ale, but I was not intoxicated—I don't think I was affected by liquor at all on that day; I think I was one day between the 13th and 25th March—I am certain that I never burnt any blotting-paper, with Mr. Karslake's initials on at any time—I did not make any comparison between the writing on the cheque and my own writing when Mr. Dashwood was there—my attention was only called to the hand-writing on the cheque and on the blotting-paper, I said that the signature was not a bit like Mr. Karslake's, I rather chaffed the bank clerks for paying a cheque with so bad a signature—I did not show them any specimen of Mr. Karslake's signature—I have not frequently filled up the body of a cheque for Mr. Karslake to sign—I keep no record of the cheques I fill up—I have not examined a great number of Mr. Karslake's cheques since 25th March, I have not seen one.</p>

Child's bank—for the last twenty-five years I have been in the habit of drawing cheques on blank paper—no portion of this cheque was written by me or with my authority—I should say it is not at all like my signature, it is much too upright, I call it very clumsy—I know Leatherbarrow's handwriting well, he has been my clerk for two or three years—I won't say that no portion of the cheque is in the least degree like his writing, but I don't recognise any similarity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had noticed a want of sobriety in Leatherbarrow and had complained to him of it—I should say several months ago, call it four months, for the first time—I repeated the complaint once or twice afterwards; I am happy to say it has not happened often—there would be several of my signatures to papers in my chambers in my drawers, nearly all of which are kept open, and a great many with my initials E. E. K. on briefs—I have very rarely employed Leatherbarrow to fill up the body of cheques; four times a year he has done it for rent to Mr. Kemp, but probably not more than three or four times besides, if so many—I was present when Mr. Dashwood found the blotting paper—some one in my presence pointed out to the pri<lb/>soner the close resemblance between the cheque and what was on the blotting paper, and he practically admitted that it was blotted on that paper; he also said most positively, without faltering in the least, that he did not know how it was done and that someone else must have done it—I think it was at this interview that Mr. Dashwood said that the body of the cheque was in the handwriting of Leatherbarrow; I think the words were uttered by Mr. Dashwood, but they may have been by Sergeant Outram—I don't recollect anything being said about the endorsement—the policeman and Mr. Dashwood did not leave and return in quarter of an hour—it was Leather barrow's duty to be there before the other clerks, but on that occasion the prisoner came first, and therefore it was that he was shown the cheque and blotting paper, before Leatherbarrow came—as soon as Leatherbarrow came I showed them to him and asked him if he could accout for it—the policeman went into some of the other rooms, and he and Mr. Dashwood were looking for papers, but I should say none of them left for the best part of an hour—I was not present when the prisoner was taken into custody and had nothing to do with his being taken.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was after the prisoner was in custody—I told Leatherbarrow that I thought the body of the cheque was in his hand writing—I did not use the words "I charge you with forging the cheque, and God and your own conscience know that I am speaking the truth"—I said "Your own conscience will tell you whether you have done it"—I said "I think the handwriting on the face of the cheque is yours"—I had found the blotting paper the night before—I did not compare the lines of the cheque with the blotting paper; it was so before my mind—I had not the cheque in my pocket at the time, but I found the impression a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—I compared the writing on the face of the cheque with Leatherbarrow's in my own mind only, that was what made me say "I think;" I had not had possession of his writing previously—I carried it in my mind as it were—the night I found the blotting paper I had access to the chambers by Mr. Karslake's permission, and I saw one of Leatherbarrow's books, and I fancied then for the first time that the writing on the face of the cheque was his—I went to the chambers for the purpose of seeing whether there was a resemblance of the handwriting; that was the first occasion on which I examined any handwriting of Leatherbarrow's, and at the same time I ex<lb/>amined some handwriting of the prisoner's—I had made up my mind some days before that the endorsement was the prisoner's writing—I had not seen Leatherbarrow's handwriting before I found the blotting paper—I hud not come to the conclusion that the face of the cheque was not the pri<lb/>soner's</p>

               <p>before I saw Leatherbarrow's writing; I fancied that it was done by one of the two, and it was that that made me go to the prisoner's desk—I had previously seen the prisoner's handwriting, and come to the conclusion that the endorsement was his—I was not then sure that the face of the cheque was written by another hand—I had, to a certain extent, come to that conclusion, or I should not have said to Leatherbarrow "I think "I was careful about it—I now feel perfectly certain that the face and the back are not written by different persons—I have had more time to look into it—I am not equally certain that the signature is in the same handwriting—I do not say that two persons have written the same document—I am per<lb/>fectly certain that the body of the cheque was written by the same hand as the endorsement, and I think the signature is by the same hand—I am almost perfectly certain that the whole was written by the same person—I have compared the signature of the forged cheque with the signature of Mr. Karslake—I did so on 16th February—I looked up an old cheque of Mr. Karslake's—my nephew was with me when I found this blotting paper; it was not a pad, it was a quire of blotting paper, each sheet loose; this sheet was in the middle—I have not got the other sheets here; this was one of the middle sheets, and there was nothing else on it but this; I examined carefully—there were heaps of clean sheets.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Thursday morning, 25th March, in consequence of a communication, I went to Mr. Karslake's chambers with Mr. Dashwood—I there saw the prisoner—I produced the blotting paper and the forged cheque, and said to the prisoner "I need not tell you Merry that I am a police officer"—he said "No, Mr. Outram"—I said "Can you account for this?" producing the blotting paper—"This has been found in your blotting pad"—he compared the writing of the forged cheque with the blotting paper, and said "There can be no mistake about that, but I know nothing about it"—I called his attention to a piece of paper with some of his handwriting, and said <hi rend="italic"/>" Is this your handwriting?"—he said "Yes"—I called his attention to the similarity of the endorsement on the cheque with that handwriting—he said "It looks like my handwriting, but I know nothing about it"—I then went with Mr. Dashwood to the bank, and afterwards returned and took the prisoner into custody—I said "You are charged Merry with forging this cheque, you will have to go with me to Fleet Street Police Station"—I think he again said that he knew nothing about it, and when the charge was read over to him at the station, he said "I have nothing to say, I know nothing about it"—he said he had had enough of trouble—I found a letter on him dated 21st February—he said "You will see by that, Mr. Outram, that I have been married again"—at that time he was residing at 5, Templeton Road, Highbury Vale—I went there on the Thursday evening and searched his bedroom—I found eleven".</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on my business at 27, Red Lion Square—I am an expert in handwriting—I have had a very large experience in the comparison of handwriting for about twenty years—I have had certain documents submitted to me in this case—I have looked at the forged cheque and at the documents A, B, C, D, E and F in the handwriting of the prisoner and in my opinion the same hand that wrote those documents wrote the forged cheque—the capital "B" in "Barnes" in the endorsements the cheque is as nearly as possible identical with the "B," in the name of a firm in the docu<lb/>ment marked D, the strong point about it, independently of its general form is the manner in which it is terminated very distinctively by a loop—the "B" in document "<hi rend="italic">D</hi>" is terminated in the same manner, also the "B" in document F in the same word "Barnes "and in the word "Barristers" in document C there is a peculiar habit of forming the B which the prisoner seems to have—then the small "h "in "John "in the endorsement to the forged cheque, is formed in an unusual manner, particularly the final part of it, and in the same word "John" in document C the "h" is formed in the same manner—the letter "n" in "John "and "London "in the cheque is terminated by a long up stroke, curved the wrong way, and in document C the "n" in "Tem<lb/>pleton" is terminated in the same way—the letter "m" in the word "sum" in the cheque is terminated more distinctly in that remarkable manner, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050019"/>
               <p>again in "William" in document C—the letter "a" in "Barnes" is to my mind almost identical with the "a" in "Barristers" in document C, in both instances the loop is open at the top—the "o" in the abreviation "Co." in the forged cheque has appended to it a long dash in a similar manner to the "o" in the word "no" in document C—then the well-rounded letter "l" in "Child "in the cheque is like the "l" in the word "children" in paper marked B—the "f" in the word "five" in the cheque is looped above the line and below the line, and is like the "f" in the word "of" in the eleventh line of paper B—in the cheque beneath the abreviation "th" of the date, and beneath the abreviation "rs" in "Messrs." there are two firmly written lines, very short, and similar marks of abreviation, with precisely the same touch of hand, apparently to my mind made by the same hand, occurs in document C in the abreviation of the date "17th of March," and under the "re" of "Esquire," they correspond exactly—those are the principal points, there are minor matters besides—the endorsement is most like the prisoner's ordinary hand writing, I think the writing on the face of the cheque is assumed, and I will tell you why, the prisoner invariably forms his small letter "r" with its shoulder to the left—all the "r's" in these documents are found with the shoulder to the right with one exception, one inadvertence where it is in his natural hand, and that is the earliest "r" in "February" which is very well represented by the "r" in the abreviation respec'vely in docu<lb/>ment B.</p>

               <p>difference—I don't know anything about the signature; I would not swear whether it is, or is not written by the same hand—I have not troubled about it; the only thing I should remark about it is that the up-stroke in the final "e" in Karslake has the same character as the final up-stroke in the letters "m," and "n"—I have been examined and cross-examined a great many times.</p>

I have done nothing"—I took him back and met Coulson in William Street—he said "That is the man who stole my watch"—the prisoner made no reply—I took him to the station, but found nothing re<lb/>lating to the charge—the skin was off his right elbow, and his coat was very dirty, as if he had been down in the road—the female is here.</p>

I am a stoker, and was last employed at 50, Tottenham Court Road—I have been out of employment six weeks; I left in February—I have known William Crabbe twelve months—I do not know where he lives—I met him on Sunday night, 14th March; I recollect the date pre<lb/>cisely—I heard on the 17th that he was apprehended, but what for I did not know—I heard it in general conversation—I met him at the Great Northern station on 14th March at 7.30, and being acquainted with him by knowing his brother, we went into the Victoria Arms, at the corner of the York Road, and had something to drink, and then went up Pentonville Road and into the Penton Arms—I was with him from 7.30 to 11.30, and we parted at King's Cross Station again; I left him in the road—on 22nd March I went to the Police Court to give evidence, because I heard that he was taken for a robbery.</p>

I am manager to Miss Fleming, a jeweller, of 1, Lower John Street, Golden Square—on the 13th February, the prisoner came there with a Mr. Collins—my assistant came to me upstairs, made a communication to me, and I went into the shop, where I saw Mr. Collins and the prisoner with some jewellery before them—Collins said that he had introduced that gentleman to purchase jewellery as he wanted some to give away, or words to that effect—and I looked over it, and saw what was being purchased, the transaction was all complete then, hut I did not know how I was going to be paid—presently, Mr. Collins whispered over to me, and said "It is all right"—the prisoner asked for a pen and ink, and pulled out a cheque-book—I looked at Collins, and Collins said to me directly "It is all right Mr. Orton, you can take this and get your money"—the jewellery was then handed to the prisoner, and he put it in his outside pocket—I said "I think you had better take better care of it than that"—he said "It will be all safe in my possession"—and he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out this pistol, and pointed it towards me—I said "I wish you would turn that another way, I am not particularly partial to having it pointed at my head"—he said "It's all safe in my hands, I am an old soldier in the Confederate Army," and he showed a wound which he had in his neck—previous to that I said "This cheque is crossed, please make it payable in cash"—he said "How am I to do that"—I said "Write across it pay cash, and sign your name"—Collins said "It's all right, take that down and get the money"—the prisoner turned round and said "Mr. Collins knows how I am come by my money," and Collins said "Yes, I have no doubt you will have further transactions with this gentleman when you have received the money for that"—the prisoner said he lived at Oak Lodge, Chislehurst, and he wanted the jewellery to make presents of—they went away, and I immediately got into a hansom cab, and went down to the Bank—the cheque was dishonoured—I allowed the prisoner to take the jewellery away because I had known Mr. Collins for twelve years living in the next street, and I placed con<lb/>fidence in him as a man of honour, and that he would not introduce the prisoner to me unless he knew him—everything he said inspired me with confidence; in fact he said "Take the cheque down and get the money, no doubt you will have further transactions"—I relied entirely on Mr. Collins—I should not have trusted or taken a cheque from anyone—I should not have allowed the goods to go without the cheque—I looked upon the cheque as money, knowing Mr. Collins, because Mr. Collins brought him to me and introduced him.</p>

The prisoner said he wished to open an account, and told me about some large transactions he had with stocks, and asked me if I would allow him to deposit a box of jewellery with us if he opened an account—I said that we did so for our clients, and would be happy to do so for him—he produced this cheque for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "A. Lascelles"—I saw the pecu<lb/>liarity of the endorsement, "Guildford "and "Danvers Guildford "under<lb/>neath—that cheque was deposited with us, and I gave him a paying-in book and a cheque book—the entry in the paying-in book is my writing, "Vallantine, 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Vallantine was the name of the cheque—the cheque was not cleared, and I put it there specially that it might not deceive any one—this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in the prisoner's writing, and that was pre<lb/>sented—I did not know Scott, Biddulph &amp; Co. personally—I knew them from their account, that was all—they had an account at the bank at that time—it has been closed since this trial commenced, by orders of my directors—I knew them as financial agents and money lenders—I knew that they had an account—I never knew that they did any financing at all—one of my clerks wrote "Not known" on the cheque.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "I did not give the cheque to Mr. Fleming with a guilty knowledge; I was the dupe of others. I became acquainted with Scott &amp; Co. through their advertisements. They declined my application for a loan, but subsequently, on my going to them and telling them I had got what I wanted and that I required to open a banking account, they gave me a letter of introduction to the bank in Sloane Square. I became acquainted with Collins in the same manner. When I showed him my paying-in book it had my address in it, as it now has; he saw or might have seen it, and he took it in his hands. I gave the Chislehurst address for no other reason than vanity. With regard to the endorsement being Guildford as well as my own name, I beg to say that was done in the presence of Mr. Hertz, the manager of the Cheque Bank, and of one of the cashiers in the Cheque Bank, Pall Mall. On taking the cheque he said 'This cheque is drawn in a very singular manner; it is simply payable to Mr. Guildford, there are no initials for Christian names.' I said 'Shall I endorse it Guildford and then put my own signature? He said 'Yes, that will do.' I did so. Subsequently the Cheque Bank gave me notice of the dishonour of the cheque. I made inquiries. I was told by a friend of the drawer that payment had not been advised. I immediately wrote to the manager of the bank and told him so. I requested him to present it again on the following Friday; he declined, and gave it back. In the following week, armed with the introduction of Scott &amp; Co., I paid it into the Chelsea Bank. I pointed out to the manager the peculiarity of the endorsement. He said it was all right. I received no notice of dishonour, and presumed it was paid. I wrote all my own cheques, in perfect confidence they would be honoured, and in proof of this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050035"/>
               <p>I gave my wife and mother about 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cheques, which they have since withdrawn. If I had intended to rob Mr. Fleming of his jewellery, it stands to reason if I had known his cheque was dishonoured I would not have gone to Thanet Place, as it was known as my address, and also to Collins, for it is written in the paying-in book. My wife did not like to wear the jewellery, and it was arranged to go on Monday and change it. I had plenty of time to make away with the jewellery and myself if I had wished to be dishonest; I ask the Court to take this into their merciful consideration; No sane man fearing arrest and knowing he had committed a crime would have acted as I did. I gave the drawer of the cheque 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my bill at four months and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; the bill was drawn on a 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. stamp. On one occasion Lascelles called on me he was shown in my room. He was with me more than half an hour. Previously to this I had received from Lascelles a bill for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable on sight. He took it away, and brought it back purporting to be signed by Vallantine &amp; Co. He withdrew the former note and substituted the one in question. Mr. Collins was to receive 10 per cent, on the amount of my purchases with Mr. Fleming. I gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd shillings, being his commission. It was of course dishonoured."</p>

I am a polisher, and live at 21, New Montague Street, Spitalfields—on Saturday, 30th January, I saw a girl named Caroline Mills in Finch Street, she spoke to me—Cain was with me—I did not hear any chaff pass—on the Monday night, about 9.30, I saw Dempsey standing at the corner of Frostick Place, which runs out of Finch Street—Caroline Mills was with him; she hallooed out my name—I took no notice—she called me again, and I went over—she asked me who it was that hallooed out "Big-headed Dempsey"—I said I did not know—she said "If you don't tell me you will have a b----y punch on the nose," and Dempsey said he would punch me on the nose—I then went home—the next night, Tuesday, I was coming through the same street again about the same time, and saw the prisoners and Mills—I was alone—Dempsey challenged to fight me in the road, and before I had time to pull off my coat I was knocked down on the back of my head insensible—Leary knocked me down, leastways Cullerty I should say—it was with his leg I went down, he was behind me, I saw him do it, they were all round me—I got up and told them I would not fight anymore, I had not fought; Dempsey asked me if I was going to fight, and I said no—on the next night, Wed<lb/>nesday, I was coming through Finch Street between 9.50 and 9.55,1 saw Caro<lb/>line Mills—she told me that Dempsey wanted me—I said I did not want him—after that I saw Dempsey in Frostick Place, and Leary, Cullerty, and I should think about ten more at the other end of Frostick Place—Morris Cantor was with me—Dempsey asked me if I was going to fight him, I said I would not fight, and I went away—I saw Denis Maddigan and John Gray and Jenner come down Frostick Place, Dempsey again challenged to fight me, and I was about to fight him when Maddigan told me not to fight as he had got a white-handled knife in his right hand—I then saw the knife, and I told him I would not fight—Dempsey then made a rush at Maddigan with the knife in his right hand, holding it so</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">down by his side</hi>), and Maddigan hit him in the mouth, and knocked him down—he got up and hallooed out "Knives out and <hi rend="italic">chivs</hi> ready"—i then saw Cullerty with a knife in his hand, and I saw him make a stab at Maddigan—Maddigan stooped down, and the knife went over his head, and it struck his own friend Dempsey—Dempsey fell on his knees, got up again and cried "You have stabbed your own <hi rend="italic">pal, Pudding</hi>"—Cullerty turned round and said "Have I, it can't be helped, I will have my temper out on some one else"—I then ran into the road, and before I had time to return I heard Gray say "I am stabbed"—I went over to him, and saw the prisoners all running up Frostick Place, and when they were half way up Frostick Place they said "Come on, we will put the knife into you"—I don't know who it was said that—I and Maddigan went and assisted Gray from the ground; he said "Keep your eye on that man, don't lose him whatever you do, it was him that stabbed me"—he pointed to Cullerty, he was then about a dozen yards up Frostick Place, he was behind the rest, and about a dozen yards off—Leary came back, and I saw him make a kick at Gray while he was on the ground—I did not hear him say anything, he went away after that—I did not see any of the prisoners stopped—we assisted Gray to Doctor Squires—I did not go to the hospital—I did not see Cain on the Wednesday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I said at first that it was Leary, who knocked me down on the Tuesday, but that was a mistake, I pointed to Cullerty, I could not recollect his name—Frostick Place, is about two or three times as long as this Court—I did not go into the court on the Wednesday night—I was coming through Finch Street, the first time—it was in Frostick Place that the knives were used—the first time I was there was about 9.30—at that time I was living with my parents in New Montague Street, I am now living at a coffee shop in Osborn Street—I should not have to pass down Finch Street to get to New Montague Street—Frostick Place has an entrance at each end—I should not have to go through it to get to New Montague Street—I was coming from the whitechapel Road—I left work at 8 o'clock and had been for a walk—I went from Whitechapel Road down Osborn Street, and through Finch Street, Morris Cantor was with me, no one else—Caroline Mills was at the Finch Street end of Frostick Place—there was nobody else in the court that I could see at that time—I could see right through the court from end to end—Mills ran away, and then about fifteen were fetched back with her—I was not there three minutes—I was standing talking to Cantor, and when Mills came back there was a lot at the other end of the court—the Old Montague Street end—I did not know them, I never saw them before—they were none of the prisoners; the prisoners were at the Finch Street end—I walked about 3 yards away from the court, and was standing talking to Cantor in Finch Street—the three prisoners were then at the Finch Street corner of the court, and Mills was talking to Dempsey—I did not see anybody else—Maddigan and Gray came up together when we had been standing there about ten minutes—Dempsey wanted to fight me, and Maddigan told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to fight a lot of little boys like us—all that were there were bigger than Dempsey—Dempsey did not take his coat off—I did not see the knife in his right hand till Maddigan told me—he did not double his fist when he asked me to fight, he stood in that manner, with the knife under his coat, and said 'Come on, fight me now"—Maddigan was about half a yard from him—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050040"/>
               <p>was behind Maddigan—Maddigan did not knock him down before he made a rush at him with the knife—he came up to Maddigan like that (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), and Maddigan up with his fist and knock him down—the others who were at the other end of the court stopped there; when they heard the prisoners repeat "Knives out and <hi rend="italic">chivs</hi> ready "they all came up the court, that was before Gray was stabbed—I could not say how many people were round when Gray received the wound—there might have been from twenty to twenty-six people out of their doors—I did not know who any of them were except the prisoners and Mills, and the three men with me—I did not go into the court out of any harm—I did not know that the prisoners were going to be there—I was in the habit of coming through there every night, and nobody ever interfered with me before—I don't generally go through the court—I go through Finch Street every night—when I was called over to the court by Mills I did not expect that some of these men would be there—I did not know that there was going to be any row, it was all through the girl—she told me that Dempsey wanted me, and I said I did not want him—she began the row on the Saturday, there was no quarrel then, she spoke to us as she was going through the court, we were in Finch Street, on the opposite side of the way—the quarrel was on the Monday night, about Mills, it was not between me and Dempsey—there was no quarrel at all, only him telling me he would punch me on the nose; that was about Mills; that was at the corner of the court—I did not go into the court on the Tuesday night; I passed it and saw Dempsey and Mills at the corner—Cantor was with me—Wednesday night was the first time Maddigan had been there; I only knew him by sight before—I did not know Gray before—I did not see Dempsey bleeding—I heard him say that he was stabbed—I don't know what become of him afterwards—Jenner came up along with Gray, they were not with me.</p>

I saw Leary at the police-station—he was not then in custody—he walked to the station alongside the policeman, and as we were going along I told the policeman that he was one of them, Cullerty was then in custody—Leary went into the station himself and sat down beside me—I did not ask him whether he had seen Cullerty stab Gray—I did not say so before the Magistrate, it is a mistake—when Cullerty's name was mentioned by the policeman; I said to Leary "That's him"—that was all I said.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Flower and Dean Street, and am a fish porter—I am nineteen years old—on Wednesday night, 3rd February, between 9.45 and 9.50, I was going through Finch Street, no one was with me—I met John Gray going through Finch Street, he lodged in the same house with me, Jenner was with him—they stopped me, and Gray asked me to have some beer—after that I noticed a crowd at the corner of Frostick Place, Finch Street—we went up to the corner and saw the three prisoners and King and Cain standing against them—I knew Cain before, and King only by sight—Dempsey asked King to fight him, and he sparred with his left hand and in the right he had an open-bladed white-handled knife under his coat like that (<hi rend="italic">with his hand to his shoulder</hi>)—when I saw the knife I said to King "No, you must not fight; he is too big for you"—with) that Dempsey would have put the knife into him; I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050041"/>
               <p>saw his right hand move—he made a clout at him with his left hand and drew out the knife in his right from his coat, but I prevented him—I pushed him back, or else the knife would have gone through King—Dempsey then said to me "You can take it up if you like," and I saw the flash of a knife go across my head—he then cried out "Knives out," and Cullerty and Leary and a few more behind them said "<hi rend="italic">Chivs</hi> already"—it was a general cry, meaning "Knives ready"—Cullerty then made a stab at me with a white-handled knife: it did not strike me—Gray pulled me away, and said "Look out, here is a knife"—I fell on my knees, and the knife went into his own friend Dempsey—I saw the knife in Cullerty's hand; I am quite sure of it, it was a white-handled one, the same as Dempsey's—it struck Dempsey somewhere on the shoulder, and he fell to the ground with the effect of the stab, and said "Do you know who you have stabbed? You have stabbed your own <hi rend="italic">pal, Puddingy</hi>"—Cullerty said "It's done now and it can't be undone; I will have my revenge out, and put it into one of them for it"—with that he made another stab at me—Gray pulled me on one side a second time, and it went into Gray just here (<hi rend="italic">the breast</hi>)—this is the coat I have on now that Gray was wearing; here-is the mark where the cut was—Gray fell to the ground—I put my hands round his waist and fell a-top of him—he said "I am stabbed," and pointing to Cullerty he said "Don't let him go"—I called on Jenner to get hold of Cullerty; I could not leave Gray—Jenner caught Cullerty by the head—he had a cap on—Jenner kept the cap and Cullerty got away from him—what happened then I do not know—there was a scrambling in the court with the three prisoners and Jenner—they all got away—Leary returned and made a kick at Gray while he was on the ground, but he kicked my forefinger; he kicked at his side—I assisted Gray to Mr. Squires' shop—he was not attended to there—we got a cab and took him to the London Hospital—he died shortly after he got there—he bled a good deal on the ground—I saw the three prisoners at the hospital—the two took their friend Dempsey there—Gray was between twenty-three and twenty-four years of age.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 106). On Wednesday night, 3rd February, I saw Gray being helped along Brick Lane by Maddigan, Jenner and Jones, and several others; that is less than a ¼ of a mile from Frostick Place—he was bleeding very much—I got a cab and took him to the hospital—when we got there I found Cullerty and Leary in the Receiving Room, and Demp<lb/>sey in a room close by, having his wounds dressed—Gray was taken charge of by the surgeon—the prisoners were pointed out to me by the witnesses, Cullerty as the man who had stabbed Gray, and Leary as the one that kicked him—Cullerty said it was not him, it was Jenner—Jenner produced a cap, and Cullerty claimed it as his—I asked him how he came by the cap he had on—he said that was Dempsey's, and Dempsey said it was his—I found nothing on Cullerty—I found this white-handled knife in Leary's waistcoat pocket—I did not see him do anything with it—I did not notice any blood on it—Dempsey pointed out four different men as the men that stabbed him and Gray; two of them were strangers, who came in with a woman to see the doctor, the others were strange men.</p>

I had no knife in my possession, and I have not carried one for more than twelve months."</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the London Hospital, on Wednesday, 3rd February, when John Gray was brought there a little after 10 o'clock—he was perfectly blanched and bloodless—his clothes on the left hand side were saturated with blood—I discovered a wound in his left shoulder above the armpit; it did not enter the chest—it was about 1 inch in length and 21/2 inches deep—it was not bleeding much at the time, but it burst out again, and he died about three minutes after his admission—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the main artery in the arm had been completely divided, which was the cause of death from loss of blood—in all probability it "was a stab wound, any knife would do it—there were no marks of violence on his body—Dempsey was under my care in the hospital for three weeks—he had two knife wounds, one on the right shoulder behind, and one on the top of the left shoulder—they were not very deep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 21, Nasmith Street—I was with the last witness near the Anglesea, and saw an old gentleman pushed out; I did not see who by, but the potman came out directly afterwards, when he had walked as far as the kerb, and knocked him down in the road with his fist—he struck him on the side of the head—I saw the blow light on his head, and his hat fell off into the road—the old man got up and said "Will you leave me alone, I am going home"—he walked about 10 yards, and the prisoner went after him and knocked him down again with his fist, but I did not see where he struck him that time; he got up again—he said nothing, but was going away, and when he had gone about two steps the prisoner knocked him down again, and he said "You have broken my leg"—I ran up to him, and he said "My <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> is broken, do fetch some one"—the pri<lb/>soner ran away—I saw Mr. Tailbee there; he said "That's right, give it to him," three times, and I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself—he told me to go home and mind our own business—I first saw Mr. Tailbee when the deceased was knocked down the second time; he was standing at the door with his sister and a man—he was not there the first time the man was knocked down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 4th March, from information I received, I went to Foster's Parcels Delivery Office, Bennett's Hill, Doctors' Commons, accompanied by Mitchell, another officer, and there saw the two prisoners—we told them we were police officers, and mentioned to them the fact of a case of umbrellas sent to Ipswich having been broken open—I asked the two prisoners if they knew anything about a case being broken open in the basement and three umbrellas abstracted—they said they knew nothing about it—I said "It is very clear that this case was broken open in the basement," and asked Joyce first if he had anything about him which did not belong to him—he said "No"—I then searched him, and in his coat breast pocket I found these three white silk handker<lb/>chiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked "How do you account for these?<hi rend="italic"/>"—he said "I had them from Fowler," referring to another porter who was present—he' said "Sexton had them first"—I then took Joyce to Fleet Street Police Station and searched him there, when I found a key upon him—he took it out of his pocket—on the way to the station he said "I will tell you the truth; you will find one of the umbrellas at home"—he gave me his address, No. 2, Scarsdale Road, Camberwell—he also said "Those white handkerchiefs we took out of a parcel the other day"—when I got to his residence I opened the door with the key I obtained from him—I found a green box in which I found two other white handkerchiefs similar to the three I found upon him, and thirty-five pieces of skin, some of sable—then there was a small box with six scarfs in it, and another box with six scarfs and three pairs of ladies' kid gloves, another box with eight silk scarfs, three cambric handkerchiefs, a pair of braces, a piece of velvet, twenty-nine linen collars, twenty-eight valentines, a lady's companion; and the umbrella I found in the room—I took all these things back to the Fleet Strett Station—I showed them to Joyce—he picked out several of the boxes—this is one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing six scarfs—he said "I took them"—that is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> box, also a small box with these three pairs of ladies' kid gloves—he picked out several other things, the valentines—this umbrella he told me was at the house—there is a ring on it—that is all with reference to Joyce—when I went to Foster's place I said to Sexton "Have you any objection to your place being searched?"—he said no, he had not, and Mitchell and Sexton went on to his place—Mitchell found these two handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I spoke to the prisoner respecting them—I said "What have you got to say to this, Sexton?"—he said "What can I say? It is a bad job"—I looked in the clock in the bed-room on the mantel-shelf, a</p>

On the afternoon of the 4th March I went with Outram to Foster's Parcel Delivery Company, Bennett's Hill—Outram was spokesman—I after that went alone with Sexton to his lodging—I asked him if he had any objection to have his place searched—he said "No"—we then went into the back room and in a drawer I found four pairs of socks—I asked him how he accounted for them—he said "I bought them"—I said "Where"—he said "I don't know"—in the same drawer I found these kid gloves—I asked him how he accounted for them—he made no answer—in the same drawer I found this bit of wire, and there was a Cardigan jacket—I then said "Have you anything else?"—he said "No"—I said "Where is your bed-room?<hi rend="italic"/>"—he said "I cannot get in there because I have not the key, you must wait till my father comes home, he will be here in a few minutes"—his father came up but did not know where the key was—the prisoner then volunteered to get through the window of the bed-room by the landing and open the door—I said "Do so"—as soon as he got in he shut the window—I listened and heard the sound of a lock and key and I then got in through the same window and found him concealing something under the bed-clothing—he had not unlocked the door—I said "What are you doing?"—he made no answer—I then turned the bed clothing down and I found those two silk handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "How do you account for those, Sexton?"—he said "It is no good, it is a bad job"—that piece of wire looks to me as if it had been used for opening locks.</p>

Fowler, that parcel is gone." I turned over the rest of the parcels and I said "It isn't here;" so I ran upstairs, just as I got upstairs, he was turning back again with the parcel and he said "I thought there was sixpence out on that one"—I know what that parcel is;" I said "Do you? whether you know what it is or not, you leave my things alone;" the seal was broken; the principal of those goods was given to me by Fowler; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know nothing about the two umbrellas; I never <hi rend="italic">got</hi> back till 5 or 6 minutes to 4 o'clock, and then all the goods were sorted, be<lb/>cause 1 lived at the West End and went to my dinner and walked back again.

I am a cattle salesman, and live at Stonebridge House, Tottenham—there is a house next door which is also my property—it was empty in the early part of February, and had been empty for some time—it was locked up and the shutters fastened—on the evening of the 3rd Feb<lb/>ruary, when I returned home from the city, my servants told me they sus<lb/>pected there had been thieves—my gardener, Warner, went into the house, I did not go myself—I was getting up about 6.45 on the morning of the 4th, when my partner, who stays with me, said something to me, and I looked out of the window and saw three men coming into the garden next door—I hurriedly dressed myself and went out, taking a revolver with me—I went to the next house, and just outside the door I found a coster<lb/>monger's truck with some sacking on it—I drew that out in the front court, and went out into the road to look for a policeman—I could not see one, but George Wake, a gardener of a friend of mine, came along, and he came and assisted me—we went to the house, and by that time Warner, my own gardener, had come—we went to the back of the house—my gardener heard something and rushed to the front, and then I heard a noise, so I ran round to the front, and then I saw the prisoner Martin run across the road, and by the side of the road—I have no doubt at all about his identity—I said "Stay, or I shall shoot you"—he said "Shoot!" and he kept on running away—I did not shoot—my gardener followed him up, and I did not see any more of him till he was in custody—I went into the house and found that the copper had been taken from the scullery, several of the gas fittings were cut, and the lead removed from the top of the house, all ready for re<lb/>moval—it was about 9 o'clock when I went into the house on the morning of the 4th—I had not been in for a week before that, but my gardener had looked after it—I did not see the other prisoner at all, only coming into the gate—I believe he was one of the three that came into the gate.</p>

               <p>my hold—Coaffee went over a brick wall, and I missed him; I turned after Martin then—he ran away and I followed him—he went through a brook twice and me after him—I saw him throw something into the brook, but what it was I can't swear—there was 2 or 3 feet of mud at the bottom—he turned round several times and shook a stick at me, and said "You b----if you come near me"—ultimately he got into a coal siding belonging to Messrs. Lea &amp; Co., and I called for help there—he had got a stick in his hand, which he would not throw away until a man came up with a dog and threatened to set the dog at him if he did not, and then we apprehended him—he said he would go with me—I said "No, I shall call on these other three men to go with me"—they got him to the station house—I had seen the house all safe, and the things in the right place on the Saturday before Thursday the 4th—I found that a gas fitting had been removed on the 4th which had not been removed on the 3rd—I saw that up myself on the night of the 3rd in the front room.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present at the fight on 1st February between Tubbs and Dulgar—after it was over Dulgar was assisted to a Hansom cab—he and Tubbs and Floyd and Bowker all four got into the cab and drove off, both the men were very weak indeed and <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad at the end of the fight—I don't know how long the fight lasted—I was there fifty minutes, and they had been fighting half an hour I was told when I got there—they were pretty strong when I got there—I went that same night to Dulgar's house and was present at his death, I should think that was nearly 10 o'clock—during the fight I heard one or two of the prisoners ask Dulgar to leave off—he refused to do so, he determined to fight, he would not take any notice of their wishes—I heard them ask him to leave off some five or six rounds before the end of the fight—if he had left off when he was first told I certainly think he would have lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 111, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury—on 1st February, about 6.15, I was sent for to see Dulgar, in Little Russell Street, his father's house—he was in bed on the first floor—he was insensible, his face was very much swollen, more espe<lb/>cially on the left side, blood was issuing from his nose and mouth, and his eyelids were both swollen up, his arms were bruised, and his neck scratched; he was suffering from injuries, and from concussion of the brain—he died the same night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination two days afterwards—I found that his nose was broken, his teeth broken, his lips torn, and bruised all over the chest—the "cause of death was concussion produced by the general injuries he had received and the shaking—he had fought too long, that was what killed him—the concussion might have been caused by blows with the fist; the injuries were quite recent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "The letter, which is sup<lb/>posed to have contained the challenge for the fight, was not really a challenge at all, it was an apology from Dulgar for not being able to keep the appointment that I believe he had made to meet at the York public-house the same night he had sent the letter. The appointment was not made with me. I believe they had had a quarrel a week or two previous to the fight, but I was not there; I believe that was when the first arrangement was made to fight for money. I believe Dulgar gave Leonard 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deposit to bind the match, and the letter likewise. I received the money from Leonard, but not the letter; that was the night after it was sent. I heard there was a letter sent to me, and I went there to demand it, and I had the letter and the money given into my hands. I had nothing to do with the fight or the arrangement of it I kept the letter some time,"' but it was burnt to light the gas. I never attached any value to <hi rend="italic">it</hi>"</p>

I was not aware that it was going to take place on the Monday. The letter said it was to take place in a few days, but it went on two or three weeks after that. When they came home Tubbs asked me for the money. I asked the coachman if it was right I was to pay the money, he said yes, and I paid it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I do not remember seeing Ann Stephens that night at all—I had had no work for ten weeks and no food for ten days, and had not been in bed for ten weeks—I used to lay in a van or anywhere I could—some men where I used to work gave me some drink—I never struck her in my life—we had a good many quarrels about her going with the railway porters and guards—She never went home before 11 or 12 o'clock at night and sometimes 3 o'clock in the morning and woke me up—I worked there twelve months—Her husband came and upset us there and she locked me up, and that was our parting, and then I got some drink and lost my work through it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 109, Mildmay Grove—that is about a mile and a half from Eden Grove, Holloway—I have known the prisoner for five or six years—I have been for twenty years manager at Docwra and Sons, the contractors of Balls Pond—the prisoner was employed there between three and four years at different times put together, and I had an opportunity of seeing him daily—I had discharged him four or five months before 6th March, and had seen him once in the interval, when he came to the office one morning and asked me to employ him—I told him I would not as he was a worthless vagabond, and told him to go about his business—that was before Christmas—I generally take money to pay the men on Saturday mornings, and it is my habit to leave home at 5.15 a.m. punctually—the prisoner knew that when he worked at the firm—he knew the hour of my arrival—I usually left by the area door, but. I have not done so since—there are eight steps up to the house to the front door and three steps down to the area—on 6th March I opened the area door to come out, I closed it after me, and did not notice anyone—at the instant I closed the door this paving stone, which weighs 261bs. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), came down from the prisoner's hands from a height of 11 or 12 feet—he was standing at the top of the steps leading to the house—it struck me on my hat and on my shoulder, it bruised my shoulder very much—I thought that part of the portico had fallen down, having no idea that the prisoner was secreted there with this stone—I was greatly alarmed—I found the prisoner on top of me in an instant; he must have jumped down and come down three or four steps on top of me—the stone had brought me to the ground—I knew then that his little game was plunder, as he knew that I had money—I closed with him as well as I could till we got out on the footway—he tried to escape, we had a struggle, and I knocked him down, but he got up instantly—I think I must have held him by his jacket, it was a kind of fustian jacket—he jumped up and ran away—I ran after him shouting "Murder," and he deliberately stopped short, struck me on the shoulder, and knocked me down and kicked me about the body—I was then about 40 yards from my own door—he made a groan when he gave me the last kick, but he did not speak—he got away—the stone does not belong to my house, it was brought there by him—there is a place on Newington Green, which would be on his way, where there are similar stones, and he had a basket which he carried with him large enough to contain this stone—it does not belong to my neighbourhood—I have not the slightest doubt about his being the man, I knew him well.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a timber merchant at Old Montague Street, Whitechapel—previously to the 11th February I had some small transactions with a person of the name of Chapman—on the 11th February Chapman, in company with prisoner, came to my premises and said he had got a gentleman who would buy some wood and pay me ready money for it—we viewed the goods and decided about the price, and prisoner wished me then to take the number of the goods and send them on that evening—I said that would be impossible—I said I should like to count every veneer and see the number there was on it, and then I could give a guarantee for what I sent away—I went away through the Mill and said "Where shall I send the goods to-morrow?"—he said "Hasn't Chapman given you a card) Pass me a card"—Chapman gave me a card in the prisoner's presence, and away they went to a public-house, and I had a glass of ale with them—this is the card they gave me—this on the back is my own writing—the other is what I wrote on it after—the card is "Hastings, Dale &amp; Co., Shackelwell Lane, Kingsland, dealers in all kinds of timber"—I said before I left him on the 11th "If you will be kind enough to call on me about 11 o'clock tomorrow I will get everything ready so that I can guarantee that everything is what I represent"—on the 12th, at 12 o'clock, the prisoner arrived—Chapman was not there—the prisoner checked the goods with me and I went indoors and made out this invoice to the amount of 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as I commenced to make out the invoice I said to the prisoner "I forget your name—I have got your card somewhere"—my wife was looking for the card and could not find it—the prisoner said "I will give you another," and he put his band in his pocket and took out another one and said "That is my address" I said "Are you proprietor of this place?"—"Oh, yes," he said—it was just the same kind of card as the other—no writing on the back—I then headed the bill the same as the card—I made out the account and said "Then shall I settle the account, sir?"—he said "No, I am not prepared to pay you the whole amount—didn't Chapman tell you my terms?"—I said "Yes, cash. and I understood cash"—he said "Well I am not prepared to pay cash; I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a two and a three months' bill for the remainder; of course I will make my bills payable at my bankers;"—I said "Who are your bankers?"—he said Drummond, the banker, Charing Cross"—I then said "I know nothing of you, sir, and I really cannot see my way clear to let you have the goods without cash, as I have looked them out for, it is the price for cash, I will consult my partner about it"—he then said "Well I will go and take a glass of ale while you consult your partner about it, and you can let me know"—with that he went to the door, and as he had got the door in his hand to go out he said "Of course you know I shall make my bills payable at my bunkers," a second time—I consulted my <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> about it—he didn't come back and I didn't go to see him—previous to the time I met him again, I met Chapman—he afterwards sent Chapman to know whether I would accept his offer or not—I went to the public-house to see him and said "I really cannot accept such an offer as that"—I asked him for a cheque on his bankers when I first saw him, and I would allow him 5 per cent, if he would give me a cheque on the bank for the whole amount—that is 2 1/2 per cent, over the usual amount allowed—he would not consent at all and when I saw him at the public-house I said "If you will pay me half</p>

               <p>cash I will accept a bill on your bankers for the remainder"—he said "No, I am offering you the same terms I can get anywhere else"—I stopped there some little time with him—he said "I have sold a business for 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the money is lying at Drummond's Bank to my credit"—I did not see Chapman there then—I was sent for to go home to business and I went outside the door and he (prisoner) followed me and said "I will make it 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash and give you a one and a two months' bill"—I hesitated for a moment and then said "Well, I will accept that on the representation of your having a banking account at Drummonds, and being the owner of a house "as he represented, the Robin Hood Tavern—he then said "Can you send the veneer in at once?"—I said "I will send for my carman and it is possible you may get it within half an hour of this"—the carman did not come for nearly an hour and a half, but he did come, and the goods were loaded as checked in the prisoner's pocket-book and in my book at home to correspond with the bill, and were loaded and delivered to his order, and the bill was receipted for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received and the two bills on Drummond's bank for the remainder, and a receipt stamp put upon it.</p>

                  </hi>.(<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 248). On the night of the 26th March I was on duty in Wardour Street, when I saw the prisoners at the corner of the street in conversation—it was about 11.30—they went to the corner of Little Dean Street and crossed to the corner of Little Pultney Street, and went on to Down's Place—after they had been there about ten minutes I went up the court leading into Down's Place—I saw West at the right hand corner at the top of the court leading into Down's Place—the other two prisoners, before I could reach West, came down, and I heard a loud report, like a smash of glass, which I found to be a water-trough which had been broken away from the woodwork—about 19 feet of it had come down right along the end of the premises—it was across the back part of No. 72—when I heard the noise McBean and Benjamin came from the corner where the water trough was broken down to where West was standing—they got part of the way down the court when I closed with them and prevented them passing—I asked them what they had been doing there—McBean replied they had been there to make water, at the same time pointing to some water on the flags—I told him that was not fresh urine and then spoke to him respecting the water trough and asked them if they knew anything about it, and they said they knew nothing about it—two of the prisoners, West and McBean, offered me their names and addresses and mentioned Portland Street—finding no help near me I kept them in quiet conversa<lb/>tion for a few minutes, when McBean passed to my left in the direction of the w.c. at the corner—he then came to the corner of the court again and was about to make his escape by trying to pass me, to force himself by me, when I closed with him and kept him back after a violent struggle—Bishop <hi rend="italic">C</hi> 78 came to my assistance—before he came up McBean said that if they had done any damage they would pay for it—Bishop came and the three prisoners were taken into custody—McBean behaved very violently the whole of the time—at the station I searched Benjamin and found on him a box containing matches and a candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—before we left Down's Place Bishop received <hi rend="italic">this jemmy (produced</hi>) from Fenton—I saw him hand it to Bishop—I didn't see where he got it from—West said he didn't know the other prisoners and they had only just come from the Surrey Theatre—I afterwards went back with the inspector and examined the place where</p>

They are all working classes that live in those nine little houses; they form a little square—I believe the w.c. is open to all in the court—I had not been in Down's Place for more than once in a month—McBean tried to slip his clothes and also again in Wardour Street—they gave me their addresses at the station—I went to McBean's and West's; they were correct—I searched there but found nothing—I found the matches on Benjamin—I found the piece of candle and two ordinary penknives—that is all—I sometimes use that kind of matches—I do not think it is common amongst working people for them to carry a piece of candle—it is composite candle—they could see without the candle outside—I never spoke to Shrives about it—I was examined twice at Marl-borough Street—I think when I was first examined I forgot to say anything about McBean being violent in trying to get out of the court—I spoke to Shrives about it after, but not to anyone else in the force.</p>

Wardour Street, and Down's Place—I heard a crash, and I ran into the passage leading into Down's Place, and saw the other constable stopping the three prisoners—I stood in the dark and watched what they were doing—I heard the last witness ask what they were doing, and they said "Making water"—a man named Fenton came out of his house—he immediately went to the closet and pushed the door open and saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> there (<hi rend="italic">prod<lb/>uced</hi>), and picked it up and handed it to me—as he did so, West and Benjamin made a rush to get past—I seized hold of West and struggled with him, and pushed Benjamin back into the passage again—West said he lived at 5, Portland Street, and that they had been to the Surrey Theatre—I noticed McBean's chin, which had a mark on it as if he had hurt himself on a brick wall, and when I spoke of it he told me to b----myself ah it had nothing to do with me—I found on McBean, a small penknife, and a key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am messenger employed by the Imperial Ottoman Bank, 28, Throgmorton Street—on the morning of the 18th March, about 9.50, I was standing between the two counters of the bank preparing to get the bank ready, and seeing that all was right—the prisoner and another man came in—one followed the other in—the missing man asked me for a list of the drawn bonds—I said I would give him one, and I went round the counter—the prisoner was standing near the left hand counter; I went round to a desk which one of the clerks has, and where the list is strung up on a nail, and while I was looking for the list I turned my head towards the door and saw the prisoner with a parcel in his possession—I holloaed out to him lustily, and he dropped it instantly—he seemed to me as if he was going to make his escape out of the swing doors—the door is about 2 yards from the counter where that package was placed; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel—I immediately ran round from behind the counter to the front, ran up to the prisoner, and asked him what he was doing with that parcel—he said "I accidentally knocked it off the counter"—I asked him what brought him there, what was his business, and he said he came in with the other gentleman—I said "Then I must detain you"—we sent for a policeman and gave him in charge—my wife came in at the same time as the prisoner and the missing man; so she told me—the packages of the cancelled coupons were about 2 feet high on the counter, and the counter is about 3 feet high—I examined the pile of packages and found one missing besides this one; it had been taken from the top of one of the piles—there were two piles, and a package had been taken from each—there was a broken parcel; that was on the top of the one that was taken away—I saw it on the counter after I had spoken to the prisoner; previous to that it had been on the top of the pile.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The packet of loose coupons was not on the floor when my attention was called to it—I did not see anyone pick it up from the floor and put it on the counter—the counter is 3 feet high, and each of the parcels of bonds was about 2 feet high on the counter—they were arranged one on the other, and were about the same size as this parcel—I believe they were all cancelled coupons—I did not find one parcel on the floor after the missing person went out—all the" others were on the counter, except the one which was taken away by the missing man—there was no other official of the bank there—there was a young gentleman who says he saw the parcel drop from the further part of the bank—he is here—his name is Mr. Beard—I don't remember that Mr. Beard and I had a discussion as to whether some of the bundles were on the floor and had tumbled down, and were put back on the counter—I don't remember it—I don't remember that Mr. Beard said that one of the parcels was on the floor, except the one that the prisoner dropped—it was not the paying-in counter where the parcels were—there is a right hand counter and a left hand counter—the parcels were on the left counter—the prisoner was near the counter where the parcels were—the other man was about 3 yards from the door when he made the inquiry of me; between the counters—I don't recollect the prisoner saying that he picked the parcel up after he had accidentally knocked it down—when I first saw the parcel in his possession he seemed as if he was going to strike out of the door—I spoke to him, and he let it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the Opera Hotel, in Bow Street—in August last the prisoner called upon me about publishing a book called the "History of Leicester Square," and asked me if I would have an advertisement in it—I had never seen him before, but he said he was a very great friend of my brother's, had known him for years and it would be a great service to him—I agreed to have the advertisement and I think once or twice he came after that, and the books were published—one night the prisoner came and said "I have run short of money, I want to get to Wandsworth, to my wife and family"—that was about a month after he first introduced himself to me—I. lent him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he first came a person came with him whom he said was publishing the book—I did not know his name at that time—about the 1st September, or the last day of August, the prisoner brought a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him who was the drawer of the cheque, and he said "Murray Harding, the gentleman who was with me publishing the book"—I asked him if the cheque was a good one—I said "Do you know it is right"—he said "He has got plenty of money there, he banks at Hoare's, and he has got plenty of money in the bank"—I said "Very well, if you will endorse the cheque I will cash it for you"—he said "You may as well take the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out that I owe you"—I handed him three sovereigns—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "1st September, 1874, Messrs. Hoares, bankers. Pay William Mason, Esq., or bearer, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Murray Harding." Endorsed "William Mason, W. Hogg.")—I paid that into my bankers, and it was returned to me marked "no account"—no other person who called himself Murray Harding came to my place, except the person who came with Mason, when the book was publishing—he may have come two or three times, perhaps with Mason—I saw the Mr. Murray Harding, who was called at Bow Street—he was not the man who came about the book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Joseph Barrett, jeweller, 94, Edgware Road—on 26th January, the prisoner came into the shop about 12.30 in the day, and asked to be shown some lockets suitable for bridesmaids—I showed him a number of lockets which were in a tray covered with velvet, and a number of hooks in the tray, and on each hook hung a locket—he took six or eight lockets from the tray and selected four, which he at first thought might do to send the lady to look at, but on consideration he thought that two of them being rather larger than the other two, it would create a jealousy amongst the bridesmaids, and he wished to know if I would show him any larger ones—I told him I had some larger lockets, but I was afraid I had not them alike—I crossed the shop and brought four or five lockets from the window, and showed him those, and he weighed them in his hand—the locket that was stolen was one of those I had subsequently, showed him in the tray, which I took from the window—there is a ticket to each locket—I am sure I took the ticket from' the window with the locket that was stolen—I never take one out without the ticket—I saw him take that particular locket in his hand and weigh it, and I saw it on the counter a minute or two after that—he asked about some engraving—he wished to see some specimens of engraving which he would want placed on the pockets—Mr. Barrett came into the shop at the time and asked me if he could assist me, seeing me looking for the specimens, and I told him what I was looking for—he went to the desk and found an envelope with some initials on it—the prisoner did not mention what letters he wanted put on the lockets—he then took his hat off the counter and put it on, saying he had got the whole of the particulars he wanted, and hurriedly left the shop—I had told him before the cost of the engraving—there was a. young lady in the shop at the time, but no other customer except the prisoner—the young lady was sitting down the whole of the time, about six feet from the prisoner—there was a chair between her and the prisoner—I went to the police station on 2nd March and picked the prisoner out from a number of men—I had not the slightest doubt about his identity, and I have not now—I discovered the locket had</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It did not come across my mind at the Police Court about the young lady sitting on a chair—I stated there was another customer in the shop—Mr. Barrett gave a description of the man to the police—I did not—sometimes we receive goods in the daytime from manufacturers—the business fluctuates, sometimes as many as fifty people come in the day—I did not search for the locket afterwards, and it was not necessary—we have goods brought in by manufacturers and left for approbation sometimes in the day—we keep a stock-book—we don't compare the actual stock with the stock-book every night—the window is only dressed about once a month, when it is cleaned—the articles are left in the window from night till morning—I don't remember how long before that particular day the window was dressed—we take stock once a year—we enter everything that we sell and compare that book with the stock-book—we have not done that since the 26th January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the particular locket in the prisoner's hand—I found the ticket of it after he had gone, lying there without the locket—when I took it out of the window I took it out with the ticket—when we sell articles we remove the ticket and put it on one side, and use it again sometimes—I never knew a ticket get changed by accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at 32, Davies Street—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 10th February, the prisoner came into my shop and asked to look at some earrings—amongst the things that he looked at there was one set of locket and earrings—that was the only locket he looked at—it had five diamonds in the centre, and then it was alternately pearl and turquoise all round—I saw that locket in his fingers once—he left the shop after buying a pair of earrings—he had hardly gone off the door step when I missed the locket, and I called out to my sister—I gave information to the police, about half an hour afterwards—I went to the police-station on the 24th, and saw thirty or forty men together there and I picked the prisoner out—there were three ladies in the shop part of the time the prisoner was there, old customers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The edge of the furnace is a cast iron frame made up with brick-work—it is hollow inside—I heard the ingot put down on the iron, that was all the noise I did hear—I was present when a conversation took place between the prisoner and Hunt at the main gate, about 11 o'clock; Newton was there—Hunt asked the prisoner if he had any keys about him—he said he had two—he produced two keys, to the best of my belief, and took off his coat—I heard him say "I saw the metal there last night, and I placed a piece of coal and a piece of coke upon it"—I don't recollect hearing him say "When I looked at it to night I found it had been dis<lb/>turbed;" he may have said that he was going" to report the matter as soon as he found out what kind of ingots they were—I can't swear that he did</p>

               <p>say so, I did not hear all that passed, I was in another room part of the time—there are ingots of different metals and different sizes in the lead-room, I have never seen any ingot temporarily stacked near the coal bunkers; the bunkers are of brick-work and iron, <hi rend="italic">level</hi> with the ground—there have been as many as fifty or sixty tons of coal put in the bunker; the coal is separated from the coke by an iron plate 4 or 5 feet high, when they got too high the coke runs over to the coal—I watched the bunker on 19th. March from about 10.30 or 11 o'clock in the morning till 10.30 at night—I was not away during that time; I went to put my ticket in, and Newton sent a man, and I came back again, I was relieved for three or four minutes—I was to watch to see that no one took the metal, nobody took coals from that bunker but me—the other men used coke—some hundreds of men are employed at the laboratory.</p>

I am a warder in the laboratory at Woolwich Arsenal—on the morning of 19th March, I received some information about the ingots of tin—I gave some directions to Keefe, and afterwards watched with him from about 9.3—the workmen left at 9 o'clock—about 10.30 I saw the prisoner go to the coal bunker, that is the coke bunker, and I saw his hand moving; he then left the bunker and walked away about 14, 15 or 16 yards; he faltered for about half a minute, and then returned to the same spot, took out the ingot of tin, placed it on his arm, and walked away to the same spot from which he had previously returned—I then rushed out of my hiding-place; he made a sort of turn to the right, and placed the ingot on a furnace which stood about in a line with his breast—I asked him what he was doing with it, and with the flurry he said that he had been watching it previous to this—I asked him if he had been watching it, what made him take it out; he said he was not sure what it was, and he took it out to have a look at it—I said "Why did you take it from the light into a dark place to look at it? that won't do for me, you will have to go to the gate and see the inspector on duty; take up the tin and come along"—he said "No, if I have to go to the gate you can carry it yourself"—I said "Well I am not above doing that"—I carried it to the gate, at the same time that he placed the tin on the furnace I heard a slight gingle as if something had dropped with it—I said nothing, but afterwards went back to where I heard the gingle—the superintendent and I got a lamp and saw this small key lying on the furnace, which has an iron frame with a brick top; there is a hole in the wall where the hose comes through; these ingots are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, and they weigh over 30 lbs.—this is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sometimes a good deal more.</p>

I am an Inspector of the Royal Arsenal—the prisoner was on duty there on this night and he came into my office between 10 and 11 o'clock followed by Keefe and by Newton who carried an ingot of tin in his arms and said "Four ingots of tin were found concealed in the coal bunker in the lavatory yard this morning, I received directions to have them watched during the day and when the workmen left at 9 o'clock this evening I concealed myself with Keefe behind a furnace and at 10.30 I heard some person coming, and I could tell by the walk that it was a policeman, he came up and walked into a coke bunker and put up his hand, and I saw his hand moving among the coals, he walked away into the lavatory-yard and halted and came back again, took out this ingot in his arms, and was walking back to the tap, and we rushed out and I said "What have you got there?"—he said "I was not aware what it was, I was taking it to the light to examine it"—he also said "I saw it there last night and was watching it"—I said "If you were watching it why did you take it out?"—he said "I was not quite sure what it was, I saw the metal there last night and I took it out and was taking it to the light to examine it—I said "You did not report having found anything last night which you should have done if you had"—he said "No I did not as I thought I should have been suspected of having put it there"—it was his duty to have reported it the night before—I took the light and Newton picked up this key which fits the padlock which secures the hole in the wall—he had no right to have such a key—there are seven keys; three of the inspectors have them, the superintendent has one, and there is one at each of the three gates in the lobby—the prisoner would have access to the key kept at the gate—the seven keys are safe, this is not one of them, it is a different metal, it has been filed—it is really a skeleton key.</p>

I got a pail of water from under the bed and <hi rend="italic">douted</hi> the blaze. I saw that my child was taken to a neighbour's house, and the mother then locked the door and took the other children with her, and I was in the streets four days and four nights, and on the 5th I went to Croydon, as I had no place to go to. I afterwards went to Deptford again and heard she had gone to the hospital. A cattle drover gave me a job, and we took some cattle to Hazlemere. I then went to Guildford, where a man told me that my child was dead, and that the detectives were looking for me. I walked all night to Deptford, where I was taken in charge. I never had any ill will towards any one, and I always loved my dear children, and would sooner be burnt myself than they should be. I have not got that upon my conscience. I have plenty of grief to know that my poor little creature met with such grief by burning; I am in grief all day long about it. Either of these witnesses who are against me might have had the same accident, because the bed and the lamp were close together. I wish to be punished, but not for throwing the lamp over the child. I did not throw it there, it fell there, but being in drink, I do not want this to be an excuse for me; I loved my children too well to kill them.</p>

               <p>—on 27th March, about 12 o'clock at night, I was on duty at the signal box at Plumstead—I heard the cries of a child on the opposite side of the line—the-station master came out of his house and called me to come across the line, and I went with a lamp—I found a child lying outside the railway fence—it was lying on its stomach crying—I took it to the signal box—about 5 o'clock the nest morning the prisoner came to the station master's house—I went to her and asked her if the child was her's—she said "Yes"—I said "Why did you leave it all night"—she said she had given it to a woman to mind, and the woman had given it to a girl, and the girl had laid it down there, and she pointed to the place she said the girl told her—I said "If the girl told you why did not you come and take it away?"—she said the girl had not told her till the morning, and she had had no peace all night till she came to me for it—I sent her to the station; it was a cold night when I found the child.</p>

I was on duty on 19th February, in the New Cross Road, Deptford, at about 1.50 a.m.—on passing The Royal Albert, I heard a noise as if money were being taken out of the till or put in in, and I waited a short time and met Howard, with the prisoner coming out of the door—I pushed them both back, and Howard said "All right policeman"—I said "Wait and we will see the landlord"—the prisoner commenced kicking me—I laid hold of one in each hand, and all three went over—after struggling up again we went over a table—the prisoner put his hand under my coat to lay hold of my person—he then made his escape, leaving his necktie and hat behind—</p>

               <p>I dragged Howard out of the door, and hallooed "Stop thief!" as I thought one of my mates might be coming down—I took Howard to the station and searched him, and found on him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, and 4¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in farthings—he said the silver money was his, but the copper money was the landlord's—on the occasion in question there was a light in the bar, on, a stand underneath, as if for hot coffee or tea—I don't know which—I turned the light full on their faces—I gave evidence against Howard, at the Police Court—the same as I have given to-day—the prisoner was not before the Court then—while giving evidence I saw Montague in the body of the Court—I knew him directly by his face—he was wearing the same coat as he had on that night—not the same as he is wearing now—I had a good view of him, and I am positive that he is the man—I had not seen him or known him before.</p>

I live at 25, Addington Street, Lambeth—I was formerly in the police, I am now carman to Mr. Merewether—on 20th March, about 6.30 in the evening, I went to the Bell public-house, York Street, Lambeth, I found my brother Joseph there, Wright and two others, we were playing dominoes—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, McKeogh came in and created a disturbance with me, he wanted me to fight—I said I was no fighting-man—he said "I can fight you on my own merits to-day, I shan't fetch Handy Casey—he stood some minutes jangling with me and at last struck me—I got up and we had a bit of scuffle, and he had a little the worst of it, and he was put out of the house by the potman—after that I sat down again—about an hour elapsed when the five prisoners, came in—I knew them before, I had had occasion to speak to three of them on three occasions when I was in the police—Burns looked over the table and said "Can you fight him now"—I said "No, I can't fight four or five," with that he struck me in the face a violent blow, I got up with the intention of defending myself from the next blow, when they all set upon me like wolves; I was pulled across the table by the whiskers and the hair of my head which they pulled out by the roots, and I was struck by all of them—I saw a kick coming across the table, I put up my hand to save it, and the kick almost broke my hand, I could not say who the kick was by—I did not see any act done by any particular prisoner, I was knocked insensible almost immediately, I don't remember anything more than being out in the back-yard with Mr. Crook and his attendants—I was taken to the hospital and attended by Dr. Lucas—I had not given either of the prisoner the least provocation.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 66, Camberwell Road—I was called in to examine Myra Reynolds, at the house, on the evening in question, about 8 o'clock—the police were there—she was lying on the floor drunk, wretchedly dirty and badly clad, with a cut mouth, blackened nose and eyes, that appeared to have been done with something blunt, as a fist, she had a cut on her left cheek, four cuts on the right side of her head, one on the cheek-was a deep cut about half an inch long, it went right through the flesh, it was such a cut as might have been inflicted by the; edge of this shovel, as were also those on the side of the head—the longest did not exceed an inch, the others varied from half an inch; one seemed to have exposed the bone, it had cut through the skin covering the bone, it did not go to the bone—there was no evidence of contusion about the head—I don't think that could have been done with the shovel; I saw the shovel, it had hair and blood on it—you can see the blood now—the woman was insensible, partly from drink—the blows must have been very violent, the weapon is light—there was danger from erysipelas or future injury to the bone, she is not well yet, but I think she will recover all right—she appeared to have been drinking very considerably.</p>
