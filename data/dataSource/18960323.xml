On the morning of February 21st, about twenty minutes to four, I was on duty in Harrow Road, and saw the two prisoners in a passage way by the side of the Church Extension Associ<lb/>ation, leading to the back of the Metropolitan Music Hall—as soon as they saw me they turned round directly to a van that was standing in the passage, and eased themselves against the wheel—they then pro<lb/>ceeded in the direction of, the Edgware Board—I went round my beat and met the prisoners again; I turned round and followed them into Church Street—I met Constable Brown, and we followed them into the passage where I had first seen them—they passed by the church door and went into chapel Street, through burn Street and Bell Street; they remained at the corner for some time—Musso crossed the road into a passage leading to toe same passage as before—I went down the passage and met him; I asked what he was doing there</p>

               <p>—Brown detained him—I saw Parissi standing in a doorway of the Green Man public-house; he left it very hurriedly; I followed and took him into custody at the Corner of Chapel Street—I told him that I had been watching his movements, and he would have to come with me, and I took him back to where the other prisoner was, in the passage—he denied all knowledge of the other prisoner—he spoke in English—I searched Parissi at the station; I found on him a pocket-knife, a pocket-book, and some papers—on the way to the station he destroyed a post-card; I picked up the pieces and put them together, but could not make anything of them.</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the Y Police—at 7.15 a.m. on February 15th I was called to the station and examined Winkworth—I found an incised wound, about one and a quarter inches long, above his left eyebrow, going down to the bone; a lacerated and contused wound under the lower eyelid, completely lacerating it, and severe bruising of the left side of the nose and face, including the lip—he was very much collapsed; he had lost a good deal of blood; his clothes and face were saturated with blood—I examined the prisoner; I found no wound on Him—I was called again at two p.m., and I then found a wound on the inner aspect of his left thumb—if a knife like this had been closed suddenly on the thumb it would cause just such a wound as he had—Winkworth has recovered; he had dangerous wounds; they corresponded with this iron carriage-washer—the wound on the cheek could have been caused by teeth; it looked like a bite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is quite possible the wounds were caused by this washer—I do not think they would both have been caused by falling on any sharp surface, as the bone of the forehead projects, and protects that part of the eye—I do not think the blow of a fist could cause either of them, because they are of considerable depth and length—the thumb was cut by a sharp instrument—there was a good deal of blood about the prisoner; it was not so thick that I could not have seen a wound through it; it evidently came from the prosecutor—I did not see a cut behind his ear.</p>

I live at 30, Campbell Road, and am a labourer in the employment of Kirk and Randall—at 6.30 a.m., on February 15th, I went to the School Board works, and was waiting outside for the whistle to blow, when I heard the prisoner say he was going to give someone a cut in. the mouth—he went down the Woodstock Road, and came up the Ennis Road, going in the direction of where Winkworth lives—after I got into the works I heard Winkworth call out, "Murder! murder! help! help! help!"—I rushed to the gates and saw Winkworth lying on the pavement, bleeding—he said something to me, and pointed, and said, "Bill"—I went and tapped the prisoner on the shoulder, and said I wanted him to stop till the policeman came—he slung round, and slung me in the jaw with his right hand; I could not see if he had anything in his hand; it was between lights—my face started bleeding directly—this is the scar—my foreman, Humphreys, called out, "Bill, Bill, be careful; he has got a knife in his hand"—I caught hold of the prisoner to stop him, and we struggled and fell to the ground, I on the top—when on the ground he struck me three times in the left side and once on the back of the head, and he bit my cheek, which has since kept gathering—I said, "I will make you drink my blood if you don't give over biting"—the blood was flowing out right over his face—the blows in my side cut right through my clothes and into my flesh; one was one and a-quarter inches deep; I showed them to the doctor—the blow at the back of the head broke the skin; the doctor dressed it; it was done with a knife, or some<lb/>thing</p>

I am master of the Union Workhouse in Poland Street, Oxford Street—the prisoner was admitted to the Workhouse on January 23rd last—she was in labour at the time; she was delivered of a female child about twenty-five minutes after—she took her discharge voluntarily on the 18th February about five or ten minutes to twelve at noon—she had her breakfast about half-past seven or eight, and before she left she had some milk and bread and butter—I did not tell her she must not come back; she could have come back if she liked—the child was provided with clothing by the house—some cotton-wool was wrapped round its body, and milk in a bottle was given for it.</p>

I am the wife of a tailor, of 67, Cleveland Street—the prisoner worked for me about twelve months ago and left—on Tuesday afternoon between six or seven she came to me—she appeared to be in a very bad state of health and excited—I asked her what was the matter with her—she said, "I ain't got work; I ain't got nothing to do"—she started crying—I gave her two cups of tea, and a slice of bread and butter; I again asked what was the matter—she said, "I will tell you"—my hus<lb/>band then came in to have something to eat—when he had gone I took a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known her about twelve months, and before that by seeing her in the street, but not to speak to—she was my servant for two months—she left me to go to some work, but she was not strong enough to do it—she was very weak—she was a very good girl to me and a very good servant; the reason she left me was because she wanted to be a tailor—I had never seen her so bad as she was on February 18th; she was very bad then; so bad that I would not ask her any questions; I thought something was wrong with her, she was bitterly crying, with her handkerchief to her eyes—she is a Russian, but I don't know from what part—I suppose her parents are in Russia; she talks English a little, not perfectly—she appeared very much upset.</p>

At half-past seven on the night of February 18th I was on duty in Fitzroy Square—a communication was made to me and I went to 82, Cleveland Street—I examined the basement, and in passing the w.c. in the passage I saw the prisoner behind the door—I asked what she was doing there—she said, "Oh, policeman, I have mur<lb/>dered my child"—I asked her where it was—pointing to a parcel at her feet, she said, "There it is," bursting out crying—I told her I should take her to Tottenham Court Road Police-station—I picked up the parcel, and took it and the prisoner to the station—on the way she said, "My cousin promised to marry me, and that is why I done this; he is the father of my child"—at the station she was charged with wilful murder—she made a statement, which was Written down by the Inspector.</p>

               <p>and dead—it was rolled up in a nightdress and napkin, a piece of flannel and a shawl, all of which were marked "Westminster Union"—the whole was tied in a piece of black Italian cloth—the head was covered over—in the child's mouth I found this piece of wadding rammed in very tightly about the size of a small orange—the mouth was forced wide open, and was full of the wadding, so full that the cheeks were forced right back—the body was not quite cold, very nearly—Inspector Shannon came in, and took the prisoner's statement; I went for the doctor.</p>

About a quarter to nine on the evening of February 18th I saw the prisoner in the station, also the dead body of a female child—I cautioned the prisoner in the usual way, that what she said would be taken down, and might be used in evidence against her—I said, "You will be charged with murdering your child," and, being a foreigner, I asked whether she quite understood; she said yes, she quite understood—she then made a statement, which I took down as follows: "I did not have any place to go to, and they told me in the workhouse that I must not come in again, and that was why I murdered my child. I had not a farthing to bless myself with. The child was crying for milk; I could not give her the breast, and I had no money to buy any<lb/>thing. At about four or five this evening I laid the child on a form in Regent's Park, and was going to kill myself. I could not kill the child in the Park; there were too many people about. I then came to 82, Cleve<lb/>land Street; the door was open; I went downstairs into the kitchen, there was no one there; I then put a piece of wadding in the child's throat, and it choked her. I then went to Mrs. Shoolman's, crying, and said to her, 'I have done murder'—she signed this by making her mark.</p>

I am a B.M., and assistant to Dr. Lloyd, surgeon to the D Division of Police—I was called to the Totten<lb/>ham Court Road Police-station, about nine, on February 18th; I was there shown the dead body Of a female child; it appeared to be about three weeks old; it was dead and cold; it appeared to have been dead some hours—it was wrapped in some clothing, lying in the clothing described, the sides covered over the body—in the mouth I found this lump of cotton wool; it was rammed tightly inside, distending the cheeks; the mouth was quite full; the mouth was open, all the wool was inside—I think that would obstruct the breathing—it was rammed in so as to push back the tongue into the cheek, that would eventually stop the breathing—I made a post-mortem examination on February 20th—asphyxia was the cause of death—there was slight discolouration of each nostril, as if produced by the finger nail—the stomach was almost full of milk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A very slight pressure leaves a mark—in my opinion, the marks were caused before death; they might have been caused immediately after death, within a minute of two, while the body was yet warm, before circulation had ceased—I have had experience of women</p>

I am a printer, and live at 22, Milner Square, Islington—the prisoner is my brother—on the evening of February 2nd, about ten, I was sitting at the table playing cards with two ladies and two gentlemen, when the prisoner came into the room—my friends turned round and welcomed him, and asked him to join the game—I said nothing—he said, "Aha, aha! a hearty welcome"—we turned to resume our game, and he said, "A little drama, ah!" and at the same moment I felt a shot in my side—I heard a report, and saw just the reflection of a flash—I jumped up at once, staggered, and fell, and was taken to the hospital, but before that, as I was falling, my brother said, "You have blighted my life and ruined my prospects"—I forgot that in my first examination—I had parted with him on very friendly terms on the Friday night; this was on Sunday—when he fired at me, I should say he was about half a yard from me; I could not tell, because I could not see him at the time; he was at my back—I had seen him on the Saturday morning for a few moments, and he scowled at me, that was all, and passed about a couple of words about business.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 100, Elgin Crescent—on Saturday, March 7th, I went to bed about 11.30 or 11.45 p.m.—I went round the last thing and saw the doors were fastened—my daughter and the servants had gone to bed—the front door was left unbolted for Mr. Gal<lb/>vonoff, and could be opened with a latch key—when Mr. Galvonoff came in he made a communication, in consequence of which I went downstairs—I found the prisoner in custody—I examined the premises—two panes of the glass of the door leading from the back-room into the garden were broken, and the shutter was lying on the floor—we found traces of an attempt to enter by the door, and by the end window—the kitchen is in the front—my house is easy of access, because the house goes round by the street—the panes of glass wore about 14 in. by 14 in.—I found the books and papers from the sideboard were on the floor, the curtains were pulled out, a large cupboard which had not been locked, but was very tight, had been forced open, and pieces of wood splintered off, and the place was disturbed—the bamboo rod which fastened a small muslin curtain was found in the garden.</p>

I am a vocalist, of 12, Charlotte Street—on the afternoon of March 6th I met the prisoner—I had not known him previously—there was a quarrel between us—about one o'clock the next morning I saw him standing at the door of the club, and he struck me with this stick on the shoulder—I lifted my arm to take the stick away, and Noot came and took it from him, and said, "You vaga<lb/>bond, you struck him with the stick"—at that moment I felt a stab in my side; I did not know it was a stab—he turned another way—I followed him a few yards; then I cried, "I am stabbed"; my friend said, "What nonsense! it is a joke; I don't believe it"; but I put my hand under my waistcoat, and found a handful of blood—I am positive the prisoner gave me the stab—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

               <p>on December 14th—I had a child on June, 1894—she was registered Laura, but was generally known as Emily—in February, 1895, I answered an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Dispatch</hi>—I received a letter of February 1st, and afterwards met the defendant at Liverpool Street Station on February 19th by appointment—I handed my child over to her, with 15s. on account of £7, which we agreed should be the premium—the child was to become hers—the advertisement was to adopt a child seven months old for love only—I received a number of letters—the child was illegitimate—I was in service—the man who promised to marry me was committed for bigamy—this is the answer to my letter in answer to the advertisement. (<hi rend="italic">That the writer would be pleased to take the child for £7, and give it every home comfort and care, the husband being a mechanic, employed by the Great Eastern Railway Company, and could give references, the address being Myrtle Cottage, Norman Street, Leytonstone</hi>). I received this letter of February 5th. (<hi rend="italic">That the money question should not stand between them.</hi>) I agreed to pay by instalments—she took the baby and 15s. at Liverpool Street Station—she only told me she had a girl of eleven years, and I understood she had no other children, and that my child would be a companion—she did not say she was in the family-way—my child was then strong, healthy, clean, very fat, in good condition, and plump for her age—she is now in the Lambeth Infirmary—I went to see her at Myrtle Cottage in March, having written that I was coming—I saw my child and three others of about the same age, also twins, which the defendant said were six weeks old, besides the other baby—she said they were all hers—I told her I was surprised to see other children there—she said she had not told me about the twins because she thought that would be a sur<lb/>prise for me when I went, and it would be nice to bring the boy and girl up as brother and sister—I paid her £3 10s. altogether—I next saw the defendant in October, 1895, when she came to see me—I was then again pregnant, and told her so—she offered to take the child, go home, and pretend to be confined with it, and her husband would know nothing about it; she would come to the workhouse and fetch it away—I went on December 14th with Inspector Bruning to fetch the child away—I told her I had come to take the child away, because she was not a fit person to take charge of it—the child was fearfully thin, and appeared starved—its body was clean, but its head was full of vermin—when I took up the child I said, "She is not half so heavy as she was when I had her"—she was eighteen months old, and when I had her seven months—she said it was likely she was thin, she had been cutting her double teeth—the inspector bought the child milk and cake, I gave it to her, and she ate it ravenously—at the infirmary the child's hair was cut off, and she was washed—she was sent to the nursery and examined by medical men.</p>

               <p>not remember her using the words, "The child is falling away"—she in<lb/>formed me it was getting thin—when I went first the child seemed" well, and called the defendant "Mamma," and her husband "Dadda, and seemed to prefer them to me, because I was not with her—I asked her to send me a photograph of the child, but was told to wait till she was a little fatter—she was anxious for me to see it—she sympathised with me when I was pregnant again, and came to see me in October, and offered to assist me.</p>

Coming through the gardens, I came through this passage on my way to the Police-station, and met this man, Gillett, in the passage. He said, 'I am not going home. I am going to do this here place.' Just as we were talking Mr. Howe passed by. Gillett said, 'That is the foreman of the shop. 'Just after that Gillett poked the window in with a piece of iron, and I pulled him out as he was trying to get in at the window, and took the poker from him, and put it down my trousers, persuading him to come away. Just then the police came and apprehended us. That is the way I got the poker. I never saw Gillett before that night."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th, on the London and South-Western Bank, for</hi> £20, <hi rend="italic">signed "A.

(<hi rend="italic">Letters marked P. Q. R. S. T. U. were here put in.</hi>) These letters are in Clarkson's writing—I also found an account headed "R. C.
