                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Todd, at No. 78, St. Paul's Churchyard. The prisoner has been twelve years in our employ, as porter—I had some suspicion about him, and on Wednesday morning, 13th July, I asked him if Mr. Madgwick's cook had paid him certain bills, and told him that the cook had been to pay the last weekly bill, and said she had paid the others; he said he had not received them—I pressed him more closely, and he said, I have received it, and not accounted for it"—(<hi rend="italic">the books were here sent for</hi>).</p>

Q.</hi> How many customers have you in the course of the day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps fifty—it was the prisoner's duty to account for money received, the moment he came into the shop—he has never, to my knowledge, paid me money which he has had more than a day—I never knew him to keep money till I was disengaged—he may have come in and waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till I was disengaged, after which he would give me the money—I should not have objected to his accounting to me next morning if he got home late; it might happen, but I do not recollect it—we always deemed him a good servant—on 13th July I asked him to produce his book; he said he had lost it—when he accounted to me, he used to hold the book in his hand and read from it—I have frequently asked him for it, but he has never produced it since—to the best of my memory, I used to see it every day.</p>

I received orders to look to Mr. Capp's warehouse—on Saturday evening, 2nd July, I heard something—I went to the premises, and saw two men in the lower shop which is below the ground—the first steps lead from there to the ground floor, and then there are steps-leading to the first floor—I saw the persons in the lower floor—I do not re-cognise them—I went for the key—when I came back the policeman was there—I tried to unlock the door, but was not able to do so—I got in by forcing the bottom of the door—the police<lb/>man went in with me—I had one dog who followed me in—I cannot say whether I saw any other dog there—I went upstairs with the policeman—I saw one person getting out of the window; I do not know who it was—one had got out—after the prisoners were taken and locked up, the inspector and I looked over the premises—we saw the pipe had been broken off, but could not find the piece—on the Monday morning I went there with Mr. Richards, and we stopped up the water pipe, because the water was running away—he pointed out this pipe, and I picked it up—it was a little way from under the stain—I had fastened up the premises on the Saturday, at dinner time; and after the prisoners were gone I just put the door up as well as I could—I had not seen this piece of lead on the Saturday night—we might have overlooked it in the dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Mr. Thomas Capps, of No. 21, Leadenhall-street. On Saturday, 2nd July, I went into his premises in Moor-lane, between 10 and 2 o'clock; I stayed there about three quarters of an hour—I asked Mr. Ewar to nail the doors, and he said he placed a piece of wood inside, and nailed them up—I was outside, and he was inside—I heard some one nailing the doors—that fastened them—he went out at a private door in connection with his own house—on the Monday following, I went there as usual to collect the rents, between 10 and 12 o'clock—I heard some water running in the lower part of the premises—I told Mr. Ewar—I then went into the premises, and found that the pipe had been broken—I found this piece of pipe just by the staircase, from two to three yards from the place where it had been broken off—it corresponded with the place where it had been cut—it was in a position where it might have been dropped by a person going up stairs—there were gas fittings and pipe there which had not been disturbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> And there were bricks and rubbish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice any; there was some dirt—the premises had been broken open, but the doors and windows were closed—no one was on the premises—there was no breaking on these doors, but on a door going to Mr. Ewar's premises there was the appearance as if a person had forced a way from the warehouse to Mr. Ewar's—that was not the door which had been broken—the socket that held the bolt had been forced away—the running water first took my attention.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Isaac Marks, of 140, High Holborn. Early in the morning of 21st July I was awoke out of my sleep by a noise—I got up, and left my room—a man was coming in at the staircase window—he was in the act of descending from the window sill—I asked him what he wanted there—he said he was shut out—I alarmed my sons and the persons on the third floor—I then went down, and found the prisoner in custody—the window was not fastened inside—it is nearly six feet from the stairs, but outside it is very easy to get in—I am able to swear to the prisoner being the person—I did not see his face, I could swear to his voice.</p>

'Gooderich says: 'I loaded with meat on Monday morning, and I was waiting for two hampers, which John Farmer and George Whittle were looking for; Red-grave then <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his van away; he then asked for the other van, of the name of Underwood; I called Underwood down to him, and told him that Joseph Red-grave wanted him; he came to Redgrave, and Redgrave brought down a firkin of butter, and also Underwood; Redgrave then went away to his van, then Underwood came to me and asked me to get three cheeses; I did so; then George Whittle and John Farmer brought the hamper of meat to me, and told me that was all; I then went on to Hyde-park Corner, where I stopped to get a cup of coffee at a stall where Redgrave was; he told me that he had looked all round and could not see anything else; I then went on to Newgate-market, and went to Leadenhall-market; on returning, when I got into the Old Bailey, I was then asked if I had not got two firkins of butter and three cheeses by a man close by the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand, which he had instructions about, to watch the meat vans from market; I said "Yes," but I did not know they were for him; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he then said he wanted me to take them to the Feathers public house, in Broken-wharf; I told him I was going for some ice and some salmon for the governor, and I would take them where I went to get them; I shifted the things into a cart, and Redgrave and Underwood helped me; I then said to Redgrave, "You may as well come down with me;" Underwood said, "I will go if you like; if you will go and unload my cheeses, I will go with them;" and Redgrave did go, and helped to carry the things in, when I met the officer.'"</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at Bacon's Hotel, Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. I was with Whatley, ray brother-in-law; the prisoners spoke to us on Holborn-hill, and we went into a public-house about a quarter to 12 o'clock—I went out, leaving Whatley and the prisoners in the house—as I stood in the middle of the street I saw Burke rush out at the side door—she went over to the corner of a court not far off, and was in the act of stooping, and putting something into her pocket—I missed her, and then saw Whatley coming out of the public-house, detaining Hill.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Burke handed a paper to the Court, stating that the prosecutor and Nicholls were so drunk that they offered the prisoners a penny each to help them up Holborn-hill, and that Nicholls stated before the Magistrate that it was Hill who ran out of the public-house.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of cattle and horses at Smithfield market. I was in the market on 1st July, and saw the prisoner with a horse, which attracted my attention, by the enlarged state of the glands; I examined it more carefully out of the market, and found that it was in a state of glanders—the membrane was lacerated, and the gland under the jaw was enlarged—that is a disease which is contagious to animals and to the human species, by proximity—it was plainly to be seen by anybody that knew anything about horses—it is very dangerous to have an animal going about in that state.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Translation of Letter marked A.</hi>—My Prince,—I permit myself once again to write to you these few lines. I had the honor to receive at my house a gentleman whom I had not the honor to know any more in Paris than in London; but from his conversation he proved to me that he was sent by you to know my intention to be useful to you. I have not told it to any one. I would only confide myself to you alone; but as it is so, I confess to you that which I beg of you not to make known to any one whatever, as you are often surrounded by persons who for money deceive you, but to you alone I confide myself, and without interest for me. My Prince,—Napoleon the Little, whom they call thus at Strasbourg, has given me the idea of an assassin, which he was My instruction was not to search deeply into politics, as I know them now; but at Boulogne, when I read his mode of acting, that man forced me to shut up in my heart an eternal hate. You, who exposed your days to go and fetch the ashes of his Uncle for the service of France, and whose property to-day he has dared to sell, which no king has done. He has acted as an assassin and a thief at the same time. You know it, my Prince, better than I, as you are the first victim. You are deprived of seeing your country, you and your dear family; you, who had exposed your life several times, you are more unfortunate than a workman who wanders from country to country. I do not seek to flatter you; believe it well; for if you knew me you would see it. You will believe, perhaps, that I do this out of interest. No; for I have been unfortunate in London, and I have never asked anything of anybody, but ten shillings which the French Society had the goodness to give me, from the moment that my wife had remained three months in bed; and I, I had no work; and it is Mr. Munier who forced me to make the request, which he supported. In fine, I cut it short. I am going to depart for Paris; my voyage is for you alone; I swear it upon the tomb of my mother and of my father. Life is to me a charge and a burden, to be no longer borne; I must utilize it, and you shall see it. My Prince, I have my wife, who is seventeen years old; I would place her under your protection. I have sought out a motive to her for the voyage: she consents to it; but the poor child, she will be the only victim of my project. But I sleep no more: <hi rend="italic">I alone I must change this base wretch; he and all who surround him must he blown up. It is a thing which oppresses me much to be an assassin; but it must be, though I should be forced to sell my last shirt.</hi> I write to you while my poor wife has gone out. I hasten to finish. Could you but read in my heart the sentiments that I have for you and your dear</p>

               <p>family. Adieu, my Prince; and all that I desire is that you should be soon on a throne, to render the people more happy than they are, and all France.

I have collected the little money that is due to me, but it is not sufficient for the idea I have, and which is infallible as to me alone; I charge myself to blow up the tyrant and his accomplices and all the persons around him. I am as sure of it as of the day I must die. My Lord, do not believe that I am seeking to deceive you, as I have no want of that, but I will give you the best guarantees for the advances you may make me. I leave my furniture, I leave my wife who has property of 12,000 francs, without that which comes back to her, and a good business which I have, I employ several workmen; in short, my Lord, it is money I want, not a large sum, I want 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I give right to whomever may see me in France, in another country, to stab me where he may find me, if I have not done that which I must do, to change the government of France; I swear it by all that I have dearest to me on earth; in short Monsieur, that which I do is for your family and your worthy mother, as she is so good to her countrymen; it is for you, you alone, you are capable of rendering the workman happy, and to make return your family.

I spent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but what of that I rely upon you, I beg of you to send me your reply by your Secretary, if you consider desirable. I have arranged my affairs ready to depart. I send you my passport to letyousee that I am not proscribed nor a thief, and that I was established at Paris before the cursed Republic, which caused my misery and yours. In short, my Prince, I rely on your goodness, and you may rely on me as upon yourself. I beg of you to give me a reply, the soonest that may be possible to you, as I only wait for that to depart and to prove to you that I am not a man who bends with fear. I rely again on your discretion as I shall be sure to fall if it is known. My Lord, you will see if the Raynauds are cowards, and if they know how to keep a secret. I beg of you to believe me, your all devoted servant. <hi rend="smallCaps">RAYNAUD</hi>. Sherrard-place, No. 4, Golden-square. ")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Somerset-street, Aldgate. On Monday morning I went to a house in Whitechapel to sleep; it was not my own house—it was too late to go home, it was 1 o'clock—two young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, William Waite and Patrick Reagan, were with me—I went up stairs, opened the bedroom door, and went to the window—I did not know that the prisoner was there, I had no candle; there was light from the window, it was a moonlight night—when I went to the window I was stabbed by the prisoner in the left breast—I could see him by the light of the window, just as he stabbed me—he is a tailor by trade—I had had a quarrel with him about twelve months ago—I had had no quarrel with him since then, except on this Sunday evening; we went to a public house, and met him there—he was going to speak to me, and I offered him the beer, and told him to drink, and then to speak—my wound bled all the way to the hospital—it was done wit! a pair of scissors; I did not know that until they were found in the bed—I did not see what I was struck with—Reagan helped me to the hospital—my wound was dressed there—immediately after the prisoner stabbed me, I heard his say that he would stick the first that came in his way—I could not rightly tell whether he was drunk or sober, I think he was sober—I had met him tat evening at a public house in Petticoat-lane; Waite, Reagan, and I were there drinking together; it was there I offered him the beer—we went from that house to the Grapes, at the corner of Catherine-wheel Alley—my partner called for some beer there—I gave the beer to another man, and Maden came up as he was going to drink it, and said he had paid for it—I denied that he had paid for it, and with that there was some words, and he and a young man that was with me struck one another—they were separated—I then went towards my lodging, and found it was too late, and Waite asked me to go home and sleep with him—I did not know where the prisoner went to.</p>

I was with O'Connell on this Sunday night from 11 to 12 o'clock—the pri<lb/>soner went with us into the public house—we had some drink there—we were all sober; we had some words, there were no blows—the prisoner swore he would be satisfied to be hung in the morning for me and O'Connell, he would have our lives—we then parted, and he went home—I lodge in the same room with him—we went with O'Connell to his lodging; he could not get in, and I brought him home to sleep with me—he went up stairs first—I was afraid to go up, I stood outside the street door—I did not go into the bedroom at all until after the prisoner was taken—while I was standing at the door, I heard O'Connell call out that he was stabbed, and he said, "Open the door, I want to go to the hospital"—he came out, and I put my cap to the wound to stop the bleeding—after the prisoner was taken, I went into the room and found these scissors in the bed, just underneath where be had been lying; there was blood upon them—I gave them to the policeman—I had seen the prisoner trying to hide them before be got up and dressed—Waite saw me take them from the bed—the prisoner was then down stairs with the police<lb/>man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, and live at Holloway. On Saturday evening, 13th August, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was outside my shop, and saw the prisoner pass—he stopped at the Pied Bull public house, which is two doors from my house—I saw the deceased Moss pass intoxicated—I saw him and the prisoner together—I did not hear anything pass between them; he came up to the prisoner, and a fight ensued; that was the first thing I saw—Moss fell, he got up again, and they had a second and third round; at the end of the third round the prisoner knocked Moss down; at least it was more a scuffle than anything else, a wrestling—Moss fell against the door-post of the Pied Bull, and fell senseless—I did not see what part of him struck the door-post; I heard the sound of something striking against the post, and I saw his head lying against the door-post—he was carried away by two men—I knew him by seeing him backwards and forwards—I knew by his walk that he was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday morning, 13th Aug., I was called to see the deceased, at No. 16, Brandt-street; he was lying insensible and motionless on the floor; he died in about three quarters of an hour—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a very extensive fracture at the back part of the skull, producing extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, that was the immediate cause of death—I do not think a violent blow with a fist would cause that; falling violently against a post would be likely to produce it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. James Humphreys and three others; they are carpet manufacturers.

Please send by bearer one piece of blue fawn, and one ditto claret. <hi rend="smallCaps">USHER."</hi>—Messrs. Humphreys has a customer named Usher—I told the prisoner we had not carpets of that description—he said he would take the nearest we had, as Mr. Usher had an order for nearly a whole piece—I had known Johnston before, he was in the service of Mr. Usher—when he said he would take the nearest we had, I looked them out and entered them in the show book, and gave him a show paper stating the particulars of them; it was a description of the goods he had—I gave him the goods; he took one piece from the warehouse to the truck, I took the other, and he went away with both—when he had them there was a ticket or mark on each of them, but the tickets are now off them—I saw the carpets again next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Silver-street, Enfield, and am a carpenter and joiner. On Saturday, 9th August, I left my tools, at half-past four o'clock, in a building where I was at work—in Northumberland-park, at a new-built house—on the Monday following, at 6 o'clock in the morning. I went there, and missed one axe, three saws, five planes, a 6-inch trying square, two gouges, two hammers, and various other things—I afterwards saw the axe at the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, on a scaffold where several men were at work—the prisoners were at work, one of them had the axe in his hand—I gave them into custody—Smith had been at work on the week previous at the next house to where I had been in Northumberland-park—he had got discharged—this is the axe—I know it positively to be mine—I drove this wedge of deal into it—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the value of the other tools I lost was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen the other tools—there were some boards taken from one room in the building and brought into the hall in that new-built house in which I was at work—they appeared to have been removed there to make a scaffold to get up to these tools—they could get these things by means of a ladder on the scaffold—I saw the tools all right about half-past 4 o'clock.</p>

In consequence of information from Mr. Fitch, I was watching the prisoner's premises—I went there at 5 o'clock in the morning on 16th June, and a little before 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner open the door, and look out up and down the hill—he went to the corner of Old Fish-street; he looked about there and came back—Mr. Fitch lives at No. 3, Old Fish-street-hill—the prisoner went inside his own door, and shortly after I saw Ingram, who was tried here last Session, bring a basket full of something with some shavings on the top; it was apparently very heavy—he rang the bell—the prisoner opened the door, and Ingram went inside the passage, and Ball lifted the basket from Ingram's shoulder; Ball and Ingram came to the door, and Ingram went away without anything—in the course of ten minutes Rolfe came, who was tried with Ingram last Session, Rolfe had nothing with him—he went into Ball's house with Ball—Rolfe then came out without anything, and went away—I waited there till half past 11 o'clock, during that time the prisoner came out three times—he came and looked about him, and went away for it might be an hour—he came back again, and then went out again—I saw him come in three times—the last time he went in he was followed by George Davis, who came out within five minutes afterwards with a parcel on his shoulder—it was in a wrapper, and corded—I followed Davis, he went up Old Change; there</p>

               <p>Knight joined me—we went from there to the Red Lion, in the City-road; Davis went in at the public entrance leading to the bar—I went in at the private entrance at the side—I saw Davis speaking to two persons who were there; one named Fitch, and the other Griffin—Griffin went in the back yard, followed by Davis, without the parcel—that was left in the house—they came back again and took the parcel, and came out and went to Mr. Birkett's, a stationer's shop in Norton Folgate—Davis there put down the parcel, and Griffin took the cord and wrapper off, and handed them to Davis—they were then about to leave the shop, when I and Knight took them into custody, and the parcel—it contained these three reams of paper which I have here—I then went to Ball's house, I looked round it—I found there some books which I have here—some envelopes, and a few sheets of paper—I looked after Ball, but I did not find him in June—I continued to look after him—I found him at last on 20th July, close to Kennington-gate, coming from Brixton—I told him I had a warrant against him for receiving property belonging to Mr. Fitch, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road. I purchased a strawberry coloured mare in July, in the presence of the pri<lb/>soner, who was in company with Kesterman—I believe Kesterman could not speak English; I heard him speaking French to the prisoner, and perhaps half a dozen other Frenchmen; they all seemed together—there were several Englishmen looking on—I purchased the mare for eighteen guineas, with a reservation that I was to give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission—I purchased a bay mare afterwards, on Tuesday, 13th, at the prisoner's recommendation; he said he was requested by Berquer and Kesterman to sell me that and a chestnut horse, that they were on the Continent purchasing horses, and if I would take the bay mare at the price he offered I might—I purchased her, paid him the money in gold and silver, and took a receipt, which was in the solicitor's hands, at Guildhall, twelve months ago; but I paid him for the chestnut horse in three small checks—in July I was at Rymer and Sower's, late Dixon's—the prisoner was there, in company with Berquer—he showed me three or four horses—I cannot speak French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On 3rd July, did you purchase a horse or a gray mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I offered him the cash, fifteen sovereigns—he said he would not take it, because if he did Rymer and Sower would not take it, and I had better pay the money in the office, which I did—I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the chestnut horse.</p>

The prisoner held an appointment in the Police, as inspector of common lodging houses in the K division—it was his duty to inspect daily, or nightly, the common lodging-houses in that district—his travelling expenses were allowed him, and certain other expenses when away from home—he sent in his account weekly to me, and if it was correct, it was my duty to sign it previous to the money being received—in his expenses for June I discovered an overcharge, and sent for him specially, having known him some time, and knowing that he had a wife and family—I told him I must caution him that it must not be repeated again, or I should be obliged to lay it before the Commissioners—on Monday, 18th July, I found an overcharge in his account, and on the 20th, when he came, I sent for him, and told him I should be obliged to lay the complaint before Captain Hay, and I did so that day, and afterwards told the prisoner that he would stand suspended from that day till the next day, when he would have to appear before Captain Hay—I was particularly careful to speak mildly to the pri<lb/>soner; I said, If you please, you will have to attend"—this took place in the Old Palace Court, Scotland-yard—the lodging house place is three houses further on—I went to the lodging-house office, and about eight or ten minutes afterwards, as I was standing with my back partly towards the door and my face to the window, paying some expenses, received two blows, from whom I cannot say, but I had beard the door open before that, saw the prisoner come in, and then resumed my position, with my back towards him, and about a minute afterwards I received the blows; the first was on my shoulder, and the second on my temple; I put up my hand and missed my eye—I said, "My eye is gone," and I ran out of the room, and was taken to the hospital—I am still under medical attendance.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the morning I was called up to see Monaghan, and found two large wounds on the fore part of his head bleeding copiously—one of them was four inches long partly incised and partly contused; it indented into the bone—the other wound was similar, but not quite so long—they were the result of violent blows—I only saw him that night—I did not continue to attend him.</p>

On Saturday night, 25th June, about half-past 10 o'clock, I was in Dudley-grove, at the corner of Dudley-street, Harrow-road, with my wife—there is a pickled-eel stall there—I had some eels—the prisoner was standing at the stall—he dropped a basin accidentally, and when it was down he put his foot upon it, and broke it on purpose—it was a basin that he had been eating the eels out of—he then asked for some more eels—the man wanted the basin—the prisoner said he had not got it—there were three others in company with</p>

               <p>the prisoner, and they all said they had not seen it—I told the man that kept the stall that the prisoner had dropped the basin accidentally, and broken it for the purpose—I saw him with his foot upon it, and I said to the prisoner it was a pity he should rob the man out of a paltry penny basin—he asked me what business it was of mine, and called me a b——snot—he then picked up a basin off the stall, walked round the stall, and threw it at me; it struck me in the eye—I was about four or five yards from him at the time—directly he had <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> the basin at me, he rushed in at me, and pulled me down; and while I was down, he got his thumb in the corner of my eye, trying to gouge my eye out—I pushed him off as well as I could, and got up—he ran in at me again, got me down, and tried the same thing over again—he had his finger in my eye, and my eye was nearly out; and after I stood up, he <hi rend="italic">clawed</hi> at my eye twice with his open hand—I cried out, and somebody came and pulled him off me—the basin he threw at me was shattered into many pieces; it cut me all round my eye; a piece of the bason was taken out of my eye—I shall never see so well as I did before—I had not said or done any<lb/>thing to provoke him—I had never seen him before—I was quite sober—my wife and I had been to market, I had but one pint of beer the whole evening—the prisoner was taken into custody by an officer, and he was very glad to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Sargent, of No. 11, Edward-street, Limehouse-fields. I have known the prisoner for some time—on Saturday night, 9th July, I met him in Carr-street, accidentally—he spoke to me, and asked if I would go and have some beer; and we went and had a pint at the White Horse—we then went and had a pint of ale at another beer shop, I do not know the name of it—I did not go into the houses, we had it at the door—we had it between us—after having the ale, we still con<lb/>tinued in company—he took me by the hand and led me across the road, and led me up a place where there are some new buildings, I do not know the name of it—it was just across the road from the last beer shop we were at—he then began to pull me about indecently, and to talk to me—he asked me whether he could have connexion with me at such time as he thought proper—I said, No, I would not; I would tell my husband—he said he did not care a d——about my husband, and that my husband went along with other women, and why could not I do the same?—he then took me by my hand across the road to the corner of a field, pulled me about indecently, and wished to know whether I would let him be with me, and such like—there is no thoroughfare through the field—the prisoner said there was—I refused to go—he said there was a thoroughfare for other people, and so there was for us—we then got into the field—he made me go; he had hold of my wrist, and pulled me, and I had a very bruised wrist—we went a very little distance into the field—he then pulled me down, took hold of my throat, and held me while he took out</p>

I am the landlady of the house where the prisoner and deceased lodged for four years—they occupied the first floor—I know of her having been ill for some time past; we perceived it more after the death of her third child; it was not from grief at the loss of the child—the prisoner never used to come home till after 12, 1, 2, or 3 o'clock in the morning, and sometimes later than that—I have never seen him in possession of money; I seldom went into their place—they were there two years before I went in, and then I only went in when I was sent for—when she was confined I went in and out for the first fortnight—I was in and out a good deal before she left her home to go to the workhouse—I never heard anything of their money matters; I have heard her say that she wanted money, when he was present—I could not exactly say when that was; it was somewhere about July, I think—she sent the little boy down to say she wanted to speak to me—she told the prisoner, in my presence, that he was murdering her by inches, and that he did not allow her common necessaries—he was coming up to her, and I stepped between them, and said, Don't strike her"—he said, "You have nothing to do between man and wife"—I said, "No, I did not come here to have anything to do with it; but, for goodness' sake, don't attempt to strike her"—he did not exactly attempt to strike her, but I was afraid of it—she came down to me on the Sunday week before she went into the workhouse; her husband was not present then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live in White Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I am district surgeon of the parish. I attended to the deceased some months ago—she came to me under a parish order—I attended her frequently at intervals from that time up to the time of her death—I saw that her case required all the support she could have, and asked her if she was able to get it—she said, unfortunately it was not in her power to get sufficient food—she had a cough at that time—she was suffering from <hi rend="italic">phthysis</hi>, or consumption; it was a very clear case—after of her death I made an examination of her body—both the right and left lobe the lungs had cavities, and were in a completely decayed state—her symptoms generally were such as would have destroyed twenty persons—I should say that state was supervening for some months; the body was very much emaciated—there were no marks of external violence at all—the heart was sound, the liver slightly enlarged, and the other viscera healthy—there were tubercles in the lungs—she undoubtedly died from disease of the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a draper, but am now out of business. On Monday afternoon, 11th July, about a quarter past 2 o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of the Regent's-park, near the New Church of St. Mark, in the Albert-road—I had been to have my dinner, and as I was coming from the coffee house I was separating my money in my hand, when all at once I was startled by somebody holding my arms from behind—I had not seen them before, for my eyes were directed to my hand as I was counting my money—it is a very quiet place—I found somebody lay hold of my arms behind and pinion me—I then looked and saw that two men were holding my arms—they pulled me on about three yards from the place where they had first seized me, and then directed my eyes to the prisoner, who was kneeling on the ground, shuffling some cards—they asked me to lay a stake—I refused to do so—they said they were betting, and wanted me to do the same—I was held all the time—one of them said, "I bet 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I pick up the middle card"—I do not remember that he said what the card was—all this time I was in the custody of the two men, and trying to get away as well is I could, but I was alarmed—I had my money grasped in my hand, for as soon as I felt them lay hold of my elbow I grasped my money and tried to</p>

               <p>put it into my pocket, but was not able to do to—I had half a sovereign, with four half crowns, in my left hand, and two sovereigns in my right hand, which I had taken from the other, and was about putting it into my pocket—I was in the act of separating the gold from the silver when I was first attacked—the man at the left hand side seized hold of my hand, and took from it the money that was in it, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of which he gave to the prisoner, and the other he put into his waistcoat pocket, and about a second afterwards he took it out again, and gave that also to the prisoner—I saw the prisoner take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was only about a yard from me at the time; he was in front of me—I did not see how many persons there were behind me—I did not look behind; I kept my eye on the prisoner, because I knew he had got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was pinioned all the time, that was why I could not resist them—two persons held me, one on each side—there seemed to be three of the party, one on my right hand, one on my left, and the other, who was betting, or pretending to bet—about a second after the man on my left took the money from my left hand, the man on the right side of me seized hold of my wrist, and forcibly took the two sovereigns out of that hand, and gave it to the prisoner—he put it on the ground, pretending that it was in my name, whereas it was nothing of the sort—I was then released—I immediately sprang at the prisoner, who was attempting to get on his feet, shuffling the cards all the time—he was then knocked down by a man, who was not in a policeman's clothes, but who at once said, "I am a constable, and you are my prisoner," and he took the prisoner into custody—when J first saw the prisoner he was kneeling down—I did not see him before I was pinioned—while the two men held me they talked to the prisoner; it was very confused; I could scarcely repeat what they said, save that "Here is a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bet; I bet you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I take up that card;" that is all that I can remember—they appeared to be rapidly betting with each other, and seemed to be quite confused with it, or quite busily engaged with it—the prisoner dealt the cards on the ground—he turned up certain cards, but I have no idea what they were; I suppose it was the one they were pretending to bet upon—I said nothing to the prisoner, only "Give me my money"—I said that as soon as I was released, and I made a dash at him to get my money—as soon as he had the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was released, and I sprang at his hands as he was getting on his feet, and said, "Give me my money" when I was interrupted by the policeman knocking him down—I did not consent to the money being taken from me; it was taken forcibly from my hand—it occupied about two minutes and a half.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody about half past 2 o'clock on this Monday afternoon, at the corner of Albert-road, Regent's-park—as I turned round the corner I saw him and two others of his companions in among a crowd of I suppose fourteen or fifteen persons—I then saw the prisoner on his knees on the public footpath, and before him he had these three cards (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—they were on the ground before I got up—I then saw some silver passed to the prisoner, but whose hand gave it to him I could not swear—I believe it was one of his companions—I saw the hand go immediately I came up—I saw the prosecutor there, he did not appear to be betting at all—I afterwards saw one of the prisoners' companions take from the prosecutor's hand two or three sovereigns—I saw that done—I was looking over a man's shoulder just round the corner—I was in plain clothes—I kept out of sight—I knew very well as soon as they saw me they would not stay—the man who took the sovereigns gave them to the prisoner—the prosecutor was in the act of laying hold of him, and I immediately came forward, got hold of him, and threw him on his back on the footpath, and whilst I was in the act of picking up these three cards some person struck me, and knocked me up against the wall—I then immediately put my foot on the prisoner's chest, and kept him down on the ground—I picked up</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Holls, a baker, in Union-street, Somers'-town; I live there. On Saturday night, 30th July, I was in the neighbourhood of Broad-street and New Oxford-street—I was sober; I had only drank two half pints of beer all the week—I wanted to get to Somers'<lb/>town—I saw the female prisoner, and asked her the way there—she told me she would direct me directly—she had no bonnet on—she asked me to give her a glass of gin—I went into a public house and gave her one—I then went with her I suppose fifty or sixty yards—in going along she said she would show me the road directly, but she was going in after her bonnet—we came to a court, and I went down the court because I was a foolish man, I suppose—when I got to the door of a cottage, she said, "Walk in"—she then told me to shut the door and bolt it—she did not give any reason for going in, but when I was inside she told me to slip the bolt, and I did so—she then told me if I would give her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she would strip naked—I said I would have no such thing—I tried to leave the house—I put my hand up to the bolt but did not reach it, she seized me too quickly; she caught bold of my left band trowsers pocket—I had a crown piece in that pocket, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, a key, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my right hand jacket pocket—I am not positive which—when I treated her at the public house, I took the money out of my jacket, not out of my trowsers—she caught hold of me, and I could not get her band loose—I seized it with all my might, but found she was stronger than me—we had a struggle; I was on my knees, and she sung out, "Why don't you come in? come in!"—and the male prisoner came in and struck me—I was then on one knee, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me on my back on a kind of cot or couch; he held me there with his arm across my throat—while he did that the woman was emptying my pockets—I missed about 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a key—I had a watch, and I saw the man make a <hi rend="italic">grip</hi> at the chain of it—the watch was concealed under the waistcoat, and did not go—I do not know what became of the female, the man held me down till she escaped—they did not say a word that I know of—I believe they both left me; I found the door open, and was glad to get out—I spoke to an officer, and gave a description of the persons—he took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman; I lodge at No. 18, Severn-street, St. George's; I have been for the last three years in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, as a lighterman; I was engaged as a lighterman in their service at Vancouver's Island. I came home from there in the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison</hi>—she left Vancouver's Island in March—on leaving the island I had 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession; it was in twelve fifty dollar pieces, four tens, four fives, one single dollar, and a twenty dollar piece—they were all gold coins, and there were six silver dollar pieces, several diems, or sixpences, and one English shilling—I am a married man—my wife was with me at Vancouver's Island—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year wages for three years, and my wife took in washing—she came home with me—she is not here today; she is close to her con-finement—we expected her to have been confined on board—she was very bad when I left home this morning—I took out 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods with me to the island, and I cleared between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by them; I got between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them on the island—that, with my wife's earnings, and my own, was the way in which I made my money—when I first left the island I had the money in a leather belt, with pockets in it—I afterwards had it sewn up; before that, I gave it in charge of the apprentice, George Naunton, for four or five days, on board the ship, till I got settled on board; and after that I received it all safe from the apprentice, and then had the belt sewn up by the sailmaker on board the ship—I wore the belt always about me till we came oft' Cape Horn, when we had some bad weather—I then left it off, and put it into a small basket inside my chest—in the course of two days after<lb/>wards I went to look for it, and it was gone—I made an alarm to the captain of the ship—the captain has got the date down in the log; it was in May—I know the prisoners, and knew them on the island; they went out in the same ship as I did originally—they were labouring men on the island—they were invalided by the Company, who sent them home—they had been sick on the island; I cannot say for bow long, but for a long while, or else the Company would not have sent them borne—I do not know whether they were in the habit of trading at all—while we were on board I bought a pipe of Wicks, for a dollar and a quarter; I went to my chest for it, and I paid him with a five franc piece—Wicks saw me go to the chest—he and Lane were sitting on Wicks' chest at the time—our cabins were opposite one another, between decks—Lane was between decks, and there was Wicks, his wife, and two children—I do not know the age of the eldest; I did say up at the Court that it was about fourteen or fifteen years of age; it looks about that—Lane has no family—it may have been a week before I missed my money that Lane and Wicks saw me go to my chest for the dollar—to the best of my know<lb/>ledge, it was in the middle of the day that I discovered my loss—my chest was unlocked—the captain sent the doctor and the chief mate all over the ship to make search—I was present when the boxes of the prisoners were searched—I saw what the doctor found in them, except the three fifty dollar pieces belonging to Wicks—I did not see them found, because I was called away at the time—the money was all laid out for me to look at—I was there when Wicks' box was searched—I saw the other coin found, but not the three fifty dollar pieces—in Lane's box nine fifty dollar pieces, and a great sum more money, was found; I do not know how much altogether—the captain has got it all down, and he can tell—Lane had some twenty dollar pieces; how many I cannot tell—I was not able at the time to identify any part of the money that was found—one of my fifty dollar pieces had a <hi rend="italic">nitch</hi> in it, as I reported to the captain on the same day—I have not seen that since—I saw it at the</p>

               <p>time Lane's box was searched, but could not identify it—I could identify it now if T were to see it, but I was in such a flurry at the time through losing my money, I was too much hurt—I told the captain on the same day that I made the alarm of the robbery that one of my dollar pieces had a <hi rend="italic">nitch</hi> in it—I know a man named Lowe; he was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison</hi>—previous to the robbery he paid me two dollars; that was a week or a fortnight after we left Vancouver's Island—it was about a fortnight before I missed my money; I beg your pardon, it was in May that I missed my money; I am wrong—Lowe paid me the two dollars about a week or a fortnight after we left Vancouver's Island, and I lost my money in May; that is all I know—the captain has got it all booked down—as soon as I received the two dollars I put them into my belt—I gave the alarm of the robbery the moment I found I had been robbed—the same day that I missed my money, Lane said he had marked his money on Vancouver's Island before he left—it was after I had made the alarm that I said that—after that, in the evening of that day, I saw Lane marking coin, but I was not close enough to him to see what sort of coin it was—he had money on the chest, and Wicks' boy was holding him a light at the same time—I have seen that boy in the Court yard here this Session; I do not see him in Court now—I saw him today, just before I entered the Court—I had a house at Vancouver's Island—I sold that when I left, for 100 dollars, to the head engineer of the Company's steam-boat—I changed my silver for six or seven fifty dollar pieces at the priest's on the island—the rest of the fifty dollar pieces I took in trade, from some Americans—fifty dollar pieces are very scarce on the island—I cannot say whether or not the priest had any more fifty dollar pieces besides those he gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at the Seaman's Home, in the East India-road—I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison</hi>—I know Metcalfe, he was <hi rend="italic">Jemmy Ducks</hi> on board, that is a sea phrase for a person that takes care of the stock—I know the prisoners—I remember paying Met<lb/>calfe two dollars on board, for two pairs of Indian mocassins—I should know those dollars again (<hi rend="italic">two dollars were here produced by the captain</hi>)—these are them—I know them by my name "Lowe" being scratched on them with a needle; I scratched it myself with the point of a needle, I do not know what possessed me to do it—it was done just before I went to work; I had a needle in my hand, and I was waiting for Metcalfe to pay him these two dollars when he came down; I was at work at some sails at the time—I marked them as I was sitting on the work bench—I had got them out for the purpose of paying Metcalfe—I marked the same on both, one on the pillar, and one, I believe, I marked in two places—I paid them away to Metcalfe directly after I marked them—I remember the robbery—sometime before the robbery, I remember wanting to change a five dollar-piece with Wicks; that might be three or four weeks after we left the island—I bought an oilskin coat and two south westers of Wicks, and I wanted to change the five dollar-piece to pay him one dollar, and he could not give it me—on the day of the robbery I changed a twenty dollar-piece with Wicks; that was at two bells, about 1 o'oclock—I bought four pounds of tobacco of him at seventy, five cents per pound—I received seventeen dollars in change, and among them were these two that I had previously paid to Metcalfe—I noticed one of them directly he gave it to me, and I noticed the other when I was relieved from the wheel at 4 o'clock; I went to the light in the forecastle and looked—I mentioned the matter to the ship's company in general, and I afterwards gave the two dollars to George Naunton to take to the captain; the captain had spoken to me at the wheel if I did have two such dollars, and I said I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not take them to the captain till he spoke to you about them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I kept them by me the whole voyage—I did not know that they must have been stolen from Metcalfe—I did not know but what Metcalfe might have changed them with somebody else—I did not speak to Metcalfe about it; he spoke to me about it—I learnt it then—I did not know that I had any particular right to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and give them to the captain—I did not know but what Metcalfe might have been trading with the prisoners and passed the dollars to them—I did not ask him about it; it was not my business to ask him—I did not show him the dollars; I showed them to the ship's company—I do not know why I did not show them to him—it was from mere pastime that I marked them, not from any expectation of seeing them again—I have often done so before; I have marked things on the ship's top, and I have my name on my arm; probably I have marked my name on dollars before—I do not recollect when I spoke to Metcalfe about it—I asked him if he had been exchanging any money</p>

               <p>with Wicks—perhaps that was two or three days after the robbery, it might be one day, it might possibly be on the same afternoon, I cannot say for certain—I did not show them to him, he never asked me—I told him I had money that I had marked which I had given to him, and that I could identify it, but he never asked to look at it, and I never showed it to him—I asked him whether he and Wicks had had any dealings together, and he said that they had had dealings together—I did not know whether he might have got the dollars in that way—I had about twenty-seven dollars when I left Vancouver's Island; they were not single dollars—I had two or three gold dollars, and had a 20-dollar piece; that was all the money I had on me when I left the island, it might amount to about twenty-nine or thirty dollars.</p>

I was captain of the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison.</hi> I remember the prosecutor complaining of having been robbed on the 14th of May, the sums he mentioned are in my log (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>); twelve 50-dollar pieces, one 20-dollar piece, four 10-dollar pieces, three 5-dollar pieces, one 1-dollar piece, that was in gold—in silver there were 6 dollars, 4 diems, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in answer to my question he gave me a description of one 50-dollar piece; he said one 50-dollar piece was slightly indented in the edge; it did not appear to be filed, and it was an old piece—he did not mention to me anything about two marked pieces in reference to Lowe—we came to England about 14th or 17th of July—we came in the dock on the 1st of August—the boy Naunton gave me the two dollars I produce to-day—I gave direction to my surgeon and mate to search the ship—in consequence of that certain money was found in possession of the two prisoners; in Wicks' possession there were three 50-dollar pieces, one 20-dollar piece, one 16-dollar piece, that is a doubloon; five 10-dollar pieces, two 5-dollar pieces, and three English sovereigns, in gold, and 197 1/2 dollars in silver, 24-quarter dollars in English and American money, 4 dollars of silver, and a bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three 50-dollar pieces on Wicks, and nine 50-dollar pieces on Lane—till I arrived in Eng<lb/>land Lane and Wicks were in possession of their money; I then took possession of it—it is here with the men's own seal on it; it has never been broken—Metcalfe has never had an opportunity of seeing these moneys in my possession.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Robert Westwood and Co., chemists, of Newgate-street. The prisoner came to the shop, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, on 5th July—he asked if we sold attar of roses—I said, "Yes; what quantity do you want?"—he said, "About two ounces;" on which he handed me a bottle, and I filled it—it contained an ounce and three quarters—I made him out an invoice, at 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—the amount was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have not got sufficient money with me;" on which he said he would go and fetch the money—I did not give him the bill—he went away, and returned in three or four minutes</p>

               <p>—he then asked me whether I had any oil of oranges—I said, "Yes"—he asked for half an ounce of it, which I gave him—he said he would pay for that—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then disputed the price of the attar, which I had told him was 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce, saying he could get it cheaper at Messrs. Grosmith's, perfumers, in our street—after that contention, I went backwards to the counting-house to inquire whether they would take less than 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I left the prisoner alone in the shop—I came back, and told him he could have it at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—I put "Settled" to the invoice, and handed it to him—he again said he had not sufficient money, but he would go and fetch it, and return immediately for it—he went out, but never returned—on going to business the next morning I discovered that one of the bottles had been changed, and I made a communication to the firm—that was on the morning of 6th July—the next time I saw the prisoner was on 15th July, in Goswell-street, close by the Three Cups—I went up to him, and told him he was the party that came to Messrs. Westwood's for the attar—he said he did not know the name nor the firm—I told him I was certain he was the man, and I asked him to give me his card; on which he handed me one, with "James Holloway, tailor and draper, 145, Old-street, Gos well-street," on it—I doubted the genuineness of the card, and told him I did not think it was a good one; on which he said that was his address; I should find him there if I went to his lodging—I then said, "Will you <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with me to your lodging?" meaning the address on the card—he said, "No; I have business to go and settle"—I followed him—he went down Westmoreland-buildings, and through Bartholomew-close, into Duke-street—on reaching there, I saw an officer—I told the prisoner I wished him to go with me to this address—he said he would go, and he took me to the top of Long-lane, not to where the card was—when he got there, he said be would go to Mr. Westwood's; and on reaching there, he said if I would let him go he would pay for it—I said I should do no such thing; I should give him in custody of the policeman—I produce the bottle which he left in exchange for the bottle of attar—it contains, I believe, common olive oil—it very much resembles the attar in appearance—I could not tell the difference of the two—I should think this is worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the attar was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and use fourteen acres of land at Langley Marsh, Buckinghamshire. I have lived there nearly five years—it is nearly three-quarters of a mile from Gerrard's-cross—I was at Gerrard's<lb/>cross on 10th June; it was about 10 o'clock in the morning when I got there—I went to the Bull about 11 o'clock, and drank some beer there, with a person named George—I stopped an hour or an hour and a half, and left between 12 and 1 o'clock, leaving him there—we had eight pints of beer between three or four of us; George took part of it—I then wanted to go home—I knew what I was about when I left, and I went straight down the road towards home—the Bull is about a mile from the defendant's house, which is next door to a public-house called the French Horn—as I came along the road, I picked up a small cask, with the name of "Taylor, Uxbridge," on it—knowing the Taylor's, I took it into the French Horn, which was about 100 yards, and left it there, with directions about it—I saw a great many people there, one of whom was a man whose name I have since ascertained to be Wilson—I had one pint of beer at the French Horn, of which Wilson took part—(<hi rend="italic">Wilson was here brought into the Court</hi>)—that is the man—I was about half an hour in the French Horn, or not quite so long, and then came out and pursued my walk home—there is a wall there which encloses the defendant's garden; that is on the side of his shop, farthest away from the French Horn—when I got opposite the wall, the defendant came over the wall, knocked me down, and I fell on my shoulder; be then said, "I told you how I would serve you," and walked away—no words had passed first—he struck me on my nose and my eye; ray nose bled very much—I got up, followed him into his shop, and asked him what he had done it for; he said he had done it, and he would do it again—his wife then pulled him indoors, and shut the door—I then went to the French Horn, and they washed the blood off; and then I walked home by myself, and saw my wife—I told her what had happened, and she washed my face again; it was bleeding then—about 4 o'clock that day I went to Mr. Gaskill, the Magistrate, who lives three-quarters of a mile off—I saw somebody there—I was told I had better come to-morrow—I then went home, and went the same day to Uxbridge, to the doctor's; that is four miles—my wife drove me in a cart—I saw the doctor, Mr. M'Namara, and then went home again—I went the same night to the lawyer's, Mr. Woodbridge, the clerk of the County Court, and applied for a summons—it was either the night I went to Mr. M'Namara's or the next day—I had had a difference with the defendant a long time ago, about a cow, and we were not on good terms When this happened.</p>

On 10th June, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, Mr. Grove came to my house, with a wound on the bridge of his nose and his right eyebrow—the eyelids were much swollen, and closed—he had blood on him, from his nose and eyes—his eye was getting black—he also complained of his shoulder—I should say that the injuries could not have been caused by a fall; it is very improbable—a severe blow with a fist would account for the injury; it was an injury that a severe blow might have caused—there must have been a rupture of the vessels of the nose, and it must have been a very severe blow—his losing a quantity of blood would make him very weak, and unable to support himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the ostler at the French Horn; I only act as ostler when my father is out. On 10th June I saw Grove in the tap-room, at 1 o'clock, when I went in at my door—he was beastly drunk—I saw nothing of any assault committed by anybody, but when I was standing at the horse trough Grove came up and accused me of hitting him—he asked me what reason I had to hit him, and said he would <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> me—Mr. Wingrove went by, and said, "Do not you go to <hi rend="italic">pull</hi> that young lad for hitting you, for it was me that pushed you.

                  </hi>. I reside at Haddenham, in Buckinghamshire, thirty-one miles from Uxbridge. Uxbridge is four or four and a quarter miles from Gerrard's-cross—I, and my wife, and James Lee, came up to the grass country, to assist in the hay making—Wilson was residing in the same place—on 10th June I was at Gerrard's-cross—I was in the taproom with my wife, Wilson, and some others—I do not know what time it was, but it was not night—I had some drink, and was eating some victuals—I saw Grove there; he had some beer in the taproom, two pints—I saw him pay his reckoning, and after that be went out of doors—I next saw him opposite the window; the taproom window looks into the road—I and my party remained in the room the whole time he was absent—John Wilson was in the taproom when Grove went out—a man named William Rose was sitting next to the fireplace, and Wilson was next to him—he did not go out at all during the time that Grove was absent—when Grove went away Small got up, and said, "Let us pay our reckoning while the house is still"—there had been a noise before—Wilson was in the room at that time, and paid his reckoning—he threw down half a crown—I cannot say whether he sat down again after that, or whether Mr. Grove came back bleeding or not—I beard some one say Grove was outside, bleeding; upon that being said, Wilson jumped up, and looked over my wife's shoulder, out of the window—at that time Grove was in sight of the window, bleeding—after Wilson had looked through the window, he went out of doors; and when he was outside the door, he said, "Where is the b——r that hit him; if he wants to fight a man, let him come and fight me"—I did not hear Wilson say anything at that time about Wingrove having struck him—Grove was very intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police, stationed at Woolwich. On 26th July, I received a warrant to search a house, No. 21, Wellington-street, Woolwich—I went there with two officers; Child was with me—I went to the front room which is fitted up as an office—I saw Saunders there—I found ten or twelve account books there which I here produce; eight of them were on shelves; this one was on a table—this one was to pieces; the greater part of the leaves were in the covers, some had slipped out; I have now tied them up—I examined the back of the books to see if any labels had been taken off—there is no doubt but a label has been taken off here; the top of this cover has been taken off about two inches—on three of these leaves there is the broad arrow—they were in the same state they are now, but I have arranged them since—this part was the back of the book—these two parts fit as if they had been one before they were divided—I have no doubt about it—(<hi rend="italic">The witness put both the parts in the covers and showed them to the Jury</hi>)—I do not believe here is the whole book, I think some leaves are gone—I found this label had been pasted on this order book; I took it off—I find here is on it "Day book, 1853," and under it a piece has been cut out of the leather—these two appear to have been one book, similar to this one, and cat down the middle—it is lettered similar to this, with the alphabet—these three books appear to have had the labels removed; here is the mark where the labels have been—this large book has had a label taken off; here is the place where it has been—I took possession of these books and have had them ever since—Saunders was taken into custody—I told him I should take him into custody for having them in his possession—on the following morning I saw Akers in custody—Saunders was present at the time I said to Akers, "When I took Saunders he said the books belonged to you"—Akers replied, "That is quite right, I bought them."</p>

I was in the front office with Akers—Arman brought some books in a brown cover, not a very large parcel—he offered them to Akers—he opened the parcel in the office, and said, "Here are some books; I have them for sale, if you like to purchase them"—Akers looked at them, and opened them—Arman said they were his own property, and Akers need not be afraid to purchase them—Akers said he had but very little money without going up to his shop of business—I cannot say how many books there were; there might be three, or four, or five—they were very similar to those that are here—Akers then called to his wife, "Here is Sergeant Arman come to see you," and Arman went up stairs with Akers—I saw Arman when he came down; he bid me good day—I examined the books; they were just like these—there were no loose leaves—Mr. Akers brought some like these other books in my office—I do not know on what date—he brought one down at a time—I gave the books that Akers brought to the police—they were just like these—Akers allowed me to have them to put on a shelf to make a show—he said if I liked to have the use of them, I might; he said they looked very well, and I might keep them there till he required them—there were some labels on them when the police had them—I did not notice the state of the labels myself.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of John William Alexander Kennedy was here read, as follows</hi>:—"John William Alexander Kennedy, on his oath, saith as follows: 'I am lieutenant and adjutant in the Woolwich division of Royal Marines; the prisoner Arman is the senior sergeant of Marines, employed in the adjutant's office, and has been some years in the office, and senior clerk about eighteen months; I have examined the eleven books now produced; they are similar in every respect to those used in the adjutant's office; the books in store were in the prisoner Arman's charge, locked up in a room, of which he has the key; upon referring to a list now shown me by Mr. Hewett, I find that eighteen books of No. 12 ledger were delivered at the Marine Barracks in the beginning of July; in due course, these books would have come into the prisoner Arman's keeping, it being his duty to unpack the box, and put them into store; I have since examined those books, and find two deficient; on looking at the books now produced by the police, I find one of them is numbered "12," and labelled "Ledger;" it is ruled, and resembles in every respect one of the two that I have missed; upon reference to the same list now shown to me by Mr. Hewett, I find that eleven divided order<lb/>books were supplied at the same time as the ledgers, and they, in due course, would also have come into Arman's keeping; I have examined our store, and</p>

               <p>find a deficiency of three of that particular book; among the books now produced by the police are three exactly resembling the divisional order-books, with the labels torn off. 'On cross-examination: 'A key has been found within the last few days that will fit the lock of the store-room door, and belongs, I believe, to an adjoining closet.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Storekeeper General's Office. It is the practice of the Storekeeper General to send stores to the different departments of the docks and barracks—(here are account books kept there, and they would be sent out on demand—the Adjutant's office is where the books would be sent—I have looked over the books taken by the officers, which are now before me—they are similar to those in store—when they are in store they are labelled for the purposes for which they are intended—there is no broad arrow on these plainer books, which are for writing in—the books are bound by contract for the Stationary office—the label is on the outside of the book, on the top—there is the appearance of the label on these books—this one has the mark of the label very plain—these are all quite new—I know of a number of books of this description being sent to the barracks at Woolwich—the last demand was sent to Woolwich on 4th July—these large books are letter books—this one is supplied as a general index—I keep these books in store—the label is still on this one—this is a book that we issue for orders—this had a broad arrow, in gold, on the first cover—these two sets of leaves appear to have been a book; the leaves are cut in two—these have the broad arrow on them—this is a printed book—the printed books have the broad arrow on them, but not the plain ones—this would be an embarcation book; I have compared it with the embarcation books, and it corresponds in every particular as to the ruling—these small ones are similar to what we supply for divisional order books—as far as I can judge these are Her Majesty's stores; I have no doubt of it—I cannot tell whether any of these were furnished on the last supply—they are made by contract—the value of the whole is about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know anything about the public sales at Woolwich? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—there are sales of old stores two or three times a year—I presume they are public sales; they are advertized—I presume they are marine stores, things that have got useless in service—I think I may say that old books are not sold—I am aware there are a large number of old books in store; the Admiralty are very particular on that point—my impression is that these books have certainly not been sold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Arman. Q.</hi> Do you put the books in cases yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do some-times; I have a man to help me—I cannot swear that I put these books in cases myself on the 4th of July—there were four or five cases sent—I have on former occasions sent books short of the complement, through there being no more remaining in store, which I have made up as soon as they were received—it may not be impossible to buy books like these in London—Mr. Truscott, a binder, in Black friars-road, has the contract from the Stationery-office—</p>

               <p>when the last contract was taken from Mr. Smith, I should apprehend he had none of these remaining in stock, because the paper for the books is supplied from the Stationery-office; he does not make them with his own paper—I cannot swear that I sent these books to Woolwich—I send to the whole of the divisions—I should apprehend that the demand this year is much the same as last year—I can swear positively that two or three of these books are the property of the Commissioners of the Admiralty—this ledger there can be no doubt about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CROWDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you have sometimes sent short, when you have not bad sufficient to meet the demand; but if you have had sufficient, have you ever sent short? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; I had not sufficient in July to send the whole of the books, but of the description of books that are here I had sufficient for the demand—I am able to state that I sent all this description of books; and I am able to state that I have the receipt for the whole—they were directed to the Colonel Commandant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Arman's Defence.</hi> There are five books stated to be missing, and only four have been found at Mr. Akers', and these he stated I sold on the 26th of June, and the books were sent on the 4th of July; it is impossible therefore that these could be them; those books I took from Mr. Parry, in Francis-street, Woolwich, for work I had done for him; I called several times, and could not get the money; I called on him on the 9th of May, and he said he had some books he wished to dispose of; he showed them to me; he wanted 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; after some hesitation, I gave him the difference between my bill and them, which was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I sold some of them to Mr. Akers on the 26th of June, and in a few days after I sold the remainder; I hope the explana<lb/>tion I have given will be satisfactory to you, for upwards of nineteen years I have served my Queen and country, by sea and land; I have a list of testi<lb/>monials, which will show what my character has been.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Bedford-row, Guild ford-street, Borough. I knew the deceased Mrs. Bishop as a neighbour, she lived at No. 21, Russell-place, opposite me—from something I heard on Sunday afternoon, 3rd July, about 3 o'clock I went over to the deceased, and found her lying on the bedstead with a chemise and counterpane thrown over her, she appeared to me as if she was in a fit, she was not able to speak to me—the prisoner was sitting on the edge of the bed—I remained with her up to 9 o'clock at night with a very slight interval, just crossing the road—on my suggestion, Mr. Nash the surgeon was then called in—I did not remain with her all night, I left at 9 o'clock—I was called at 20 minutes past 2 o'clock in the morning, I then remained with her up to within ten minutes of her death—she died from about half past 11 to 12 o'clock—after her death I examined her person—I saw two small bruises on the left side of her head, a small cut bruise on the right side of the head, about the length of my nail, which appeared to have been done about four or five days; a bruise on the back</p>

               <p>part of the right arm, and one, a very large, one quite at the bottom of the hack—the two bruises on the head seemed quite fresh—I asked the prisoner how the bruises came there; he said he did not know—I asked if he had bad any words with her—he said he had had words on the Saturday night, but no blows had passed between them—he said he had found her, between half past 5 and 6 o'clock on the Sunday morning, on the floor at the bottom of the bedstead, and she then appeared to be in a fit, in the same state as I had found her—I had not known them long, they had not lived a great while in that neighbourhood—she had five children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bridge-street, Southwark. On Sunday, 3rd July, about 10 o'clock at night, I was called in to see the deceased—she was then in a sinking state—I could do nothing for her—I saw she was dying; it was quite a hopeless case—I gave her some stimulants—afterwards, in consequence of an order from the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the state of the stomach and liver indicated a habit of drinking—there was a great deal of disease in the chest; both lungs were diseased—that did not contribute to her death—death was caused by extravasation of blood on the brain, which I detected on opening the skull—I found an injury corresponding to that extravasation, behind and above the right ear, and there were also contusions on the left side of the head—I should say the injury had been inflicted three or four days—I made the examination on the Tuesday—there was no injury of so recent a date as Saturday evening" except the bruise on the right shoulder—all the injuries on the body were of an older date—the injury on the head had the appearance of having been inflicted three or four days before death—I think the extra<lb/>vasation of blood must have taken place on the Saturday evening—the wound which corresponded with the extravasation I should say had been inflicted at least a couple of days previous—I think the injuries behind the ear so injured the vessel without exactly tearing it across, that subsequent excitement or the fall had divided it—that which the witness described as a bruise at the lower part of the back was not a bruise—it was merely caused by pressure, such as might be produced from a person lying in bed—the extra<lb/>vasation of blood would account for the sinking state in which I found her on the Sunday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that a Mr. Tibbitt's had been called in before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have not seen him here—the prisoner appeared desirous of doing everything he could for his wife—I gave general directions to bathe her temples, and so on—there were a great many women present, and I think they did that—he appeared grieved, I saw him crying—that was after her death—I think it most likely that the immediate cause of the extravasation was a fall coupled with excitement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Roberts, a plate glass silverer. I am the prisoner's sister, and live with him—he keeps the Carpenter's Arms, Old Pye-street, Westminster—on Tuesday, 19th July, I was at home all day, with my brother—I did not leave home at all, and he was not out all that day—I know Michael Durrant—he was at the house all the evening till it was closed—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the house that evening with a woman who called for some beer, and would not pay for it; it com<lb/>menced at 8 o'clock, and lasted about half an hour—I was down stairs next morning about 8 minutes before 7 o'clock—the house is frequented by working people as they go to their work—my brother was down before me, at half-past 6 o'clock—when I came down, I went into the kitchen to light the fire, and then went to clean the bar parlour out—two men and a female then came in, and stood drinking ale for nearly an hour—about a quarter of an hour before they left, the taller man pulled a small brown paper parcel out of his coat pocket, and asked my brother to take care of it till he called for it, and asked him to be careful with it; my brother said he would, and he put it on a shelf underneath the bar—it remained there about half an hour—my brother went out that morning about a quarter before 11 o'clock—before he went out he opened the parcel; it contained two watches and some small jewellery—on account of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> on the previous night, and the woman being locked in the station house, he said, "For safety, I will take these things with me; if the woman comes back, Mrs. Bolland, no doubt she will come and make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—he went out to pay Messrs. Elliott, the brewers, and took twenty-six sovereigns with him for that purpose—I know that, because he brought them down, put them on the bar table, and counted them—I knew before that that he was in the habit of keeping money in his bedroom, in a bag, which I had seen before, and I know he had money by him at the time—he had to pay Elliott 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Hawkes, of Wal<lb/>ham-green, another brewer—he returned again about half past 12 or a quarter to 1 o'clock, and told me he had not been to the brewers—I saw that he had been drinking, and asked him to step in; he stayed a quarter of an hour, and then went out—I expected him back in a few minutes, but he did not come, and I saw no more of him till he was at the station—I know the persons by sight who left the parcel, but not by name; they bad been in the house before, and I should know them again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say your brother opened the parcel: how came he to do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, if he was going out he had better see what was in the parcel, as I was going to be at home by myself, and it was then that he opened it—on that day, while my brother was out, Mrs. Bolland's sister came, and two more women; they thrust the bar parlour door open, and broke everything I had on the dinner table—I was by myself, and was very much alarmed—I gave them into custody; they were taken before a Magistrate, one had a month and the other ten days.</p>
