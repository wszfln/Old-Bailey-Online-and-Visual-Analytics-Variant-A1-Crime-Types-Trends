They went towards the Foundling-hospital, I went and saw the door open, I shut it, and went after the prisoners: I watched them down as far as the Hospital; I could not see any body to assist me there. I came back, thinking they would come again, as they had left the door open; I got behind a piece of wood, and saw them come and cross over and down the yard; then I went and got assistance; I met them coming out of the yard, I told the watchmen they were the men; they had been at the house and found the door fast, and were coming back.</p>

On Monday night was a fortnight, my wife told me somebody had got in at my parlour window, and stole my watch (a Pinchbeck watch and chain) from off the chimney-piece, where it usually lay. I made no enquiry about it, but gave it over for lost; but last Thursday, in the afternoon, Hawthorn the constable brought

             to me, he acknowledged he had stole it, in company with the prisoner Twyner; the next day Hawthorn brought the watch to me; on the Friday, Cliff, Twyner and Bird, were all before Justice Welch. There Cliff charged Twyner with having got in at my window, and stealing my watch, and carrying it to Bird, who gave him a guinea upon it, and said they should have a guinea more, when he had sold it. Bird at that time acknowledged they did come to him with the watch, and said, they told him they found it at Chelsea; and he did lend them a guinea upon it; this was all in my hearing.</p>

            . Cliff told me, that Twyner had taken the watch, as the prosecutor has mentioned, and sold it to Bird. I went with a search-warrant to Bird's, and asked him after it; he acknowledged he had a watch left there for a guinea, he sent his maid up stairs for it; she brought it down. I told him I had a warrant to bring him before the Justice; he made some excuse, and said, he would not go then, but would soon follow me. I left him, he came accordingly. I found Twyner at Bird's house. He acknowledged he got in at the prosecutor's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070005"/> window, and took the watch out of the parlour.</p>

            . One evening, I cannot tell the day, between five and six, we went and pulled up the sash of the window of the prosecutor's house. Twyner pulled his cloaths off, and got over the rails, and went in at the window, and took the watch; then we went to the Running Horse in St. Gyles's, where Twyner's brother lives: then he, his brother and I went all together to Bird's house; we got there by about seven; we gave Twyner's brother the watch, for him to tell Bird; we got it out of a window at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for that?</p>
               <p>Cliff. Because, Bird would not have meddled with it, had he not thought it came from some distance off. Bird desired to look at it. He took us into a back room, and said he had not a great deal of money in the house; but he would lend him a guinea till it could be sold; then he would give him the remainder of the money. Then I was very ill, and staid there four nights.</p>

             the prisoner, and his brother, came to my house, and called for liquor; then this watch was produced. Cliff said, he had no money to pay, unless he had some upon the watch. I did lend them some money upon it, taking them to be honest people.</p>

               <p>Wane. I generally do when I have been drinking, because sometimes the others have none, and they may want to borrow; then I show them I have none.</p>

            . I am a constable, I went with the search-warrant to Puddle-Dock, Black-fryars; where Thomas's mother lodges; and found these things up in a chimney in the garret. I understood one of the prisoners had confessed where the things were; and before my lord mayor, I heard Thorman say, it was by his direction that the things were found. Thomas said, he would suffer before he would confess any thing.</p>

            . I live in Gloucester Court, Blackfryars. I was coming home that night from my club, I met the two prisoners in Church Entry, just by where I live, close to the prosecutrix; I said to Thorman, is it not time for you to be at home in bed; he said yes. They both came with me to the door where I live. I desired Thorman to come up stairs with me: he said he would come presently. I left them both at the door, he lies in the same room I do; he did not come up.</p>

On the 18th of October last, I was alarmed about three in the morning; our bell rang, we lissened to know what was the meaning; I heard a person run up stairs. Mr. Reynoldson, that lodges in our house, call'd, and said, he believed there were thieves in the house; he came down into my chamber and took the keys, and went down stairs. I followed him immediately after;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070008"/> my husband was ill in bed; and is so ill now he cannot attend the Court. When I came into the parlour, I found the flap of the cellar window was torn up, and a padlock torn from the cellar door, that opens into the street upon the cellar stairs; the door shuts on the flap, and was padlock'd on the inside. There is a window seat like in the parlour, which was a head-way front, the top of that was wrench'd off, and the top of it lay upon the ground; by that means a passage was opened into the parlour, close to the bureau where our goods were locked up: I locked them up myself, about eleven o'clock over night; I am always the last up, and know the cellar door and flap were safe at that time. The bureau is a bureau and book-case, but instead of books there are twenty-four drawers that hold our work: there is an iron bar that goes cross and fastens the two doors, and is padlocked. The padlock I found torn to pieces, and the bar torn off; the shutter taken down, and the flap of the bureau had the lock torn off, the keys were in there; by which they unlocked the top where the other drawers were; there was a lock to the top besides the bar; the middle drawer the lock was broke off. There were three locks of the buffet broke also, and a case of tea-spoons moved out and put into a chair; but we believe, by the alarm of the bell, the thief made off. The next day I observed there were some drops of wax in the bureau: the goods mentioned in the indictment were taken away; some we have found again, but not all, nor near all. I immediately had warnings dispersed about, from Goldsmiths hall, and went to Sir

I heard nothing of them till Mr. Wintle came to me, on the 21st of November, and told me, he believed he had some of my goods, he shewed them to us, and we owned them; he said, they were offered to him to sell, by one Mr. Davis in the Minories; Mr. Davis's son came with him: we asked him how he came by them: the son said, a gentleman, that his father knew very well, that his father had them of; and he was to call on his father about three o'clock; he had left them to see whether he liked them: Mr. Wintle, seeing Mr. Knight's seal, thought proper to stop them. There were fifteen pair of gold buttons, and seven pair of garnet ear-rings. Mr. Wintle and Mr. Peirce, a friend of ours, that happened to be at our house, went to see if they could light of the man that brought them to Mr. Davis's and between three and four o'clock, the same day, I was sent for to Sir

            's; there I saw the prisoner, and a case of rings that was taken from him; they were all our property, except one ring: there were seventeen in all. Sir John granted a search-warrant. I went with three of his people; and a gentleman that lives behind the Change, that had been robbed, to search the prisoner's house, No. 5, in Swan-street, in the Minories: we found the prisoner's wife and her sister, and a nurse; at going in the nurse took down a watch that was hanging up, and clapped it into her pocket; one of Sir John's men insisted upon her pulling it out; and upon my examining it, I found a gold seal of mine hanging to it; we asked for the keys; we were answered, they had none. So Sir John's people broke the locks. In the bureau we found several of my rings, buckles, ear-rings, buttons, and several things of mine: some we found in a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to the goods?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. I have been in the business near twenty years, and my husband has been very ill for twelve months: I have attended the business more than he laterly: and there are marks upon many of the things of my making; by which I know how to sell them, We found great many things at the prisoner's house besides mine, an iron crow, two chisels, a dark lanthorn, some wax lights, and a particular gimblet. We found a great quantity of silks, plate, china, and other things belonging to other people; we brought all to Sir

            's. Then the prisoner was called in to be examined; he would make no other answer, but that he bought the things in the street, Sir John ordered him to Newgate; he returned back again, and wanted to be admitted an evidence; and said, he would make very great discoveries. Sir John said, he was an old offender, and would not admit him. (The padlock produced, broke.) Perhaps, when the iron tools come to be produced, very likely, the Court may judge who did the mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods of your own did you find at the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. There were a pair of knee buckles, which were taken out of his knees. The other things as follows, a pair of three drop cluster garnet ear-rings, in gold; a pair of single drop garnet ear-rings, in silver; six pair of fancy ear-rings and cases in silver; a silver girdle buckle; a pair of crystal buckles, in silver; a pair of topazes; a pair of children's stone buckles; a pair of knee buckles; a stone shoe buckle; a child's silver buckle; a pair of garnet shoe buckle in silver, gilt; a pair of crystal buckles; a pair of cluster garnet buttons, in gold; six pair of buttons and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070009"/> wires, three silver; twelve gold ear-rings; three stone buttons, in silver; a pair of cluster studs; three gold diamond rings; a gold ring with a false stone; three pair of stone buttons, in silver; a pair of garnet buttons, in gold; a pair of cluster Moco, in gold; a pair of crystal, ear-rings, in silver; a pair of cluster paste, in silver; a heart trinket, in gold; a purple paste hoop-ring, in gold; two paste crosses, in silver; and a small pocket piece.

               <p>Q. How do you know it was his wife?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. She told me she was; and that her certificate was in Sir John Fielding's hands, among the papers that were brought there. We asked her if she had any more rooms than that, she said no. But afterwards she said there were more.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of marks were on the buckles?</p>
               <p>A. Knight. The marks are scratched with a point of a file. (She takes up a buckle.) I have the fellow to this in my pocket. Please to examine this knee buckle; which is one I had out of the prisoner's breeches knee. You will find out felling mark, H. I. upon it. (The bench and jury examine and find it so.) Thus we mark all our goods that are large, so as to bear it; our papers are scratched in the same manner.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Knight's. About half an hour after two, or a little after, that morning, I awaked, and thought I heard somebody was getting in backwards. About half an hour after three, thinking somebody was getting in backwards, I got up, opened my door, and rang the bell. No body coming, I went up and awakened one of Mr. Knight's apprentices. We both went down together, and opened the street door, and went into the street. There we found the cellar window open, upon which the apprentice put the flap of the window over it. We went in, and shut the door, and went down into the cellar, and from thence into the kitchen, and from thence into the parlour, where we found the seat of the window broke open. Mr. and Mrs. Knight heard us go down. She came down. We found the desk and book-case open, in the parlour; and the drawers open, and most of the things gone: upon which we went to the beaufet, and found that open. There were some little things lying in an easy-chair by it, ready to be taken away. I did not go to bed till near one o'clock that morning. I was in my own apartment; I was at home all the evening, and can answer to the street door being fast before I went up stairs.</p>

            . I keep a silversmith's shop in the Minories: On Monday morning, the 21st of November, the prisoner came into my shop, and laid these goods on my counter, and said, Pray sir, will these goods do for you? (Producing seven pair of gold buttons, and fifteen pair of gold ear-rings.) I was very ill; and it was a rainy dark morning: I said, indeed I cannot see them, whether they are garnets or not. Pray what do you ask for them? Said he, I must have nine guineas for them. I said, Sir, they will not do for me, for I am so ill I cannot look at them. He said, well, what time shall you be back from 'Change? I will leave them, and call again for either the money or my goods, by two, or a quarter after. He left me. I wanted to go to 'Change, but being ill, I went no farther than Mr. Levi's Coffee-house. I had not been there long before Mr. Wintle came to me. My son had taken the goods, and carried them to Mr. Wintle. Mr. Wintle, and another man, and my son, came to me. Mr. Wintle called me out, and said, here are some goods which your son brought me to sell, which belong to a workman of mine, whose house has been broke open; and I hope you will give me an account how you came by them. I said, sir, do not be uneasy about them, I have not bought them; but the gentleman left them, and is to be at my house by two or a quarter after, for either the money or the goods. He said, do you know the gentleman? Said I, yes, sir; I see him every day, at the Bank Coffee-house. Said he, I am afraid he will not come for the goods. Said I, I will warrant you, the man will come. Mr. Wintle had the goods in his pocket at the time. I said, do you and the other gentleman come to my house, and make no noise, but sit in my parlour, and you will see the gentleman come according to his time. We went to my house, and in about half an hour after two o'clock, the prisoner came. Then I said to Mr. Wintle, please to give me the goods. I took and opened them upon the counter, and said, here sir, is your goods, they do not suit me. The prisoner said, pray, sir, why do not they suit you? I said, because here is a gentleman that says they are not honestly come by. (The goods, with the gold rings in the case, produced in Court.)</p>

I found several things which Mrs. Knight owned, particularly a seal that was to a watch, and several gold things in papers. In an under-drawer, in a double chest of drawers, I found an iron crow, two-ripping chisels, a piece of wax candle, and a dark lanthorn. (Produced in court.) The Chisels seemed to have been much used against nails, &amp;c. the crow, about two feet long, two, claws at the great end, and the other drawn off tapering<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070011"/> round to a sharp point.

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Webb. This was about ten weeks ago. I set them down at the end of the Minories, at the end of Swan-Street, betwixt one and two o'clock in the morning. A gentleman said, Mr. Martin, a good night to you. There were several things in the coach; one in particular was this iron crow; (taking the crow in his hand.) I am certain it was this crow. There was also something that rattled; whether it was brass or silver, I know not. There were two men came with them in to the coach, but they parted with them in Cheapside. I carried the prisoner five times within a fortnight. I carried him twice from Blackwall: I cannot be sure he was one of them in the coach, the first time; but I carried such things as these (meaning the crow and chisels) and three men, to No. 5, in Swan-Street, in the Minories: I know he was one of them the second time. I delivered the crow to a woman at No. 5. They had bundles with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>

I know nothing of any things they had with them: I was in the house when the people came with the search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect your taking the watch down which hung up, and putting it in your pocket?</p>
               <p>G. Mather. I did not put it in my pocket, I took it for fear it should be broke; the gentleman said, where is it? I said, here it is, and said, there it is, on the shelf.

            . I keep a cloaths-shop in Field-Lane. The prisoner came to my shop with two shirts the last day of October, between eight and nine in the morning; I bought them of her for 3 s 6 d. As soon as I had bought them, she said she had more linen, which she had contracted for with a carpenter in Salisbury-Court, but had not money to pay for them all at once. She asked me if I should be at home, she would soon be with me with more. She went away, and, in a little better than a quarter of an hour, she came again with four more; I bid her 9 s. for them; she took them away, and in about ten minutes she brought them again, and said, she had been at three shops, and had 9 s. bid at each, but as I was the first bidder, I should have them; I looked at them, and said, you say you bought them of a carpenter in Salisbury-Court, Fleet-Street; before I pay for them, I'll send my man with you to see that you had them there. I delivered half a guinea to my man to pay for them, if he found it so, and they went away together. My man came back and told me, she would go no farther after she got out of the lane. I saw no more of her till the Wednesday morning. She then brought two or three cloaths-people, who said they saw her buy them, and claimed the linen. I took her to Justice Girdler, who committed her to New Prison. I then advertised the shirts, and

I came to Mr. Chapelow and sold him two; I know no more of their being than any one in court. I never said such a word as Mr. Chapelow says. I have taken a great many pounds of him.</p>

            . On the 12th of last month, I was in liquor, having been drinking at the Castle inn, by Carnaby market. I met the prisoner, either in Monmouth street, or the top of Long Acre, I am not sure which. She took me to a house. I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go to bed with you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, I went to bed by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it?</p>
               <p>Thomas. It was a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. As you are not certain where you met the woman, can you be sure the prisoner is the woman?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I knew her again when I saw her the next morning. There was a soldier, named Piggot, in the room, when I went in; he and I had a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I know not where she went.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she did not go to bed to you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No, she did not. Piggot was in the room when I went to bed; when I awaked, about 5 o'clock in the morning, I missed three guineas out of my breeches pocket; the soldier saw it before I went to bed. I took it out and gave him a five and three penny piece, to go for a pot of beer, and to bring the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I put them under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I lodge in the city. I was hardly capable of going home. Piggot, the soldier, awaked me. I had some silver in my waistcoat pocket: then the soldier and I went to a public house. The prisoner came in, while we were there. I asked her for my money. She said she knew nothing of it. I sent for a constable. She was taken to the round house, and upon searching her, two guineas were found upon her, in a private pocket, but I cannot swear they were mine, but she owned they were mine. We found another guinea at a public house, where she had left it. She owned they were all my property, before Justice Welsh.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the soldier to awake you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I had ordered him to call me, that I might go home.</p>

            . I hire that room. I was in it when the prisoner brought the prosecutor in. She lives up one pair of stairs above me. They came in about seven o'clock in the evening. He complained he was cold; he asked me if I would drink, and gave me a five-and-three-penny piece, to go and get a pot of beer, hot. I brought it, and gave him the change. She said she should be obliged to me, if I would let the gentleman lay in my room all night, as her room windows were broke. I saw three guineas in his hand, when he gave me the five-and-three-penny piece. I believe I might stay in the room with them about an hour. They were both going to bed when I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lodged in that house?</p>
               <p>Piggot. She had been there about five or six days. He desired me to call him about five o'clock in the morning, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lay?</p>
               <p>

He went to put on his things, and said he had lost his money. Then we went to a public house. He treated me with a pint of purl. The prisoner came in. He asked her if she had his money. She said she had not a farthing of it, and that if he was robbed, I must have taken it. She was searched, and two guineas found upon her, and before Justice Welsh she said it was his property; that he gave it her to keep for him till morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>About five o'clock that Saturday evening. I met that gentleman in Long Acre. His face was very much scratched. He took hold of me, and said, he had been very ill used, and had lost all his money. He asked me where I was going, and said, he would go with me; I took him home, and went into Piggot's room, to light a candle; the gentleman said, he would go in there; I said, that was not my room. He went in and sat down, and bid us look at his arm, he had a hurt on it. He would have some supper. He gave Piggot money, to get two rabbits, for the Sunday's dinner; he asked me if I liked a duck, and said he would stay all the next day. He was much in liquor. About two o'clock he went to bed, and I with him. He gave me three guineas, in a paper, and bid me take care of them. He said he was about taking a public house, and asked me if I would live with him, saying, he had no wife. I said I should like it very well: the soldier's wife came in the night, and said, her husband would not let her live there any longer; after I got out of bed, the soldier went to bed to him: in the morning, I went to the public house, the gentleman was there, said he, I want the woman; I said, I am she; said he, I have lost five guineas; I said, I took none; he sent for a constable, and I was taken to the round-house. They took two guineas from me. I thought as he gave it me, I might do what I pleased with it.</p>

He said he would not bring any innocent man in, and owned he was the man that took the mare out of the field on the Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070016"/> morning, about one o'clock; and went away for Reading, in Berkshire, and staid there till Sunday night between ten and eleven o'clock; then he came away for Kingston. I asked him how he came by the pistol, he said he found it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a gate in the fence where Mr. Lewis's horses and mine run one among another, and he could better take the mare out of Mr. Lewis's gate, than mine.</p>

            . I did not know the prisoner was in custody till I saw him at the bar. He once lived with a relation of mine, in Berkshire, near Reading. I generally go there once a year. I remember seeing the prisoner there several times. I have said to my uncle, you have your old servant still, he said, I have, and he is a good servant. I know he bore a good character there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him last</p>
               <p>Montague. It is pretty near twelve months ago. I was surprised to see him at the bar.</p>

They said they would go and walk, and come again in about an hour. They went out, and the prisoner came in again when I was at dinner. He said he did not bring Smith, because he knew I did not like him. He went out again: then I told my wife to tell him if he came again, I was gone out; and I went up stairs. The prisoner came in just as I came down; then we had some beer and gin, and we went out. When we were at a place I never was at before, he swore he would go in and have a glass of gin: he went in, and I after him. Who should be there, but

             and the other man came there after.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I believe it was about four o'clock. They got me into the bar-room; there were two other men in the bar-room when I went in; they were gambling. One of them said he would lay an hundred pounds, about hiding under a hat: he would guess three times out of four, if money was put under the hat. Then Smith, and the man that came in with him, said, they would play with him for a pot of hot, and a shilling; they threw down a shilling each, and I put down a shilling; we won it: then one said, how much money have you got? one said, I have so much, and another, so much: then the prisoner said, we will all have an hundred pounds each, before we leave the house. I was not willing to let them know how much I had, but they fell a swearing, and asked me what I was afraid of? then I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out ten guineas; the prisoner told me to put it into his hat; they said they would put down the same; that is, all that were in the room, were to put down the same; then they asked me, i f I had any more? I then put eight guineas more into the hat; they all said, they would put down the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were they to put it down?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. For gambling. One of the other men said, neither of us was worth so much money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the hat before you put in your's?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No, there was not. The prisoner and Smith said, if I could show so much money, they could get a hundred pounds apiece, before they left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was you to show?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. They said, if among us all we could show twenty guineas, we should get the money before we went out of the house; and they said, they would put as much in as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said they should get an hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. There were only Smith, the prisoner, and the other three; it was the prisoner, Smith, and one of the other, that said we should be sure of an hundred pounds each.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070017"/> Then the other man, he that came in with Simpson and Smith, put an halfpenny under another hat. I discovered the villainy, and saw what they were about, and that neither of them would put in any money; I got up, leaned over the table, and took hold of the hat in the prisoner's hand, where my money was; and, at the same time, Smith catched hold of my collar, and dragged the hat out of my hand. I said, you are all a parcel of villains, I see what you are about, you shall not have my money. The prisoner handed the hat to the other man that was pretending to gamble, and, as he was handing it to him, he put in his hand, and took out a guinea; I took hold of his hand, got it out, and put it into my pocket: they then all got up, and collar'd me, threatned me, and hauled me back, and let the man get out of the house with my money; two had hold of me before, and two behind. I saw the man take it out of the hat, put it in his pocket, and go away with it: I never got a farthing of it again; I never saw the man before, nor after he had the money. The landlord of the house hearing a noise, came, the prisoner was standing before me, and would not let me go out; but when the landlord came, I ran out, and fetched the man back to the door; they then all got round me again, brought me into the room, and insisted I should pay the reckoning; the man then ran away: I told them I had no more than a shilling, and threw it down on the table. I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How come these men to know you had so much money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I do not know. The prisoner and Smith used to come to the house where I live; he was acquainted with the man of the house; he knew I had money. I was paid off from his Majesty's sloop the Ferret. They all threatned me after I had paid the reckoning. When the prisoner and I were left, he said, I will go along with you, you will get every farthing of your money again, never fear; he swore, d - n his blood, he would get it all again, that he knew the man; (they called the man that had it 'Squire Johnson) he said he would bring me to where he lived, and said he was a rich man. He brought me to a house, and asked for 'Squire Johnson; the people said, they knew no such man. Then he brought me to another house, there was no such person there. Then he brought me back, and said, perhaps he may be there again; he was not there. Then we came away; and I went into a house as we came through Golden-lane, to enquire for a person: when I came out the prisoner was gone, and I never saw him after, till he was taken up, which was three or four days ago. I got a warrant for an assault, thinking to get my money again. Smith was bailed out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not they gaming when you went in?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the ten guineas put down for a stake?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. Yes, but I saw they did not put down theirs; I seeing their roguery, wanted mine again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the money declared to be won?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No body won at all, there was no declaration who had won; they all said, that man should have the money, after he had taken it away; they forcibly took the money from me, they did not win it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that guinea was not thrown down by Johnson, to be spent?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the prisoner up for an assault?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. I did that, thinking they would return me my money; I was advised to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice they had been playing with you?</p>
               <p>Mackinally. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>We had been drinking plentifully that morning. They had a bottle of gin, they asked me if I would have a dram; said I, I will be a quartern, and we will have a glass together; I sent for it. His wife said, are you going towards Bartholomew-Close? I went and fetched a child's skirt for them to do. They wanted me to stay and dine, I said I could not; said he, then come after dinner, and we will take a walk in the fields. I went, we were both in liquor; as we went along, said he, we will go in here and have some slip; there sat two men and a young gentleman; I never saw them before with my eyes. Smith was going over Moor-fields; said he, I will go with you. The prosecutor would go into the room where these gentlemen were; they were drinking rum and water; I said, let us keep our own company, that is best: he would go in there, we had two pints; after that he said we will have a pipe of tobacco; said I, I must get home; said he, you may stay a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070018"/> bit; I said, I will stay half an hour, with all my heart. They were talking about marrying a girl with a good deal of money; he said, he was just married, but had no money with her. They began to talk of gaming; they tossed up for a shilling, in punch; after that, for another: then we tossed up for five or six shillings, he and I won it; come, said he, will you toss for any more? said I, do not go to gambling, it does not look well; said the other man to him, I will toss with you for half a guinea, and pulled out a guinea; he won that guinea; the young man went out and left his guinea. Said Mackinally, we will have that among us. When the young gentleman came in, he said, where is my guinea? said I, it is safe enough, I have put it in my box; said Mackinally, what did you tell him for? Then they goes to gaming for ten guineas; he said, he would put it in no body's hands but mine, because he knew me; I laid it down upon the table, and would have no connection with it. Said he, this man has money enough, we can have some before we go: I said, you may do as you please; said he, you shall hold it; so I did; the gentleman put his money in my other hand: the gentleman won the ten guineas. Said Mackinally, I do not mind it, I shall win it again; said I, I will go and leave you; will you? said he; I said I will. The gentleman put down 10 guineas again, and Mackinally put down eight; I told it over, and said, he has put down ten, and here are but eight: I took out one guinea, and he took it out of my hand; I said, here is now but seven: he lost that; then I said, this is your own fault. He began to rave and tear, ready to knock my head off; I said, it is your fault. Said I, I shall drink none of your losings, I have some drink of my own; said he, d - n it, I can go home and get some more; said I, do not go home alone, I will go with you; on that he got up and said, G - d d - n him, I can lick him well, and take my money again; said I, do not go to fight: they went out, and were going to fight, and I persuaded him not to fight; said he, Simpson, I do not value my money, if I can but lick him well; the man was gone. I went to every house with Mackinally going home, to see if I could find him.</p>

               <p>Willet. I do not remember there were. I went to serve my customers, and heard a noise. I came in and said, Gentlemen, what are you about? Said the prosecutor, I have lost my money, and the man is ran away with it.</p>

I desired her to stay at the stall, while I went to look after Simpson. I went home, but Mr. Bell was not at home, so I returned to the stall.

When I came home that day, the girl was crying: I said what is the matter? she said she had lost a quarter of a guinea. I said, I suppose, you have been at some of your tricks again; said she, here has been Simpson, and I suppose he has took it. I said, did you see him take it? she said, she saw him lay his arm upon the dresser, but did not see him take it. I was going to light a candle to look in the cellar, there being cracks; she said, you need not light a candle to see in the cellar, for I have looked in every place in the cellar. I never knew the prisoner to be guilty of such a thing in my life. She and I went in pursuit of the prisoner that night, but could not find him; he came the next morning to know what was the matter; I said, Jack, there is a 5 s. and 3 d. lost, if you know any thing of it, let her have it, and I will give you a 5 s. and 3 d.

The deceased, Mr. William Pimlot, had chambers on the ground, on the left hand of mine; when I am in my own chamber, I think they are No. 4. As to the day I can't recollect, it was on Sunday evening. I came home about twelve at night; (I speak of the night that Mr. Pimlot was killed; I heard of his death next morning as soon as I got up.) I went into my chamber and lock'd the door; I don't know whether I went to bed immediately or not; I believe I did not stay above half an hour. I believe I had not been in bed above half an hour, before I heard a great rapping at the Inn. I could not distinguish at what chamber; I thought it was in my own stairs; I got up and went to my own chamber door, and

             the inner door to me; then I opened my shutter, and shov'd up the window; I heard a talking. I saw a woman come out of Mr. Pimlot's stair-case. I think she was cursing and swearing at the time; saying, she would see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention her own words as near as you can.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. She swore I will see you, or you shall see me; I believe she said both: she went round to the end of his chamber, which was out of my sight; I apprehend to that window where his bed-chamber was: I heard a window immediately break, as though somebody struck it with their hand; I heard the glass as plain as ever I did any thing in my life; after that she came away, swearing that he should see her in the morning. I saw her come from that part and go out of the Inn: she went towards the gate for Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what woman that was?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. I could not be particular as to the woman, I could not distinguish her face; I really do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. I went to bed, and the next morning I heard this accident had happened; which alarmed me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you hear any thing from within the chamber?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070023"/>Carpenter. No I could not, I went to the window and saw it was broke. Then I went to inquire into the circumstances of the affair; and mentioned what I heard in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was broke?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. It was one pane of glass, in Mr. Pimlot's window: I believe that window was next to his bed-chamber; but I never was in his chamber.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the liberty of the Rolls. On the 14th of November, being Monday, in the morning about half an hour after one o'clock, I was in Weeden street, I heard watch called.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Weeden-street?</p>
               <p>Sowens. That is a little street that comes into Chancery-lane. I said, who calls watch? I do, said Mr. Pimlot, follow me. I followed him into Chancery lane; she cross'd the way towards Simonds's Inn coffee house, which is at the corner of Simonds's Inn; he was alone at a little distance; I saw a woman upon a loitering order, she staid a little; he said, Watch, take charge of that woman, it was the prisoner: she was standing at a small distance; the words were scarce out of his mouth, before she flew to him with her right hand, and gave him a push under his left breast.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance was she before she flew to him?</p>
               <p>Sowens. She was about five or six yards distance from him; I seized her right hand, and said, you strike, madam, you break the king's peace, I'll take you to the watch-house; I took hold of her, she said, for God's sake do not squeeze me so hard, I will go with you. The deceased turned round to the left, and said, Here, watchman, take this, delivering to me this knife. (Producing a small clas penknife, the blade about two inches long, with a sharp point, with some appearance of blood upon it.) He proceeded to the watch-house, and I followed him close with the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance from the watch-house, when she gave him that push?</p>
               <p>Sowens. It was betwixt eighty and ninety yards. I had the woman by the left arm, when I came up to the watch-house, I said to the beadle, Sir, here is a charge; that gentleman has charged this woman. I then saw the blade of the penknife was partly all over bloody, fresh blood. Sir, said I, here is a knife, the beadle took it, and laid it on the mantlepiece. The deceased went across the room, about four or five yards, and set down in the constable's chair, and pulled up his cloaths, and laid his belly all naked; there I saw a wound plain enough on his left side. He never said a word as I heard, after he said (Here, watchman, take this) he flung his cloaths open and leaned his head; his shirt had a very deep bosom, that also was bloody; the blood was fuming out of the wound as new beer out of a bottle: the prisoner clapt her hands together, and said, Oh, Mr. Wilson! it was I that did it, it was I that did it! And I think she said, send for a surgeon. Then I imediately went for Mr. Minors, the surgeon; two of his people came. When they came, he was dead; they came in less than a quarter of an hour; to the best of my knowledge, that was some minutes before two o'clock. Then the prisoner was sent to Clerkenwell New-Prison; the constable, Mr. Robinson, went with me. At the prison-gate, he got out of the coach, in order to have the door open. I said to her as we were in the coach, Madam, was it before the watch was called or after, that this rash action was committed? She held up her hands, Oh after, said she.</p>

               <p>Court. Begin where the watchman said, I have got a charge.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I was in the watch-house alone, the door was half open when he spoke; I threw the door open immediately; there I saw the deceased and the watchman, with the prisoner under his arm; he said, that gentleman charges this woman; upon this the deceased went across the room, seemingly as if nothing ailed him; I took the woman by the arm, and set her down on a bench on the other side. Said the watchman, the gentleman gave me this knife. I clapt it down on the mantlepiece; I turned round with a design to ask the gentleman, what the woman had done; there, to my great surprize, I saw he had opened his breast; I saw the wound. Lord have mercy, said I; what have you done? get a surgeon: Oh, said she, get a surgeon. Mr. Wilson, I did it. He had a deep bosom to his shirt, deep enough to shew the wound; it was bleeding. I did not examine the shirt, but I saw a hole in his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was it?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It was a wound just as if a pig had been stuck. It appeared in a different shape, when the blood was coming out than what it did after he was dead: It appeared as if it had been done by a knife. When I said, send for a surgeon, she said, Mr. Wilson, it was I that have done it; get a surgeon, and save my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070024"/> dear Pimlot. She spoke of it several times, and seemed to be in a very bad taking. She said, I do not want to screen myself; get a surgeon to save my dear Pimlot.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by her saying, she did not want to screen herself?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I understood it, that she meant she would not run away, if I went for a surgeon. She repeated that several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he might live after he came into the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I believe, there might be breath in him about seven minutes after he sat down in the chair; he died like a young child going to sleep, not an eye nor a hand, or any thing stirred; he never stirred hand or foot; he died without any stirring; he never spoke in the watch-house. His dying thus made it very hard to know when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the knife?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did. It was bloody. The prisoner desired me to give her leave to kiss him; she went across the room and kissed him, and said, My dear Pimlot, I shall never see you more.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night at that time, I was out when the deceased came in, the two young surgeons were there when I came in, which was about a quarter of an hour after two o'clock; the deceased was dead at that time. The surgeons probed the wound, and measured the probe to the blade of the knife, and said, it just answered to it. I saw the wound, they took the penknife to match to the hole, and it did match. I said to the prisoner, did you do it; she said, she did, twice over. She said it several times. We got a coach and went with her to New-Prison; I asked her to tell her name, she refused to tell it. I was got out at the prison door, she seemed to be in a great deal of trouble; she rang her hands, but said nothing. The watchman was in the coach with her, while I knocked at the door. I did not hear what past then.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Chancery-Lane; I was called out between one and two that morning; I being ill and could not go, sent my pupil and my apprentice; they returned soon after, and said, the gentleman was dead. The next evening I was sent for to open the body. I found a wound in the interior ventricle of the heart, which I apprehend to be the immediate cause of his death. I could not possibly form any judgment what kind of instrument it was done with; I traced the wound from the integument into the heart. It was between the fifth and sixth rib on the left side; it had the appearance of a small wound; (a wound will contract after given) it was larger internally than externally; it had the appearance as if given by a knife, or sharp instrument; it had not gone to the opposite side, it had only just penetrated the interior ventricle of the heart.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was it from the outward part of the body?</p>
               <p>Minors. It was three or four inches; if the heart was beating to that side the body at the time the blow was given, the knife need not have reached so far as three or four inches to get at the heart. I believe, that wound to be the cause of his death.</p>

The three prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070025"/> in company with another, were on the inside near a dunghill consulting together; just as I came about a yard past them, one of them knocked me down; when I fell, two of them laid hold of my arms and kept me down, while the other two rifled my pockets; they took all I had out, and turned my pockets wrong side out. I had a guinea in gold, and 6 s. in silver, in one pocket, and half a guinea and 9 s. in silver in the other; I had borrowed a 27 s. piece in the morning and had changed it. Then they all ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any weapons?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I saw none they had, I believe it was with a fist; I am lame of one leg, and I am soon knocked down. They did not speak a word to me, nor I to them. Only one of them, said, when they were rifling me, Knock the old dog on the head. I got up and had an iron needle in my hand, which we use in casing of rabits; I flung it after them, but it touched none of them. I met Fennell the next morning about eight o'clock in Cow-Cross, and laid hold of him. I got assistance, and took him before Justice Girdler; there he confessed the fact. Provided the Justice would give him a little time to inform him where the others were, the other two should be taken in five or six days. He told where they were, and they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before?</p>
               <p>Kelly. No, I did not, but it being day light, I saw them and knew them. I lay on my back, and saw them while they were robbing me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the other two?</p>
               <p>Kelly. The keeper of New-Prison did, I believe, on the information of Fennell. I never got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Kelly. I called out as loud as I could, but nobody came to my assistance, there was nobody near, there were no houses near, but Cow-Houses.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, this man was much in liquor, he sat down to ease himself and fell backwards; the money fell out of his pocket, I picked it up and gave it him, and he gave me a shilling; I had a child with me, he gave that two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you fuddled or sober?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was as sober as I am now, my pocket was tight, my money could not fall out.</p>

               <p>Rosanna Martin. I live facing the ruins near Chick-Lane, I take in washing and needlework; I was looking out of my own room window and saw the prosecutor sitting to ease himself I suppose, and the money fell out of his pocket. I saw some silver, I cannot say how much, the lad picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any gold?</p>
               <p>Rosanna Martin. No, I saw no gold; he said to the lad, if he would return it again, he would give him a shilling; he returned it, and the man gave him a shilling; the lad went from the ruins with a child. The man was very fuddled, he was up and down the place better than an hour after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Fennell going?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. I believe he was going to carry a child to his master. He is a neighbour's child. I should not know the others that were with him; there were several boys there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boys?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. I believe there might be ten or a dozen; but I know none of them. I cannot say, I saw the other two lads. I saw the prosecutor fall all along.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Fennell?</p>
               <p>R. Martin. His mother takes in scowering. My window faces the place; it is not half a stone's cast distance.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker; and live in Fleet-Street. On the 24th of October, about eight or nine in the morning, the prisoner brought this watch, and wanted a guinea upon it. I asked him several questions; he told me, he gave 50 s. for it to a gentleman's servant. The day following, it was advertised. On the Saturday following, the prisoner came to me, and wanted half a guinea more on it; I told him, I could not advance any more upon it, and kept him, while I sent for a constable. On the Monday, I took him before the Sitting Alderman, at Guildhall, there I produced the watch, and the prosecutor owned it. (Produced, and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

            . I keep the Barley-Mow, in Milford-Lane. Mr. M'Carty came to my house a little after three in the morning, on the 24th of October; he seemed very much in liquor; I offered him a bed; he chose to sit and sleep by the tap-room fire. The prisoner and three others came in about an hour and half before this thing happened. The prisoner sat down next to the prosecutor, on his right hand. A neighbour came in about a quarter after six, for a pint of beer; going down for it, I was call'd to, to make it a pot; in the time I was gone to make it a pot, the prisoner's company were gone. An old watchman was just come in from off his duty; I asked him, where they were gone? he said, he knew not, they were all run out together. I went and awakened M'Carty, knowing him before he had used my house. I had seen his watch chain hang down, as he sat sleeping. Just before I went to draw the beer, I asked him, if he had got his watch? he felt, and found it was gone: we thought it was that company that had taken it. I took up the prisoner that morning, about eleven o'clock, and went for a constable to search him; he owned he had pawned it for another man; and that he had a 5 s. 3 d. or a 4 s. 6 d. of the money.</p>

I saw Mr. M'Carty much in liquor, bruised about his face, and two girls by him. Being in a hurry to do a job for myself under the gate-way, one of the men came out to me, we went on, and coming down Fleet-Street, he said, he wished he had some money, and desired I would pawn his watch. I came to this gentleman's house, I went in with it, and had a guinea upon it; after that, as I was going into Butcher-Row, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070027"/> took me in hold, and the other man, that I had the watch of, ran away.</p>

When I took Bailey up, she had my bonnet on. She said, she would go with me to the place where they were sold: she went with me to the bottom of Rag-Fair, where I found Bailey sitting by the woman's fire-side, who bought the things. When I charged her, she began to behave very impudent. I charged the watch with her and Gold; they were brought to Guild-hall.

            . I keep the Red Lion, in Black Lyon Yard. I know but little of the prisoner. I remember a man, and he came into my house: the man had a bag with a parcel of old things to be sold, he shot them out upon the table, after they had agreed; I bought a pair of leather breeches for my little boy. There were some green things, they looked to be setts of curtains, four or five pieces of them, (the green vallance produced) such as these. The man pulled out some neckcloths, and handkerchiefs from his pocket, they were talking about changing. I was backwards and forwards in the house. I saw the prisoner take the things that he bargained for; I cannot say these are the same pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Sherbone. I think this was the 22d or 23d of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think it was one of them days?</p>
               <p>Sherbone. Because, the prisoner's wife came to my house, and desired me, if ever that man came to my house again, to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did she come?</p>

I asked the man what he did there; he said he wanted a man called Mahogany. I said, what is he? he said a coachman. I said there was no such man in the yard. I went down the ride, (it is a livery stable) there I found a hat. I bid the watchman lay hold of the man. It was the prisoner. I went a little lower and found two stable doors broke open; one of them was mine. I went home and fetched my servant,

            . He came, and opened the corn bin, and found his silver shoe buckles were gone. We found a large poker in the yard. I asked the prisoner if he had the buckles, to the best of my knowledge, he said, no. We took him to the watch-house, and searched him. We found a pair of shoes in his pocket, not finding any thing else, we insisted on stripping him. Upon throwing down his cloaths, we heard something knock against the floor. One buckle fell out of the lining of his coat, and I took the other out. (Produced in court.) I think he said he found the buckles on the road.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cooper. I look after his horse. These buckles are mine. They were in the corn bin, in my master's stable, in Catharine-Wheel-yard. I left them there the 23d of Oct. in the corn bin, and they were missing the 25th, at night. I locked the door of the stable. It appeared the door had been broke; the staple was wrenched off, and the lock thrown on the dunghill.</p>

               <p>I went to a club, in Russel-street. I wanted a man that lives in that yard. I was going down the yard, and met a man, just coming out of it. I went on, and found a pair of shoes, a hat, and a pair of buckles, together. I put the buckles in my pocket, and went to ease myself upon the dunghill. I know no more of them than the child unborn. The coachman I wanted is gone over to Ireland with his master.</p>

He went and stood behind a water-trunk, that joins to the board where the goose lay; he reached over the outside and took the goose, and was walked round the side of the shop. I ran and laid hold of him, and stopped him.</p>

I observed he was looking at what he could get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070032"/> instead of looking at the people as they came by. He snatched hold of my watch chain and got my watch out; I got hold of his arm, and said, D - n you, you rascal, you have got my watch; I clapped my hand behind him, intending to get hold of my watch: some of his confederates behind him, I imagine, took it. It was gone: then he opened his bosom, and said, Search me. I took him by the collar and drawed him down towards the Old Bailey, and called constable, but could get none. I took him to Bridewell. There was a woman that appeared before my Lord Mayor when we were there, that swore she saw the prisoner draw my watch out of my pocket. I went to her last Friday, there were two Jews, who, I imagine, have inviegled her not to appear. (The prisoner is a Jew.)

I got up about three o'clock in the morning and observed the bar door open, and the till was gone. I looked about and missed another drawer and some punch bowls. I found the window was burst open, the sash was up, and the shutter open, and the bolt was on the bench on the inside the window. It was an inside bolt, wrenched off. I missed silver and half-pence, about 10 s. of each. I missed eleven china punch bowls. On the day before I saw the money; and, I imagine, there were more than I mention. Three weeks after I was robbed, I had two of my punch bowls brought to me:

I felt a hand in my pocket. I turned suddenly round, and found the prisoner taking it out of my pocket. I saw his hand drawing with something in it, which, in appearance, was a handkerchief, but it being lamp-light, I could not distinguish it to be mine. He had a very quick motion with his hand, as I have seen gentlemen exercise dexterity of hand. It was in a moment gone. I immediately seized him by the coat, and led him three or four doors to a fishmonger's; I had first felt and missed my handkerchief. There was only one person near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070033"/> me, he was on the other side, and by circumstances was his comrade. He was a young man, seemingly about twenty. He was about a yard from me. I sent for a coach and took the prisoner to the Compter; I desired he might be searched, but nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain whether he took your handkerchief or not?</p>
               <p>Elderton. I can take upon me to swear, the prisoner's hand was in my pocket, and I seized his hand as it was rising up from my pocket, and I felt something go out, and I found my handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Elderton. I believe I had it about three minutes before. I had put it down to the bottom of my pocket, and buttoned my pocket. When he was in the Compter, he petitioned I would use my endeavour to get him sent to the East-Indies, saying he should be transported: he said he had rather go to the East-Indies than be transported, or words to that effect. I went to my Lord Mayor and found it could not be done.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Fleet-street, between the hours of seven and eight. I walked pretty fast. I was a little a-head of the gentleman. He endeavoured to get by me. He immediately seized me by the collar, and with his left hand got me by my left hand, and took me into a fishmonger's shop: he looked upon the ground, and could not find his handkerchief: then he said he supposed I might have swallowed it, as men do cups and balls. I was never nigh his pocket.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and deceased, just before they set-to to fight. They fought for a wager.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any quarrel?</p>
               <p>Roberts. They were drinking together the over-night, on the 6th of September. I was not present when the wager was laid. The deceased fought the prisoner a guinea to his half guinea. I was with them the morning they fought, at the Three Jolly Batchers, in White Cross-street. That was Wednesday the 7th, at about eleven o'clock. They went out of the house to a ruinous sort of a place. They shook hands and stripped, and set to fighting. they fought some time. There were a great many people there. They broke in and shoved people about when the deceased was down; before he could get up again, they shoved people over him. I was obliged to take the poor man away. I said to the deceased, will you fight any more? yes, said he, I will fight again. They went in and fought again as long as he could: he laid down, and said he could fight no more: I tried to lift him up, he said, let me lay; and they were the last words I ever heard him speak. We got a chair and carried him to the public house where we came out of, and kept him there some time. Then we got a coach, thinking him a dead man, and took him home to his friends, in Peter-street, Clerkenwell parish; we got him to bed, and went up to the same house where we took him from, and in about an hour we had news come that he was taken to the hospital. I went to the hospital the same day, about six in the evening. He never spoke a word after the words, Let me lay. I saw him just before he died. The prisoner was at the public house when news was brought in by a young fellow that he was dead. The prisoner jumped up in a sort of brave manner, and said, D - n his eyes, I should not have fought, unless I had thought of killing of him. I jumped up and laid hold of him by the collar, and said, Mr. Knight you ought to be confined, I will take care of you till a proper officer comes. A young fellow said, he is not dead, but he is all but dead: then I let the prisoner go, and we ran to the hospital, and just saw him alive, and he expired immediately. I went up the street after the prisoner: he was at a public house with a great many of his acquaintance that behaved very bad at the fight. They said, Roberts, you have no business with it, let him go; the people said to me, you make yourself very busy; so I let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070034"/>Roberts. I believe he was not drunk. He had been at public houses.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the public house before they went to fight?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner want the deceased to wave the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner offer the deceased a shilling, if he would give up the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear the deceased say, he would not take 10 s. and 5 s. 3 d. for the wager?</p>
               <p>Roberts. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the father of the deceased at the fight?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not encourage his son to fight longer than he chose?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I did not see the father till I got the young fellow away, and they made out the ring again.</p>

            . I saw the fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how they came to fight?</p>
               <p>Bridges. No, I do not know how they came to fight: Roberts and I came together, after it was over. I heard the prisoner d - n his eyes and say, he would not have fought him, unless he thought to have killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there before they fought?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I was there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour before. I saw them going to fight. I did not see any foul play.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the deceased, Ball, being taken out of the ring?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I do; he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who persuaded him to go back?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I do not know who persuaded him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any words the deceased said?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I remember he said, Let me lay. The last words he said were, Let me lay. We took him to the public house, and from thence we carried him in a coach home. I went in the coach with him. He bled all the way he went from his mouth and left eye and ears. He did not speak in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I had hold of his left-hand when he died. He could not speak then. I, and a person that is not here, and Mr. Burgess, apprehended the prisoner. The people that belonged to him, of his own sort, came round us, and was rescued from us. We were obliged to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bridges. He is a tin-men by trade. When we told him Bob was dead; he said, he would knock my eye out. I told him I would not fight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. I am a pupil to Mr. Young in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I was not there when the deceased was brought in, he had been there about an hour before I came in; he was dead, I examined the body, and found several bruises, especially on his left eye. In all probability he died in an hour after he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the body?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. The coroner did not require it, therefore we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodcar. I judge, from the report we received, that as he was in full health before that time, that he died of the bruises and hurt he had then received. The eye was entirely closed when I came.</p>

            . I was going down White-Cross Street upon business. I saw a great mob in the Street, and a parcel of women said, the rogue will kill the man, there is such a mob about him. I asked what was the matter, they told me they were fighting down in the back ruins; I went down and into the ring. They broke very near me; Bell was down and the prisoner upon him; the prisoner's second pulled him up; just as he got up, his left foot kicked the deceased in the breast; I spoke of it; some that belonged to him said, what business had I with it? and told me I deserved a good licking. I got out of the ring; after that I saw them bring Bell up to a wall, there he stood as though he was dying, (they were both strangers to me) I said, Gentlemen, do not let them fight again, for I believe that man is dying. I kept out of the ring, hearing the prisoner had a very bad company belonged to him; presently they carried the deceased into a public-house, and I went in; the man seemed to be a dying.</p>

            . I saw the beginning of it, I keep the public-house; it was the night of a chair-club, a three-pence half-penny club. On the 6th of September, the night before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070035"/> fight, the chairman did not behave so well as he should do; there was 2 s. and 3 d. half-penny missing; the deceased said, it was a very bad thing, so words arose: I was the loser of it. I said to the deceased, never mind it. Knight took the chairman's part; the chairman was a journeyman watch-maker. The prisoner was bragging, and said he could lick Ball. Ball said, what signifies what he says? I said, do not mind what he says. Said Anderson to Ball, I will back you, if you will fight him; they wanted to put their money into my hands. I would not take it. I said to Knight, what signifies fighting now, fight to-morrow; he went out naked, and I kept him out a quarter of an hour, and said, I would not let him in, unless he would be quiet. Then another would back the prisoner, for half a guinea, they aggrivated the deceased, and he said, he would fight a guinea to half a guinea. The bet was made, and they agreed to meet the next day, by ten o'clock, or lose their money; they put some money down, I know not how much. They came and fought down a packthread ground the next day, they neither of them drank much, they drank nothing at all to signify. I did not go down with them, only a butcher came and said, let us go down and see them fight; we were there just before they set too. I saw them strip.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they fight?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe, first and last, they might fight two or three and twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they fight before the ring broke in?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I believe they might fight six or seven minutes before that, the prisoner then had the worst of it to my thinking. Then there was a great mob; the ring broke again, sometimes they fought higgledy-piggledy, that a body could not see rightly. The prisoner was out of the ring while they made a fair ring again, but where he stood the while I cannot tell; I kept my own place, they set too again and there was a fall, and Ball could not get up any more, he was left behind. They asked me if I would let him come to my house? I let him. They brought him in, he had not strength to suck a lemon. I poured some vinegar down his throat, thinking that would break the clod of blood, that he might have got by straining himself in going to heave the prisoner. I ordered my maid to make the bed, and ordered my wife to get some white-wine whey made; there were a good many friends of his in the room; we persuaded the father to have a coach, and get him home. His father got a coach, and I lent him a blanket to take him away in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the prisoner said, when he heard the man was dead?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The prisoner came in and wanted some beer to be drawn, and swore and blasted. I would not let him have any: he said. You old dog, I never fought a man, but what I intended to kill him, and blasted, and talked of fighting me; then I went and got a poker, and ordered him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Ball called a fighting man?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I never saw Ball fight in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner want to be off the wager in the morning?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I said to Ball, be ruled by me, and forfeit the money; he is too young for you. Said Ball, I am almost sure of winning, and I will fight him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear the prisoner say, he was willing not to fight?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I did hear the prisoner say to the people, they might do as they please, he would fight or not fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Who persuaded Ball to fight the second time?</p>
               <p>Hudson. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, in Bishopsgate-street. (He produced thirteen pieces of muslins and lawns.) Mrs. Perkins pawned these with me at different times. The 28th of March next will be two years since she brought some of them: the last was about November was twelvemonths. She used to tell me she brought them for one Mr. Scott in Hoxton-market-place, a man that deals in drapery.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. All these pieces I can swear to: there are my marks upon them all. This pawnbroker has three times as many, which I left, they not having my marks on them; I do not swear to them, but I think they are mine. I have seen Kelly in my shop within this month.</p>
               <p>Q. to Delafore. To what amount might Perkins and you have dealt thus?</p>
               <p>Delafore. I believe we may have dealt to the amount of about 20 l. Egan was never in my shop but once, and that was with Perkins; then she brought seventeen yards of muslin. She said it was worth 9 s. a yard. I lent her 3 l. 8 s. upon it. She told me that was Mr. Scott's. Egan never said a word: she said he wanted money to make up a bill.</p>

The deceased catched seven birds out of nine, that came over a hedge; he catched them with twigs. Williams sent a boy to spoil his twigs; that boy was named Sharp, he was helping the prisoner. Cunningham attempted to push Sharp down the bank: his twigs were upon the bank. Sharp spoiled some of his twigs.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was Sharp?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was a great deal bigger than me. He began to beat Cunningham with a stick. Cunningham then went and sat down upon Williams's nets, because he should not get any more birds. Williams came and talked with him. The boy would not get off. He talked with him near ten minutes: then he hit him three or four times with a stick, and kicked him.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the stick?</p>
               <p>Robinson. It was as thick as my thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part did he kick him?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He kicked him on the private parts: he kicked him but once. Then Cunningham came away to us: then he and I came home. He complained very much of his back. I saw no more of him till after he was dead, which was about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any bruises upon him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I saw none, but on his groin; he was very black, and swelled very large.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Williams, when you went away.</p>
               <p>Robinson. We left him in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain Williams kicked the deceased?</p>

I went again at night and brought him out of the fits. He was the next day in very great pain. All he said was, O my belly! O my belly! not a word how it was done, nor who did it. Upon searching him, I found a rupture: one testicle was swelled, and very black. He died on the 12th of November. I really believe he died of that rupture.</p>

            . I am father to the deceased: he told me Williams set Sharp to beat him, and he did beat him; and after that Williams came and beat him with a stick. I asked my boy why he did not tell me sooner? He said Williams kicked him in the groin, and he lay about a quarter of an hour in the grass before he could recover himself. He said Sharp hit him once or twice with a stick.</p>

             hit him with a stick once or twice. I asked him if any body else did? Yes, said he, old Williams hurt me in my groin; and I was afraid to tell my father, lest he should be angry. Sharp came to my son said, God bless you! God bless you! And a little after that, he cryed out, Old Williams! old Williams! Sharp kneeled down and asked my son's pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Robinson. Are you sure he did not kick the deceased?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I am certain sure he did not; nor did he offer to lift his foot up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Williams at the time?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I was about an hundred yards from him when he kicked the deceased. I am sure I saw him kick him in the groin. Cunningham came immediately to me, and we went home together. He lay on the grass, and cried murder several times for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Sharp beat him was it that he went to William's nets?</p>
               <p>Robinson. About a quarter of an hour after.</p>

               <p>Just before the deceased's death Robinson was sent for: he then, upon oath, said I was not the person that kicked the lad, but it was the other lad with them.</p>

               <p>Robinson. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it you now say he did?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Because the little boy that was with me, bid me say so.</p>

               <p>I did not know of my son's leaving his place, till he came home; when he said, Mother, I have found a spoon; I asked him, where? he said, in Turn-again-Lane. I chided him for it. I never found him guilty of stealing any thing in my life.</p>

            . The woman at the bar was a lodger with me about three months to the time this happened. The boy came home on the Friday, and left his basket upon the table. She said, what is this boy come away for? I cannot think what is the matter! A lad that was there, said, he believed he was in at the Baptist's head. When he came in, his mother said, now come along, and let us go to your master; the boy said, my master is not in the way, if I do; I will go with you to-morrow. He again said, come along, mother, I have found something; she said, what is it? he shewed her a spoon. Where did you find it? said she; said he, I found it in Sea-coal Lane. Then she said, I will go and get you a pair of shoes, and you shall go to your master in the morning.</p>

The prisoner came into my shop the 25th of October, about ten or eleven in the forenoon; he wanted to see a pair of black stocking breeches; I shewed him a pair: he went to the end of the compter in order to try them on. At the end of the compter there lay some Bath-coting, and some other things: they did not fit him; I reached him another pair, he said they did not; then I reached another: then he walked out with a pair, in order to show me that they did not come high enough on the hip. Then he said, as they did not fit him, he would call again in an hour: as he was stooping to buckle his shoes. I observed something bulky on his back part: I laid hold of his coat, (he had two coats on) I said, what have you got here? You have something that you should not have: he said no, I have nothing at all. I said, you have made a great mistake; let me see what it is. With some difficulty I got to the bell, and rang for my people to come down; I being a constable, thought proper not to act on my own account. I sent for another officer, I was obliged to let go the piece to ring the bell, and then he let it drop; I found, when I had hold of the end of it, part of it was in the waistband of his breeches, and great part hung out. (Produced and deposed to.) It lay upon a shelf on the same side he was on, beyond the compter about a yard and quarter from the place were he was trying the breeches, before he took it.</p>

The prisoner said, he pulled it from himself, and that he did not know how it came into his breeches: he offered to make the prosecutor a present of two guineas, if he would not take him before a magistrate: Mr. Ament said, he would not take any thing, he should take what the law allowed.</p>

I stood still, and said not a word; he took hold of the cloth and called for assistance; I was with my breeches half on and half off; he called his people down, and gave charge of me; and sent for a constable: the constable said, it was impossible I could put them in my breeches; he insisted upon holding me; I said I would not be held; he was taking me before a justice; I said then, I would have a coach; then I said, I would give two guineas for any of my relations to be there, to see how ill I had been used; when I came before the justice, I did not know whether I was dead or alive, I was so surprized; I was sent from thence to Clerkenwell Bridwell.</p>

I left my money in the bag, on a locker in the window, there was 40 l. of it. I had just told it. I came up again in a minute; I am sure I was not above.

After she was gone, she came again dress'd in gauze and a black apron, and other things, with a new gown; then I thought about my money; I looked in my bag and mist two guineas; and I mist a silk and linen handkerchief out of my drawers. I took her up, and heard her say she took two guineas out of the bag as it lay in the window. he said, she lost one of the handkerchiefs, and left the other at the place were she was gone to live.</p>

I screamed out murder, for God's sake; he roiled me about, and made me very dirty. He run away at last, and a gentleman catched hold of him.</p>
