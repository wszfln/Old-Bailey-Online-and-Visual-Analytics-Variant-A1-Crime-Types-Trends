               <p>Was it near the high road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any path? - No path, Sir, that I saw, while one stopped to ease himself, the other took me to the corner of the field that looked over the hedge, and said we cannot get over here, and then we went by this man that was doing his occasions, I said that is a nice place for you, then the prisoner took me up to this corner, I said this is a comical place to carry me to for lodgings, upon my saying that, the prisoner immediately

               <p>Where did you travel from? - From the Coach and Horses at Ilford.</p>

               <p>Had you travelled with the prisoner also? - No, I never saw him before the evening that the mischief was done.</p>


               <p>Where did the prisoner join the other man? - At the White Swan, somewhere in London, almost over against Rag-fair, then the prisoner tied my hands, and the other stood at my head, and the prisoner swore he would cut my throat from ear to ear; and just as they had done tying my hands, there happened to be a gardner come up to the hedge at the instant, and he said, what are you after; and I said, for the Lord's sake, come and help me, and they both run away, and he run after them, and would have taken them, but they turned again, and he took me up, and brought me to his master's.</p>
               <p>Was you robbed when you was upon the ground? - When I was upon the ground, they took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Before the gardner came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which took the watch out of your pocket? - It was the prisoner I think.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any money? - No, I lost no money, I never got my watch again.</p>
               <p>When was this prisoner taken up? - The month after.</p>
               <p>Where was he taken? - In Wapping.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night or a dark night? - It was darkish, it was not over light, nor over dark when the mischief was done, one could not see a great way.</p>

               <p>On that evening about six o'clock I heard the prosecutor crying out for help in a field near Mr. Wells's ground in Bethnall-green, I went to the man's assistance, I came to the hedge and I saw two men upon one, I said halloo, and immediately they both got up and run away, I jumped over the hedge and ran after them; when I came to them, they turned upon me, one with a cutlass, and the other with a stick of some sort.</p>
               <p>Which had the cutlass? - I cannot say which, it was rather dark, so I turned back again; they said they would do for me if I did not go away, I came back and picked the man up, and had him home, and washed his wounds, and had him to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Was he much wounded? - Yes, my Lord, he had several cuts over the backs of his hands, and three or four on his head, and one on his leg.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How long was you in the hospital? - I have been there ever since.</p>
               <p>Are not you cured? - I am from under the doctor's hands at present, but not discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Strong. Have you any recollection of that prisoner? - No, I cannot swear to him, it was too dark to swear to him.</p>

            ; if you are satisfied (and he has told you that he was sober, and so the witness Strong says) that he is not mistaken in the man, and that this prisoner was one of the men who committed this robbery upon him, there can then be no sort of doubt of the verdict you must give; the only consideration with you is, whether, as it rests intirely on his single evidence, you will think that sufficient; now you find in the first place, he was perfectly sober, in the next place he had been in company with this man for two or three hours before, it was not an accidental casual meeting of a moment or two, as is frequently the case when a robbery is committed, he had eaten and drank with him, and he positively swears that he never had been out of his company so as to lose sight of him; you find too,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100005"/> that through Strong cannot confirm him as to swearing positively to the man himself, he very cautiously and properly declines that being so dark, and having only that momentary opportunity of seeing him, which is generally the case; yet he confirms Spicer in this, that one of the men had a cutlass and one had a smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man says, he was in my company so many hours, he must certainly know whether I had a hanger about me or no.</p>
               <p>Court. As to that gentlemen, we know very well that these kind of men do carry their cutlasses about them concealed under their coats, if you have served on Juries here before, I dare say you must have seen that they carry them loose within the coat, without a scabbard, and it is by no means impossible that the man might have sat with him for hours, and not have discovered this; it may however have some weight with you, but if you think he is clear as to the man, and there is no mistake at all in it, then to be sure there can be no doubt at all of the case: but if you have any doubt you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Council for the Prosecution. You mean as to the officers of justice, you cannot mean as to Mrs. Bond, and Miss Bond.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan, Prisoner's Council. I am very sorry to insist upon it, but I am so instructed.</p>

               <p>I have belonged to Sir John Fielding's Office many years, I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday the 16th of November, about eight in the morning; I produce two bits that were taken out of the prisoner's pocket: I took the prisoner up one pair of stairs backwards in Princes-street, he was in bed, he got out of bed and opened the door, and he had a black handkerchief tied round his head for a night-cap; the woman prisoner was in bed with him, he got into bed again, I desired him to get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Court. He knew you, I suppose? - Yes, my Lord, we are well acquainted one with another; I then searched his breeches pocket, and there I found a half guinea, some silver, and the two foreign bits which I have now produced; he then dressed himself, and he had a brown close bodied coat, such a one as mine, splashed up to the shoulders; we went to him from a particular information, which I hope your lordship will not enquire into; in the fore-room, in a little closet, I found these boots wet.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose lodgings were these? - I cannot tell, and by the side of the fire-place lay these spurs, the leather of which was wet, there was a whip in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you distinguish between town dirt and country dirt on this occasion; I think I have heard you do so on other occasions? - That must be left to the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. That is too nice.</p>
               <p>(The bits produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are like the pieces that were in my purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you believe these are some of the pieces that were in your purse? - I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Mr. Sheridan. Here are two more that are pretty like them, I believe, Madam, do you recollect them also, (showing her two other bits) you have no particular mark on them? - No, I have had them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100007"/> for some time, I have used them as common marking pieces instead of counters.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no distinguishing these unless there was a particular mark.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was the man that robbed you and took the purse from you and your daughter a tall man or a short man? - He was on horseback, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had he boots on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he a whip in his hand? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What did the other man do while the prisoner robbed you? - He stood on my daughter's side; my daughter and myself delivered our purses to this man.</p>
               <p>It was light enough to discern his countenance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you know his voice? - I would not venture to swear.</p>
               <p>Did he seem to use his own voice or a feigned voice? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But you swear positively to his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You did not state it as a positive fact that he had a round hat on? - It was a round hat he had on.</p>
               <p>You say he had a dark great coat on? - Yes, a dark coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Jealous. Was the coat you found a great coat? - No, my Lord, such a one as mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutrix. You said it was light enough to distinguish objects? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it harder to distinguish objects or features? - I could distinguish the men.</p>
               <p>But you could not be certain whether he had a whip in his hand? - No, because his hands were constantly employed, he held my reins down with one of his hands, and he had our purses to take with the other.</p>
               <p>Where either of the men disguised? - I did not notice that they were.</p>
               <p>You said at first, I think I see him now; upon a closer question you said, you verily believed that was him, and after that, that you had no doubt; I would ask you one question, there is the life of a man at stake; will you undertake to swear upon your oath, I beg you to consider seriously of it, and the consequences; it is not the first time witnesses have been mistaken, will you swear it was impossible it could be any body else? - I do not know how far I can swear to that, I swear that I know the man, and that that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. That is enough.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Which side of the carriage was this man on? - He was on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution to Jealous. Did you observe any thing else that is particular to mention to the Court? - When I looked round the fire-place, I could not find any spurs, and at last I saw the woman prisoner hiding them under the bellows.</p>

               <p>Did he know you? - Yes, very well; I did not knock at the door because he knew my voice; Jealous found some pieces of money upon him, I found a purse in the girl's pocket under her head, there was nothing in it; I searched his pocket and found some loose powder in it, I found no firearms, he had a brown coat and a white shag waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was it a loose coat? - No, there was never a loose coat in the room; there were a pair of boots found in the room; I searched the man and found a key; he said he kept a stick-shop two or three doors off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do not you expect a share of the reward on the conviction of this man? - Yes, you know that as well as you get your own fee.</p>

               <p>Then you believed there was such another, or you would not have gone to look for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you swear to it with as much certainty as you can swear to objects of that sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you at home when the robbery was committed? - I got down directly after the ladies, I believe the highwaymen passed me, I sent an express directly by one of my servants, and a letter to Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Mrs. Bond. Did you swear positively to this man then? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In what manner did he speak it? - He did not speak it in an over harsh manner.</p>
               <p>In what manner did you understand him to speak it? - He spoke it mildly like.</p>
               <p>Did he express any concern for what he had done, or any thing of that sort? - No, no further, and upon saying that, he and the woman went out together.</p>
               <p>Did the woman say any thing? - I heard them say they would go to some doctor's, and they went to the doctor's afterwards, I followed him in the highway, and I took him by Mr. Bishop and Bayley's door, I knocked his heels up and caught hold of him, and I took him before Justice Green.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you laid hold of him? - As soon as ever I took hold of him, and threw him down on the stones, there was another man who assisted me, and took a knife out of his pocket; says he that is not the knife I killed the man with.</p>

               <p>Did the deceased say any thing then? - I heard him say, who could have thought that the man I had been drinking with all the afternoon, and pawned all my things to treat him with, should have served me in this manner. I know nothing further.</p>

               <p>Did he come alone, or any body with him? - He came by himself.</p>
               <p>Did any thing happen while he was there? - Not at my house, he came dancing in as if he had come to play, he had a knife in his hand, and he said I have killed a man, and I will resign myself to you, says I, you are mad, and he appeared to me as such.</p>
               <p>You say now he appeared to you to be mad? - He seemed to be not in his mind.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you formed that idea from the strangeness of the declaration at the time, or from his other behaviour? - By his coming in, in the manner that he did, to resign himself to me, dancing with the knife in his hand, he stuck the knife in the table, and said I have killed a man, and I will resign myself to you; I said to him you are mad, for no man that had committed murder, would have come in dancing.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - A good while before, he is a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Did you know him shew any signs of insanity before this? - Always in liquor, they always used to call him mad Clarke when he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>But not when sober? - No, I never heard any one call him mad then.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He sat down a little while, and still persisted he had killed a man, I asked him where, he told me at the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes; I asked him who, he told me Johnson, he said he saw his bitch, I believe, or something as bad as that, getting out of the window from the man, or the door, I cannot be positive which, I cannot be positive to the words, it was getting out of a window or a door, the one from the other, but I cannot be positive which; if it is where he mentioned, it must be a door, for the pavement is raised.</p>
               <p>How did you know what place he meant? - The house that Clarke used to live in.</p>
               <p>Who did you take him to mean by his bitch? - A woman that used to live with him.</p>
               <p>Do you know her name? - I cannot be positive to her name, she went by the name of Clarke, she lived with him a great many years, and had several children by him, at the same time my wife came in, she had been out with a pot of beer, and this man was walking by the door, says she, you scoundrel how can you say you have killed the man, and he is just gone by; so it put me out of all thoughts that he had killed any body.</p>
               <p>Is your wife here? - No, my Lord, it is rather hard for us both to be out from our business at once.</p>
               <p>Does your house lay between the Bunch of Grapes, and the King and Queen? - Yes, before you come to the King and Queen, between the one and the other.</p>
               <p>What did he say upon that when she said the man had walked past the door? - He went out directly, as soon as she said that, he took the knife out of the table, and went out.</p>
               <p>He took out the knife? - Yes, he struck it into a little wainscot table, and though the point of it is pretty sharp, it fell, he took it up and went away; I should have preserved the knife, if I had thought any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing upon the knife? - I had no thoughts of looking at it, nor did I think he had done any such thing.</p>
               <p>What sort of knife was it? - I was a very picked pointed one, with a short handle, it appeared to me to be a shoemaker's knife, they call it a welt knife.</p>

               <p>Was either Clarke or Johnson there then? - No.</p>
               <p>Which of them did you see first after that? - Clarke.</p>
               <p>When did you see Clarke? - I saw him just before nine, I was looking after Johnson, and I saw Clarke with his apron turned on one side, and the knife in his apron, at the bottom of Chamber-street, Ratcliffe Highway.</p>
               <p>Clarke lives next door to you I believe, does not he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you know there was a knife in his apron? - He out with the knife and shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Did he do that directly? - Yes, immediately, I asked him first whether he had seen Johnson, no, he said, he wanted him; he shewed me the knife, and said, that either Nan or Johnson should be the first that should have that knife stabbed in them.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand him to mean by Nan? - His wife.</p>
               <p>Is he a married man? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>A woman that lives with him by the name of Nan? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any further questions? - I told him, says I, for God's sake whatever you do govern your passion.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he would stab them for? - He said, they both jumped out of the back window together.</p>

               <p>Did he say that before you told him to govern his passion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you begged him to govern his passion? - He told me he would not.</p>
               <p>What more passed? - He run into this gentleman's house, the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, I saw him go in, but I did not follow him in, because I had been in just before, and I did not see Johnson there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100016"/>Where did you go to? - I looked in at the door, and saw him reach over the table, and give somebody a blow on the head, and I thought it was his wife that he gave the blow to, and I thought it was no business of mine, I could never have thought it was Johnson he struck, as they had been drinking all the blessed day, I went away to the next publick house, the Bell.</p>
               <p>What did you see or hear then? - I thought, I would see what became of her on account he had used her so ill the night before, thinks I, I will sit me down here and see what comes of this, I saw Johnson come out and he was almost double.</p>
               <p>Where did you see Johnson come out from? - From the Hoop and Bunch of Grapes, I called out Johnson! Johnson! three times, he was just going to turn back again when he heard my tongue, he turned round, and said to me, he has done for me and you too; who has says I,

               <p>Did you see Clarke come out? - I did not, I suppose he passed me while I turned away.</p>
               <p>Why, when Johnson come out directly from the entry, and said, Clarke had done for him, did not you look to see if he was coming? - I suppose he was gone out before.</p>
               <p>What became of Johnson after he said this to you? - I laid hold of him and crossed the way with him, and led him right facing Mr. Dimsdales, then I heard Clarke coming out of Mr. Sayers, he said, bowpots; it is a cramp word he had got.</p>
               <p>What does he mean by that? - I do not know any more than the dead, he often crys bowpots when he is in liquor: Says I to Johnson, shall I lead you home; no, says he, go to Clarke's for my candle which is on his table, and I went; Clarke, Clarke, says I, give me the candle that is burning on your table.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know what he meant by that word? - When he was in liquor he used to cry it.</p>
               <p>You knew the man? - I never knew him but about two months in my life; Johnson desired me to go and get my candle which was burning on Mr. Clarke's table, and he would go over immediately to Mr. Dimsdale's and get a drop of gin.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what candle it was that was burning upon Mr. Clarke's table? - I bought the candle myself, a penny flat candle.</p>
               <p>Did he say how the candle came to be burning there? - No, he never did, it was Clarke's room, and Clarke went with me and I took the candle off of his table: Clarke said nothing to me nor I to him, as I went for the candle.</p>

               <p>That was in the next house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Clarke go with you to your room? - He met Johnson at our own door, I heard him as I was coming down stairs to light Johnson up, it was not three minutes after, I heard Johnson say to the prisoner, Jack, come up and see what you have done; I know says he, what I have done, says he, I have done it on purpose to kill you, I have stabbed you on purpose to kill you; Johnson says to me, I wish you would go and fetch a doctor, Clarke said, he would go, says I, I will go myself, says Clarke, I will go with you.</p>
               <p>Did this pass up stairs or where? - It passed up stairs, he came up into the room by Johnson's orders, to see what he had done, and Johnson shewed his wound to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did Clarke say after he saw the wound? - He said, he knew it, he had done it on purpose.</p>
               <p>Did he say it twice or once? - He said it once up stairs and once at the door.</p>
               <p>Did he express no concern when he saw him? - No, none at all.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100017"/>How come he to offer to go for a doctor? - He said he had done murder, and he desired to die for it, and he said so in both the doctors shops.</p>

               <p>Was you with him when he was tripped up and taken? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I do not know, I found he was secured, and I ran immediately to the third doctor, and the doctor came down.</p>

               <p>And what came of Johnson? - The doctors said he must go immediately to the Hospital, or he would be a dead man.</p>
               <p>He was carried to the Hospital then? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear him say any thing more respecting it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>What did you hear and see? - I live on the ground-floor, and I went out of the door and I heard a women say that Clarke had murdered a man; I went to the back-yard and I heard a noise in Johnson's room, I did not know what it was, I went up into the room and I saw Johnson laying on the bed which was on the floor, and I asked him what was the matter with him; he told me that Clarke had stabbed him; he said to me who would have thought this, such friends as we have been all day; I asked him whether he had any words or no, and he said he had no words at all with him.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner locked up; just before he came to the watch-house, I asked the prisoner what he had been doing, he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100018"/> he had cut a man across the belly; I asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing, he told me it was through passion and liquor, and that after he had cut him he went to a couple of surgeons to get them to dress him, and that he hoped to God the man would not die.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the surgeon? - He left a card of his place of abode where he might be sent for, Mr. Seaman, No. 33, Thread-needle-street.</p>
               <p>(The Surgeon sent for.)</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. Did you see the wound? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What appearance had it; what sort of a wound was it? - It was about an inch long.</p>
               <p>Where about was it? - The right side of the navel, just under the navel.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about it? - I did not observe any thing particular, but I saw a part of the caul of the belly hanging out of the wound.</p>
               <p>A part of the caul? - Yes, a good part of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. What state of health was Johnson in before he received the wound? - He had no disorder at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you think there is sufficient evidence before you now, that the wound which this man received in his belly was the cause of his death, in that case, if you are satisfied with the evidence now before you of that fact, it may not be necessary to wait for the surgeon, for it certainly is not necessary in point of law that that fact should be proved by a surgeon; there may be cases where a surgeon could not be had.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to wait for the surgeon, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot be too cautious in such cases, but it is not in point of law necessary that it should be proved by a surgeon.</p>
               <p>(The Surgeon sent for, but was not at home, he was gone to the other end of the town; the Court ordered his recognizance to be estreated, but it was afterwards discharged on the application of the Surgeon.)</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. You say this man was in a good state of health before he received this wound? - As good a state of health as any person in the world.</p>
               <p>Did you see his wound? - No, I could not bear to see it; I went to see him in the hospital three times.</p>
               <p>Was you with him at the time of his death? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Marshall. You knew this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in good health? - Yes, in perfect health.</p>
               <p>No disorder that appeared to have indangered his life? - No, I believe by the stab he got his death.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say any farther than I knew nothing of stabbing him, there was nobody but the woman; I have nobody to my character; my master that I have worked for this twenty years did not expect I should be tried till to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I will state to you what the witnesses have said, with such observations as it is my duty to suggest to you. (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added as follows:) The declarations of the deceased after receiving the death-wound are always considered as admissible evidence in cases of murder, through nothing before that wound is considered in that light. The result of the evidence seems to be this; that this man, as appears from some of his expressions, from some conceived jealously, the cause of which does not appear in evidence, or whether it existed at all further then in his own mind, went with a determined purpose, with this weapon with him, in search of the deceased Johnson, and him, called him out of the house where he was, and instantly stabbed him in the belly: it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100019"/> appears also, that they had been drinking together a considerable part of the day, and there is reason to suppose the prisoner was in liquor; and he himself said to Eloy that it was through passion and liquor. Sayer describes his conduct, when he came into his house, as appearing to him in the light of a madman; that led me to enquire whether the prisoner had shewn any signs of madness, and the witness said, only when he was in liquor on former occasions, and then he was called Mad Clarke.</p>
               <p>In the first place, Gentlemen, it is my duty to state to you the law upon the subject. The killing a man deliberately, and with premeditated malice, is clearly and unquestionably murder, and is the legal definition of that crime; the killing a man at all in consequence of an intention to hurt or injure him, is in law an high offence; but where death ensues from a sudden quarrel, or the wound which occasions the death is given in consequence of a sudden provocation at the instant, the law makes that allowance for the impetuosity of passion, and the frailty of human nature, to reduce the crime to manslaughter; but it is necessary that the provocation should be sudden, and proportioned in some degree to the violence of the party who kills; for a greater degree of provocation, provided it is sudden and instantaneous, will reduce to manslaughter, when the same degree of provocation would not justify the use of a deadly weapon, even though it was done on the instant: and the law has held it so strict, as to consider that nothing but personal violence will mitigate the offence of using a deadly weapon, however sudden the occasion may be; no words, however provoking, can reduce the offence to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>In this case there is no proof of any actual provocation given by the deceased at all; there is no evidence, except from the declarations of the prisoner, that tends to shew that he had conceived some kind of jealousy with respect to the deceased and a woman who lived with him; now that jealousy would not be a sufficient cause, even if the cause of it had been proved to exist, in point of law to reduce that offence of killing a man to manslaughter; but independent of that, no such case is in proof to have at all existed: it is in proof to you that this man, before he gave the wound which is supposed to have occasioned the death of the deceased, declared to a witness that it was for the purpose of killing him; that declaration being accompanied by the other I stated to you, if you take the one you must take the other, it is for that reason alone that I selected those expressions of the prisoner that imported jealousy, for he declares expressly his purpose to kill the deceased; he goes in search of him with that deadly weapon, he finds him in a house where it is proved the deceased had been ten minutes before, he strikes him a blow, calls him out, and the wound must then have been instantly given; the deceased afterwards declared he had received his death wound from the prisoner, and the prisoner makes the same declaration in a manner very extraordinary: I therefore am of opinion, that no provocation is proved in this case to have existed, that can reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter.</p>
               <p>The next consideration is, whether you can upon this evidence, find any other excuse that will reduce the crime of the prisoner. If the prisoner had been a man, really disordered in his senses, from natural and unavoidable infirmity, that act which would amount to murder in another man, would certainly not have amounted to that in him, because such a man is not considered as knowing what he does, and the consequence of his actions; but there is no pretence in this case for that sort of defence; for all the madness that is imputed to the prisoner, is the madness arising from liquor; and independent of the consideration, that such a madness is far from being an excuse for the commission of any atrocious crime; and it would be a great hurt to society, if such excuses were ever admitted; but independent of those expressions, he appears to have known what he was doing, both before he did it and afterwards; he declares, even after he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100020"/> the deadly wound (which one would have thought, would have made the strongest degree of resentment relent) he declared that that, he did it on purpose, and with intention to kill the man: therefore he clearly appears, even with that drunkenness, which in itself would not be an excuse, he appears yet to know what he was about to do, and what had done. It is there four for you to consider gentleman, first whether, you are clearly the satisfied with the truth of the evidence, and the result of the whole evidence taken together, the prisoner is the man the deceased that wound; and next wether you are satisfied that that wound was the cause of the man's death, for however criminal the conduct of the prisoner may have been, yet unless you are satisfied clearly from the evidence, that he was the actual occasion of the man's death, he is not guilty of murder; and with respect to that part of the case, to be sure the evidence is left less compleat and perfect than it sometimes is in other cases, from the absence of the surgeon who had examined the deceased, and dressed his wound and attended him; for that evidence would have put it out of all doubt. It is not however necessary, at all, in point of law, that that fact should be proved by the evidence of a surgeon particularly, provided it is proved without such evidence; but it is fair to make also this observation, that though it is clear that the presence of a surgeon is not necessary, yet where a surgeon has examined the wound, his evidence in that case is the best and most satisfactory that can be had, and where he is absent, a less degree of evidence appears before a Jury, than would be before them if that surgeon was examined. Subject, therefore, to that observation, gentlemen, you will consider the evidence as it stands; this man is in health, he receives his death wound, he, himself, declares his own idea of it, that it will be mortal; that wound is described as a wound in the belly, near the navel, a very dangerous place, where all the intestines are exposed to injury from the wound; and a part of the caul of the intestines is described as hanging out of the wounds; under these circumstances he is carried to the hospital between nine and ten in night, and on the morning of the seventh he dies; the witness who saw the wound who is not a man of skill or judgement, he has no doubt but the wound was the cause of his death; is therefore remains under the circumstances I have stated to you upon the description of the wound, the place in which it was given, the wound of giving it, the state of health of the man before, and the time he died: If from all these circumstances you are clearly satisfied that the wound was the cause of his death, and are also clearly satisfied with the truth of the rest of the evidence, and that the result of that evidence is proved clearly to your satisfaction, that the prisoner is the man that gave the wound, I am then obliged to tell you that I am of opinion there is nothing in this case that can reduce the crime below that aggravated crime of murder: and it will in that case be your duty to find the prisoner guilty of this indictment: If on the other hand you think there is any room to doubt the truth of the evidence, or that believing the truth of the evidence is not sufficient proof that the prisoner gave the wound, or that the wound was the cause of his death; in that case it is your duty to acquit the prisoner wholly; or if there appears any circumstances that would reduce the crime to manslaughter, in that case you may find that verdict; but there does not appear to me any sort of evidence to take that middle line: Therefore, give your verdict according to your own consciences, you must be clearly satisfied of the fact of a crime so heinous in its nature, and so penal in its consequences, and then it is your duty to the public and to justices, to find the prisoner guilty. If on the other you think there is any reasonable cause for doubt, either upon the fact of his warning the man, or of the wound being the cause of his death, you will acquit him.</p>

            , you have been convicted upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, by a Jury as much inclined to mercy as any I have met with, of a crime, one of the most heinous, both in sight of God and man, that can be committed by the most wicked of mankind. The act of wilfully depriving a fellow creature of life, is a crime, which in all civilized nations has been justly punished with death, the law of God as well as man, decrees, that whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; you have been unfortunately a prey to those violent and outrageous passions of malice and revenge, which have led you to perpetrate this horrid crime; when I say you have been a prey to violent and outrageous passions, I do not mean those infirmities of nature, for which the laws of man, and I hope of the Almighty also, will make some allowance; but you have been a prey to those dark and malignant passions, which have led you deliberately to seek the life of your fellow citizen, and that fellow citizen your acquaintance and your friend, with whom you had spent the day in harmony and sociality! Guilt so aggravated, can have no hope to escape the punishment of the laws: I hope therefore, that the impression made upon you by the dreadful sentence which you must now receive, will so operate on your mind as to correct that malignant temper, which has rendered you unfit to continue a member of society here, and so to correct it as to entitle you to that mercy hereafter, which is infinitely more important for you to obtain, and that the short period of time which you have now to live, will be spent more in regretting and lamenting that crime, than even the miserable consequences that must follow upon it; I hope the remorse of your own conscience will be such as to make the only atonement that is left you in this life, and such as to obtain mercy for you at the throne of him whose mercy is infinite. It therefore only remains for me to fulfil my duty, and pronounce upon you the dreadful sentence of the law; which is, that you be <rs id="t17831210-4-punish29" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>What is your master? - He carries on the business of a silversmith, he kept a pawnbroker's shop, he left off the pawnbrokery business; I asked them what they wanted, I said, it was too soon to disturb my master, Horne said, he had a gold watch to sell, and two rings, I told him he might leave them with me till my master was up; they left them with me and returned in about an hour and half, then I went up and called my master, he came down in his morning gown to the foot of the stairs, and I shewed them to him, he bid me ask them what they asked for them, they said, twenty guineas for the watch and rings; he told me to bid them four guineas and a half; which they agreed to take; my master gave me the money to pay for them, I came down and I paid them, and they went away.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - I do not know, my master bid me put the watch safe up and take particular care of it, till he went to give information to Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Did you know who the prisoners were and their names? - Yes, I had seen them once or twice before, I had drank with Horne before, I knew him by name, but not the other.</p>
               <p>Your master knew them I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he know where they lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how could he give information? - Mr. Clarke found out where they lived.</p>
               <p>Had your master bought things of them. before? - No, Sir, not as I know of, I never saw them at our house before.</p>
               <p>How came he to think of giving information after he had bought these things? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for Prisoner Kennedy. How long had the melting pot been off the fire that morning? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Do not you, why Henry Lee No. 19, Petticoat Lane, is known as well as any person in this Court; well then the crucible had not been on the fire that night? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Why what does your master melt his plate in? - He does not melt any.</p>
               <p>He buys it all ready made, does he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he by trade? - He deals in the silversmith trade, he buys any thing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100024"/> he can come honestly by, he will shew receipts for every thing that he has bought.</p>
               <p>Where is the receipt for this watch? - I do not know about that, we have no receipt for that.</p>
               <p>He is not here? - He did not think he should be wanted.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with him? - Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>During that time upon your oath you have never seen any plate melted in that house? - No, Sir, none at no time.</p>
               <p>And as to the goods that are bought they are bought in an open way? - Yes, Sir, I can mention several working silversmiths that he buys his goods of.</p>
               <p>He buys all kinds of goods you know, he is not very nice? - It is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>You are present, are not you? - No.</p>

               <p>What were the rings gold? - One was a mourning ring, and one an enamelled white head.</p>
               <p>There was a seal to the watch and a string? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Sunday after the robbery was committed, Mr. Lee came up and asked if there had been any robbery of a gold watch, I did not know then, I went to enquire at the office, and understood a robbery had been committed in Pall-mall; I brought him the best description of the watch. I know nothing more, only the Tuesday following I searched the place belonging to Kennedy, where I found a pair of pistols.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You know Lee of old? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Donnedy. (Looking at the watch.) This is the same, I am sure of it, and these are the two rings upon it.</p>
               <p>(The watch and rings deposed to by the Prosecutor)</p>
               <p>PRISONER HORNE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw this man Donnedy but once before; he then said, that the gentleman in the red coat sold him the watch; he made a remark of the young man in the red coat, and Sir Sampson Wright asked him once or twice. I will leave it to the gentlemen whether they did hear him or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Adey how is that? - Donnedy swore that the man in the light coat gave him the watch; the one had on a blue coat and a red cape, and the other a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Horne. Have you any witnesses? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kennedy. I leave it to my Council.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Horne called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Kennedy called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the fact with respect to the prisoners rests on the evidence of Donnedy; there is no doubt but Mr. Adey's watch was found on Lee by his information: Donnedy and Lee certainly stand under circumstances of particular discredit; and it is evident what sort of a house Lee keeps; and if the circumstances respecting Lee had come out any other way than they have done, I should not have hesitated to have bound over Donnedy an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100025"/> evidence to support a prosecution against Lee as a receiver.</p>

               <p>He took nothing from either of you post-boys? - No.</p>
               <p>Which way did he go? - To London as fast as he could gallop.</p>
               <p>Had he a good horse under him? - A very poor horse.</p>
               <p>I suppose you took the best of your horses to pursue him? - I took the horse I rode, and I pursued him; Sir William desired, me to pursue him.</p>
               <p>What coloured horse did the highwayman ride? - A grey mare.</p>
               <p>How soon might it be before you overtook him? - I overtook him in the space of a mile, at the Green Man, he walked up the hill, and I kept sight of him about 2 or 300 yards behind; I had no pistols.</p>
               <p>How soon did you venture to got up with him? - When he came to Highgate, I got as near, him as I could, then I hallooed stop thief, I was got up the hill opposite the Bull there were three men going through Highway on horseback they tried to stop him but did not, he kept going down the Holloway mad, and when he came about half way down the hill, I was obliged to run my horse up against a waggon, or else I must have gone by him; my horse went so fast I could not stop him: I then heard two reports of a pistol. I was then about fifty or sixty yards from him; after that I got close to him and met with a horse patrol, and he would not assist me; I called to him to assist me, and told him of it, and he would not; there happened to be two gentlemen on the road one going to London and the other to Whetstone, one Mr. Dalton and one Mr. Cooper and they insisted on the patrol coming to assist me; with that the patrol came up and said to the gentlemen, that it was a false report; then the highwaymen came forword, and he and the patrol and me were all side by side, I thought he was going to catch hold of us; the patrol had arms. Then the patrol went back again and would not assist me; the gentlemen went about their business I told him I would not want any assistance if he would lend me his hanger; the patrol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100027"/> would not; then the prisoner rode away from me for the space of eight or ten minutes; the patrol went and sent three men but he never came himself: then the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Who took the prisoner? - I am not sure whether I caught hold of the reins first, or whether the patrol did.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any resistance? - No, my Lord, he begged the favour of them to let him ride on his horse; he was taken to the Half Moon at Holloway, we took him off the horse and he walked.</p>
               <p>Was he searched there? - Yes, we found two gold watches and a purse; we searched him after he got into the room.</p>
               <p>What were the two firings that you heard? - He fired first at the watchmen, and then the watchman fired at him.</p>
               <p>You swear the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me a little extraordinary, that as he had fired at the watchman and the watchman had fired at him, that he did not make the best of his way to town? - He made the best of his way, but his horse would not go.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the four prisoners are all indicted for a capital offence; your consideration will therefore be, whether, in the first place, all or any of them stole goods in a dwelling house; and if you are of that opinion, you are then to find what the value of these goods so stolen is, if it is less than forty shillings their lives are saved, if it is above forty shilling that makes it a capital offence: You are farther to enquire, whether they were stolen in the dwelling house; now I think if they were stolen at all, they were taken in the dwelling house; the general story you find is, that Mrs.

Upon this evidence you will determine whether you think all or any of them stole all or any of these goods; and to what amount; if you are all of opinion, that any of them have stolen goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100037"/> to the amount of forty shillings (as I told you before) it is a capital offence, but then you must be satisfied that the goods of that value were stolen at one time, because unless you are, there is no particular theft amounting to that value; and I confess it seems to me extremely difficult for you to say upon this state of the evidence, that at any one time goods to the value of forty shillings were stolen.</p>

            . Under this difficulty there is nothing else involved but that flowered gown and coat, which were pawned at two times, and therefore the gown might be taken one day, and the coat another; and where it comes to such a nicety as that, perhaps you will think yourselves at liberty to suppose in favour of life, that nothing was taken at any one time to the value of forty shillings, and you will then save the lives of these people; it will then remain for you to consider which of them you will charge with simple felony: Now you find that every one of them has pawned something, there is no evidence against any one of them, but what arises from the act of pledging these goods, but that is an act sufficient to put the party upon giving an account how they came by them; for at first view it is a dishonest thing to have your goods or mine in another person's custody, they having nothing to do with them; now they have given no account how they came by these goods; and if it was to relieve then in an instant necessity, they could not want to take such a number of things, especially for five months together: If you suppose that they really intended to plunder the house, and that the fact really was that they were surprized by the sudden return of Mrs. Read, and flattered themselves with the expectation of this month's notice, which would have given them time to have accommodated matters, either for their excuse or for facilitating their escape, then to be sure you will suppose that they did take them with a dishonest purpose; and with respect to the discrimination of the different persons, Moody was the person intrusted with the care of the house, she is the only person that lived in the house, therefore it is to be presumed that she was having pawned some of these things, that she was the hand that took all the goods; and there are these two strong circumstances against her more than against the rest, that of making her escape in the morning, and when she was taken being found with the key of Mrs. Read's box in her pocket; that key Mrs. Read swears was up stairs in a drawer in the garret, when she went out of town, therefore it is impossible, that she could have any business with that key; another circumstance is, that she had the possession of the duplicates, not only of the things that were pawned in her name, but as the constable says, some in the name of Price, some in the name of Parker, some in the name of Moody. All of them were in her possession; that imports very strongly that they were pledged for her benefit, at last in common with the rest. With respect to the two Parkers, they are relations to her, and they did pledge at several different times part of this property; if you are of opinion that they were concerned in taking these things, and that they knew they were not Moody's property, but the property of Lady Teynham, and were also instruments of pawning them, you will connect them with Moody, so as to include them in the same guilt; if on the other hand, you only think them guilty in the light of receivers, then that is a different species of offence, with which they are not now charged, but which may hereafter subject them to other punishments; but if you suppose them principals in the fact, then they are equally guilty, and that involves the case of Price also, because she pledged several of these things in the name of Ann instead of Bridget; she however has this peculiarly attending her case, which speaks strongly in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100038"/> ster favourish that she was taken up upon this suspicion and let go, and she came voluntarily again: As for

               <p>Was it a dark night or a light night? - It was moon-light, but very foggy, they ran after me very quick, they told me to stop, they unbuttoned my clothes, and they pulled out a bludgeon, the prisoner Haines took me by the collar, and I gave him all the money I had, I gave him about one shilling and nine pence, then with a deal of persuading they let me go, they did not hit me, but they threatened me, and Haines swore have you got no more.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the persons of the men? - Yes, I have known Crouch some time.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to Crouch? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Do you know his voice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to Haines? - Yes, I picked him out of a good many people.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that Haines was one of the men that robbed you? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>You swear to them both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to see their faces? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Crouch while Haines robbed you? - At the side.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - I cannot say that he said any thing.</p>
               <p>Had he a bludgeon in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in company with the other? - Yes, they were taken about three quarters of an hour after, I followed them, I went to Acton, I came to Shepherd's Wash, and got some people to go with me, I found Haines in a publick-house, and Crouch near his own door; at the time he stood by while I was robbed, I knew Crouch particularly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crouch. My Lord I am deaf; I never saw him nor knew him in my life.</p>

               <p>I conduct the patrol belonging to Bow-street; the prisoners were apprehended by me on the information of the prosecutor, the robbery was about a mile and three quarters on this side Acton, near the Four-mile-stone, we had information of it, we got to Acton about twenty minutes after eight, we searched several publick-houses, there were several people in each house, we went into the Red Lion, there were twelve or fourteen people, and the prosecutor picked out the prisoner Haines from them, and said this is one of them that robbed me, I immediately took him into another room, and search him, I found nine penny worth of halfpence him, we then went to enquire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100039"/> for the prisoner Crouch, upon information that we received at the Red Lion, and within about twenty yards of his door the prosecutor saw him in the street and said, that is the man that robbed me, he said so before any body pointed him out; in his pocket I found some money and a crooked farthing, which the prosecutor said he believed to be his.</p>
               <p>Jury. The prosecutor has not mentioned any crooked farthing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you say as to the farthing? - I cannot be positive to it, I had a crooked farthing, it was taken from me, I believe this to be it.</p>
               <p>Bowyer. The prisoners both denied it then, but on their examinations before Sir Sampson Wright you will find they confessed the robbery. (The confessions which were taken in writing before the Justice shewn to him.) This was Haines's confession which I saw him sign, it was read over to him before he signed it, it was free and voluntary; it is signed by Mr. Addington: Crouch made the confession first, and on Haines being sent for over, he immediately confessed it; they were both read over to them, indeed Crouch read his himself; he said he was induced to commit the robbery by Haines, who first proposed it.</p>

               <p>Really sober? - Yes; I agreed to lay with one of them for one shilling, and I gave it her; that was the prisoner Sherlock.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed? - No, I was not in bed; when I had got some part of my clothes off she called the other up, an they threw me down on the bed, and one of them lay over me, and the other took my breeches from me and ran down with them, and took my watch and money out; I had the breeches in my hand at the time they threw me down; there was 5 s. 6 d. and my watch in my breeches; it was M'Cabe that ran down stairs with it; Sherlock I were she would take away my life if I made my resistance, she threw up the breeches again, and I put my things on and went down; somebody without tried lock the door, and the street-door was locked on the outside and they stopped and the street-door and searched if I had any money about me, and they pulled off my shoes.</p>
               <p>What did they do with your shoes? - They let me put them on again when they saw there was no money in then; they searched all my pockets, and took my breeches down the thigh to see if there was any money in the breeches; then they me go.</p>
               <p>How long might you be kept in the house? - About a quarter of an hour from first to last. There were only these two up stairs; M'Cabe had gone down stairs, and then Sherlock called her up again.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Is that your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you had it? - Not above five or six hours, I only bought it that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you buy it of? - I changed it with a young man a companion of mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; as I was attending the prisoners in the justices yard, I saw Mr. Lucas take a watch from the prisoner Sherlock.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'CABE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going down Cross-lane I heard a great noise, and I went in, and the prosecutor was standing, and he said he was robbed; I went to a public-house, and the constable came and took me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SHERLOCK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met the prosecutor, he asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and we went together into Cross-lane; I told him I had no apartment, but I would take him to a place I knew, and I took him to one Mrs. Martin's; he said he had no money; he said, if I would let him sleep all night he would let me have his watch for a crown; I said then I will call up the woman of the house. We had not been in bed quite an hour before he demanded the watch, and I would not let him have it without the five shillings; the watchman took us both to the watch-house, and the next morning he said if I would give him five shillings and sixpence and his watch he would make it up; I sent my handkerchief and gown to pawn, and when the five shillings and sixpence came and his watch, that watchman and another went out to him and told him not to make it up at all. We have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Wells. You took them up that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it that you took them up? - Eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was the prosecutor sober? - Yes, to all appearance.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you then? - He told me he had lost a watch and five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is a very serious story, because the prisoners stand charged with a capital offence;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100043"/> and if you are satisfied with the evidence, there seems to be nothing in the case that authorizes me to wish you to reduce the offence from what the law describes it to be; for a robbery, you well know, is a taking by force and violence the property of another, from his person: it is not often indeed that we meet with robberies of this kind committed under circumstances of violence on the person; but when we do meet with cases of this sort, they certainly deserve punishment; though women of this bad character must of necessity be in such a country as this, yet they ought to confine themselves to their trade, bad as it is; and in this case undoubtedly they have committed a plain robbery on this man, and if you are satisfied as to the evidence you are bound to find them guilty.</p>

               <p>Court. Does your master live in a house of his own, or does he take lodgings when he comes to town? - He rents a house, and these things were at Mr. Harden's clubhouse, which goes by the name of Boodle's club-house, he dined there on the 25th of November, he lost his pin while he was in the house; it was a diamond pin set in gold, a pin he always wore in his bosom when he was dressed; he had it not in his bosom then; he sent there for his things to dress after dinner; he lives in Charles-street, Berkley-square; I carried to Mr. Harden's the things mentioned in the indictment, except the leather breeches and boots, which he changed; he changed the leather breeches for sattin ones, and the boots for shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose these things, exclusive of the pin, are worth more than forty shillings? - Yes, my Lord, for they were almost new; I carried the things to dress my master a little before night, and they were lost between seven and eight; I asked for a room for Sir George to dress in, and I was shewn into a room up one pair of stairs, I put the things there, and there he dressed all he did dress; there was a fire made on purpose; he only changed the breeches and boots, and the cotton stockings for silk stockings, and put on a clean neckcloth; he was not long dressing himself, and then he went into the room again where he dined: I packed his things up directly after, and put the pin in the coat; I pinned the diamond pin in the coat, and I brought the things all out of that room, and put them into the porter's hall; the boots were dirty, I wrapped them up in paper, and put them inside; I went down the street for some tea, a little lower, which was for my own use; I intended to take the things home myself, I thought I would not take them to the tea warehouse, but call for them as I came back; I was absent about ten minutes, and when I returned, the things were all gone; they were wrapped up in a linen packing-cloth; I immediately enquired after them, and asked the waiter; there is an outward door and a door within that door; all the family of the Harden's lay in the house; when I missed them I immediately informed Sir George. I have seen part of the things since. I first heard of them on the 28th of November; I was at home at Sir George's own house, and there came a man from the Office in Bow-street, and informed us of them; I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to think of Sir George? - Because the pin answered the description of Sir George's; I took him back and searched him, and he had a ruffled shirt on, and it was marked O. P. No. 14, the same that was in the advertisement; I found nothing else upon him.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Look at that shirt. - This is my master's shirt, I marked it myself, I have another of the same set in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether it was the shirt you carried that day to Boodle's? - Yes, I carried it clean, that mark will not wear out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Council. As to this pin you pinned it in that coat. - Yes, I put the pin in the coat again.</p>
               <p>This porter's hall, I believe, is at the entrance of the house? - Yes, there is a door which goes with a spring, any body may open it on the outside.</p>

               <p>There are a vast number of waiters and servants in this house? - A good many.</p>
               <p>You left this bundle behind the door without any body to take care of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you swear that you marked both these shirts yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you account for the one shirt and the other being marked differently? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Yes they are, there is a dot in the one shirt between the names, and not in the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What makes you so sure that was the shirt you carried that day? - That was the only set of shirts I had in town.</p>

               <p>Court. What is become of Paterson? - I cannot find him, he told me to bring a duplicate to him to No. 5, Charles Court, Strand.</p>
               <p>How long might you be with Paterson, before such time as you sent this woman to pawn the pin? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>How came you to have this shirt on your back? - I was going to see a friend, and this shirt was rather cleaner than my own, I took the shirt off and put that on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heather. You will hear my Lord from Mr. Macmanus how the shirt became torn, it was by the prisoner making a resistance, for I had sent Macmanus to see if he could find any such a man as Paterson.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Was the shirt tore when you carried it to Boodle's? - No.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner at Mr. Heather's, he said, he had it of one Paterson, who lived at No. 7, Charles Court, in the Strand, and that he took it for seven shillings and sixpence, I went to enquire, and there was such a man lived there near four years back; then he was pressed very hard to know where he lodged, he did not like to tell his lodgings, at last he said at Ratcliffe Cross; I took the directions, I went there the same night, and no such man ever lodged at the place, nor they did not know such a man: Harding went with me, I think the shirt was tore in struggling to get away from Mr. Heather, and Clarke, and me, in Broad-court.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he endeavour to get away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Harding. Had you examined the shirt before that time? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. Were they small toes or large toes? - They were small toes, I observed a table that stood very near the window, there I found the mark of footy feet, I saw a bar bent that went across the window curtain: I took the impressions of the foot and toes that were on the table upon a piece of paper as minutely as I could.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What passed before the Justice, were there any promises or threats made use of? - He first denied it, and then he told the Justice that there was another boy with him, and that the other boy broke through the window and got into the room; after the foot was measured by the paper he then confessed he had been in the house.</p>
               <p>(The pistol and stockings deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Did the boy seem to want understanding before the Justice? - He said very little.</p>
               <p>Court to Bayners. Did he appear to you to want understanding? - No: the runners said it was the third time they had had him within ten days.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The boy's confession may be admitted, in evidence, but we must take it with every allowance, and at the utmost it only proves he was in the house; now he might have got in after daybreak, as the prosecutor was not informed of it till eight the next morning. The only thing that fixes this boy with the robbery is the pistol found in the sink; that might not have been put there by the boy: his confession with respect to how he came there, I do not think should be allowed, because it was made under fear; I think it would be too hard to find a boy of his tender age guilty of the burglary; one would wish to snatch such a boy, if one possibly could, from destruction, for he will only return to the same kind of life which he has led before, and will be an instrument in the hands of very bad people, who make use of boys of that sort to rob houses.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Could the boy go through this hole without scraching himself? - The glass was taken perfectly out.</p>

               <p>Had you examined that piece of cloth before you delivered it to the other person? - When I pursued the prisoner up Basinghall-street, the number was towards me, it never was out of my sight, it was about three times the distance from here to your Lordship.</p>

               <p>Whose mark is it? - It is the mark of the clothier that manufactured the cloth.</p>
               <p>But may not other people employ the same clothier? - No, my Lord, not the same number.</p>

             the third, chapter twenty-third. There was a case determined therein 751, before Justice Parker and others for stealing goods in a warehouse; they kept a warehouse by the water side, where merchants usually kept goods till they would be put on board, that was to be a warehouse within the act. In this case, gentlemen, two reasons why the prisoner should be acquitted of the capital part; he was not seen in the warehouse, and secondly its being a doubt whether this is a warehouse within the act.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor, one of the Prisoner's witnesses. Did the prisoner's wife lodge at your house? - Yes, your honour and she is with-child.</p>

               <p>I went after the prisoner was in custody and searched his lodgings on the 24th of October, and I found concealed in a little back place adjoining the room where he lives, a parcel of old lead, I suppose about thirty or forty pounds weight, covered over with different cloths and rags, and I brought it away with me, and in his box I found a thing that the brewers use to pull out bungs with; this piece of lead has the letters on it.</p>
               <p>(The lead produced, being the same that was marked by Yardley.)</p>
               <p>Lefcure. My Lord, part of these premises have been in the possession of a brewer.</p>
               <p>Court. What may the value of that lead be? - Four or five shillings.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found these four pieces of lead in a sack standing against a door, and I kicked against them, and I thought I had a good right to go and sell them, Yardley met me and took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Was all the lead you found in a sack? - Yes, I took two pieces to sell, and left the other at home, I know nothing of their being covered over.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five Witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. You observe nobody has told us when this theft was actually committed, and nobody says the prisoner was seen actually on the premises, but the constable says he took him about two hundred yards from the house.</p>

               <p>I was going with a knot load to Ratcliffe Cross, and under my right-arm I had a piece of British callicoe containing twenty-one yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the same thing as printed cotton? - The same thing, I put the bundle on the bulk where I pitched my other load, the corner of <placeName id="t17831210-31-crimeloc175">Lime-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17831210-31-crimeloc175" type="placeName" value="Lime-street"/>

               <p>Jury. Was he dressed then as he is now? - He had a brown great coat, and a green coat, and a red plush waistcoat, I had the bundle in my own care all the time, till the prisoner was committed, then it was in the possession of the constable, I wrote my name upon it, it is now in Court.</p>
               <p>Was the bundle that you gave to the constable the same bundle that you picked up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council, Mr. Sylvester. The man turned up Lime-street immediately? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Then you pursued him behind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not then an opportunity of seeing his face? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you laid hold of a man and the bundle, and the man instantly got away? - He crossed over and went about the length<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100058"/> of this place, I saw him by the light of the lamp, I saw him particularly and his clothes, I can swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Round or cocked? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>You could not observe him for a second? - I saw the side of his face when he crossed over, and I particularly took notice of the waistcoat, and the brown coat with the yellow buttons.</p>
               <p>Who took the man? - A taylor, his name is Bull, he gave a false direction, he said, he lived in Hare Court, Aldersgate-street, and he had not lived there for same time.</p>
               <p>How was Bull dressed? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why you had longer time with him than the prisoner? - He had a rough head of hair, I did not see the man when he was taken, they brought a man to me.</p>
               <p>Which man you never saw before nor knew nothing of him? - I saw him plain enough that night.</p>
               <p>Not plain, friend? - I saw the side of his face, I saw it plain enough.</p>
               <p>You never saw but half of his face? - Yes, I met him in front.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that Bull gave you a false direction or that you could not meet with him? - He gave a direction that he lived No. 9, Hare Court, Aldersgate-street; he had lived there about eight or nine weeks, he was a stout thick man, he had no great coat on.</p>
               <p>Could you mistake Bull for the prisoner? - No, they are as different as any two in the world could be, Bull had a rough head of hair, and the prisoner's hair was tied, I observed that at the time.</p>

               <p>Who was in the room where you put them down? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long might it be that you missed them after you laid them down there? - Ten or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>I suppose in that time a good many people might have gone backwards and forwards? - I cannot say, this man was writing a letter, he was a good deal in liquor, he went away, and we missed them in about ten minutes after, it was about three o'clock in the afternoon, I immediately suspected him, he was pursued and taken in a field, and brought back, the things were found upon him.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you supposed that you had in your box a piece of the same sort of lace with that Podd had shewn you, but upon looking into the box you missed it? - Yes, I then said to Podd, this is our lace, if it is says Mr. Podd, I will tell you the length of it, O says I, I will tell you the length presently, I went to the invoice book and saw the length of it corresponded with the lace, Podd then fetched that lace, he lives in Bell Savage-yard, Ludgate-hill, he brought it to our house, the piece of lace he fetched was ours; Mr. Pope says this is our lace, you must tell us where you got this lace.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you charge Podd as suspecting him? - No, my Lord, we called upon him to declare where he got it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Bell Savage-yard, I am a haberdasher and dealer in china, I sell to the china trade, I do not keep any shop, I keep my goods at home, I was apprentice to the haberdashery, and my wife minds the millinery business; on the 16th of October I went to Mrs. Banks's shop behind the New Church in the Strand, she keeps an open piece broker's shop, with a deal of lace in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100060"/> the window, and I called in there, and she shewed me a pattern of a very fine grounded black lace, she asked me what I thought I could give for it, I told her I could not tell unless I saw it, she said she had seen it, and it was a very good made one, and she said she would sell it to me for a penny a yard profit, she said she would shew it me in the afternoon, I saw this piece of lace, and from the description she gave of it, I thought I might buy it, I gave her four shillings a yard, she said she gave three shillings and eleven pence, or near it, and for the sake of turning a penny she could sell it for that small profit; I bought another piece of her that same day, and gave her twenty pence a yard for that; I have frequently seen laces in the window with a ticket to them, which led me to go into the shop, sometimes I thought them very dear, I have been in that line, I travelled for a capital shop some years ago.</p>
               <p>Did not this appear to you extremely cheap? - No, it did not, I shewed it to the trade, and I offered it for five shillings, I offered it to Mr. Collier in Holborn, at the bottom of the hill, he keeps a large haberdasher's shop; on the twenty-fifth, I went to Mr. Brown's house at eight in the morning, and told him I had got a fine lace, and should be much obliged to him to tell me the worth, I asked him if he thought it dear at four shillings and nine pence, he said he thought it cheap. I said if he would give me five shillings, for three pence a yard profit, I would sell it him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that true? - No, it was not true, but I did not know that a tradesman was obliged to tell his profits.</p>
               <p>No, but you was not obliged to tell him false, every man is bound to tell the truth if he tells his profit at all.</p>
               <p>How long have you dealt with this Mrs. Banks? - Not a great while, sometimes I have looked at the window and seen lace with a ticket to it at such a price, sometimes I have bought some twelve or fourteen yards, no particular length.</p>
               <p>You have had this lace in your possession then from the 16th of October to the 24th.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Brown. It struck you when this lace was produced by Podd that it was a lace of the same sort that you had in your box, how long before had you seen this lace in your box? - The 4th of October my partner had it with him on a journey, and returned to town on the 3d with that lace, it was then in that box, I did not tell your lordship that the lace cost me eight shillings per yard.</p>
               <p>Had Podd been at your house between the 4th and 24th of October? - I had not seen him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - I do not of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of this Mrs. Banks? - Not till I went to her house.</p>
               <p>The lace that was so produced by Podd, have you it here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what circumstance do you know it to be yours? - It is a lace of a particular texture, and a particular pattern, and very uncommon.</p>
               <p>Was there any shop mark or private mark upon it when it was brought to you by Podd? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Might there not be other lace of the same texture and pattern at other shops? - It is possible the length and pattern and texture corresponded with my own lace.</p>
               <p>You examined your books, I think you say, to see that the length corresponded, and the length corresponded exactly? - Yes, it was twenty-seven yards and an half.</p>
               <p>Do you mean it was nearly about that measure or exactly that measure? - It was either twenty-seven yards and an half or three quarters.</p>

               <p>Had you seen Mrs. Banks? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the prisoner before? - I think I have seen her in the shop, I cannot be positive, but it must have been some months back.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect having seen her between the time of your coming home and this lace being brought by Podd? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know that lace? - I have no doubt in the world but it is our lace, it is a remarkable fine lace, I am well acquainted with the pattern, and the length exactly corresponds with our invoice book.</p>
               <p>Is there any private mark on it? - It is not upon our card.</p>
               <p>Jury. I presume more of the same pattern and fabrick may have been made? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>I understood this piece of lace was not seen either by you or your partner, later than the 3d of October, and on the 24th of October Podd brought you this lace, a space of twenty days, is it usual for goods of that nature to lay so long? - O yes Sir! frequently.</p>
               <p>Podd. My Lord, Mr. Brown said he had the lace on the 18th, I therefore told him, I supposed it could not be his lace.</p>
               <p>Court to Podd. Have you ever taken it off the card, so as to see whether there is any mark on the card.</p>
               <p>Podd. I put it on that.</p>
               <p>What was upon it when you bought it? - I believe it was on a card covered with paper.</p>
               <p>Why did you take it off one and put it on another? - I believe it was too large to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100063"/> put in my pocket, I believe there was more lace on it, I left it to Mrs. Banks's.</p>
               <p>Court to Pope. What passed then? - Podd hesitated, he said, he came by it very honestly, he had bought it at a very reputable shop, he would not tell us the name of that shop, he had no right; we went to go to this shop, and we never knew where we were going till we came into Fleet-street; this is the same I had of Podd, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Podd. I likewise told Pope and Brown, I had bought lace that morning, if they had lost lace, I would shew it them.</p>
               <p>Court to Podd. When did Brown say he had seen the lace? - On the 24th; I think on the morning, or on the next evening, I am not quite clear, I told him I supposed it could not be his lace, for he said, he had it in his shop on Saturday, and shewed it to a lady on Friday; I told him I had had it in my possession ever since the 16th: On the 26th in the morning, he sent his apprentice to my house, to meet him in Bow-street about the fine lace; the boy said, Mr. Brown says, he had it in his house on Saturday, and shewed it to a lady on Friday; Miss Royle, who is now in Court heard Mr. Brown say so.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Is this true what this man says? - I do not know whether I might not say, I believe I saw it on the Friday.</p>

            ? - Very well, I have seen him several times.</p>
               <p>Do you remember selling him a piece of lace on the 16th of October? - I did.</p>
               <p>What price did you sell it at? - For four shillings, I bought it for three shillings and elevenpence.</p>
               <p>You have dealt in that business for some time? - Twenty-five years: I bought some fine lace of the prisoner, I was busy, I told her I had not time to look at it, I was afraid it was a died blond, and she left me a pattern.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - She has some time dealt in lace and other articles.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - Somewhere by Aldersgate-street, I have known her about ten months. I have bought several things of her; I can make lace on a pillow, and I have dealt these many years in lace, I thought it was a fine lace but not a serviceable one, several ladies looked at it, and did not like it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know at the time you bought it, that it was worth a great deal more than that price? - I absolutely did not, and I have dealt a great deal in lace. When the prisoner brought it it was put up in half yards, I put it on a large card, which is half a yard long and a quarter broad, which I keep on purpose that the thieves should not rob me.</p>

               <p>I sold the piece of lace to Mr. Pope and Brown, that very piece of lace, for eight shillings a yard; I believe it to be the same, it was lace of the same pattern and quality.</p>
               <p>Whose manufacture is it? - I cannot say, I bought it in the trade.</p>
               <p>Is not it very common when anew pattern is made to make a number of pieces of the same pattern? - A number of pieces cannot be made in a short time of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: It seems that you can hardly have sufficient certainty, that this is the same lace, without which, there is nothing at all to affect the prisoner; if I thought there was a sufficient ground to put the prisoner on her defence, I would then hear what she has to say.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are by no means satisfied as to the identity.</p>
               <p>Court. I did not think you would, it is too slight evidence, even to put the prisoner upon her defence, in my opinion.</p>

               <p>Did you see her do this? - Yes, she said then, the stockings would not do for her, and was going out, I told her, she had stole two pair; she said, she had not, she then pulled her apron off and shook her petticoats, and they fell from her: I locked them both in the shop, I put the key in my pocket for she wanted to go out; my master sent the maid for a constable: The prisoner Fagan, then asked me to let her go out, I told her I would not, for she was as bad as the other: Fagan then struck me and knocked me down against the stairs, and Ware struck me several times: I ran up stairs and called one of the journeymen down, and went down stairs again, then Charlotte Ware struck me again, and swore she would rip me up with a knife, which she was feeling for in her pocket, I then ran backwards where there were pistols loaded, I told her if she came near me I would blow her brains out? my master and mistress cried out do not shoot, and they were very much frightened; I held my hand down then, or else I had it pointed up to shoot her: Then I threw the pistol down the cellar, then she knocked me down and pulled my hair, and tried to choak me: then one of the men came down and got me from her: She then struck one of the men, and when the constable came, the prisoner Ware struck the constable and ran away; she was taken again: The other woman struck the constable several times, and they were both secured, and we went to the Justice's, and then she told me she would finish me.</p>

Then a hamper of wine and brandy came in, I went backwards, and the prisoner Ware followed me and took up a bottle, I do not know whether it was full or empty, she said, damn your eyes you old blood of a bitch! If you do not open the door and let me out, I will dash your brains out! She held me by the collar at arm's length, and stood over me with this bottle, and swore she would knock my bloody brains out! I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100065"/> frightened very much indeed: There were two men at work in the garret, and one of them was called down, and he said, you shall not kill my master, and he took her away, and just then the constable came to the door, what became of the bottle I cannot say, I expected nothing but to be knocked on the head.</p>

               <p>I was at work with this man up stairs, and George came up stairs and called us down, I said, run Tom, he seems frightened, I thought there was some fire; when I came near the bottom of the stairs I stopped, and he was telling Tom how she had stole stockings: She then put her hand to her pocket, and swore she should rip him up; then the boy went to the back part of the shop and took up a pistol, and I heard my master say do not shoot, and afterward. I saw her go to the back part, and there was a scuffle ensued, I went to their assistance; the woman had got the last witness by the threat, with the finger and thumb; and the other had hold of his ear: I was for to all the strength I had to open her hand, she was very strong indeed: We pulled her off of him, and he run up stairs; then my master went backwards, and she got hold of a bottle, and swore she would knock his bloody brains out, if he did not let her out, I said, she should not strike my master; then the constable came, and he desired me to go with him to prison, and while I put on my coat Ware got away from the constable, and the other was striking him; Ware was found in a public house, and the constable said, I durst not meddle with her, for there is a great number of thieves, so she got away once or twice, and I fetched one Collins and Mitchell from another house, and she was taken.</p>

Mr. Peacock frequently missed several sacks of flour, and at last suspecting the clerks intrusted in sending out flour and keeping the accounts of it, he taxed them with the defraud, upon which they confessed very plainly to him, that they had for sometime been in the habit of sending flour out of his house, and selling it under price to the prisoner: upon this they went before a justice of the peace, where the two clerks, Gilbertson and Wareham, confessed these facts, Gilbertson was admitted an evidence, and bound over to prosecute Wareham for the felony, and also to prosecute Smith the prisoner at the bar as an accessary to that felony in receiving the goods. Upon the trial of that indictment in Surry, Wareham was convicted, and Mr. Peacock now comes here to have that justice done against Mr. Smith, which has already been done upon Wareham. This case, now before you, being for receiving goods knowing them to be stolen, it is not necessary in the trial of an accessary to state all those facts over again which were proved on the conviction of the former prisoner; yet this case is so very particular, that you must have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100068"/> the same facts told you that were told on the former trial in Surry; but although this case depends on circumstances, and on the guilt confessed by the parties, yet, those circumstances and that guilt are so explicit, that there can, I think, remain very little doubt in your minds that the prisoner is guilty. The fact, among many others which I shall select for your consideration, in order to fix upon the prisoner the offence with which he is charged is this: I shall prove to you, that on the 1st of August last, six sacks of flour were taken in Mr. Peacock's cart by Mr. Peacock's man to Mr. Smith's house in <placeName id="t17831210-36-crimeloc204">White-Chapel</placeName>

                        targets="t17831210-36-off200 t17831210-36-crimeloc204"/>. I shall prove that by the evidence of the man who carried it, and also by the person who assisted him in the delivery; I shall also prove by Mr. Peacock, that there was no entry in his book of such sacks being issued from his warehouse, which is the usual way when the trade is a fair one, and conducted by clerks, not for their own benefit, but that of their masters. I think when these facts are proved by Gilbertson the clerk, and that the prisoner who dealt with Peacock paid but half the value for these sacks of flour, you can have no doubt but the prisoner bought this flour knowing it to be stolen, and that it was not flour he bought of Mr. Peacock in the common way of trade.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You live in the Borough I believe, Mr. Peacock, and deal very largely in flour, and keep a large wharf for other people, as well as yourself? - Yes, in the latter end of June, July, and August I was kept in doors with the gout, and in the course of that time, I lost about 140 sacks of flour; some was my own, and some what I had as a factor; I began to be very uneasy when I got about again, I accused my two clerks, Gilbertson and Wareham, and they confessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. You must not tell us what they said, unless this prisoner was present. - The prisoner was present at the time when they confessed it; I took them into the parlour, and as soon as ever they confessed they had sold this flour to Smith, I went with a friend and brought Smith to my own house, he denied it at first, but afterwards he owned it, and said he was willing to pay for it. They owned to selling Smith about 18 sacks of flour, or thereabouts, and after the prisoner heard what they said, he then said he was very willing to pay his share; that he had bought the flour at a guinea a sack, the same flour that cost me two guineas, and that he was very ready to pay his share of the money back again. He paid me two guineas a sack himself for some that I sold him in a fair way.</p>
               <p>Have you looked at your books, and seen whether there is or is not an entry of any flour delivered to Mr. Smith the first of August? - There is a memorandum I gave that gentleman just now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. That paper cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. No, I offer it only that he may look at it, and refresh his memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This circumstance cannot affect the man at the bar, it may affect the clerk, who should have made the entry.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think it evidence to go to the jury, the jury must judge only from facts that are within his knowledge; you may leave it to the jury whether they will presume this was a fair sale at a guinea, when he bought the same sort of Mr. Peacock at two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. Then I am not to ask him whether there is an entry on the first of August.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask him as to his knowledge of it. - I know of none after the 26th of July; he then bought five sacks the first of August, he charged one sack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I know you are in very great business Mr. Peacock, very great indeed, therefore your business is not conducted by yourself, but by your clerks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100069"/>You was ill ten weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then that flour was sold, was not sold by you, but by your servants? - I sold some.</p>
               <p>Therefore you have no: knowledge of any corn of any flour sold by yourself after the 26th of July? - No.</p>
               <p>They might have sold it and not made an entry you could not tell you know? - No.</p>
               <p>While you was ill you was obliged to trust to your servants. - There was none booked much after that time.</p>
               <p>Your clerks, though they have turned out bad, yet they have dealt and sold to a great many people. - Not to a great many.</p>
               <p>They have not always entered what they have sold fairly. - I do not find any misentries.</p>
               <p>There have been some sold to others, I suppose? - I cannot find where the flour is gone.</p>
               <p>Gilbertson himself had the power of selling your flour, and receiving your money for you. - Certainly.</p>
               <p>What was Wareham? - He was the clerk that used to look after the carts and keep the books.</p>
               <p>They were both concerned in a fair way of trade, in selling your property and receiving your money. - Wareham seldom did.</p>
               <p>Now who should I have applied to if I had come and you was ill, I should have applied to your servant, to your clerk? - The general rule was, they used to come in to me.</p>
               <p>But suppose I had met him at the market? - He would have sold it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. Your way of examining would be very good, if the prisoner was indicted with the man who stole, because, if you could shew it was not felony in the principal, it certainly would not be felony in the accessary; but in this case here is a conviction of the principal; and is not a conviction conclusive evidence?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe I, as councel, may controvert that conviction; there is a noted case in Foster, the case of Daniel and Egan.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish to see it; it is a nice and subtle distinction, because it is a general principle of law not to permit evidence to be given against a record. (Looks at the case.) I see the authority goes the full length of what you say; I am satisfied with it; it is an exception to a general rule of law, and the reason is very accurately given by Mr. Justice Foster, because the record is conclusive only against the party to that record: therefore you may certainly go on with this examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I have got the fact I wanted, that these are both clerks intrusted by Mr. Peacock to sell his property and receive the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve to Mr. Peacock. You say Wareham had not that authority which Gilbertson had. - He very seldom received money, and had no authority to send goods out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Wareham and Gilbertson were both in your employ, Gilbertson was clerk and book-keeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was Wareham's particular employ? - To look after the carts, and take the orders in, and send the goods out.</p>
               <p>He was in fact principal carman, that was his particular province. - He has some times received little sums, but it was not a part of his business, his business was entirely to look after the carts, and manage the wharf business.</p>
               <p>Had Wareham any authority to sell things out of your warehouses? - Yes, to common customers.</p>
               <p>Then he was so far intrusted, that if customers sent and Gilbertson or you was out of the way he might sell? - Yes, he has many and many times to pastry-cooks and others, little orders.</p>
               <p>Now Gilbertson during your absence conducted the business land had authority to sell? - Yes; when I am well I always go to market myself.</p>
               <p>Court. If these goods were stolen by any body, it is very strong evidence that this man received them knowing them to be stolen; and I am of opinion, and it has been ruled over and over again, and is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100070"/> every day practice; that for and through in with the custody of his master's property, and to whom it is intrusted for custody only; or for carridge, or for any other special purpose disposing of that is felony; the trust or posed in the servant does not take it out of the principal trust, the property rerfle us; unaffected but that vase seems to be very materially by different from this where a servant is entrusted to sell, and then contrary to that trust sells at an inferior price, and does not carry the money to account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is a gross fradd to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. What is become of Gilbertson? - He is admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Why he is the most guilty man of the three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. He was admitted an evidence to convict the other clerk.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I am very sorry in this case, though a gross fraud, that the law cannot reach this defendent upon this indictment, as an accessary to that fraud; That no desire of bringing offenders to justice must induce us to transgress the principles of Law.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of November I went to Mr. Jones's wine vaults, at the end of Widegate Alley, and I saw Baker snatch this bundle from the boy, I am sure it was him, I have seen him several times, but never spoke to him: they ran by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he lay hold of the boy or attempt to knock him down, or make use of any violence of that kind? - No, Sir, Abrahams went up to the end of Gravel lane and made a retreat back again; I cannot say they were in company, he was standing there; the boy was standing at the end of Widegate Alley when they snatched the bundle from him; but whether he stopped of his own accord, or whether they stopped him I cannot say, I saw Baker snatch it from him.</p>
               <p>Court to Neale. Where the things ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Abrahams? - I saw him the next day, and I saw him that night just before they took the bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Did you see Abrahams with Baker, just before Baker snatched the bundle? - Baker and Abrahams stood talking together at the corner before Baker snatched the bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did either of them say any thing to you? - No, neither of them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ABRAHAMS'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was apprehended on Tuesday morning about twelve o'clock; I was brought up to Justice Wilmot's Office and had my hearing; this little boy swore to me; I was sent to gaol for another examination on Friday; then this little boy could not swear to me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at work on the Monday when this was done; I came home at and worked till half after eight o'clock at night, I went to bed before nine, the door is ways locked up at nine.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Baker called for Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this offence is stated to be that of a highway robbery, and the indictment states all the requisites of such an offence: the distinction that is established in point of punishment between a common theft and an highway robbery, is intended to protect the personal safety of individuals; therefore it is that the law which makes a common theft only what we call a single felony, and always allows to it the benefit of clergy, punishes highway robbery with death: but in order to constitute a highway robbery, there must in point of law either be a putting in fear so as to excite an apprehension of personal danger to the party who is robbed, and by that means intimidate him to deliver his property, or else there must be actual force and violence used to his person: without one or other of these requisites a highway robbery cannot exist in point of law, and in all cases where these requisites are not found, if the Jury are satisfied that property is taken by a person, it becomes a simple theft and not a highway robbery. Now in this case there is no pretence to consider this as a highway robbery: one of the prisoners snatched the bundle, he never laid hands on the boy, he never spoke to him to threaten him, and though it was snatched with a degree of force to get it out of his hands, that is not the kind of force that the law means in the case of a highway robbery, for in this case there was no previous putting in fear, neither was there any violence used to the person of the boy, so that I am clearly of opinion that the evidence in this case will not support that part of the indictment which makes it a capital felony: but the indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100072"/> contain in it a sufficient description of a common theft therefore those words which would make it a capital offence if wanted may be so far separated from the rest of the indictment, as that you may find the prisoners guilty of the single felony, without that aggravated circumstance, if you are persuaded that those are the persons who committed the fact. Now subject to that observation in point of law; I will state to you the evidence. (Here the learned Judge stated the evidence to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>Are you sure he was the man that dropped the piece? - Yes, he was never out of my sight; I picked up the piece of cotton and brought it home; it was the same piece I saw the prisoner drop.</p>

About three o'clock the next morning, the watchman informed me this house was broke open; I went there and found the place in great confusion, the street door was open, and the things that were left were laid on the floor: I missed the things mentioned in the indictment: I called a constable, and we went down a court that is just facing the shop and we heard a noise in some rooms on the left hand side of the court: we were informed by a woman, where the property was, and we went and found it; I think it was in the same room where the noise was; neither of the prisoners were in the room; half an hour after, we met one of them coming down stairs, and we took Cox at a publick house afterwards, and the two women were also taken.</p>

I asked him where they were, he said he did not know, the knives were gone, and the window was up; this was up one pair of stairs; a person came from the next door, and said he had taken a person with some silver handled knives and forks, which were the same I lost.</p>

             brought back the prisoner and the handkerchiefs, I laid them in the window in the morning myself, and I saw them in the course of the day several times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council, Mr. Keys. There is no shop mark on them? - No.</p>
               <p>Then they are only such sort of handkerchiefs as you lost? - They are such sort as I am positive they are my handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>It is a very common pattern? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>There are dozens and dozens of them in London? - I cannot tell how many may be made of them, I never had any of this pattern before.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from the corner of the street? - Four houses.</p>
               <p>It was a pretty dark night was not it? - I believe it was.</p>

               <p>I live in Rosemary Lane, about five houses down after you come out of King-street, I was standing at the door, and there was a sudden alarm with the cry of stop thief! I looked out and saw the prisoner running, I suspected him to be the thief, I immediately crossed the way and caught him in my arms with the property upon him, these were the handkerchiefs I delivered to Mrs. Salter; when I caught him in my arms, he fell down and threw the handkerchiefs from him, and a man that stood by picked them up, I am sure he had the handkerchiefs upon him when I stopped him, because I saw them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you say before the Justice that you saw the handkerchiefs drop from him? - Yes, I say now what I said then, and no more.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Stewart by at the time? - He saw the window broke.</p>

               <p>On Saturday evening between seven and eight o'clock, I was going down King-street, I observed the prisoner standing in the middle of the street below Mr. Salter's shop, I thought him to be a servant to a friend of mine, and crossed to speak to him but found he was not the person I thought he was; I was only going a little way to the Post Office, and I came back immediately, when I turned round, I observed another person standing with him in the middle of the street, the man and himself were the only people I believe in the street, I then saw them go to the corner of Mr. Salter's window, and look into the window, and immediately the window was broke, the other person had a blue great coat on, the prisoner at the bar made a snatch at something, it was very light being opposite to the tobacconist's shop, and the light of Mr. Salter's shop, the prisoner turned down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100077"/> Rosemary Lane, I perceived several things fell down on the ground, I am not mistaken in the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you consider that this young man's life depends on your evidence? - Yes, I well remember his dress.</p>
               <p>What did you say before the Justice? - I said, I saw the prisoner in the street, when I went down the street.</p>
               <p>Have not you said, Sir, that you thought it was the other boy that broke the window? - One of them certainly did it, for there was nobody else close to the window, I cannot say the prisoner broke it.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the handkerchiefs were found? - No, I only went to the corner, and cried stop thief! One of them had gone down Rosemary Lane.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When that gentlemen was before the Justice he would only say that he saw the handkerchiefs in my hand as I was running, and if the gentleman was to speak God's now, he knows to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen; doubts have at sometimes what should be considered as a sufficient breaking or entering to constitute the crime of burglary, and upon that several determinations have been made, and the Judges have from time to time decided what cases were in their opinion within, that law, and they have been very strict in their construction of this law, and have considered any of any thing that was that and fastened, to be a sufficient breaking, and any the entering, even the putting in a hand, to be a sufficient in this case to be sure the breaking and entering does not appear to be very strongly within the law of burglary, for the intention of that law was most certainly to protect people in the hours of rest from injury and depredation; to protect them in the secure enjoyments of their dwellings, was certainly the original and principal reason of the law with respect to burglary; and if therefore, such cases as this at the bar were now and undecided upon, I should have doubted very much whether they came within the reason of that law, but it is my duty to tell you, that this circumstance of breaking a shop window has been decided by the Judges to be a burglary, therefore, I am bound to state to you the law, if you believe the fact it is sufficient to support the indictment.</p>

               <p>I was walking near Shoreditch Church, in Kingstand Road, I met the two prisoners at the bar, on the 7th of November, about twelve o'clock at noon, I passed them at first: I recollected they had been in my custody before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know you are not to tell us that? - I am telling you the reason why I stop them.</p>
               <p>But you are not to tell us your reasons. - I am not talking to you, I am talking to my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit to your Lordship, that this man who is an officer of justice, is not to tell us his reasons, why he stopped them.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. You knew them before and therefore you stopped them? - Yes, they are mother and daughter, I asked the young one what she had got in her lap, she said, she was moving from the other end of the town, and had taken lodgings in Kings-land Road, I then asked the mother whether she knew it to be a fact, that the daughter was moving, she said it was a fact, and she was assisting her. I then insisted upon knowing what she had in her apron; there I found two gowns, and a scarlet cloak, and a sheet; I carried them before Justice Wilmot, the young one (Slade) said, she had fetched them out of pawn in Oxford Road, I then asked the Magistrate leave to enquire into the facts; in the mean while the prosecutor's wife came up to the office, wringing her hands, and saying they were robbed, I told them to make themselves easy, I shewed them the things, and the woman said they were hers.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any other things found but these? - No, they were in the prisoner Slade's lap, and this key I found on her, which opens the prosecutor's door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How do you know that, did you ever try it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then do not tell us any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was present when it was tried in the door? - The wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Eggleston. Did you go with him when he tried that key? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Yardley. What did you do with the key you found on the prisoner? - I delivered it to one of our officers, he is not here. I received this key from him.</p>
               <p>I want to understand a little further about this key, whether you are entitled to introduce it, in the manner you have done, to the jury; you having found a key on one of the prisoners, delivered that key to one of your officers, who is not here? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100079"/>Who was he? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You have now a key in your hand which has been delivered to you by somebody. - Yes.</p>
               <p>From whom did you receive it? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>So that you do not recollect to whom you gave that key, nor from whom you received this? - I do not, I know it was a very remarkable key.</p>
               <p>By what was it remarkable, Sir? - It was worn with rust.</p>
               <p>Now I want to know, Mr. Yardley, whether in the whole course of your life, as a thief-taker, you ever knew a key identified in such manner; is it by a key being worn with rust, Sir, that you affect to identify it in a court of justice? - There is not a doubt in my mind.</p>
               <p>It is not your saying bluntly here, that there is not a doubt in your mind, that will induce the Court or Jury to believe it: by what marks. Sir, will you make the Court and Jury believe that that is the key which you took on the woman, which key you gave to you do not know who, and have received a key from somebody you cannot describe. How will you make us believe it is the same key?</p>
               <p>Court, looking at the key. It is a very remarkable key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Not, my Lord, because it has been eat up with rust.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. You gave it to one of your officers, you cannot recollect which, to go to try the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was the key returned to you? - In the course of three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the key, and observe the wards and the shape of it? - I have not a doubt of the key.</p>
               <p>But answer my question. - I did, because it was an old worn out key, I thought there was not such another.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the wards, and the shape? - I cannot take upon myself to say as to the wards, but I know it was much eaten with rust.</p>
               <p>(The things that were produced deposed to by the prosecutor's wife.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you remember any circumstance of a key being given to open the door with? - I know Yardley gave me a key to try to open the door, I am sure of that; I tried it, and it opened the door readily.</p>
               <p>Was the key you opened the door with, the same you gave to Yardley again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Yardley. Was the key you gave him to open the door with, the same you found on the prisoner Slade? - It was.</p>
               <p>You have not changed it; - I could not, I had none to change it with; I know I gave it to one of our officers, but whether I gave it to the woman I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it not changed when you gave it to the officer? - I am sure it is the same key.</p>
               <p>Was it out of your sight? - It was in a box, but I am sure it is the same I gave the officer.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you coming home, or was you fetched home? I was coming home, but as I came along, a lamp-lighter told me, he believed there was a thief gone down Mr. Wells's Area, I made what haste I could, I was rather lame, I went out of the great door, and I believe the area-gate was open; there is a partition which divides the house-keeper's room from the kitchen; the women were washing the kitchen, and with their pattens on the stone floor they made such a noise that any body might come in and not be heard.</p>

How do you know that? - There was no other way for any body to get in, there was company in the house, I did not hear any particular noise to suspect any thing of that sort, one of my servant girls, who is not here, went up into the room, it is a bed-chamber facing Duke's-court, and upon her informing me I went up stairs, there is a case of drawers in the room, and I saw one of the drawers taken out from the case, and laid empty on the bed, the sash was down, but not fastened, and the door shut; it did not appear how any body got in, I was at this drawer about fifteen minutes before, I cannot say whether it was locked or not, the things mentioned in the indictment were missing, the window is about nine feet high, the room door was locked, and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Then how did the maid get in? - I gave her the key a minute before, I have two papers which were in the pocket-book, which were found in a publick-house in Downing-street, I have none of the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>What leads you to suspect the prisoners? - I should not have suspected them for it, but when I came down stairs again, I went to the door, and there were four men standing in the court, who informed me of them.</p>
               <p>Are any of them here? - No.</p>

               <p>Can you swear it is one of the sheep you killed? - Certainly, Sir, every man has a different mark to the sheep he kills, my master knows this to be my mark, there are nine cuts.</p>
               <p>Does no other butcher mark them so? - Yes, but there are different ways of marking them, I can safely swear this is my own mark.</p>

               <p>Court to Columbine. You told me before that the prisoner Weston parted company with Solomons, and you lost Weston; when did you take Weston after? - I took him out of bed the next morning, I had information where he was.</p>

            ; I lost a watch, a chain and seals, and a guinea, on or about the 2d of May, but I am not positive; I was coming along Fleet-street, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and the prisoner came up to me, it was a pretty warm day, and the prisoner said it was not so warm in his country, I looked round at him and he said he came from Scotland, and on saying these words he looked down on the pavement, and picked up a green silk purse: he said, here is something; I asked him what was in it, he said, he supposed it was bank notes, as he felt something soft, he said, I had a right to part of it, or he would give me part of it, and he proposed to go to the other side of the way to see what was in it, for he said, if we opened it in the street some person would come and own it, and we went into a house at the end of <placeName id="t17831210-48-crimeloc269">Chancery-lane</placeName>

(The ring and purse shewn to the Court.) Then another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100086"/> young man came in, and the prisoner asked him to read the receipt; he said he would; he said he was a clerk to Mr. Drummond, of Charing Cross, the Banker: I never had the receipt, the prisoner kept it: the young man asked the prisoner where he found it, the prisoner said he found it just now, the other young man told me after reading the receipt, I need not be afraid of him, for he was a clerk; the prisoner said he would give money for my part, for he had a friend going to the East Indies, and it would be of more service to him, and he would leave the ring with the other gentleman, the pretended clerk, while he went to seek his friend; he went, and returned, and said his friend was not at home: the pretended clerk said, it was dangerous to let him go away, for there were a great many sharpers about London: as the prisoner said he would call again, the clerk said, there was so many sharpers about, it was not safe to let him go away with it, so I gave him my watch and a guinea, and he left me the ring.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your watch again? - No, but it is here.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - I think it was the 28th of October; I found him coming along the Strand; he came and beckoned to me as if he wanted to make an acquaintance of me; I thought I knew him, I held him and kept him fast, and carried him to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood of Council for the Prisoner. My Lord, this is an indictment for a felony; I humbly submit to your Lordship, that on the part of the prosecutor there was an agreement entered into; the prosecutor left the watch in the hands of the prisoner, and the purse was put into the hands of the prosecutor, and therefore if there was any deceit whatever, either on one side or the other, I should humbly apprehend that it is not a felony, but a contract.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. My Lord, there was a case where the man was convicted, but that was for snatching money.</p>

            , is indicted for stealing this watch and a guinea, and the prosecutor luckily for public justice was too wise to accept the watch and guinea again, but has brought the prisoner before you: This is what is vulgarly called a swindling transaction; an evident sharper who makes it his business to pick up unwary countrymen of this kind, to impose on them in this manner by so gross a fraud: It has happened to myself since I have had the honour of sitting here, to try two or three of these people, but not exactly under the same circumstances; two I think, I tried, and they were both convicted, but the circumstances were different from this; however, I have talked with the Recorder, and also with Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Sheldon, who are extremely conversant in the business here, and they concur with me, that there have been cases of this kind where prisoners have been convicted of a felony: And it has been determined by the Judges, that a man shall not under a pretence and guise of fraud, be enabled to plunder an innocent man, and they have gone to the bottom, to the true found principle to guide them by, they have enquired why, with what view was it, that all this was done, and as in this case, for what was it that this man produced this ring, for what was it that he said, he would go to his friend and get money for this ring, for what purpose was all that done, but to obtain from this prosecutor the watch and the guinea; if the intention was fair, if in truth there was such a friend, then it would be a fair transaction, a foolish one on both sides, but a fair one. But it is to be left to you gentlemen of the Jury, whether under all the circumstances of the case you believe the whole to be a fraud and imposition on the prosecutor, and if you do, you will then consider what was the intention of the prisoner in holding this discourse, and in the whole transaction; whether it was with intent to get into his possession the watch and guinea, never intending to restore them: And if so, of course then you will conclude that he intended feloniously to obtain the watch and guinea: If a man hires a horse and rides away with it, it is felony: So here, if this man got possession of the watch and money by this pretence, with intention either to sell the watch or convert it to his own use, it is a felonious intent. If you suppose the transaction was a fair one, and that the prisoner had such a friend, in that case to be sure you will acquit him; but if you think his intention was felonious in obtaining this watch and the guinea, in that case you will find him guilty of the charge in the indictment.</p>

            , it was dark, rather nearer eight o'clock then seven at night, I asked him where he lived, he said, No. 4, Leicester-street, Leicester-fields; and the prosecutor came to enquire for a stray horse, and I told him there was one with a bridle but not a saddle, he said, the mare and bridle were his.</p>
               <p>Is that the man that brought the mare? I believe it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Never before that I know off.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I had been to Smithfield last Friday was fortnight, and sold a horse, and coming home, I saw this horse about the top of Great Queen-street loose, I laid hold of the horse, and took home the saddle for safe custody, and took the horse to the Green-yard, I told the prosecutor I would send<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100089"/> the saddle home to the Green-yard, says he to me, if you send the saddle home I would not wish to hurt any young man, I did not take the horse with any intent to steal it, if I had, I should not have taken it to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes to Mackland. What did he say when he brought her? - I asked him where he found her, he said, near Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Did he bring to you to take care of? - He brought her to me as a stray</p>
               <p>Then he could not have had the mare again from you? - No, my Lord</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice That puts quite a different complexion on the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Hotham, Gentleman of the Jury, he certainly could not the mare again, but I see the transaction in this light, that his object was not to keep the mare, but to get the saddle to sell, and to get the shilling from the Talbot Inn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. He is not indicted for stealing the saddle, but for stealing the mare.</p>

               <p>I went by information to the prisoner Field's house, No. 7, Park-lane, on this day week, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, Hall lodged with Field upstairs, but there was nothing found in his room. When we went to the house I met a woman, which I thought was Mrs. Field, and I asked her if one Hall lodged there, she said he was down in the kitchen; she called Hall, and somebody answered, I went down, and found the prisoner Hall; he looked at me, and said, I suppose you came after this box; I did not know what he meant by that; I said, yes, I am come after the box, where is it? he said, it is up stairs; says I, have you made away with any of the things? no, he said he had not, the things were all safe. When we had got up stairs, some of Mr. Gosling's people came up; the trunk was in Field's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100091"/> bed-chamber; then Hall and I went into Field's room and Mrs. Hardcastle looked at the box and found it was locked, and she pulled out a key and unlocked it after some difficulty; there were some things in it, but she missed several things; I turned round to Hall, and said, did not you tell me the things were all safe? Oh! said he, they are all to be found; and he went down into the kitchen were I found him first, and I went down with him and he pulled the things that are in this handkerchief out of the drawers; they were brought up and shewn to Mrs. Hardcastle, and she said there were still some more things wanting; then Hall said there was an apron and some sort of a locket or thing that ladies wear about their neck; he said he had sold them: he said, the trunk was found at the end of Park-lane, going into Pically: Field was not at home; he came house while she was there, I stopped him; there was a good many of the things wanting; so Hall said, your wife has taken some of the things out here; he said, he did not know any thing at all of it; says he, damn your things; if my wife has got any of them you must have them; I will break the drawers open and you shall have them; then he took some keys that we had tried before, and could not open the drawers, but he got them open; I believe he sent for some keys, but he opened three drawers which we could not get open.</p>
               <p>Did he open the drawers with those keys or with any other keys? - I do not know, I believe the keys lay on the escrutore; and all the things that are in this white handkerchief were found in the drawers; Mrs. Hardcastle and Mrs. Cartwright were present all the time.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetworth Council for the Prisoners. Field was not at home? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe he came in from his work; had not he a pail in his hand? - He had two pails.</p>
               <p>Did Field appear to you, from the observation you made when he came in, to have any knowledge of the things being in his house? - I cannot think he could miss seeing this box, because it stood by the bed side; but from his conduct I had every reason to think he did not know the things were in his drawers.</p>
               <p>I believe the Justice was of the same opinion? - I believe every body has a good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Did not Hall say to him these words, I believes your wife has some of the things in her drawers? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Did not he take up a poker to break open the drawers, and was persuaded not? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>You enquired after him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What character did you learn of him? - A hardworking honest man.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hardcastle. There were keys found on the top of the drawers; Macmanus opened some of the drawers; there were two drawers that could not be opened till Field came, he opened one with a key, the other he could not open: Macmanus said, they must be opened, there is a poker; Field immediately took the poker and attempted to open the drawers; he seemed very concerned and very much surprized when my things were found in his possession: I had several letters in my box, some directed at me at Mr. Gosling's, Lincoln's-Inn Fields, and some in the country. I had a large parcel of manuscripts, poetry, and bills and receipts, and many things that I valued very much, and Hall had burnt them the night before: the gentleman went down into the kitchen and found several scraps of my papers half burnt; I had likewise a common leather memorandum book which Hall sold for two-pence with the papers that were in it which I valued exceedingly: I had likewise a very large parcel of poetry; Hall afterwards, when I asked him why he burnt them, said, for fear of leading to a discovery, because he meant to sell my clothes.</p>

               <p>I saw something lying in Piccadilly, I did not know what it was; my landlady lent me the key; it contained woman's apparel, I never found it advertized; there was advertized a trunk and box: I got it honestly and I had sold two or three of the things out of it, which I redeemed with my own money; the things were found in my landlady's drawers unknown to me; nobody can say a wrong word of me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FIELD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I came in the doors about eight o'clock in the morning; the lady was there in the room, I stept in and said what is the matter; says they, here is so and so; I said, if there is any thing belonging to you, I will take the poker and wrench the locks open, will be damned if I do not; I went to do it: Macmanus said get the key: I went right across the way, and my daughter had the key; says I, why do not you give me the key, what do you keep me in this purgatory for: I am innocent of the thing as a child unborn.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday three weeks as I was coming down Islington, about 11 or 12 o'clock at night, by the Bank-side, I met with one of these prisoners, Carter, the corner of a street, I asked her if there was any house open, as I could not get a lodging, she persuaded me to go with her, I cannot say where she took me to, but I have been since informed it was <placeName id="t17831210-58-crimeloc323">Three Kings Court</placeName>

               <p>Where was the prisoner Harrison when you fell asleep? - To the best of my remembrance she lay down by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober? - I was not sober, but I was not any ways in liquor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100097"/>Are you sure that the other prisoner was in the room at all, when you want to sleep, Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there a light in the room when you went to sleep? - Yes, and when I awaked: I awoke about one or two, and my things were all gone. I am sure these things were all in my pocket when I went to bed; I immediately went to the watchman and the officer of the night, but every thing was gone.</p>

               <p>About 11 o'clock I went to the Fleet-Market to an acquaintance, to have some supper; coming home about half after, I met the prosecutor, he asked me the way to Dock-head, I told him it was a great way from thence; it was in Cheapside I met him, I told him he might go home with me if he chose it, he came home with me, and he sent for some bread and cheese and a pot of beer; he was very much in liquor, at last he went to bed, and he gave me some things to take care of till he awaked, and he said if I took care of them till the morning he would make me a handsome present.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go away with them then? - I only went into the same street to a public house to get a drop of purl to warm me; before I came back that gentleman waked, and was out in the street, I have not a friend in London.</p>

               <p>I was not in the house when the man came in, I called for some cloth I had left in her room, I fetched two pots of beer and went home, I could not get in; coming back again, I did not like to come to her house, and went into this public house where she was drinking; I had a pint of purl by myself, she was much in liquor, she said, I wish you would go home with me, and take care of these things, for if the man should wake, he will think I am gone off with them; she gave me these things for fear she should lose them. Carter was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you give this woman the things to take care of? - No, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court to Hawes. Where were these women when you first found them? - At the sign of the Ship, in White-cross-street, about three or four hundred yards from where they live.</p>
               <p>What were they doing when you first saw them? - They were drinking.</p>
               <p>Not coming away that you saw? - No, I asked the prisoner where the man's property was when I laid hold of her; she said, she had no property but what was her own.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for the crime of forgery, and before this offence could be carried into effect, the person committing it must also have been guilty of the crime of perjury, for he must have sworn he was the executor under that will, by which means he obtained the probate. Some time since, a man of the name of Farquharson died; the prisoner by some means heard, that enquiries were making for his executor, for there was a great deal of wages due to him. That gave the prisoner the idea of setting up a will; he immediately went to the Commons, and there produced a will in the name of

               <p>Court. Had you any marks in your books? - These books were not marked, but the singularity of the binding renders them beyond a doubt, I can swear to them, that word Olivet has been lettered under the first lettering piece, owing to a mistake that was made.</p>

               <p>Did they both say so? - Johnson particularly said so before the constable came.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hayes called on me on the 29th in the morning, I went round with him to the Pawn-brokers, and we called at Rushton's; he informed us as you have heard, and we waited till the two prisoners came in, I then went into the shop, Mr. Hayes went for an officer; I looked at the books, and asked Johnson what he expected for the books; Johnson said, half a guinea; I observed they were Latin, I said, did he read Latin; he said, no, he could not read Latin; I then said they were not compleat, there were other volumes of the work, and it was extraordinary he should have books he could not read, I asked him where he got them, he said, he bought them of a man in Wapping the night before, he said he did not know who he was, he believed he was a smuggler, he bought them in the street; this was merely for the purpose of amusing them till Mr. Hayes returned with an officer, I then expressed my suspicions, that they were not honestly come by, he said he gave eight shillings for them, then Mr. Hayes, came in, and they were taken before the justice. I believe Birmingham was the person who brought the books, but I do not recollect he said a word about them; Johnson was the man that said he had bought them, and described the manner of them before the justice; Johnson said, a man offered him the books in Wapping, and that Birmingham told him they were valuable, and persuaded him to buy them, that he might get something by them; they were there examined apart: Birmingham said they bought them at Wapping, they disagreed in the time, one said they were up at Holborn with them at six o'clock, and the other at ten, they described their lodgings very differently, one said they lay together in the same bed, and the other, that they lodged in the same street in separate rooms.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hayes. What is the value of these books? - To me they are of much more value than to another; I have valued them at thirty shillings, I thought I could not do less.</p>
               <p>PRISONER JOHNSON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming up Wapping, and I met a man accidentally, he asked me to buy these books, he asked me eight shillings, and I gave him eight shillings, I then came home to bed, I sent Birmingham the next morning to see if he could sell them; my sister maintains me at present.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BIRMINGHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I carried the books for this man, I thought to dispose of them, Johnson told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100108"/> me he would pay me for my trouble; the first shop I came to, I said, she did not belong to me; I sold the first for eighteen pence, and gave this man the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you sell them for? - For this man, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Johnson called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>About a month ago I was at Mr. Pigott's house, when the prisoner came to it, Mr. Pigott was out, Mrs. Pigott informed me that it was the prisoner, and that there was a warrant out against him for stealing Mr. Pigott's harness, and some livery, the prisoner came to beg forgiveness, upon which he was detained till the legal officer came to take him into custody, he went down stairs, and attempted to go out of the door, but the servant had put the chain up at the door, he did not endeavour to escape by any precipitation, I desired him to go into another room, I asked him several questions respecting the harness, where he had taken them to, and what he had done with them, at last he told me they were at a certain person's house, whose name I have really forgot now, though I took it down in writing, he told me he had taken them and pawned them, and told me the name of the place or the street.</p>

               <p>I live at the sheeps head shop, in Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Broad-yard? - Close to it, the last witness is my sister; on Sunday the 19th of October, she and I were looking out of window a little before four o'clock, I saw two men go down the street with large bundles under their arms, and in about ten minutes after, they came down the street again.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of them? - To the best of my knowledge I think the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was one of them? - To the best of my knowledge I think he as.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Not to notice him much, I do not think I ever have; I saw him at the Rotation-Office about a fortnight ago, I then said, to the best of my knowledge I believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the best of your knowledge; can you be sure that he was the man, or that he was not? - I think to the best of my knowledge that he is the man; when I saw him again, I thought I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man, or have you any doubt of it? - No, I have no doubt of it at all but he is the man.</p>
               <p>You are sure he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so at the Justices? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing him at the time? - Because seeing them pass in sermon time made me take more particular notice of them, as they went down the street, and came up again, and the other stopped and tied up his garters, and Rich crossed the way.</p>
               <p>Did you see these men's faces? - I could see Rich's face very plain, he had a cocked hat on, but the other had a hat over his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said at the Justice's, that she could not swear I was the person, she said I had my hair curled? - His hair was in curls in his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wore my hair any otherwise than it is now.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he on? - A white coat, a black waistcoat, and a cocked hat.</p>

               <p>How came it you did not stay at home to let them in? - Because they meant to have it seem that people got into the house, they had a key to get in by.</p>
               <p>How did they know that key would open the door? - Because it was tried before.</p>

               <p>I am the officer, I have two half-crowns and a shilling, I was called on November the 22d to take up a suspicious person, I went to Mr. Womersly's shop, and he charged the prisoner with taking money out of the till, and insisted on seeing what money he had in his pocket, he made no hesitation, he put his hand in his right-hand pocket, and pulled out three guineas, four half-crowns, and three shillings and put down; among the money were these two half-crowns and this shilling, that was marked; his master said then, John, I am afraid thee hast not done right; he is a Quaker, says he, here is some of the money that was taken out of the till, says the prisoner, Sir, I have taken seven shillings which you borrowed of me in the morning, and had repaid myself out of the till, he said, John, I paid thee that in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the master here? - No, he is a Quaker, and he will not swear.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. As it depends on the prisoners asserting on the one side, that his master had borrowed money of him, and his master asserting on the other side that he had paid him again, and as the master does not come here to swear it; it would be a great deal too much to convict the prisoner.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went to see Mrs. Riley, and I was coming out, a spoon lay on the ground, and I trod upon it, and I was frightened, and I put it into my pocket: I went to this gentleman and asked him if he bought or changed old silver, I did not know what to do with it when I found it; I did not not intend to steal it.</p>
               <p>Court to Riley. Has she any relation that lives with you? - Not that I know of, my Lord, I have a good many servants: She was first hired as a kitchen-maid, and my wife thought her too decent a person for a kitchen-maid, and she made her housemaid.</p>
               <p>What made you part with her? - I believe my wife did not like her servitude, not for any theft I will assure you; if she had gone up stairs among all the plate I had, I should not have suspected her.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called three Witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>

               <p>I was coming along, I was a little in liquor, and that gentleman took hold of me, and one of them struck me, I struck him again, I did not know what I was taken for, they told me I had taken the bundle from the child, and they brought the boy before me, and he said I was not the man till I went to the watch-house, then the boy said it was me. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this prisoner is indicted for a highway robbery upon this boy, now it seem to me, and Mr. Recorder agrees with me in thinking that the evidence does not amount to a robbery on the highway, for though he snatched the bundle away, yet there was not that degree of force nor of terror that is necessary for a party to be under to constitute a robbery, and it would be too much therefore to make it so serious an offence as the law considers a highway robbery to be; but you are at full liberty to find him guilty of the larceny, and acquit him of the capital part.</p>

               <p>My Lord, it is very difficult to swear to property in lead pipes, I can only say, about three months before this happened, I had a quantity of lead pipe put in the kitchen for the convenience of lodgers, when I went on the Saturday after the robbery was committed, the pipe was then gone; I cannot swear to the identical pipe.</p>

             was my servant, Mr. Blackborough sent two of his people with some locks, desiring me to look at them, they had been found in a house that he suspected for stolen goods, I knew them immediately to be mine, they were patent locks, and had my marks on them, I went to Mr. Blackborough, he asked me some questions which led me to suspect the warehouseman, he was a weekly servant, and we agreed that when he went home in the evening, he should be followed and his lodgings searched, they followed him, and in a short time they returned with him, and a considerable deal more property than had been taken that evening, in taxing him with it he was a good deal moved, and frankly confessed that he had robbed me of several things, then he equivocated by and by, and said he intended to pay me two guineas which he had borrowed the next morning before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Council for the Prisoner. I beg that Mr. Oldham may be stopped as to any thing that the other prisoner said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham. After these people were taken up, the prisoner Jones came and appeared to be very busy in getting these people off.</p>

               <p>Did you know these were lost before Lennard was apprehended? - These locks were marked and put into a particular shew-glass for gentlemen to see, they have been stolen out of that shew-glass, and have never been sold, and they were hudled together with wrong keys.</p>
               <p>Mr. Isaacs.

               <p>Court, No, Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When Jones was present what did they say? - Mrs. Brett declared she had the property of Jones, and Jones has repeatedly at my house, offered Redgrave and me five guineas a piece not to say any thing about it, and that we might do what we would with the locks.</p>

               <p>Your information was against Mrs. Dunn or her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In which house Jones did not live? - No.</p>
               <p>In which house he had no shop? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>And in which house Jones did not carry on any business? - That I do not know, he might.</p>
               <p>You and I have very different accounts of this offer? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Where did this happen? - At my house, he was a prisoner then.</p>
               <p>In what way do you mean? - He was taken for receiving these things by Mrs. Brett's declaring she had these things from him.</p>
               <p>Was this an offer to suppress the evidence against Jones, or an offer of commiseration to Mrs. Brett? - It was to suppress the evidence against Jones, he offered to give Redgrave and me five guineas apiece not to say any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg Mrs. Dunn and Mrs. Brett may go out of Court? - Court. It is too late now.</p>
               <p>Will you swear this man was in custody at that time? - Yes, it was after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Did not he say he would rather give five guineas? - There was no saying rather five guineas at all about the matter, he positively declared he would give five guineas apiece, if we would say nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was there at that time any intention of prosecuting Jones? - Yes, he was then committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oldham. I had then taken a warrant out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Isaacs. When was it? - The 22d of October, I believe it was three days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. The offer was after he was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not you know that Jones himself went to Mr. Blackborough's, and was there discharged? - That was on the night of the 21st.</p>
               <p>He went voluntarily to the Justice's? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>You did not take him there? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any body else to your knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he went voluntarily? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>What do you know of these locks? - Mrs. Dunn very frankly told us she had them of Mrs. Brett; I went to Mrs. Brett, she was at home, and she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When Jones was before the magistrate, who did she say she had them from? - From Jones; Jones came the same night, and denied she had them of him, he came the next morning to Mr. Isaacs, he said he would make an acknowledgment provided we would stifle the matter; he said all these things should be delivered up provided the matter was settled, and no prosecution had.</p>

               <p>Was you to do nothing with them in the mean time? - Nothing Sir, she thought her house was not safe enough, for the lock she had on her door was not a good one, and any body could get in, and she was afraid of being robbed.</p>

               <p>These people took you away I believe? - I was obliged to go to say how I came by them.</p>
               <p>I suppose you mean just what I said, that they took you away? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Had not they a warrant against you? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>What do you believe about it? - I do not believe any thing about it, I cannot believe, because I do not think any thing about it; I went to Justice Blackborough's.</p>

               <p>You believe him to be an honest man? - I know nothing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Where do you live? - I keep a publick house in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear any harm of him? - With respect to his way of dealing is no, is no business of mine.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of his being in trouble? - I have.</p>
               <p>For what? - I do not know; some time ago there was something happened: I did not live at this end of the town, I came here by accident.</p>
               <p>Do not you know friend was tried here?</p>

               <p>Where does he live? - In Fleet-lane, he is an undertaker by trade, and keeps an iron shop besides.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with you last week along with Jones? - Mr. Woodward and I went in together to see Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation? - In regard that he would satisfy me as far as lay in his power, that Woodward himself had bought some locks, or a lock, he did not say where he bought them.</p>
               <p>What was he to do with these locks that he had bought; do recollect yourself; you have told Catchpole? - I never told Catchpole: he was to bring them here to shew that he bought some locks; he never told me who he bought them of.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Where was this conversation? - In Woodward's own little room in his house, and once in Newgate.</p>
               <p>So then this terrible conspiracy and consultation turns out to be no more than this, that Woodward was telling Jones what he could say with truth upon the trial: he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100137"/> not say a syllable about the purpose of producing them here? - No.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A plane maker, my wife keeps an iron shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Brett has been in Newgate a number of times since I have been there, and said, she deserved to be there instead of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. These locks were not lost till October, and those they produce were bought as they say on the 29th of September.</p>

I doubt whether in this case there is any property in the prosecuton, it differs from the case, she was the carrier, and I think the property of this is wrong laid in the indictment, and in point of law the prisoner must be acquitted; at all events the case does not come up to the indictment, which is for a highway robbery, for the coat was not obtained from her by threat or violence, and the man throwing himself down for her to fall down, in order that the other might avoid the pursuit, was a subsequent transaction, and could not alter the circumstances of the robbery at all.</p>

               <p>I live in Baker's Row, Whitechapel, I was going over to Mr. Robertson's facing my house, I was upon my own steps about half past five o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner came up to me and laid hold of the coat, I was not willing to give it up, and he pulled it so hard that I slipped down the steps; it was a child's great coat, belonging to Mr. Robertson, the publican, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner forcibly take it from you? - Yes, he said nothing to me, and after he had got the coat, he took his hat off his head and violently threw it at me; I picked up the hat and carried it into Mr. Robertson's house, and told him I was robbed, he pursued the prisoner, who ran away with the coat.</p>

               <p>Did you see it? - Yes, I heard it fall, and picked it up.</p>

On Wednesday morning last, when I came from Ramsgate, I found Sir Sampson Wright had sent for me to go to identify this man, I never found my watch again; I am positive the prisoner is the same man, I had him in my hands for a quarter of an hour, and in the shop of the upholsterer, where there was light sufficient; if I was not quite sure, I would not give the least hint in the world, but I am positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You are absolutely sure that you felt somebody take your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now as to your certainty of the prisoner, you have no doubt but he was the man that was a quarter of an hour in your hands, I can easily conceive that? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>And you have as little doubt that he was the man who was in the upholsterer's shop? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Will you have the goodness, Sir, to tell the Jury in what situation you found the prisoner at the publick office; was the prisoner marked out to you in any particular way? - He was brought to the bar whilst 75 I was in the room with several of the Justices.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was brought to the bar? - There were several people in the room.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else at the bar? - Nobody, there were some people near.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was brought to the bar and charged as a felon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100149"/>When you slipped down, part of the prisoner' coat remained in your hands? - Yes, all the skirt, I believe it was plucked out of my hand by some people that were in his company, I know it was a frock coat.</p>
               <p>Has any apartment of the prisoner been searched at all? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that any coat of a description answering to that has been seen at his lodging</p>
               <p>There were a great many people, it was a favourite tragedy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were in the passage leading to the two shilling gallery? - I was.</p>
               <p>I fancy there is no great degree of light in that passage? - Yes, it is light enough.</p>
               <p>You will believe me, Sir, when I say, I do not mean to impute any thing unfair to you, it is my duty to put these questions to you; How was he dressed? - He was dressed in black, and his hair was powdered, I believed he had a cocked hat.</p>
               <p>Were not every body's hands pressed by the crowd as well as your's? - He had his hands down.</p>
               <p>It did not occur to you to seize the hand of the person that was your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Was is possible for you to observe the hand that was directed to the pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>You seized the collar of somebody that you suspected to be the person that had his hand in your pocket? - So I did, but in the situation I was, I could not be any other way than positive. I had two gentlemen in my company behind me, on the right hand side was the prisoner and before him there was a lady in a straw hat and red ribbon, I did not take any particular notice of the people on the left hand side, the prisoner's face was rather turned towards my face, he was stopped immediately, and searched immediately, and nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake positively, in a case like this, to say that you did return your watch into your fob after you looked at it? - O certainly so, I not only put it in my fob, but I turned the chain within my fob.</p>
               <p>Then the struggle to get your watch must have been very great? - Yes, and the person that took it was very clever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As well fitted for a lady's hand in a striped hat as any body's else, I should have thought.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. A great crowd at the theatre this evening? - Yes, it was one of the nights that Mrs. Siddons performed.</p>

               <p>Last Thursday night I was going up by St. Sepulchre's Church, I believe it was a quarter before five, and I saw the prisoner with another man standing at the post just by the watch-house, and he had a white frock on, and I saw something under his frock, and I says to him, says I, what have you there, says he, nothing; I saw it was a half hundred weight; says I, how did you come by that; says he, my master gave it me to carry; where does your master live, says I; says he, I brought it from Whitechapel, from the church with the high steeple; the other man that stood by said, we are going to carry it to Smithfield; says I, then you know something about it; I took hold of one with one hand, and the other with the other and the half hundred weight, and as I took them up the passage the other man tore off part of his coat, and he picked my pocket of my handkerchief; we put him in a coach, and took him before the alderman, and there appeared the broad arrow on the weight.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. After you have entered it then you put it into a book which was a memorandum of the place to which it was to go? - After entering it, it was put into the place where the other bills are usually put till we come to charge them out.</p>
               <p>What is done with the bill after it has gone through that ceremony? - It goes to the person that is to take charge of them the next day.</p>

               <p>I understand from seeing a number of gentlemen standing up here, that a many people have access to the place where these bills are put? - Yes, they are put into one of the back offices, and then given out at evening to the respective clerks.</p>

               <p>I am a clerk in this banking house, I examined these bills on the 19th of August, 1712, which were charged out for the 20th, they were all right when I had sorted and examined my bills, and sorted them regularly according to the walk I was to go, which was the city walk, I then took them round to the place where I usually put them, which was behind the counter; I put them in my own case; not finding the large case which was appointed to put these bills in, I put them in my own case, which I was to go out with the next day, and put them behind the place where I usually put them; there are partitions behind the counter where we used to put them; I did not take any more notice of these bills which I put up, supposing they were safe and right; in the morning when I came to look for my case of bills which I put up on the night before they were missing, I enquired of all the clerks.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there were other bills besides those that were lost? - There were thirty or forty; I did not find my case.</p>
               <p>Court. Whose business was it to put those bills of yours into the tin case? - Mr. Hollingsworth's, or one of the clerks; I enquired of all the clerks if they knew any thing of my bills; and when we could not find the case of bills any where, we agreed to go and stop the payment of the bills which were charged out, the bills for payment, and the bills for acceptance, which were all examined together, on account of going regularly in the walk: we went out to stop the payment of the bills for payment and the bills for acceptance; we found no such bills, nor heard nor learnt any thing during the time we were out concerning the bills; we came home, and the gentleman agreed to advertize the bills that were lost, with the particulars; I was so flurried with the loss of my case, and was so unhappy for myself and my friends who were security for me, that I could not draw up any advertisement or do any thing; I went down into the kitchen and set by the fire, and was lamenting the loss of my case;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100156"/> I was unhappy and uneasy on the account of it, as the gentlemen and the clerks had searched for it; the prisoner stood at the corn er of the kitchen door, and said, he was very willing to go up and seek with me, where I should chose to go; I said it was in vain to seek for it; however, thro' the persuasion of the servants and himself, I went with him to seek for the case; this was between nine and ten o'clock, we began at one part of the office and went on regularly round till we came to where there was a bureau bedstead, which was moved by him or me, and he held down the candle, and looking behind the bedstead, he said he saw something, I looked behind the bedstead with great anxiety, and saw a hair broom which lay towards the ground, and the corner of the case seemed to appear under the hair broom; I drew it out, and to my great surprize, found there were my bills; I did not examine them that night by the book that I had entered them in; I looked them over and supposed they were all right, in the morning I found that one bill which was upon

             for 10 l. which was wrote upon at the top, Bank post bill, very small, I found that that bill was misplaced, had been taken out of the partition where I had placed it, and put in another partition in the case, as I supposed the person or persons who ever found it, thought that to be a Bank post bill as well as the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow another Council for the Prisoner. This transaction is near a year and a half ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you affect at this distance of time, to speak with all that degree of accuracy as to all these minute circumstances, which you should do in a circumstance of this kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I fancy your situation at this house was, at that time, the situation of an out door clerk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told us, that there were certain bills charged out to you the 19th of August, to be delivered on the 20th; these were charged out by you to some other person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But it is not your business to charge them out? - No.</p>
               <p>Then these bills were not disposed of in the uniform usual course of your office? - No, the case was not to be found.</p>
               <p>You therefore put them into another case and carried them round behind the counter and placed them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was this? - In the evening, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>You have a great number of clerks in your house? - We have eleven.</p>
               <p>This place in which you deposited the case was not locked up? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all the partners in this house, and all the clerks in this house, had access to this place, and all the servants, if they pleased, had access? - Nobody is suffered to go behind the counter but the clerks, without it is when the porter locks up the place and shuts up the shutters, which is whilst there are some of the clerks in the office.</p>
               <p>Some of the clerks sleep in the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not it usual for the clerks to have their hair dressed in the shop? - We used to do these things, but we have left it off now.</p>
               <p>Oh, you used to do these things then, but you have left them off now; pray why is it left off now? - The gentlemen did not know what to think, these things being lost, the only reason I believe for that, Mr. Prescott, the head partner came one morning as as we were having our hair dressed, ten minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was there an old clothes man introduced into the shop? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When the book was found, you say you did not examine it with much minuteness? - I did not with any great degree of accuracy.</p>
               <p>Did you express to the prisoner your satisfaction at having found all the bills right? - I do not recollect particularly, it is possible that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100157"/>I suppose this transaction made a good deal of noise in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the case was recovered, it became necessary I imagine, to take off the stoppage of those bills that you had recovered. - We stopped the payment at the Bank immediately, and I believe it was advertized.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly notorious in your house and made a great noise? - It did not make a great noise, we were very much alarmed, we did suppose that the case had been in possession of some person or persons by these two bills being missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester council for Prosecution. You said it was the porter's business to sweep the shop and shut the shutters? - Yes, and rub down the counters and such business as that, and to make our beds and bring our suppers up.</p>

               <p>Jury. Is it an easy thing for a person to get behind the counter? - We let nobody come behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Is it an easy thing; could a porter in the house get behind the counter? - Yes, Sir, he goes behind the counter to shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you put your book that night in the place it is usually put into? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the business of the day is over, and you gentlemen clerks are dismissed from your business, is the place where your book was, open to the access of any body in the shop, or open to the access of the servants of the house? - It is open; the servants never come into the office: I did not sleep in the shop myself, some of the clerks did.</p>
               <p>Where were the beds in the shop? - One was near the office where we sup, that where the case was found, that was near the office where we sup.</p>
               <p>Court. Does the porter sleep in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you gentlemen clerks, after the business of the day is over, never go out of the shop till you go to bed? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Is there somebody always left in the shop? - Always one person appointed to attend at home.</p>
               <p>But I want to know whether you are so strict on the subject, as that you make it a rule never to leave the shop without one clerk in it? - I cannot say we are.</p>
               <p>Now supposing it might happen, none of the clerks were in the shop, could the porter have access during the momentary absence of a clerk? - After locking up, the porter might go in any part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. Supposing the clerks were out of the house in the evening, the pigeon holes where you put your notes, the porter, if he had so been disposed, might have had access to it? - He might.</p>

               <p>How came Foster not to be sent out with his book the next day? - Because it was supposed they would pay me sooner than any other clerk.</p>

Hold, don't tell us of any information! - I was desired to find him out, and I met him in the market, I asked him if his name was Thompson, he said yes, I took him to my house and asked him if that name was his hand-writing, and he said it was, I asked him how he came by that draft; this was the draft that Lang gave him, he said that this was his hand-writing, I then asked him how he came by that draft of twenty pounds, he seemed much confused and said, Sir I will give you the twenty pounds for it, I told him that would not do, he then said he received it of one King, I asked him where he received it, he hesitated very much, and he pressed me to take the twenty pounds, I told him this draft I supposed to be a bad one, he then said, between Bridgwater and Bristol, as he was going to Bristol, this King overtook him, and asked him if he was going to Bristol, and if a hill would be more easy carriage to him and more agreeable than cash, and that he then gave him twenty pounds for the bill, I told him I thought this was a very unlikely matter, says I,

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not you say you had threatened to carry him before a magistrate? - I told him that I thought this business a very unlikely one, and unless he gave me a more satisfactory account, I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit to your Lordship whether you will, after what he has told us, hear what Mr. Cole may say, I do not know what he is going to say.</p>

Why to be sure one is always very chaste in these kind of things, I think we had better not hear it, I do not know what Mr. Cole is going to say, but if it is any confession made by him, if it is made immediately after a threat, we should not hear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is not a threat.</p>
               <p>Court. Why it scarcely amounts to that, but he is hardly a free agent at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is much more efficacious than that, it coaxes him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I never knew the objection but where there was a promise that you would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose Mr. Cole had said I can hang you, you had better confess, if you you do not, I shall certainly carry you before a magistrate; and if the man under the terror of that threat had made a confession, to be sure that is not evidence; now Mr. Cole is much too prudent to do that, he only said, unless I have a more satisfactory account, I shall take you before a magistrate, and then the man says, why then Sir, that is, since you will carry me before a magistrate, if you will keep a secret, I will tell you the whole business, this is the safe side, and I own I never like confessions.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had been at the prisoner's house before you met him in the street, and when you met him, he went with you without any sort of hesitation? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Hollingsworth. How long after this affair did the prisoner continue in your service? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>I am desired to ask you whether after he left your service, he did not upon some occasion or other, give you notice where he might be heard of, and that he was about to leave London? - He did.</p>
               <p>The payment of the bills were stopped then? - Yes, and they were advertised.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you where? - In Mead's-court, somewhere by Soho.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you begin to search after him? - About a month after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my Council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You understand we cannot say any thing to the Court or Jury in your defence, we can only examine witnesses.</p>

               <p>A WRITTEN DEFENCE OF THE PRISONER's READ.</p>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury: In answering this charge which is now made against me, I shall be under the necessity of troubling the Court with some account of myself. Before I came into the service of the prosecutor, I carried on the business of a maltster to a considerable amount, but was reduced by losses, and recommended by Mr. Fothergill to the house of the prosecutors; my duty was that of porter, and in that situation I was neither intrusted with bills or notes nor had the means of secreting them; in September, 1782, I was dismissed the plaintiff's service, on account of these bills being missing; the plaintiff's suspicion did not rest on me alone, since then they discharged another of their servants, whose opportunities seem more calculated to warrant their suspicions; I continued some time in London after my dismission from the plaintiff's service, and when I went into the country I gave notice to Mr. Prescott where I was gone to. If I had been conscious of having stolen these bills from him, your Lordship will not think I should have been so mad as to negotiate them; after I left the plaintiff, I insured lottery tickets with great success,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100160"/> and having got money, I went to pursue my former business, and I was induced to assume another name. In the course of my transactions with lottery offices, I was frequently paid in bank notes, and this note I received at Mr. Palmer's office, in Fleet-street, one night in payment of forty guineas: I hope the bare possession of the bill, at the distance of two years, cannot prove me guilty of the offence of stealing it.</p>
               <p>- FOTHERGILL sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>I believe you are a very considerable corn factor? - I am in that line of business; I have had very considerable concerns with the prisoner, to a very large amount; and since I have been subpoened in this business, I have had reference to our ledgers, and I see I dealt with him from January 1779 to November 1781.</p>
               <p>By what name did he deal with you? - By the name of

               <p>In all the dealing you have had with him, have you as reason to look upon him as an honest man? - We has particular reason on this account; he had frequently occasion to over-draw us, he requested the indulgence to accept before asserts came, and we have frequently accepted two or three hundred pounds in advance to him, and when he promised to send asserts he never disappointed us: after he had quitted the service of Mr. Prescott and Co. I heard they had some suspicion about some matter, and in about a week after he called on me; I told him, and desired he would call and clear it up, which I afterwards understood he did; he told me his lodgings were in Meard's-court at that time.</p>
