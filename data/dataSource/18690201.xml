                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Marlborough Road, Carnaby Street—on Monday morning, 11th January, about 6 o'clock, I was in a public-house in John Street—I saw six or seven persons there altogether—the prisoners were among them—they were sitting in the parlour—I treated them, and as I was coming away they knocked me down on a form, and put their hands on my mouth, and took 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my trowsers pocket—I had been drinking, but was not drunk—a man of the name of Carroll, a tailor, was there—I complained to the landlord.</p>

               <p>January, about 3 o'clock, I remember three gentlemen coming to my front bar—I saw the prisoners and the prosecutor—there were two or three pots of porter called for, which the prosecutor paid for—they went into the club room, and called for three pots more beer, for which the prosecutor gave me a shilling—they could only muster 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. amongst them, and the beer came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the prosecutor gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., change—one of the parties said, "Give it to me; I am his brother-in-law; I can give him the change as well as you can"—I did not do so—I went down stairs again—I afterwards heard a noise up stairs, and went up—they were quiet then, and I went down again—afterwards several persons came down with a sort of rush, and went out, but I did not see either of the prisoners—some time afterwards the prosecutor came down, and made a complaint to me—he was not tipsy; he had been drinking, evidently; but he was not what I should call drunk.</p>

I have been a working man now for a great many years, and have had some thousands of ounces of silver through my hands. Owing to misfortune, I left my employers, and had no alternative then but to set up businees for myself, unfortunately, without friends. I took a shop, and could not meet the demands for rent, and, having a wife and five children. to support, I fell into arrears. I called upon Redgrave to know if he could do anything for me. I had a gold chain, which he pledged, and so paid a portion of the rent that was owing. The chain was wanted, and I began to be uneasy, when Redgrave said he had the means of making money, but that I should have his liberty in my hands. I told him he must take all the responsibility upon himself. He then manufactured a cup, and pledged it in Long Acre for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He afterwards made and plated other cups, and pawned them. One evening he asked me to pledge one, and I took it to dir. Morgan's. I had nothing to do with making the cups, or depositing the mark, taking the impression, or plating them. When I pledged the</p>

I am divisional surgeon of Police—Caunt was under my care in July last—on the night of the 14th, I found him in a very ex<lb/>hausted state, and he appeared to be in great pain, especially about the front part of the chest—there was a swelling at the lower and back part of the head, from a blow—a bruise on the back, and he complained of great pain in the right groin—kicks would produce such injuries—he was under my care for about three weeks before he resumed his duty, and then he had several fits of a paralytic character, and he was on the sick list again for some time—his health was injured very much while the fits were on him—at the time the fits were on they would impair his memory, and for some short time after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer, of 89, Chancery Lane—I am one of the official shorthand writers of this Court—I was present at the trial of James Coutts, at this place, on Friday last, 5th January, before the Recorder, and took notes of the evidence given on the trial—I remem<lb/>ber Mr. Alsop being called and examined as a witness—I took down what he said—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a transcript of the evidence he gave—I have my original notes here—Mr. Minot, clerk to Mr. Justice Willes, produced the affidavit of Mr. Coutts, but could not identify him; and then, after some conversation, Mr. Alsop was examined—(<hi rend="italic">The examination was read, as at page</hi> 294: <hi rend="italic">the part upon which the perjury was assigned bang that Coutts was present before the taxing-matter on the</hi> 14th <hi rend="italic">November, when his affidavit was used.</hi>)</p>

I produce a copy of the record of my trial—I have examined it with the original—I am now carrying on business as a baker, at Bromley—I first became acquainted with Mr. Alsop a little after 4th December, 1867—I had seen him before, but not to speak to him, I think—from that time onwards, he was repeatedly engaged as solicitor for other parties against me—he was solicitor in an action brought against me by a person named Kelsey—I made an affidavit in that action—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the affidavit to which I was a party, with Mr. Bleby, who was my solicitor in that action—it was sworn on 11th November, 1868—I received a commu<lb/>nication from Mr. Bleby about 10 o'clock on the night of the 12th; in consequence of which, I came to town on the morning of the 13th—I also came to town the next day, the 14th, and I went to Mr. Bleby's office, which is about the middle of Chancery Lane—I came from the Southampton Buildings side, at the top of Chancery Lane—if I passed Serjeant's Inn at any time that day, it must have been after the taxation; I have no recol<lb/>lection that I did—it was a little after 12 o'clock when I got to Mr. Bleby's office, not beyond 12.15, I think—I had some conversation with Mr. Bleby as to the taxation, after which Mr. Bleby left the office with Mr. Peace, his clerk, leaving me in the office—I remained there until Mr. Bleby's return, all the time—Mr. Peace came back once before his return—during the whole of the time, a youth named William Edwards was in the office with me—I was not present in the taxing<lb/>master's room on any occasion; I was never before a taxing<lb/>master at all in my life, to my knowledge—I was not present when this affidavit was used and read at the taxing; I did not see it there at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You describe yourself as a baker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I have been a Baptist minister—I should say it is four or five years ago since I ceased to have a fixed charge—I became acquainted with Mr. Mitchell in Bromley—I was not in business between the time I ceased to officiate as a minister and the time of my meeting with Mitchell; that would be about</p>

               <p>four years—I subsequently made an arrangement with Mitchell to see to his accounts; not in the first instance—an arrangement was made that I was to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for it, but I never had any—I think that arrange<lb/>ment continued about nine months—his was the business of a baker—my name was not over the door instead of his at the end of the nine months, it was in the beginning of the following year—it was not while I was arranging his accounts that he became bankrupt; it was some time after; four or five months—I had not a bill of sale for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on his goods; it was for between 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Kelsey was a creditor, and was the creditors' assignee—he brought an action against me to contest the bill of sale—on that occasion Mr. Alsop acted as his attorney—I am happy to say I have not had any private business matters with Mr. Alsop; I never had any private business arrangements with him; I have never employed him—I believe I have not been brought into connection with him at all, except when he was acting as solicitor for other parties—I swore that affidavit—it states: "I swear that I have paid the witnesses, other than the said Ernest Robinson, for their travelling expenses and attendance at the Assizes, the sums set opposite to their respective names in the schedule"—I had paid them partially, not in full—if you wish me to explain, I can do so simply, and it will be patent that there is no untruth in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It would be untrue, whether wilfully untrue or not is another thing; but, if you swore that you had paid them, and you had not, it was untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said before that he forbade you to go! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me not to go.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He forbade me to go; it is per<lb/>fectly true that he said I need not go—it is no use perplexing me; I wil explain simply how it was, Mr. Bleby had an engagement at Westminster that morning, I was waiting there from 12.30 till near the time of the taxation, for his arrival, he came in hurriedly, and said "I am going to this taxation"—I said "May I go," or "Shall I go"—he said "You should not go"—I don't know the exact words, but he forbade me to go, and in consequence of that I did not go—the effect was that I did not go—if he had said "Come," I would have gone—it was in consequence of my solici<lb/>tor telling me I need not go, or I should not go, or forbidding me to go, that I did not go; that is quite correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not because of your not wishing to meet Mr. Alsop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you ask me my private reasons—</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were your private reasons—had you any reason except being forbidden by your attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but at that time my not going depended entirely upon my attorney forbidding me; I had no other reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is not true that you did not go because you did not want to meet Mr. Alsop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I don't want to misunderstand you, but you wish to perplex me. The witnesses are all paid their expenses—Strong was paid before—Carpenter is paid—I called at his house the day the affidavit was sworn, on the 14th November I think—I paid him myself; I called twice to see him and failed to see him, the third time I did see him—that was on 14th November—I paid them all on the same day—Strong was paid, that is to say it was only to settle the accounts <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>—I did that on the 13th—Robinson was paid on the 13th also, I sent the money to him, I sent the money to them both—I never said that I was before the taxing-master on the 12th—I never said to anybody at the last trial that I was not there on the second occasion but I was there on the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am a painter, living at Farwig, near Bromley—I was present at the taxation of costs—I was not there on the 12th—I first flaw Mr. Alsop about this matter on the 11th, at his office in Bromley—he asked me if I had been promised some money by Mr. Coutts, and I said no, I had not—he said, "Mr. Coutts has sworn in his affidavit to having paid you money"—I said, "Then I have not received any"—he said he thought Mr. Coutts had committed perjury, or something of that sort, that he had been a long time trying to catch him, and if he got him this time he would not like to stand in his shoes for so much money, or something of that sort; that was it as near as possible—that was on the 11th—after that I went to my own house—my wife gave me some information, and I went back, and told Mr. Alsop what my wife had told me—I said that Mr. Coutts had been to pay the money—he said, How do you know"—I said my wife said so—he said, "You can't swear to that, because your wife's evidence is no evidence; you were not at home, and you never saw him"—there were other things passed, I don't exactly recollect—I told him that I was to call and see Mr. Mitchell, to receive the money next morning, that was the 12th, and he asked me if it would make any difference to me if I stopped away—I believe Mitchell was at that time managing the baker's shop—Mr. Coutts came to my house afterwards, and paid me this money—Mr. Alsop told me, I think, at the second interview, but I would not swear that, that I should not be the loser, he would make up the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think it was; I am not quite sure of the amount—I said I thought it was more than 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said well, if needs be, he would pay me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid with the subpoena—Mr. Alsop afterwards brought me a paper, which I signed—I went before a Magistrate at Bow Street—I afterwards saw Mr. Alsop, and told him I thought he had treated me rather badly in bringing me into an affair that I did not know anything about—I believe that was the beginning of the conversation; it is some time back; I cannot recollect positively—I told him I thought he had done me wrong, and ill-treated me in making me a complainant to enter an action against Mr. Coutts—he</p>

Q.</hi> Were you a complainant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I was—Mr. Coutts paid me the money on the 12th, I beg pardon, on the 13th; he came before it was exactly light—I was not astonished that he should pay me, because my wife had told me before that he had come to pay me, and told me I was to go to Mr. Mitchell's at 9 o'clock next morning—I told Mr. Coutts I thought I had not any claim on him; at any rate, I led him to suppose I did not expect any—he waited till I got up—that was on the morning of the 13th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Defendant's Statement before the Magistrate was read, as follows</hi>: "What I have to say is this; there have been many meetings between myself, as solicitor for various parties, and Mr. Coutta I have met him at the Bankruptey Court on two or three occasions; I have met him at the Examiner's Office, in the Court of Chancery; I have met him at Judge's Chambers; I have met him before the Judge; I have met him at the County Court, at Bromley; and I have prosecuted him, as an attorney, in the Criminal Court at Bromley. I was in the habit of meeting him, on law business, almost daily. It has been proved in evidence to-day that Mr. Coutts was within thirty yards of the place where I swore to seeing him. He must have passed the office with the windows opening on the street at or about the time I was at the Taxing Office. It has already been proved that there were several persons present, and a great confusion existed. I was no witness set down in my counsel's brief; I was asked the question suddenly, if Mr. Coutts was present, and I answered 'Yes' I then went into the box, and honestly and conscientiously deposed to what I believed to be the truth. The learned counsel turned round and asked my clerk if Coutts was present on the 14th, and he immediately answered, 'He was,' and this before I had an opportunity of communicating with him. The next witness, Mr. Kelsey, was asked the same question, and he said "He was," but, on cross-examination, he would not go beyond belief. I have nothing more to say."</p>

Come out!"—no charge of indecency was made before a Magistrate—Mr. Jacobs was a witness—through that I fell out with the station-master, and I resigned—I have since been head gardener to Mr. Phillips, and seven years and a half with Mr. Thomas Belmont—the charge about receiving stolen wood was this: my little girl, four or five years old, went into a place with a hundred more, and picked up bits of lath which fell down, and they searched my house, and found the pieces which the child had picked up; the Magistrate paid the fine for the child—with the exception of the charges I have mentioned, I have never been in trouble in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of Bedford Street, Peckham Rise—I lived at. Feltham up to 1861—I know Mrs. And Miss Alicia Dendy, living at the Hollies in 1857—Harris spoke to me about Miss Alicia before 1859; it was at the Hollies, in 1857—I had occasion to go from Mr. Fronde to Mr. Harris to haul up the carriage, and Mr. Harris said, "If Miss Dendy comes out, do not take any notice of her, for she is not right, poor thing"—on another occasion I went to haul the carriage up again, and Harris said, "Morris, I have got some nice little partridges here; do you know where you can get some ant's eggs for them!"—and while I was talking, Miss Alicia came out (I cannot tell you the exact date, but it was about the same time)—Harris said, There is the poor thing; do not take any notice of her, Morris," and, as she was going, she passed a little haystack in the corner of the yard, and made a kneel, and said some kind of a prayer, but I was not close enough to hear it—on another occasion, I was on the Queen's River bank, near Warleyboy's bridge, and Harris came to me, and said, "Oh, Morris, have you seen Miss Dendy this way!"—I said" No"—he said he had missed her, and could not see which way she had gone—this was about the same time, but some months before—he did not seem in a state of excitement—he came up early.</p>

On 1st January, I travelled with Lady Cholmondeley from Stokes Bay to the Waterloo Station, where we arrived a little before 6 o'clock—we had eleven packages—after arriving at home we mussed a bag late at night, and gave information at the Lost Property Office of the railway station—I afterwards saw this bag (produced) at the Police Court; it is exactly like the one I lost, but the lock has been cut out—this gold watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to me—I cannot say whether it was in the bag—I believe it cost fifty guineas, but I have had it nearly fifty years—this spoon is electro-plated, my crest is on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station-master at the New Wandsworth Station of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway—on the evening of 20th January, I was at the Shaftesbury Anne, Wandsworth Road, with three friends—we left there about 11.30, went to the York Road Station, and found the last train had gone—the two female prisoners addressed me as I came down the stairs—Sarah Smith said, "Your name is Mr. Harding, the station-master at the Wandsworth Station; we know you very well; we live at Clapham Junction"—I said, "I do not know you"—they said, "We know you very well; you had better Dome home with us"—I said, "No; I am going to my owu home"—they said, "You had better stand something to drink"—and as I thought they were persons from Clapham Junction who knew me, I went with them to the Mason's Arms, opposite the station, where they had some gin, and I had some whiskey—I stopped there about 10 minutes, and left them about 12.40, but they followed me down the Queen's Road, which is twelve or thirteen yards from the house, and came on each side of me—I knew perfectly well what I was about, but had had a glass or two—I had my hand in my pocket, and felt my watch and chain</p>

I had none of the property nor yet the money, if I had, I wish my arm may drop off my body"—when the prisoners were charged, Sarah said to Joseph, "I gave you the money and chain 'in the Queen's Road"—he said "No, you did not, you gave it me at the corner of the road"—and he turned round to Brockley, and said "You had some of the money"—she made no reply.</p>
