(<hi rend="italic">The summons was read, and was for 1 l . 0 s. 9 d ., the balance of a debt, and the prisoner alleged that he had personally served it.</hi>) Personal service is requiredâ€”I administered the oath to the defendant, who said that he had made personal serviceâ€”it was not signed in my presence that was done before it was broughtâ€”the defendant did not appear upon that, and an order of commitment was made, dated 1st Juneâ€”on 7th June a notice was served by the defendant's father for the purpose of setting aside the judgmentâ€”that name on before the Judge on 10th Juneâ€”I then heard the defendant's father say that his son had not had the summonsâ€”the Judge then put a question to La Dell, and he then admitted that he had not served it personallyâ€”the Judge then rescinded the order of commitment, and sent the matter on to the Public Prosecutor.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had received from Allison a good character of Nutt, and that during the time he was with him he found him as described, and was satisfied with him; that he left him of his own accord saying he wished to give up travelling.</hi>) That was accompanied with the written document which Nutt had filled up, stating he had been with Hall from 27th February to July, 1886â€”I believed that was the last situation he had filledâ€”I heard nothing about Spence and Co., or Bushell, or Gray and Bakerâ€”I knew nothing about his being tried and acquittedâ€”he entered our service, and was with us from August 12 till the summons was taken out on 18th September, when he was dischargedâ€”I made a complaint to him about 14 days or three weeks after he entered our employâ€”I made further inquiries, and in the result I took out a summons and Nutt went before a Magistrateâ€”I did not know he was married, nor that he had been William Peek Nutt a month before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Stanley.</hi> You asked me the time, and if the clock was right, and you said you were going to catch the train at half-past 5 across the waterâ€”you had a few minutes' conversation with me.</p>

               <p>were finished at the latter end of January; two were not quite finishedâ€”Mr. Runtz is the Liberator Society's surveyor; the fees were to be paid him for surveying the houseâ€”the prisoner showed me the counterfoil of the cheque in the cheque book of the District Bank of London to show me that he had paid the money to Mr. Runtz; I think it was a brown cheque bookâ€”that was January 6thâ€”he then told me he had paid it, so I took it to have been paid before 6th Januaryâ€”a cheque of mine was dishonoured by the District Bank; it has since been settledâ€”they agreed to take so much per month in part payment; that was a month or two months backâ€”I had money enough at the bank to meet the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque which I stopped.</p>
