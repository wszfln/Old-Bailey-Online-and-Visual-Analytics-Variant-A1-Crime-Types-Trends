               <p>Q. What have you to say, with relation to this charge?</p>
               <p>Skelton. The beginning of May I sent a piece and an half of broad cloth to Mr. Lodge's.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of yards were there?</p>
               <p>Skelton. There were two quantities; one was twenty-five, and the other about eighteen yards.</p>
               <p>[The cloth was produced.]</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be your cloth?</p>
               <p>Skelton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who stole it?</p>
               <p>Skelton. I know nothing farther than that it is mine. The Prisoner was charg'd with stealing this cloth, and was carried before my Lord-Mayor; he denied it at first, but afterwards owned he was the person that stole the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what manner he stole it?</p>
               <p>Skelton. No</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what sort of cloth it was that he had stole?</p>
               <p>Skelton. He said it was superfine cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this cloth again?</p>

               <p>White. Let me look at the cloth [which he did.] On the fourteenth of May, at night, I left these two pieces of cloth at Mr. Lodge's, safe in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave these in the warehouse?</p>
               <p>White. Between six and seven at night.</p>

               <p>White. No; he had not worked there for fourteen or fifteen months before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Mr. Lodge's again?</p>
               <p>White. On the Tuesday; and when I came there, I was asked concerning the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any gate there?</p>
               <p>White. Yes; there is a gate that goes into a yard, with a lock to it, and a bolt that goes into the staple four inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this warehouse?</p>
               <p>White. It is in Little St. Hellen's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it any part of the dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>White. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it join to the dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>White. They join wall to wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any passage, or communication, between this place and the street?</p>
               <p>White. None, but by going in at the gate. The house and warehouse is all within the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. But this is not Mr. Lodge's dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>White. No; it is only for to receive goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you go through the dwelling-house to go into this warehouse?</p>
               <p>White. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the dwelling-house any door to it, besides the door that is at the coming into the yard?</p>
               <p>White. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And is there no way of going out of the dwelling-house into this warehouse, without going into the yard?</p>
               <p>White. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the cloth was found again?</p>
               <p>White. Only as it was said, to be brought to Mr. Cam's.</p>

               <p>Q. What occasion had you for a candle at that time in the morning?</p>
               <p>Walker. Because the woman of the house was in bed, and he desired to leave it there, till the inn was open. Your servant, my Lord, you have done with me?</p>

               <p>Longbottom. On the eighteenth or nineteenth of May, the Prisoner came with two men to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. They came about noon, and they were talking about cloth; and they said they were going about this cloth to Scot's, and that they believed the cloth was damned, but sooner than the people of the house should have it, the owner should have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who said that, the Prisoner, or any body else?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. It was another person said so to the Prisoner, and advised him to send a letter to Scot's, or to advertise it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner say any thing to that?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. He said he would go to Scot's; and presently there was a woman came in, and she advised him not to go to Scot's, for it would blow him.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he go to Scot's?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. He went out, and said he would go to Scot's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return again?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman stay?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. The woman staid all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. The woman asked him what he had done, and he said he had made an offer of part of the cloth, and nothing could be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between you and him?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. I asked him whether he had lost any thing, and he said, he believed he had lost fifty pounds; said I, did you tell it? he said, it was not money, it was cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloth did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Longbottom. He said it was superfine cloth. And there was one White, who was turn'd out of his work upon that account, came to my house, and spoke of the affair.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of him?</p>
               <p>Scot. The Prisoner at the bar came to demand a piece of cloth, which was brought when I was in bed, and asleep : He came several times about it; he came one night, about ten o'clock, with a woman in a cloak; and the next day two men came, and one of them threatened my maid, and said, if she said any thing to them, he would put her eye out with a cane; and the Prisoner said, the cloth was worth twenty pounds. I told a man of very good sense of it, and he advised me not to let the Prisoner have it, and I would not let him have it; for I said to my husband, keep it and he said he would keep it, and see whether it was advertised; and when it was advertised, he sent it home.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it advertised?</p>
               <p>Scot. It was advertised the next day, and my husband ordered, that there should be no money taken for the carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the cloth?</p>
               <p>Scot. That is the cloth, I am sure, and I was angry with my maid, and gave her a slap on the face for taking it in, for I thought it was tea, and she run away from me upon that account.</p>

I ordered my maid to let her have some victuals, and go to bed. I talked to her a good deal, and spoke very simpathizing to her; and I said, if she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060005"/> done a fault, she was not a thief, and the Prisoner went to bed with my maid.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it in?</p>
               <p>Marshall. In a canvas purse, in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot say what time it was: I went into the stable at eight o'clock in the morning, and went and laid down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you asleep?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes; I lay asleep in the manger.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel in your pocket for the money a little before you went to sleep?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before?</p>
               <p>Marshall. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any company in that time?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No; I went in with a pair of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a coachman?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No; I went in with a young man, who lives at the Green Man in Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the Prisoner with it; can you say he took it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot punctually say, whether he took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Marshall. The same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up upon suspicion?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with any thing?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I could not swear to any particular pieces of money he had in his pocket, but he owned the taking the 14 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he owned it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. He said he took it out of my pocket. I did not say much to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your money again?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No, all the money is gone; he has made away with it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when he owned it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes, and he owned it before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner work in the yard?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a helper to the hostlers?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you a note of his hand?</p>

               <p>Q. Who said so?</p>
               <p>Fulbrook. The Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prosecutor say so?</p>
               <p>Fulbrook. If he would have signed a note for the money, it might, I believe, have been so, but the Prisoner would not do it. The Prisoner had in his pocket half a crown, a shilling, and some halfpence, but the Prosecutor could not own any of the pieces of money that the Prisoner had in his pocket, and he returned them to the Prisoner again.</p>

            . I live at Hamlin's Coffee-house, in Swithin-Alley; and as I sat in the house, I saw the Prisoner take this gentleman's handkerchief out of his pocket, and it was conveyed down into a cellar, and was brought up the next morning, and the gentleman came and owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else with the Prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Moxum. There was another boy close by him.</p>

I had a pretty many customers in the shop when the Prisoner came in, and after they were gone out, he said he wanted to ask me a question; I said, what is it? he asked me whether I bought plate, and I said I did not, unless I knew the person; he shewed me this lid, and I asked what he would have for it, and he asked ten shillings for it; I said, I believed it was stole; he asked me, whether I thought he stole it, and began to make words; I said I would stop it, and advertise it, and I did not doubt but I should find an owner; and I told him, if he would tell me his name, an d place of abode, I would return it him, if it was not owned, and he told me where he lived, but I found it was advertised in the paper: I went to Mr. Watts's with it, and he owned it to be the lid of his tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the right place of his abode?</p>
               <p>Scriven. He told me pretty near it, it was in the next street. Mr. Watts sent for the silversmith he bought it of, and he said it was the lid of the tankard he sold Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Scriven, that I found the lid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body by when you found it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a person by, but I don't know where to find him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you draw any in this tankard for the Prisoner, that night the tankard was lost?</p>
               <p>Rylance. I drew two tankards for him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What in this tankard, that was missing afterwards?</p>
               <p>Rylance. Yes, and, to the best of my knowledge, this is the same lid. The Prisoner went into the fields with us, under pretence of shewing us where the body of the tankard was; he said, if he had his hands loose, he would tell us where it was.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Rylance. Islington-Fields, by the ditches upon a dunghill.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he own the taking of the tankard?</p>
               <p>Rylance. He owned he had it, but he would not own he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not own it, for I could never own what I never had; and they kicked me, and beat me about, and used me very ill; they promised me money, half guineas, and two guineas, if I would tell them where it was; and I was willing to accept of it, because I was poor, and wanted money, and I pretended to tell them where it was, but I could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the top of the tankard?</p>
               <p>Wilks. It is the very same that I sold to Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of the tankard be, that you sold to him?</p>
               <p>Wilks. He gave me eleven pounds seven shillings for it. When the Prisoner was taken, he said, if we would let him, he would go with us, and shew us where he had hid the tankard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not tell you so.</p>
               <p>Wilks. You did tell us so. I will go further yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You may go as far as you please.</p>
               <p>Wilks. I can go a little further yet. We went with him into the fields, and went on the backside of Islington two or three times; and he told us one place, then another, and we tried to find it, but could not, and then we brought him back before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice?</p>
               <p>Wilks. Justice Hole; and then he said where he had hid it, and insisted upon that to be the place, but they did not let him go; and there was a letter sent to Mr. White about it, and yesterday, in Newgate, he said he could tell where he had hid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have several here, but they are not come; my wife is here, and I believe she can call them. I have been a master of my business nineteen years, and never was before a Judge in my life before. I was very drunk that night, and I am sometimes mad and lunatick.</p>

               <p>Harding. My Lord, I know that the Prisoner has been deemed a lunatick person.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he deemed so?</p>
               <p>Harding. In the year 1745, when I served the office of churchwarden in Whitechapel Parish, and where he then lived, and I confined him to a mad-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he lunatick at the time he stole this tankard?</p>
               <p>Harding. I cannot tell that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to let him abroad?</p>
               <p>Harding. I suppose they did not think him so then; he was better for some time, but he was confined again afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that?</p>
               <p>Harding. Yes, my Lord, he has been confined in Bethlem, as I have been informed. I knew him a great many years before that, and never knew but what he bore a very good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, if you please, I will tell you how it was, from the beginning to the latter end. About two months ago I was ill of a fever, and I had an acquaintance in the Prince of Wales's nursery, and she advised me to go into the Hospital, and I was six weeks there under the physicians hands; and I went that day to the Prince of Wales's, and as I was coming down this street, with the child in my arms, a woman, with a white cloak on, slipped behind the counter, and took something out of the shop, and Mrs. Baxter took hold of me, and gave me a slap on the face, and I gave her another; and as I was not guilty, I did not know why I might not give her another.</p>

               <p>Q. What did Crone lay hold of you by?</p>
               <p>Hudson. By the collar; and he put his hand to my throat, and asked me for my money; and Collins struck me on the side of my head with his hand, and I went down on my knees, and begged for my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take all you had?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, so I was very willing to strip myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so to them?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, and I pulled off my clothes, so much as my breeches and stockings, myself, and afterwards they threw me into a ditch, and I cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them threw you into a ditch?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I cannot tell, but I am sure one or two of them pitch'd me into a ditch; and then they took my clothes, and run away, as fast as they could, for London.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, but I cannot tell justly what it was, but it was silver; I am sure there was a shilling, and they took away all but my hat, wig, and slippers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake any of these three men?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, I overtook Frost; and he said he was sorry for my distress, and he pitied me very much, and said he went into a ditch to save himself, and he helped me out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those two men again, Collins and Crone, and see whether they are the men.</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, I am sure they are the men. I saw Frost afterwards, at the White-Swan, and treated him with a pot of beer; and when I saw him, I was sure he was one of the men, and I took him, and carried him before a Justice of the Peace.</p>

            , and I set their names down in my pocket-book, and carried Frost to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to enquire after the other two?</p>
               <p>Rouchead. Not till I went with Frost before Justice Poulson, and he said the same before the Justice, and desired to be admitted an evidence against the other two, but the Justice committed him to Newgate; and on Monday morning, about six o'clock, I took the constable with me, and went to the guard-room with Hudson, and I said to Hudson, if you see them, shake hands with them, and he did see Collins, and shook hands with him; and as soon as Hudson shook hands with him, I took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon duty then?</p>
               <p>Rouchead. Yes. Frost told me, they were both upon duty, and Crone was in the guard-room at the same time; I secured him, and had them before the Justice, and they were committed : The colonel was a little affronted that I should take them off the guard, and said, he would deliver them up, as soon as the guard was relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Rouchead. They had a great many frivolous excuses, and Hudson said he had got into a skittle-ground with them at play, at the White-Horse, on the other side of Kilburn-Turnpike.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did Justice Poulson admit Frost as an evidence?</p>
               <p>Rouchead. He would have admitted him to have been an evidence at first, and Frost said he never touched the man, but knew the other two that did it; and afterwards Frost would have been an evidence, but the Justice told him he should have spoke sooner, it was too late, or else I believe he would have been admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Pris. Collins. I said to the Prosecutor, if you have a mind to be a soldier, I can help you to money for us all, and I put my hand in his pocket, and put sixpence into it, and presently afterwards he was stripped, in order to fight my comrade, Crone, and he stripped himself stark naked, and said, he would not go along with us.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you had inlisted him then?</p>
               <p>Collins. Yes; I put the sixpence into his pocket to be sure, and I thought he would be a soldier, for he said he would go through the world with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his stripping?</p>
               <p>Collins. He was going to fight with my comrade, and I said there was no occasion to pull his clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. But you took his clothes away?</p>
               <p>Collins. I never took any of his clothes, to take them away.</p>
               <p>Pris. Crone. The Prosecutor challenged to fight with me, and I said I would not fight with him, and I went away directly.</p>
               <p>Pris. Frost. I had been a haymaking, and the Prosecutor had left his fork in pawn for a penny; he followed me stark naked; I went into a house to drink a pint of beer, and the Prosecutor came in, and challenged me with robbing him.</p>

               <p>[ The Jury desired that John Hudson might be called again, and desired they might ask him the following questions. ]</p>
               <p>Q. to Hudson. Was you playing with these people at skittles?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, two or three games.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they call one another by their names?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No, only comrade, and comrade.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any drink after you played?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes; after we had done, every man had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay for it?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes; I laid a penny down, and left my pitchfork for the halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body talk of putting sixpence into your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I never heard such a word, as I wish God to be my judge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you about inlisting?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No, they never said any such thing, as God is my judge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you paid a penny, and left your pitchfork for a halfpenny, how could you have a shilling for them to take?</p>
               <p>Hudson. That shilling was to pay for my lodging and washing.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I received three shillings, all but twopence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you paid?</p>
               <p>Hudson. On Saturday, the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the rest of the money?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I paid it where it was owing.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire to know how you came by those breeches, which Rouchead says you had on, when you came into the alehouse, if you was stripped of all your clothes?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I left the breeches, and a waistcoat, at one Jones's, and as I was returning home along with Frost, I took that pair of breeches and waistcoat.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning, about three o'clock, my maid heard a noise, and told me, the house was broke open; a little afterwards I heard another noise, and the Prisoner had left his shoes, and by these shoes there was a ladder standing at the window, which was left there, (as the house was repairing,) and had been there for a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Barnard. He was a <rs id="t17480706-13-deflabel71" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the windows were shut at night?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I cannot say they were; it is possible they might be left open upon the account of the beat.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I have two houses together; the house that he broke into is let to two gentlewomen, and the other I live in myself, in Fisher's-Street, Red-lion-Square. The watchman was called by one of the maid-servants, and found the Prisoner wrapped up in a blanket, in my kitchen, lying upon two chairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was drunk that Saturday night, and one of the plumber's men was as drunk as I, and whether I went in at the house, the two ladies live in, or not, I cannot rightly tell.</p>

            . Some time last April he came into Leach's house a little after ten in the evening, and I served him with a dram; presently afterwards he went out of the house, and in about a minute or two I saw him give this gentleman a drive at his head, and he snatched his hat and wig off his head, and run down Chambers-Street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060015"/> with it. I am sure he is the man; I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Bridgman. I am sure I was served so, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Jury to Bridgman. Did you know any thing of this gin-shop?</p>
               <p>Bridgman. No, I did not. There was a house near, and the Prisoner run into that house; I said to the officer, go into that house, for the man is run in there; the house was searched, but he was not found there. I had about 50 l. in my pocket, and, I suppose, if I had not stood upon my legs, I should have lost that.</p>

               <p>Pris. Coun. How long have you known the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Milward. Twenty years.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Has he been evidence in any cause in which you was concerned?</p>
               <p>Milward. I owe no body any ill will.</p>

               <p>Milward. I don't know but he may.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. When you called out stop thief, did not he run back towards you?</p>
               <p>Milward. I did not call out stop thief, I called out watch.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. What did you charge him with, when you carried him to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Milward. I will tell you, Sir; I never knew a <rs id="t17480706-21-deflabel109" type="occupation">ropemaker</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going along with two women, and one of them stopped to tie her garter; I said, my dear, shall I tie it for you? then I was in the highway, and Mr. Milward called after me, and said, you rogue, have I got you? and charged the watch with me; I said, Gentlemen, shall I go along with you? and I did go along with them; but he only said, that I had abused him, and assaulted him.</p>

             (a watchman). Mr. Milward would have had the two women have charged us with the Prisoner, but they would not; Mr. Milward was running after the Prisoner, and called out, Watch! Watch! and the Prisoner said, You need not call watch, for I will come to you directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spencer (the constable). At the watch-house, Mr. Milward charged the Prisoner with an assault, and threatening to blow out his brains.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Did you see any pistol about him?</p>
               <p>Milward. He had none with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any women with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Milward. I did not see any women with him, as I am here standing, before God and man; he came up by himself, though these two rogues of watchmen swear so.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. And did not you desire any women to charge the watch with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Milward. No.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Was you sober, or not?</p>
               <p>Milward. I was as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him say any thing about the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Touchfield. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Pris Coun. What is the character of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Touchfield. Nothing bad.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Does he bear the character of a sober and industrious man?</p>
               <p>Touchfield. I know nothing tricking in him; I know him to be a man that follows his business, and does as other men do, and I believe he is an honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Eyres (a ropemaker). The Prisoner is a ropemaker, and a very honest man, and I hope I shall employ him again. There is a spleen in the case; he was an evidence against his son. The Prosecutor has drove him away from his work by a press-gang, and the Prisoner said he was afraid to come to work, for fear he should send him on board a man of war. I take this, upon my life, to be only spite.</p>

               <p>Sands. I can't say.</p>

               <p>Sands. I was not as I should be; and these good women came in, and made a property of me. I had these things when I went in, and when I walked I had not them; but who took them I don't know. When they came to sell the buckles and the ring, they quarrelled about sharing the money, and so the thing was discovered; and they said before the Justice, that Peg took the apron, and that Jane sold the buckles.</p>

               <p>Fanaltena. She has nothing to sell; it is her own house, and she lives in it. About four weeks ago I was at her house, and she took my money out of my pocket; she took nine guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you go there?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I came out of a publick-house, and was going to my lodging; she asked me for a pint of beer, and I went into her house; she said she had no beer, but brought two or three bottles of cyder; she asked for the money, and I gave her a guinea, but she would give me no change; and when I gave her this guinea, I had eight guineas more; I then fell asleep, and slept till about two o'clock, and she would have me pay for two bottles of cyder, or she would take my coat off.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose this money?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I lost it when I was asleep; and it is well known, to herself and the Justice, that she is the person that had it; she owned herself, that she took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What language was it in?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. In Dutch. She said before the Justice, that she took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has been in my company for a fortnight, and before he went to sea. How did I steal the money from you?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I will swear to it, and stand by it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was drunk, and gave the money into my hand. I wish the devil may carry me away, if he did not give me the money.</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I am sure I was not drunk, for I had only a share of a pot of beer, and I could drink ten before I should be touched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you acquainted with her before?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I might see her in the street, but I never was acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can bring witnesses to prove it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barron. The Prosecutor lodges with me; and when the Prisoner was taken up, the headborough brought her to my house, and she talked good English, and she said she would give a note of hand for the money, if the Prosecutor would not carry her before the Justice, to be paid when her husband comes home.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prosecutor charge her with?</p>
               <p>Barron. He charged her with eight guineas, and she said she would give her hand seriven (that is a note of hand) for the money.</p>

               <p>Sutton. She can speak English as well as I can</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He put the money into my hand, and he was as drunk as a hoy; he gave me the money but in the morning he repented that he gave it me, and I gave him three pounds twelve shillings back, in three guineas, and nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fanaltena. Did you receive three guineas and nine shillings back of her?</p>
               <p>Fanaltena. I did receive three guineas and nine shillings.</p>

            . Last Sunday was fortnight, about two o'clock on the Sunday morning, the Prisoners took my watch, chain, and seal, out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be with you?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. They enticed me to go to their house; I had been at the Bull-Head just by where I live in Ratcliff Highway; I staid there from four in the afternoon till half an hour after six, and staid in company with the Prisoners till eleven.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060019"/>Q. What condition was you in then?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. I was not drunk, I was a little heavy headed; I said I was afraid of being locked out; she said I need not mind that, for she had a good lodging; I agreed to have a bed at her house, and paid her a shilling for it: we had a tankard of beer (I gave her six-pence, but she returned no money:) I took a drink of it, and laid down upon the bed about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. No, there was no bed to lie on, but a sort of a blanket: about an hour afterwards Foster came and put his hand under the blanket, and he waked me in doing it; and then he made towards his wife (that woman) the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she his wife?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. He calls her his wife; and then they both went out of the room, and presently I found my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to lay hold of the watch when he took it from you?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. No, then I immediately got off the bed. for I had some valuable things in my pocketbook; then he came into the room again, and threatened me, and asked me why I did not go out; and he told me he would knock me on the head if I did not go out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. In <placeName id="t17480706-28-crimeloc138">Elbow-Lane, by Ratcliff Highway</placeName>

               <p>Q. Could not you have got into the street?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Yes, but then he would have locked me out; and he said if I would treat him, he would help me to my watch again: I told him I would if he would let me have my watch again; and I was in the porch [he explained it afterwards to be the stair-case] and he pulled me down stairs, and I thought the street was the best place for me, for I did not know but I might have been knocked on the head.

               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. She said if I would not hurt her, I should have my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Foster carried before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. They were both carried before the Justice on Monday morning, and she said she took the watch off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you know to be false?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the watch again?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Mr. Gosden has the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gosden produced the watch.</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you ask this witness any questions?</p>
               <p>Pris. Foster. No, my Lord, he has said too much already.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say for yourself?</p>

On Sunday was fortnight I was sitting at the house that I live at between seven and eight in the morning, and this woman came by, and said, who will buy a watch? I said if I would, she had never an one to sell; she said she had, and shewed it to me: I asked her how she came by it (for I thought she did not look like one that had come honestly by it) and she said it was her brother's. I challenged it, and she said she would trust it in my hands; I said I would keep it till I knew how she came by it: and I carried an advertisement on Sunday night, which was published on Monday morning; and the Gentleman had taken her up: she brought the Prosecutor to my house, and she said nothing to me, nor I to her.

             is, and stands convicted, and attainted of felony; and this the attorney-general, for our said Lord the King, is willing to aver and testify, and therefore prays the Court to award execution against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Ar. Gentlemen of the Jury, the several issues contained in this suggestion the Prisoner has denied, and thereupon issue is joined, and you are to try these issues between our sovereign Lord the King, and the Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Crown. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner comes before the Court in the manner I am going to mention to you.</p>
               <p>The Legislature considering the great progress the smugglers had made, the height they were got to, and the violences they had committed, thought it necessary to suppress this practice; and in order to do that, there was an Act of Parliament<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060023"/> made, to make it felony, without benefit of clergy, for three or more persons to be assembled together with fire arms, in order to be aiding and assisting, in running, landing, and carrying away uncustomed goods; for it was difficult to bring them to justice in the common way, by reason of the outrages they committed, and the damages they did in the country, and therefore the Legislature made an Act, that if they did surrender themselves, according to due course of law, they should have mercy, but if they put their country at defiance, and did not surrender themselves according to that Act of Parliament, they are guilty of felony; and in order to this, there are several steps, which are by that Act directed to be taken.</p>
               <p>And gentlemen, the first step is to have the fact laid before a proper Magistrate upon oath, then that is to be laid before a secretary of state; then laid before his Majesty in council; an order made by his Majesty in council, and that order to be transmitted to the sheriff of the county where the offence was committed, and is to be proclaimed on the two next market-days, at two market towns near to the place where the fact was committed, and stuck up in the publick market-places of those towns, that the Prisoner might know what his offence was; then, by that Act of Parliament, he was to surrender himself, according to the directions of the Act; but if he did not surrender himself, he was to be convicted, as if he had been convicted of felony, in point of law; and this was done, upon account of that practice, which the Government thought so prejudicial to the publick.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the Prisoner at the bar has been charged according to the directions of that Act of Parliament; he has been charged with being armed with fire arms, and assembled together, with three or more, to be aiding and assisting in running and landing uncustomed goods; and this has been laid before a proper Magistrate; and has been laid before the Duke of Newcastle, one of his Majesty's principal secretaries of state; has been laid before his Majesty in council, and an order made, and every thing has been done according to the Act of Parliament; therefore he is now, if these facts are proved, guilty of felony, and if he cannot disprove these things, he is attainted and convicted of felony; therefore it is incumbent upon us to prove these facts, and as you are a Jury according to the laws of the land, you are to try whether these facts are true, and if you find these facts, the Prisoner will have execution awarded against him, as a person attainted of felony.</p>
               <p>Second Coun. for the Crown. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I will state to you what facts are to be proved, in order to have execution awarded against the Prisoner; and these facts are contained if the suggestion, which has been opened to you, by the gentleman who spoke before me.</p>

               <p>Curtis. Only as I am told; the Justice told me it was a market town, and that the market was kept on a Saturday. There were several people there when I read the order.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Mr. Curtis, you are very well acquainted, I suppose, with this country?</p>

               <p>* The Court commended Mr. Hammond for acting so generous and careful a part, and recommended it as an example to others; and several gentlemen expressed an intention to employ, and promote him in his business upon that account. Mr. Hammond is a glazier, and lives in Park-Street, by Grosvenor-Square.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is the child?</p>
               <p>Hammond. He was in breeches; but I do not know his age. I said, I believe that is not your child; she said, the mother of the child had lent him to her to go a begging with, as she was a poor woman out of business, and I said she should go back with me to town, and shew me the friends of the child, and if she did, I would have no more to do with her. With that I went with her, and took her into a publick-house, and would have charged a constable with her, but he would not take charge of her. I asked the child what his name was, he said his name was

The child had a coat on, but the waistcoat was under the Prisoner's petticoat, and the child's mother said it was her child's waistcoat. I saw the waistcoat in the Prisoner's lap, and it fell down to her feet.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Yes; and I heard my child was picked up in the Park, and was at a house in Park-Street; I went, and there was my child, and the Prisoner was there; the waistcoat was held up, and I said, that is my child's waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Skelston. Between eleven and twelve, and was called up between two and three; and when I got up, I missed these things.</p>

            . The Prisoner lodged in my house about a fortnight before this happened, and gave me the slip, and went away. I went out that day about ten in the morning, and came home about four in the afternoon, and found the doors open, my boxes open, and rummaged, and my things gone; but one of my neighbours telling me they saw a couple of men lift another man over the pales, who by description was the Prisoner, I took him up the next morning, and had him before Justice Tall; and the corner of the handkerchief, that the things were tied up in, was hanging out of his pocket, I said that was my handkerchief, he said he had had that handkerchief several years.</p>
               <p>[The constable produced the handkerchief, which he took from the Prisoner, and said the Prisoner had six shillings and sixpence in his pocket.]</p>
               <p>Smith. This is my handkerchief, and the handkerchief that the Prisoner had. I know it by the mark, it is marked with an M.</p>
               <p>The Constable. The Prosecutor said, the Prisoner told him he had no money, and desired him to give him three halfpence for a pint of beer; he said he had bought a new pair of breeches, and had spent a good deal of money that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the money, did you?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; there were no marked pieces. He was asked how he came by the money, and he said he borrowed about half a guinea of two masters, and the Justice was so good as to let him send for his masters, but they said they did not let him have any, and that was the reason the Justice committed him; and going along, the Prisoner said, it was well for the Prosecutor that he did not come home while he was in the house, for if he had, he should have done him a mischief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor is a very hard-mouthed man. I desire to know, whether I told him I had no money?</p>

            . The Prisoner nursed me in my lying-in, and robbed me of every thing that I had, but the shift on my back. I have lain in but fifteen days to day, and was hardly able to come out; and I had not a farthing left for me nor my babe. She gave the child some stuff to sleep, and she did sleep two days, and never waked; she gave me something to sleep, and I slept all that afternoon, and the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake?</p>
               <p>Harris. About half an hour after two on the sixth of July.</p>

               <p>Harris. She was gone. I sent for my brother, and she was taken up the day before yesterday.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any company in your bed-chamber?</p>
               <p>Peterson. No body, but the Prisoner and I; he came with an intent to marry me.</p>
               <p>Q. So he came with your free consent to pay his addresses to you?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I cannot say but he did, and he desired I would promise him marriage on the Saturday; for he said I might as well do that, as remain single. First he told me he was a Hampshire man, and then he told me he was an Irishman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060030"/>Q. How long had he been with you?</p>
               <p>Peterson. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he take them?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He took them feloniously out of my lap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire any body to stop him?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I did not cry out stop thief, for I did not think he would have served a person so, that he pretended to have a value for.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you to have been married?</p>
               <p>Peterson. That evening, at May-Fair Chapel. I was suspicious of his leaving me, and I went out along with him; he took me to the Red Lion in Silver-Court (I lived in Paradise-Row) and he dropped me in that strange place, and left me with one of his countrymen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him?</p>
               <p>Peterson. On Whitsunday, when he was going to dine on a pigeon pye, with all his company at his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been at his lodging?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Yes, once.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say, when you took him?</p>
               <p>Peterson. He made a great many out of the way speeches, that were not agreeable, to be, and he owned he took the ring and the money.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you make any objection, when he took the money out of your lap?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Yes, and I desired he would return it me again.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Do you know Mrs. Barnes?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you borrow a ring of her, in order to accommodate you for your marriage?</p>
               <p>Peterson. I bought a ring of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the hour six o'clock fixed upon for you to be married?</p>
               <p>Peterson. No, Sir, it was seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he come to you between five and six o'clock, in order to go with you to be married?</p>
               <p>Peterson. Not with my ring. Must a person come to rob me? Gentlemen, take this into consideration. He run away before the Justice, and that looked very unhandsomely. There was one

               <p>Peterson. We went to the Red Lion, in Silver-Court, and he left Mr. Macguire with me; he said, my love, I will come to you presently; and Mr. Macguire said, He does not use you well, nor does he use me well, to leave you in this manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider, madam, you are upon your oath, were not all these things taken by your consent?</p>
               <p>Peterson. No, he took them, all together, out of my lap, without my consent. I was doubtful of him, because he first said he was a Hampshire man, and then he said he was an Irishman; but I was glad I missed of him.</p>

               <p>Barnes. He said he got a little in liquor, and forgot it; she followed him till twelve o'clock at night, and he could not be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy a ring of you?</p>
               <p>Barnes. Yes; she bought it about a fortnight or three weeks before, and she gave me seventeen shillings for it; the Prisoner went out of my house to the Red Lion along with her, and he said, Mrs. Barnes, I will be back again immediately.</p>

               <p>Barnes. They were sometimes, there is no harm in a person's coming in an honourable way, if they come frequently; and there is nothing to the disreputation of the woman. I think it is a barbarous thing to see a person abused in this manner, and by an Irish fellow.</p>

            </rs>, against the form of the Statute, in that case made and provided, in manifest contempt of the laws of this kingdom, to the perversion and destruction of publick justice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>* Statute of II George I.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Prosecution. My Lord, I am council for the prosecution, which is against Mr. Cable, for being guilty of a crime, which the law calls subornation of perjury; and I am sorry to say, that it seems to be attended with two of the foulest circumstances that can be. In the first place it is practised upon an ignorant boy, incapable of judging for himself; and then it is upon a solemn occasion, the election of magistrates for the city of London, and the time of election of magistrates, with respect to the common-council, is a wardmote held on St. Thomas's day, within the city of London. Gentlemen, in the infancy of the city these elections were proceeded upon, and carried on with great calmness, and great impartiality; but as this city grew to be magnificent, and so large as it is, people contended for a share in the government, and it became common to make use of frauds, and other practices, in order for that purpose; and the electors could not have any thing to turn their eyes upon more proper, than to apply a remedy for this evil; for people came with false notions, and took upon themselves a right that they had not, by taking upon themselves to be freemen, when they were not; and there was a remedy made, which remedy is, that it is enacted, That upon a poll being demanded in favour of any candidate, the presiding officer at the wardmote, the alderman of the ward, or, in his absence, his deputy, shall, upon the demand of two persons of the ward, grant a poll; that there shall be clerks sworn, and the poll taken impartially; and every person is to take the strongest testimony, that can be given before man, that he has a right of election for the city of London; for he shall swear, that he is both a freeman of the city, and an householder of the ward, where he is an elector; and the wisdom of this Act of Parliament is obvious to all men; the Legislature had a view to this salutary end, that elections should be made by men of understanding, men of substance, and integrity; and if persons, who have no property to vote, are to be introduced under the names of freemen, of what consequence will this be? I would not be understood to insinuate the least imputation to any of the candidates, for in this election, the competitors on all sides were men of worth and honour; those who succeeded, and those who lost it, from their general characters, would have an abhorrence of this practice, and desire that Mr. Cable may be made an example of, if he is guilty; but I wish it more strongly, that he may make out his innocence to your satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the year 1747, according to ancient and annual custom, on the 21st of December (St. Thomas's day) the customary day of election of common-council-men, the Lord Mayor issued his orders for holding wardmotes in the city; and there was an order issued to Sir

            ) to take the poll; the poll continued that day, and was adjourned to the 23d; but whether matters run very near, or whether the zeal of people run to an unreasonable height, I cannot tell, but, as I am informed. Mr. Cable came to the election, and got hold of a poor ignorant man, so inconsiderable as an apprentice to a butcher, and one who, I am informed, Mr. Cable knew, who brought meat to his house frequently, and he advised him to go up to poll, where this boy took upon himself to be a freeman of the city, and an householder in the ward; and gentlemen, I am informed to say, that at first the boy was shocked at the thing, to pretend to be what he was not, but Mr. Cable encouraged him, and clapping him on the shoulder, he was hurried up, and took the oath, and in consequence of taking that oath he polled.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in such an election as this, it was not an easy thing for a boy to pass under such circumstances, for this boy was neither a freeman nor an householder, but Mr. Cable himself became sponsor for the boy, and warranted him to be as good a vote as any in London. Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses to prove this, and I am sorry to say it, but, according to my brief, we have more witnesses than one to prove it; and if you are satisfied with the evidence, you will, no doubt, think it your duty to find a verdict for the crown, in order to put a stop to that practice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060033"/> which is prejudicial to the good government of the city of London, which I think is a great guard to the liberties of Britain.</p>

               <p>Caruthers. I was standing in the hall, facing the pulpit, between the two isles, when this Walker was coming up the hall; Mr. Cable spoke to him, and said, Brother Walker, what are you come to poll? I cannot tell what more he said then, but afterwards he said, D - n it, brother Walker, you have as good a poll as any body, you have a right to a single vote, and you shall go and poll for brother Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the table where he polled?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I did not go up to the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this Walker live near Mr. Cable?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Mr. Cable lives in Warwick-Lane, and I believe Mr. Hyde lives in a court in Warwick-Lane; but I don't know whether he lives there now.</p>
               <p>Def. Coun. on the cross examination. What officer are you?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I belong to St. Faith's, and am beadle of the parish.</p>

               <p>Caruthers. He was in a dirty frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of hi m?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I did not think it at that time.</p>

               <p>Caruthers. I believe he is twenty years of age, or better.</p>

               <p>Caruthers. I will tell you the truth; whenever he meets me, at almost every place, he calls me perjured and forsworn rascal, and all the parish will tell you, that he always used me in this manner; but I told him, if he did not hold his tongue, I would take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between Walker and him?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Mr. Cable said, Brother Walker, are you come to poll? and he said, Brother Walker, you have as good a single poll as any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, that he said to him, You have a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether the words were not, Whether he had a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, he asked him, whether he was not come to poll?</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, whether he did not ask him if he had a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. How should you like it, to have a man indicted for asking another to vote for his friend?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, I should not like it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make this declaration against this Cable?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yesterday, in the market, when he mobbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare this at other times?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not you say you would send him to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make a declaration, that you would keep him in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare, before Mr. Newby and Mr. Leversedge, that you would keep him in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, I don't know that I did; I said I would send him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you stand by it, that you did not make such a declaration, at the Bell in Warwick-Lane.</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not that I know of.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060034"/>Lyne. I was at the polling-table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Cable there?</p>
               <p>Lyne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Walker there?</p>

               <p>Q. Tell what you saw or heard between Mr. Cable and Walker?</p>
               <p>Lyne. Mr. Cable and Walker came up pretty near together, and Walker called himself a pewterer by company; and deputy Sclater made an objection, and said he did not know such a man in the ward, then Mr. Cable clapped his hand upon Walker's back, and said he believed he was a good poll.</p>
               <p>Def. Coun. on the cross examination. You say, he said he believed he was a good poll?</p>
               <p>Lyne. I believe he said he was a good poll.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he bring Walker up, or take hold of him?</p>

               <p>Lyne. No, I only went to him to be examined.</p>
               <p>Q. To be examined for what?</p>
               <p>Lyne. To be examined by Mr. Robinson the attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him, whether Mr. Cable persuaded him to do this, or that, or the other?</p>
               <p>Lyne. I desired him to tell nothing but the truth, but to be sure to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear Mr. Cable say any thing till after he had polled?</p>

               <p>Coun. for the Pros. What do you know of this election?</p>
               <p>Sclater. I came here out of curiosity, I did not think of being an evidence, but as I am call'd, I will tell you the truth as far as I know. The Defendant met this fellow the butcher in the middle of the Hall, and after he had talked with Mr. Cable some time, he came to the poll book, and Mr. Cable had hold of Mr. Walker under the arm; and towards the close of a poll, every body have their eyes upon the persons that come to poll; I saw his name in the book, and said, I do not believe there was any such person in the Ward; and I remember the Alderman's saying, if he would take the oath, he could not refuse his polling; and upon that Mr. Cable clapped him on the shoulder, and said, he was as good a vote as any in England.</p>
               <p>Def. Coun. This was after he had polled?</p>

               <p>Coun. for the Def. My Lord, I think he cannot be a witness, for he appears upon the face of this record to be guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, for he went voluntarily and swore he was a freeman and an housholder, and now he is to swear directly the contrary, and he must one way or other be guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, for they are diametrically opposite; and if he had been convicted of perjury, he could not be a witness, because the King cannot restore a person to the credit he had before: and I think there is as much reason for his not being admitted a witness, as if the record of his conviction had been produced in Court; and as to a person's being admitted an evidence who owns he is perjur'd, I cannot see; I never knew it, and for that reason I hope such a president will not be introduced, to admit a person who has been guilty of perjury, to swear against another, when his conscience ought to have flown in his face, and have prevented him. I have taken pains to find out, whether ever any man was admitted to give evidence in a case of subornation of perjury, that was guilty of perjury himself; I never knew it in my life, and I hope he will not be admitted.</p>
               <p>The second Council for the Defendant argued, that if this person, who has owned himself to be guilty of perjury, should be admitted to give evidence, it would be attended with the greatest inconveniences that could be; and hoped that this would be taken to be as strong an evidence of perjury, as if the record of his conviction had been produced: and that this prosecution was bolstered up to convict a Gentleman of subornation of perjury, of as good a character as any man in the City of London; and that there never was an instance of any person, who has been guilty of such a crime, of being admitted an evidence in a case of this nature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This was likewise argued in a full manner by the Council for the prosecution, when many cases were cited, and a reply made by the Council for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060035"/> the Defendant; after which

               <p>Q. What company are you free of?</p>
               <p>Walker. I mentioned the pewterer's company, but I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mention the pewterer's company?</p>

               <p>Coun. for the Def. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am council for the Defendant, Mr. Cable; against whom there is a very heavy accusation, of doing a thing which is of a pernicious nature, and attended with very ill consequences, and whoever is guilty of it, must remain eternally infamous, till he comes to his grave. I hope these instances are not frequent; and I hope no man is so wicked, as, in the face of the world, (though it is as wicked in private) to suborn a person to commit perjury; all innocent and honest men ought to be aware of such an act, as having a tendency to destroy the good government of such a famous city, for I have a detestation of such things; and I am against bringing persons into offices, who are not fit for them, as having a tendency to the ill government of this city. It was very well that the Legislature interfered in this case, and the living Magistrates are testimonies against this practice, and I hope they will be so to the last of times; I do not doubt their integrity, and hope this will never be overthrown. This is an Act of Parliament, made to prevent cases of this nature, and not only for the punishment of the crime; but I hope you will think, that there was no crime committed in this case. It was opened, that the boy was shocked at it, if he had, he would not have done it; but I would not ask him the question, for I would not give him any credit; and if you, Gentlemen, are of opinion with me, I would not convict a dog upon his testimony; for must a man's reputation be impeached, and he liable to be convicted of subornation of perjury, upon the evidence of this infamous fellow? I hope the Court will excuse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060036"/> me in saying so. My Lord, this evidence seems, for it must be taken all together, not to amount to a proof of subornation of perjury. What the witnesses have said, I will recollect as well as I can, and I hope I shall not err. This gentleman never saw the fellow, till he came into the hall, and had laid down his tray. One of the gentlemen on the other side calls him an ignorant boy; look at him, Gentlemen, no body would take him to be the babe he is represented to be, for he is twenty-two years of age. Then they say, Mr. Cable knew that he was not a freeman. I should have thought it as reasonable to suppose, that Mr. Cable could, by looking in the boy's face, know what money he had in his pocket. But the most of the thing lies here, knowing that he was not a freeman How should I know he was not a freeman? he might be in partnership with his master, for what I know, and live with his master. Then they say, Mr. Cable shook hands with him, and says, he hopes he will poll for this person, or that person, or the other person. This is a barbarous doctrine, to call this subornation of perjury: Who would meddle with elections, if this is the case? great is the danger, great is the inconvenience. But, Gentlemen, if you suffer this, you are making a rod to whip all the honest voters in the kingdom; for if a man comes, and swears falsely, then what has he to do? why he comes, and says this man induced me to do it; and a man, that has the best interest, is liable to suffer most upon these occasions; but, Gentlemen, suppose you should give credit to him ( though as I give no credit to him, I hope you will not; especially as you have heard what the other witnesses have said. Is it reasonable to suppose, that a man, in an open hall, where every body must know what he said, would do this?) is every person to be punished under this Act of Parliament for asking another to vote? No, Gentlemen, there must be something more than the bare asking a man to vote. The Act says, If any person shall corrupt, or suborn any person, &amp;c. I, with great submission to the honourable Bench, say, that it is bribery and reward, that tempts people to forswear themselves; therefore it must be something more, under this Act of Parliament, than bare asking a man, that makes it subornation of perjury; for no body can suppose, that any body would come there, without they have a right, and Mr. Cable would not have asked him, if he had known that he had not been a freeman, and an householder.

               <p>Think, Gentlemen, again for yourselves and your fellow-citizens, whether this will amount to such an offence as subornation of perjury. Then comes Mr. Caruthers, and he seems to be very angry; he is willing to go as far as he can, but he does not make use of any expression that he heard any words come out of Mr. Cable's mouth sufficient to convict him of the crime; but at last he says, he told the boy he had as good a vote as any body; and Mr. Cable must have been a most abandoned wretch to have asked him, if he had known he was disqualified from voting.

             says, that Mr. Cable said he believed he was a good vote: I have heard of people that have been thought to be very good votes, who have been rejected five hundred times in the City of London. My Lord, I will trespass a few words more; I hope by the boy's evidence, we shall establish the character of that Gentleman, as a person incapable of being guilty of any under-hand practice, much less that he should be guilty of a crime of this nature. We shall shew, that he has in all cases in life, acted with the greatest integrity; and I hope it will never be suspected, that a man, who has always behaved well, will jump into the jaws of destruction (which is open before them) to eternity, and D - n them both. Gentlemen, I don't find there was any benefit or reward accruing from this; it is hard and unreasonable to suppose, that a man for nothing at all, should be guilty of this. Can this gain belief with any body?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, We shall call our witnesses to the Prisoner's character, and the character of the boy: this is the defence we shall make, and I hope for the sake of him, and all honest men, that you will not find a verdict against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Second Coun. for the Def. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg a few words in favour of the Prisoner: the crime that he stands indicted for is the greatest crime that can be committed; and I do say, that all elections of Magistrates should be without biass; and it is necessary, that prosecutions should be set on foot for the sake of publick justice, and to punish the criminal; but this should not be done out of partiality or malice, to punish a person, who, as far as I can see, cannot be guilty of this crime. And Gentlemen, the indictment against the Defendant,

               <p>rought, they have not said a word that he is not a freeman, or an householder; which I take to be the offence of the indictment, and therefore I hope the Court will not proceed any further. And, Gentlemen, I beg leave to take notice, that Mr. Cable is an inhabitant of the city of London, he has been for twenty years a householder, and for the space of ten years has carried on a flourishing trade, and reckoned to be as honest a man as any in the city of London, till he fell under this imputation. Gentlemen, he is by business a chocolate-maker, has by this lost his business, and is now almost undone; and if he is entirely innocent, hard is the fate of the man, that he should be ruined, and lose all his fortune in the world. They have brought several witnesses to prove this indictment, but there is not one witness that has proved it. One of the witnesses is so infamous a fellow, that he is not worth any regard; as to another, he shews the most inveterate malice; for it appears, he has declared that he would keep this unhappy man in Newgate all his life. What rancour must this be! Therefore this does not seem to be a thing done for the sake of publick justice, but set on foot out of malice and spleen, and for the sake of rancour, and not for the benefit of the city of London. Gentlemen, is there any evidence that he knew this man not to be a freeman and an householder? Is there any evidence, that he bid this man say that he was a freeman and an householder? Is there any evidence to shew, that he said he was a freeman? If there is no evidence of this, what are you to try? why, that thi s was from a wicked and corrupt procurement, that this man was induced to do this; but as infamous as he is, he has not sworn any such thing. What have their witnesses sworn? One of them says, that Mr. Cable clapped him on the back, and said he had a good vote; but did he procure him to swear? Gentlemen, what crime this is, I am at a loss to know upon this evidence; and I dare say, that the Gentlemen on the other side will give it up, for I must say, that they have not proved any title of this indictment; and then they bring up the rear with a person, who has been guilty of a crime so atrocious as perjury; and I cannot represent the inconveniency of this to be bad enough, that this man should come to prove a fact of this nature, and which fact he has not proved. He says, Mr. Cable said that he should take a single vote, for he had as good a vote as any body there; but there is nothing said of telling him of swearing that he is a freeman, and an householder; he has not proved, that Mr. Cable induced him to swear any thing of that, and Mr. Hyde, the master of this boy, says, he does not think that Mr. Cable was acquainted with this man. Gentlemen, this infamous fellow went into Newgate-Market, and said among the butchers, You are all a parcel of scoundrels, I am a gentleman, and have been voting for my namesake, Mr. Walker. Now, Gentlemen, this is all they have proved against the Defendant, who is a freeman of the city of London, and an householder; with all their learned arguments, with all their flourishing, and great ingenuity, Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses, and prove him to be a man of the greatest integrity and honour that can be; and give me leave to say, that this prosecution is set on foot out of spleen and malice, and not for the sake of publick justice; therefore I hope you will find the Prisoner not guilty.</p>
