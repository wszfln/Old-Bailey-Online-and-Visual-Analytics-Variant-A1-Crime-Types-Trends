               <p>Prisoner. I saw this Woman first by the Turn-Stile in Band street she sighed, and said, she had been at the Pyed Bull, an there they had broke her of two Dozen of Spoons. What Spoons? says I. And then she shew'd me one. I ask'd her the Price, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173410160003"/> told me 18 d. a Dozen. I let her know that I belong'd to the Trade, and if the Spoons were good Metal, and she came honestly by them, she could not afford to sell them at that Price. Whereupon she run away, and I afterwards happen'd to call in at a Gin-shop in Carnaby-Market, and while I was there, this Woman came by, and so I goes to her, to know what Authority she had to hawk such Goods. You are one of the Rogues that sells Buttons about the Streets, says she, and then she flew upon me, and struck me in the Face, and then taking up one of her Spoons, she said, See here, you Rogue, here is my Spoon, I neither stole it nor is it bad Metal; and what has such a Rogue as you to do with it? I took the Spoon out of her Hand to look at it, and then John Wing said, Now by God she shall swear a Robbery against you. A great Mob gather'd about us, and they took her part more than mine, and so I was carry'd before Justice Lambert, and committed to the Round-house. As for what she says of the 2 Dozen of Spoons, I never touched 'em, for I meddled with none but that one Spoon as she shewed me in Carnaby-Market.</p>

The Prisoner and another Woman came in, and asked for some Cambletee for a Gown: We agreed for a Shilling a Yard, and then the Prisoner bid me cut off 12 Yards, which I did. Then she felt a good while in her Bosom with her left Hand for her Money, and the same time fumbled under her Apron with her right Hand. I suppose she was hiding the piece of Cambletee. Then she said she had left her Purse at home; and so she laid down half a Crown earnest, and said she would go home for her Purse and come again presently; but as she and her Companion were going out at the Door I mist the piece of Cambletee ; the other Woman run up the Street, and the Prisoner into an Entry; I follow'd her, and brought her back, she said she had got nothing, but the piece was afterwards found in that Entry.</p>

I desired to see her Box, she open'd it, and the first Thing I saw was a Handkerchief of mine which I claim'd. Yes, says she, that is yours, and a great many more Things which you little think of. Some of the Things were my own, and the rest had been Pledged to me. There was in particular a little Doll's Gold-Ring. I asked her if she did not take a Moidore out of my Breeches as they hung up; she said no, but she tookout a Guinea - I lost in all to the value of 12 l. or 14 l. She said she took the Goods at several times at the Ware-house Door. My Ware-house is up Stairs on the same Floor with the Nursery. When a Customer comes to redeem any Thing, 'tis common for us to take the Bag in which are several sorts of Goods, and empty at the Ware-house Door to look for what we want, and when we have found it, we carry it down, and leave the rest of the Things there till we come up again; and the Prisoner took these Opportunities to steal the Goods.</p>

I took Coach directly, and when I came home I found my 'Scritore had been forced open, and the Goods taken away. I went into my Garden, and close to the Back door I saw the Mark of two Feet, which look'd as if some Man had dropt from the Garden Wall. Near the Stable Door I found other Footsteps, and there lay a green Purse with some Gold in it, which I suppose had been dropt in the hurry. The Bar of the Stable Window was forced out, and the Glass was broke, by which I supposed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173410160005"/> the Rogue made his way out; and one thing that made me suspect the Prisoner, was, that I found his Cane in the Stable Window. The Cane was remarkable, because it had an Iron Thimble upon it instead of a Ferril. I went back by the same Coach to my Friends at the Castle Tavern, to consult with them what Method I had best to take for discovering the Thief, and they advised me to put an Advertisement in the Daily Post. But about Two a Clock in the Morning I was knocked up, and told that the Prisoner was taken.</p>

            , the Prosecutor's Servant. About seven in the Evening I went out on an Errand, and there being Nobody else in the House, I left a Candle on the Stairs to light myself in. The Back Door was on the Latch, and I locked the Street Door and took the Key with me. I was gone about a quarter of an Hour, and then Thomas Brooks, a Foot-boy (but he was not my Master's Servant) came home with me. When I opened the Door all was dark, and I could not find my Candle. Lord, says I to Brooks, Call your Nanny, for our John has been here - I suspected him, because he had done some ugly Tricks while he lived in my Master's Service. I mist a Gold Watch out of my Master's Chamber, and a Draught on the Bank for 137 l. besides what was lost out of the 'Scritoire. I saw Marks of Feet under the Garden Wall, the Key of the Stable Door was taken away, and the Window was propt up with the Prisoner's Cane.</p>

I saw several Things taken from him, as 3 Cornelian Seals set in silver, some Gold Lace, a Shagreen Case, a Brass Shoe-Snuff-Box, a little pair of Steel Tweezers, and a Tin Box of Gunpowder. - Other Things had been taken from him before I came, by the Order of my Beadle Tim.

One of the Watchmen said, that the Prisoner offered to stick him, and was very troublesome; upon which I ordered him to be Hand-cuffed and searched - He had this Hanger in his Hand; there is a Knife and Fork in the Handle of it - And in his Pockets were found a Gold Watch and Case, a Gold Chain and Hook, four Seals and a silver Snuff-Box with a Stone in the top - the Haft of a Knife with a Nail fastened in it, and turned up crooked, which. I suppose, was to pick Locks with; a Pistol and a Tin Box. I asked him what was in that Tin Box; and he said it was Havanna Snuff, but it proved to be Gunpowder.</p>

            . About Nine at Night as I was going by Mr. Forsithe's Shop, an Acquaintance of mine (James Francis) called me in, and said there was a Man that had got a great many Valuables, which he believed he did not come honestly by. I went in and found the Prisoner, and happened to know him; for about five Weeks before, I saw him at a Publick House, and then he said he was out of Place, and had but Three half-pence in the World; and by what I saw now, I thought the Times were much mended with him, for he shewed me a Hanger mounted with silver, which he flourished o'er his Head, and then put it up again, and went backwards and called for a Quartern of Gin. Then he shewed us a Gold Watch and Seals, which he said were his own, and that he dealt for such Things to France and Spain. We begun to question him a little, upon which he appeared very much ruffled, asked us what Business we had with his Way of Dealing, and if we had a mind to have a slice of his Hanger? We told him, no. But however he offered to draw in earnest, upon which we seized him. Then he endeavoured to pull out a Pistol. Mr. Francis told me there was no danger, for he had seen the Pistol a little before, and it was not charged. Now, says I to my Gentleman, you shall give an account how you came by these Things before we part with you. The Man of the House was sent for home. As soon as he came in he struck the Prisoner, and told him he had surprized his Wife. There was one Watchman in the House, and Mr. Forsithe went for another, then we carried the Prisoner to the Watch-house.</p>

            . I was smoaking a Pipe in Mr. Forsithe's Shop; the Prisoner came in, and said to Mrs. Forsithe, Madam, Will you please to give me a Pinch of Snuff? She said, Yes. Now, Madam, says he, what return shall I make you for this Favour? She told him, she desired none. Then, says he, will you give me leave to walk into your Back Room, and drink a Dram. She said he was welcome, and so he went in and had a half-penny Dram. There he pulled out this Hanger, and some of these other Things. I had some suspicion of him because he did not make an Appearance to be the Owner of such Goods. He took out a Pistol, and was going to charge it, for he said he had 500 l. value about him, and was to go to Bloomsbury, and from thence to Kensington that Night, and therefore must provide for his own safety; but I told him he had better load his Pistol somewhere else for fear of frightening the Woman of the Shop, and so he desisted. Mr. Seymour coming to the Door, I called him aside, and told him what I suspected; upon which he came in, and said, he had some Knowledge of the Fellow. The Prisoner shewed us all his Things, and would treat us with a Quartern. Seymour asked him who he deals with for those Goods. He answered, that he dealt Abroad with foreign Gentlemen. Why says I, those are English Goods. Upon this and some other Words he grew angry, and offered to draw his Hanger, asking us if we would have a slice of it. But we prevented him, and threw him into a Chain.</p>

The Prosecutor left his Trunk locked fast; and as for the Door of the Room being open, perhaps when a Friend has staid late at my House, I have got him to go up and lie with the Prisoner.

            . Last Saturday Night was three Weeks, I went to visit the Prisoner, at Mr. Pellit's House in Martin's-Lane, where she lived, and I was to stay with her all Night. I happen'd to hurt my Ancle, and she desir'd the Deceas'd, who was her fellow Servant, to fetch up a little Vinegar, to bathe it with, and to bring the Bread and Butter with him. He refus'd at first, but after a little while he went and did as she desir'd. Then she bid him go out of the Room, because I was going to rub my Leg. No, he said, he would not go till he had some Bread and Butter. She told him he had supt already, and should have no more. Upon which, he fell a damning her, and calling her a great many ill Names, and told her, she was a Bitch and a Whore, like her Sister. She said, Don't provoke me so, for fear I throw something at you. She had a Case-knife in her Hand, and she threw it at him, and it struck in his Side. He went out, into the Entry, and coming in again, holding his Hand to his Side, he said, Betty, you have cut me. She said, Where? He shew'd her, and I said, Lord! you have cut him indeed! and she said, Christ! I have kill'd the Man! - His Caul hung out of the Wound - He went to Bed, and she went down, and bid a Watchman call a Surgeon. The Surgeon came and dress'd the Wound; he said it was very bad, and that he must advise with another Surgeon in the Morning, and so he went away. And the Prisoner made some Sage-Tea for the Deceas'd, and sat up with him all Night - He died about 5 a Clock on Sunday in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot, the Surgeon. Between 1 and 2 on Sunday Morning, I was called to assist the Deceas'd. The Prisoner said he had fell upon a Knife, and he did not contradict it. He had a dangerous Wound in the Abdomen, about 5 Inches from the Navel, and rather below it. The Orifice was so large, that a Portion of the Caul hung out, and the Wound was very Deep. Some of the Intestines and large blood Vessels were cut, and he had lost a vast Quantity of Blood. Between 7 and 8 the same Morning I was call'd again by the Prisoner, I desir'd the Assistance of another Surgeon, who came and approv'd of what I did. I visited the Deceas'd again at 11, at 2 and 4 in the Afternoon, and he died about 5. Here is the Case-knife - 'Tis round at the End, but something sharp tho' not pointed; and the Wound exactly answers it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not tell the Surgeon that the Deceas'd fell on the Knife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. I asked how the Wound came, and was answer'd that he fell upon the Knife. I will not be positive that you made the answer, but there was nobody present but you and

            . I live in the same House, I am Mr. Pellit's Book-keeper; I was a Bed when the accident happen'd, and heard nothing of it till 8 o'Clock on Sunday Morning, and then I heard her say her self that she did it, and that she flung the Knife at him. I ask'd her for what reason? And she answer'd, because he call'd me Whore, and I would do it again if he was to call me so again;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173410160010"/> and if I had not done it, I should have done it another time. Mr. Kindleside the Apothecary was then present, and ask'd her if the Deceas'd had offered any rudeness to her, and she said, No - They were often quarrelling, and she was commonly the aggressor, for she was very Insolent. About 3 Weeks before this happen'd, he was in the Yard, and did something that displeased her, upon which she went out to him: He gave way; she follow'd him: He ran up Stairs, and she after him; but he shutting his Door upon her, she stood Scolding and calling him names for a quarter of an Hour, and then she came down and said, she would be reveng'd on him, and do him a Mischief one time or another.</p>

I desired Mr. Williams to take care that she did not escape while I went for a Constable, and indeed she attempted to get away twice; but he forced her into a Chair - I ask'd the Deceas'd how it happen'd. He own'd he call'd her Whore, but said he offer'd no rudeness, and that she was a violent passionate Creature, and had often threatned to do his business; and he believ'd she had done it now. I ask'd the Prisoner the same question, and she answer'd, he aggravated me and call'd me Whore, and if he was to do so again, I would do the same. I found the Knife (that I suppose it was done with) among the foul Knives. It was bloody like rust, up to the Shoulder - that is, to this rising part of the blade - I could not conceive how such a Case Knife that was not pointed, but round at the End, could be thrown so, as to pierce through a strong Coat and Waistcoat, and a Dowlas Shirt, and so far into the Body: Which made me ask the Deceas'd about that particular. He said it was done so quick, that he knew not whether she threw it or struck him with it in her Hand - The Girl

I gave him a Basket, and desir'd him to step down, and fetch me up some Walnuts, I being busy with a Customer He staying much longer than was necessary, I call'd him, and he said he was coming, and so he came up, with about half a hundred of Walnuts, tho' he might have brought half a Bushell in less time. Presently after I had taken them from him, he held up his Hand, as if somebody had call'd him, but no Body did, as far as I could hear; and so he went away. In about ten Minutes afterwards, I had occasion to change a Guinea, and so went to my Trunk, and miss'd all my Money; which was kept Guineas and a Half, for I had put a half Guinea in, but a Quarter of an Hour before the Prisoner came; and from that time, to the time I miss'd the Money, no Body went down the Cellar but he. The next Day, about 11 in the Morning he was taken.</p>

No, says he, but if she is, I'll go and fetch her back. So he went away, and I miss'd my Goods, but they never darkened my Doors afterwards I took him about a Week afterwards, and then his Brother came and told me, if I would be easy he could help me to my Goods again, for they were at his House.

               <p>The SPECIFICK INJECTION or LOTION,</p>
               <p>Which in Nineteen Years private Practice has cured 673 Gonorrheas or Claps, (without taking any Medicine by the Mouth) and has kept several Hundreds from Clap or Pox, which is sufficient to convince the World of its Efficacy.</p>
               <p>IT intirely destroys and carries off all Venereal Contagion, (because it reaches the Cause immediately, which no Medicine taken by the Mouth can do, being liable as well as Food to the Alterations made upon them by the Stomach) thereby prevents all the dismal Attendants of impure Embraces, as Inflammation, Scalding of Urine, Cordee, Phymosis, Paraphymosis, Herniaveneris, or swell'd schirrbous Testicles, Buboes, Gleets, Shankers, dribling of Semen at Stool or Urine, in short, any kind of the Pox. Besides, it saves a Constitution which is too often tore to pieces by harsh Drugs, ill applied by ignorant Dabblers in Sin, Mercury, and Antimony, and spares the nauseous Trouble of swallowing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173410160015"/> such poisonous Slops, and the Confinement those rugged Drugs require; and never fails acting with Safety, Secrecy and Ease, upon Man or Woman, without Confinement or Alteration of Diet. It cures old Claps, Shankers, nay if you piss thro' a Dozen Holes, (old Gleets, careous Ulcers in the Uraethra or Prostatiae, and all manner of Weakness from Nocturnal or Self-pollution, and Whites in Women, when every thing else is left off.) I have been long of Dr. Cockburn's Opinion, not to make publick any thing of this Nature; but I see People as bold in Iniquity as ever, notwithstanding the bad Consequents of it; and really the common Methods of Cure are none of the least Punishments attending it; witness the vast Numbers of fine Youth, both Male and Female, daily ruin'd, nay rotten before ripe, who seldom or never recover the Injury, which is oftner their Doctor's Fault than the Distemper's, which will run longer without hurting the Body, than when stopt by violent or frequent Purging Pills, Bolusses, Electuaries, Balsamick Elixirs, and lastly, Astringents, and what not. Simple Colds breed many Diseases, and simple-Claps, as they are generally managed, I affirm, lays not only a Foundation for the Pox, but Gout, Gravel, Leprosy, Rheumatism, King's Evil and Scurvy, whatever People think to the contrary: Therefore I can no longer prevail with my self to with-hold so useful a Remedy from my fellow Creatures, who are daily imposed upon, both in publick Prints and private Practice, by People who generally know no more of a human Body, or the Operation of Medicine, than the Patient does, but uses such or such a Thing, because their Master did, or such a Man or such a Book taught them; and how generally so unconscionable are as not to be satisfied with killing Men by a longed winded Cure, &amp;c. but must entail Misery upon Posterity, rather than lose their unjust Gain.</p>
               <p>To convince the World this is published for a general Good, which the Rich may chuse, Desipiantur, it is sold at 7 s. 6 d. with ample Directions for the Author, at Mr.

People who want Help, or are tired out with the Pox and Apothecaries Slops, may do the same.</p>
               <p>N.B. I cure without Mercury, Antimony or Salivation: One Bottle of this will prevent many Claps, and generally cures a common one. It will keep many Years in any Climate. Ask for a Bottle of Wash, which is wrap'd and seal'd up. This never would have been made publick in this manner, could I have rendered it so extensively useful for Mankind without publishing.</p>
