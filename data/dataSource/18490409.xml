                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, living at Edmonton. On 14th Feb., about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner about ten yards from Mr. Kendle's house, walking backwards and forwards, as if keeping a look out, for about a quarter of an hour—he was smoking a cigar, and I took out one, and said, "Will you oblige me with a light?" and he gave me one.</p>

                  </hi>. On 14th Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to call on Mr. Kendle, I knocked three times, but could get no answer, and went to the back of the house, but did not go to the door for fear of the dog—I saw a very clear light in the house—the prisoner was close to the front steps—he looked at me very hard for some time—I had seen him before—I do not think he knew me—I said nothing to him—when I left the back of the house he walked before me—I left him there, and returned home.</p>

The prisoner was in my charge—he made a statement to me—I said nothing to induce him to make it—he said his brother went to London the Sunday before, and got four men to come down and rob Mr. Kendle's house, and on the Wednesday morning they came down and robbed the house while he stood outside—that after they had done it his brother fetched him, and they went down the road, and found the four men, and his brother held a pistol to his head, and told him he was to go and show the men the way to the Ponder's-end railway station, and he went and then left them, and came home—he said Passey was one of the men, and he did not know the names of the others—after he was committed, he told me if there had been any money I should not have found him, that it was not goods they went for, but money.</p>

I was in the Exeter hotel on the night of 11th March—I saw the prisoner standing close to the bar at the Exeter-street door—he asked me if I did not think it was a bad job that his money happened to turn out to be a bad half-crown—I told him as the landlord and landlady had taken so many lately, it behoved them to keep their eyes open, and that I should do the same if I were in their place—the prisoner paid for what he had and went away—I followed him; he went out of the Exeter-street door, and went straight towards the City—the first street he came to was Savoy-street—he just turned the corner, and he had hardly time to say "<hi rend="italic">Jack"</hi> to a man he met—they joined company, and went straight up the Strand towards the City, and I after them, till they got to Lombard-street—they stopped about two minutes—they went to a court and stopped about one minute, and then the prisoner went into the court, and into the Woolpack tavern—the other man went away—I gave information imme<lb/>diately to an officer—I went into the Woolpack after the prisoner had been taken back there by the officer—I asked the prisoner if he knew me—he said "Oh dear no"—I said, "You do not recollect seeing me in the Exeter hotel"—he said, "No"—I had the half of the half-crown which Mr. Dicke<lb/>son's brother had put into my band—I held it up, and said, "Do you know this?"—he said, "Oh dear no;"he knew nothing of it.</p>

On Wednesday evening, 17th Jan., I was in Angel-alley with Eliza Graves, about seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner as he was going to the shop with some work—he came back about eight—he seemed rather angry—I asked him what time it was, and he said about eight—he asked me where I had been, and I said no further than the door—while talking to him John Sumner came by: I went to him, and was talking to him about ten minutes—the prisoner saw me talking to him, and when the conversation was over the prisoner was gone—Graves went in search of him—I followed, and found him in Skinner-street—I put his cap on his head, and he knocked it off and flung it over the wall at the back of his own house; I recovered it and took it to him—he then walked into Back-alley—I then went indoors into my own house—shortly afterwards, in consequence of what Graves said, I went out again—he had sent for me—I asked him what he wanted—he said that was his business; I should see what he wanted with me if I waited time enough—he then seized hold of my right hand—I asked what he held my hand so tight for—he said that was his business—I got my hand away, and he seized me by my dress—I kept asking him to let me go in doors; he would not—I turned my head from him, about ten minutes, to talk to Graves, and as I was going to ask him again he fired a pistol at me—he had still hold of my dress with his left hand—I saw the pistol—it was about half a yard from me—I felt that I was wounded on the side of the head—I fell down twice—Sumner came and picked me up, and when I came to my senses I found myself at the hospital.</p>

I was at the Salutation hotel, Newgate-street—these papers now produced were in my private sitting-room—they are marked in the usual way of law papers, "Cowley, Buckingham"—I put them into my carpet bag on Thursday, and on the Friday night I put other things in the bag—they were there then—I left them there—next morning' when I came down, the bag and its contents were gone—I gave notice to the police, and adver<lb/>tised them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William White, a shoemaker. In Jan. last we lived in Summers-street, Back-hill, Hatton-garden, in the same house with the prisoners—I lived in the front room first-floor, and they in the back room—on the Saturday before the inquest the male prisoner went out about eight o'clock—they had two children, a boy and a girl; the boy had been ill on the Friday—I went to the door about half-past nine, and asked the female prisoner how the child was—she said he was better; it was only a fit he had had—I did not go into the room; she held the door half shut—I did not tee the child—she went out twice or three times in the' course of an hour, and the last time she went out I saw her go across the road to Mrs. Parker, with her little girl—I saw her from my window—she was there about three minutes—I did not hear any noise in their room while she was away—I heard her come back; she opened her door very quickly, as if it was not locked—she had left the girl at Mrs. Parker's—she walked half across the room, and then stopped, and began to scream—she came to me immediately, and said her boy bad burnt himself—I followed her into her room—she took the child up in her arm; it was near the fireplace; I cannot say whether it was sitting or standing; I think it was sitting—she then pulled its clothes off, and sat it on. its bottom—the room was full of smoke—the child bad a brown stuff frock on and a pinafore—the clothes were very much burnt, and smouldered a good deal after they were taken off; they were burnt in front—the child said, "Mother, I have been screaming for you;" but he said it so low I could scarcely hear it—there was no fender before the fire, and there was very little fire in the grate; it was red behind, and a little on each side—it is a very small fireplace, and has only three bars—there was no fire in front—I put my hand in between the bars; I did not touch them—I put my stuff-apron between the bars, and held it there an instant, and the fire did not catch it; there was no flame—I said to the female prisoner, "My good woman, the child could not have burnt itself at that fire; did you leave any lucifers or any paper about?"—she said, "No"—I said, "How could he do it?"—she said he was a tiresome contrary child; he would do what the told him not to do—she put some oil on the child's neck—I said she had better take it to the hospital, but she would have the doctor sent for—Mrs. Parker came in about ten minutes after, and she said she would send her girl for the doctor, and she went away immediately—the doctor came immediately, and told her to take the child to the hospital, because he wanted immediate attention—when I went in there was a saucepan on the hob, and a little one on the fire, with the handle sticking out—the female prisoner said to the child, while he was sitting on her knee, "You naughty boy, why did you do it did not I tell you not to touch the fire? I begged of you before I went out not to meddle with the fire"—the child's aunt took it to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend the child on the Friday, the day before the burning—it then appeared in a state of collapse; it was in a fit—I ordered its feet into hot water, and some castor oil to be brought, which I gave it—it was in a very weak, emaciated state, and required nourishment, and I sent some meat for it—I was called on the following day, and found it on the mother's lap—I examined it, found it was very much burnt, and ordered it to be sent to the hospital immediately—I saw the clothes; they appeared to have been burnt by a smouldering fire—the mother was rubbing the child with oil; as a domestic remedy that was as good a thing as she could apply at the moment—I noticed the fire; it is possible that if the child had been trying to reach the saucepan, in which the broth was, it might have pulled a hot cinder on to its lap.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 27th Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I was at the shop-door, and saw the prisoner coming down King-street, with another man, driving some beasts—just as the beasts got to the corner of Fox and Knot-court, the deceased and another man or two were standing at the corner of the court—the man who was with the prisoner called out to the deceased, as he was about to cross the front of the beasts, and told him to stop—the hallooing frightened one of the beasts, and it ran away, when it again joined the remainder, and was about to enter the court—the deceased ran in front of the beasts, and turned them back again, and I had great trouble to keep them out of my master's window and door—the prisoner called out to the deceased, and said, "What did you run across the beasts for, and turn them back?"—the deceased said, "Why did not you call to me?"—the prison said, "I did; besides, have you hot eyes to see?"—the man who was with the prisoner said, "I should like to cut you across the a—with a stick"—the prisoner then said, "I should like to <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> your bead for you"—deceased said, "You can't do it; I should like to catch you at it"—the prisoner said to him again, "I will <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> your b----y head for you if you do not go away"—the prisoner had a stick in his right hand, which he changed into his left, and raised his hand and arm, as if to hit the deceased; but he did not strike him—he turned away about half a dozen yards, towards the court—the deceased called after him, "You had better do it; it will take a better man than you to do it"—the prisoner then turned round again, and hit him in the face with his fist—the deceased returned several blows; they doted in each other's arms, and fell both together; they then got up, and the prisoner was stooping down, picking up his cap, which fell while they were struggling, and the deceased hit him some blows upwards, about the face and head—the prisoner then got into an upright position again, and was putting his cap on, and I have no doubt would have gone away without taking further notice of it, but the deceased went and struck him several more blows, about the face and head, before he was aware of it—they closed in each other's</p>

On 16th Feb. the prisoner came to my shop between four and five o'clock, and asked for half a quartern loaf, and gave me a bad shilling—I did not notice it to be bad till he was turning out of the door—I put it on the back counter, apart from all other money, marked it, and put it in a piece of paper, and locked it up in a drawer, where it remained till the 28th, when the prisoner came again for two half-quartern loaves—I remembered him, walked into the shop and busied myself with the gas lights till he put down a half-crown—my wife was serving him—I picked up the half-crown, bent it, found it was bad, and put it into my pocket—I told the prisoner that made the second piece of bad money—he denied it being the second piece, and said, why had I not given him in charge on the first case—I took the bread off the counter—he said, "Well, let me have the bread master," and threw down a good shilling—I, in the hurry of the moment, gave him the bread, and took the money out of the good shilling—I could not leave my shop as my wife was very near her confinement; I could not see a policeman handy, and therefore let him go—next morning I saw the policeman, Brine, pass my shop—I spoke to him and gave him the half-crown and shilling wrapped in a piece of paper.</p>

I am an ironmonger, of 17, Besborough-place, Belgrave-road, in the parish of St. John, Westminster On Saturday night, 3d March, I went out with my wife, about seven o'clock—I secured the back-door with bolts and locks; the rindows were shut and fastened, and I left the front-door on the latch—no one could get in without a key—I was away about an hour—when I came back, before I got to my house, I noticed a light in my bed-room—I knew I had left no one in the house, and I directly thought there were thieves in the house—I left my wife, and tried to get in at the front-door with my key, but could not succeed—I then went round to the back, where there is a wall, dividing my house from the sewer, and I then saw a man, who I believe was Strudwick, attempting to get over the wall—I was within ten yards of him—he was getting from my premises—I called, "Police!" and for assistance from my neighbours, and no one came—the man did not get over, but went back again—I should say he could hear and see me—I next saw him in the custody of the police—I came round to the front again, and found the door open—I went into my house, and found the drawers open—the kitchen-door had been burst open, and the cupboards and drawers all open—it appeared to me that the house bad been entered from the area-window—they had got down the area, cut the glass, and turned the sash-fastening—there was glass cut out large enough to admit two or three fingers, and sufficient to turn the catch—I missed a watch, a pair of sugar-tongs, six spoons, and a ring—I found some lucifer-matches.</p>

I came home with my husband on the evening of 3d March, and saw a light in the upper room—my husband left me, and ran on—I went to a neighbour, Mrs. Bickerton, she came out, and I went to my door—when I had been there two or three minutes, Strudwick rushed out—I have no doubt whatever that be is the man—I touched him on the arm as he passed, and said to some of the neighbours, "That is the thief; pray hold him"—he tried to escape over a fence in front of the house, across the street—he was taken in endeavouring to get over—it</p>

I recollect Mrs. Wollen coming to my door on Saturday night, 3d March—I and Mr. Farrington, a lodger of mine, went out with her—when we had been at the door two or three minutes, the two prisoners came out, and one ran one way and one another—I can swear to Strudwick—he ran, and tried to jump over the railing, Mr. Farrington caught him—I had not lost sight of him at all—there was no one on the house-side of the paling but me, Mrs. Wollen, and Mr. Farrington—it is an iron railing that goes round the area—there is a row of houses, of which this forms one-the railings run in front of all the houses—the fence where he was caught is another place—to get from Mr. Wollen's to that fence you must cross over the road—Strudwick had crossed the road when he was taken.</p>

I live in St. John's-lane, Smithfield—I am a <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi>driver—on the morning of 23d March, I was on the <hi rend="italic">cab-stand</hi>, in Smithfield—a young man came and told me, if I went on a little further I should find a party waiting for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I went, and the two prisoners beckoned me, and asked what I would take them to Petticoat-lane for—I told them, and a third female came up—I said, "Are you all going;" they said, "Yes"—I took them to Houndsditch, where there is a turning that leads to Petticoat-lane—I asked if that would do, and they said, "Yes"—they got out, and said, if I would wait I should take them back—I waited about ten minutes, and saw them in possession of the officer; it was exactly six o'clock when the young man came to me.</p>

We carry on the business of cheese-mongers at Chelsea—the prisoner was in my service about two months—I marked some sixpences, and gave them to two parties to spend in my shop, and I retained two of them—next morning I left the prisoner in my shop, about half-past eight o'clock—I think there was a little boy in the shop with him, but he had nothing to do with the receipt of money—I examined the tills little before nine that morning, the 6th—I missed one of the marked sixpences which I had not given out—in the middle of that day I gave four other marked sixpences to spend—I examined the till about two o'clock; there should have been four sixpences in it—I gave the prisoner into custody in the evening—he maintained that he was innocent.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner received a good character, and his mother engaged to send him to sea.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and clerk to the guardians of the Holborn Union, and have been so since March, 1838. In consequence of the over-crowded state of the workhouse belonging to that union, in Oct., 1847, I entered into an arrangement with Mr. Drouet, to send the pauper children to his establishment at Tooting; that was by the direction of the guardians, and consent of the Poor-Law Commissioners—I have here the letter containing the approval of the Poor-Law Commissioners—I first had a personal interview with Mr. Drouet, that was in the beginning of Oct., 1847—I had received directions from the guardians to seek a place for the children, and knowing that Mr. Drouet farmed children, I requested that he would call upon me at the Union Workhouse the first time he came to town—I saw him, and then obtained from him the terms upon which he received children, what he did for them, the price, and all the particulars; and when he went away, I said, "Now, Mr. Drouet, I cannot undertake to state to the guardians everything that has passed between us to-day, when you get home be kind enough to commit it to writing, and let me have a letter"—and in consequence I received this letter—I know it to be his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" 16th Oct.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090061"/>
               <p>1847. To Mr. James. My dear sir, my establishment is for children only, and I have spared no expense to make it second to none; there are five schools con<lb/>ducted by competent teachers, and the Chaplain; various trades are taught by well-conducted masters, on a large scale, so that we are enabled to fit boys for all kinds of servitude—the girls being carefully instructed in needlework, laundry, washing, and the general household work. I can take the number you may require to place out at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per head per week; this includes every charge, as also conveying them to and from the establishment."—I laid that letter before the board of guardians, and a resolution was come to by the Board, that the children should <hi rend="italic">go</hi>—I have here a letter which I sent to Mr. Drouet embodying the resolution—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"The important matter of the removal of our boys has been determined in the affirmative, and you are to have them; but it is still thought by some of your best wishers, that you cm afford to take them at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per head per week; they are earning us, and will be earning you, very considerably. It is thought that the past ought not to be taken by you into consideration; it is not the same as asking you to lower your charges for children you have had during the hard times; we have hid them during those times. I am sure that in the whole you would be a greater gainer at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, than you would at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is if you prefer a greater number. So strong is the impression of a great part of our Board; at present about ninety will be ready to be handed over to you at our workhouse, on Wed<lb/>nesday next, at two o'clock. I will take care that they shall be decently clad, and you will take care to be prepared to receive and carry them off our premises at that time. I will thank you just to drop me a line acknowledging the receipt of this communication, and saying you will be at the workhouse at the time I have named."—This was written on 4th Nov., and on 5th Nov. I received this letter from Mr. Drouet:—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Dear sir,—I will arrange for the children coming away as appointed, on Wednesday next. I feel confident of arranging the price to the satisfaction of the Board, after I find the children can render me any assistance, as I only want a fair return for my attendance, &amp;c."—Eighty-one boys went on the Wednesday; the deceased boy was not one of them—we endea<lb/>voured to send none under six years of age—they were between six and twelve, thirteen, or fourteen, as far as we could ascertain their ages; but some children at fourteen are younger than others at eleven or twelve—abort thirty more boys were sent between that and the beginning of Dec.—I bare the returns here from week to week—perhaps six or eight had been dis<lb/>charged during the same period—it was a debtor and creditor account of children—at the time the first number of children were sent I understood from Mr. Drouet himself, that there were about 800 or 850 children in the establishment, and that he could well receive 1200—I had myself visited the establishment, and it was there that I received the information.</p>

There are at this time about 850 children farmed at the esta<lb/>blishment, and there was scarcely one so ill as to require medical aid. The soil is gravelly, and appears to be dry and healthy, and those members of the com<lb/>mittee acquainted with the Norwood establishment"—that is, where some of the children formerly had been—"consider that the one at Tooting is, by no means, so bleak, or so exposed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> cold and cutting winds as that is"—that is the report that was presented by this committee to the board of guardians, and upon which, in fact, it was determined to send the children—annexed to this report is the printed dietary of the establishment—it was given to me by Mr. Drouet at the time the guardians were there (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Surrey-hall, Toot<lb/>ing. Dietary.—Breakfast:—The breakfast every day is the same, namely, pottage composed of flour, rice, and milk, with water and salt in sufficient proportions;—this is for the strong children—the infants, those newly-ad<lb/>mitted, and the weakly, have boiled bread and milk—the allowance of bread to the healthy children is according to age, being 6, 5, and 4 ozs. to each.—Dinner:—There are three meat dinners in each week, viz., Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday—the quantity of meat, free from bone, to each child is regulated according to age, being 5, 4, and 3 <hi rend="italic">ozs.</hi> each, with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4lb. potatoes; if with cab<lb/>bage, unlimited: on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, soup, made from the liquor in which the meat had been boiled, assisted with legs and shins of beef, peas, and a proper quantity of vegetables, pepper, salt, &amp;c., each child one pint, with bread; on these days the same quantity as at breakfast: on Thurs<lb/>day, suet-pudding, the quantity being 12,10, and 8ozs., according to age, &amp;c., to each. Supper:—the suppers every evening are either bread and butter, or bread and cheese, sometimes treacle with milk and water; should milk be scarce, which sometimes may be the case, then the children have good broth. Little children are dieted in the best way I can, as no fixed diet can be adopted—some have meat and porter daily. In sickness, the diet is regulated by the doctor." There is something written on each aide of this, which was written at the time, "Licensed for 1200—In: 800 or 850, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per head per week—clothes"—that was put there, because there was nothing said in the printed particulars with regard to clothes, and it was to put that out of doubt; the children went fairly clothed, and they were to be clothed by Mr. Drouet—for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week; they were to have lodging, food, raiment, and every thing.</p>

The undersigned guardians of the Holborn Union, in company with Mr. White, one of the medical officers of the Union, this day, visited and inspected the establishment of Mr. Drouet, at Tooting—they find four children confined with an attack of measles, at present doing well—the general appearance of the other chil<lb/>dren is healthy and satisfactory, and those that were sent in a weakly state from previous disease much improved—they attended during dinner, and found the food wholesome and sufficient—they found the premises very clean and well ventilated, the bedding clean, and well arranged, and the esta<lb/>blishment appeared to be conducted in a satisfactory manner"—that is signed by Stephen Peason, William Hunt, and Richard Hurst, three of the guardians; and by Edward White, one of the medical officers of the Holborn Union.

We also recommend that each bed should have four blankets, three for a covering, and one to lie upon. We also recommend that fire places be introduced instead of the stoves, wherever they are in use. We also advise that instead of the suet-pudding, rice-pudding be substituted, and that the pease-soup be changed for Scotch barley-broth.

Winch, Rebbeck, and Mayes—this is the report which they made to the guardians after that visit—(read—"We beg to report to the Board our having, on Tuesday, the 9th of May, visited Mr. Drouet's establishment at Tooting, to ascertain the state of the children's health belonging to this Union. We were there at the time of dinner being supplied, and are of opinion that the meat provided was good, but the potatoes were very bad. We visited the school rooms, dor<lb/>mitories, and workshops; everything appeared clean and comfortable. Yet we are of opinion that the new sleeping-rooms for the infants on the ground-floor has a very unhealthy smell. The girls belonging to the Union looked particularly well. The boys appeared sickly, which induced us to question them as to whether they had any cause of complaint as to supply of food or otherwise. About forty of them held up their bands to intimate their dis<lb/>satisfaction; upon which Mr. Drouet's conduct became violent. He called the boys liars, described some that had held up, as the worst boys in the school, and said if he had' done them justice, he should have followed out the suggestion of Mr. James, and well flogged them. We then began to ques<lb/>tion the boys individually, and some of them complained of not having suffi<lb/>cient bread for their breakfast. While pursuing the inquiry, Mr. Drouet's conduct became more violent. He said we were acting unfairly in the mode of inquiry; that we ought to be satisfied of his character without such pro<lb/>ceedings, and that we had no right to pursue the inquiry in the way we were, and that he should be glad to get rid of the children. To avoid further alter<lb/>cation, we left, not having fully completed the object of our visit."—I was not in attendance with the guardians on that occasion—that report was presented to the board by Mr. Winch, through me, and was ordered to be taken into consideration that day week, which it was, and then a special deputation was directed to proceed to Tooting, to make more particular inquiries into the circumstances—no intimation was given to Mr. Drouet of the period when that special deputation was to attend, certainly not by me,' and I do not think by any one of the guardians—I cannot conceive that be knew anything about it—those gentlemen were desired to invite the three members of the committee, who had made the immediately preceding report to accompany them on this special visit, Mr. Winch, Mr. Mayes, and Mr. Rebbeck—they did so, and this is the report—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" Holborn Union, Tues<lb/>day, May 30, 1848.—We, the undersigned, the committee specially appointed to visit Mr. Drouet's establishment at Tooting, to examine into the state., condition, and arrangements of the children belonging to the Holborn Union,</p>

We witnessed some scholastic examinations of the children, which were quite satisfactory; and, on the whole, we desire to report that we were well pleased with our visit. We desire specially to report that with respect to the particular circumstance stated in the last monthly report of the committee, Mr. Drouet expressed his regret that any exhibition of warmth of temper on his part should have occurred at that meeting, and the guardians then attending expressed themselves satisfied with this acknowledgment."—Signed by the vice-chairman Mr. Sou thee, Mr. Wrench, Mr. Winch, Mr. Rebbeck, Mr. Mayes, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Sheppard, and countersigned by myself—I was in attend<lb/>ance on that occasion—no inquiry was made of the children in my presence whether they had received any punishment for having held up their hands—one or two of the guardians were in one part, and others were in other parts—I an not aware of any such inquiry being made—on Monday, 1st Jan., about one or two in the day, I received a communication from Robert Aldridge, the master of the Union-workhouse, as to the state of the children—in consequence of which, I, on the following day, 2nd, sent a person to Tooting to inquire into j the circumstances; and on the Wednesday I received a message from Mr. Drouet—the board met that evening; not in consequence of that message, because it was their regular time of meeting, but that was one of the matters of business at that board, and directions were given to Mr. Whitfield, one of the medical officers of the Union, to proceed to the establishment—the entry in Mr. Drouet's book of 4th Jan., which has been read, is the one which Mr. Whitfield and the other gentleman then made, but of that I know nothing—in consequence of the state in which the children were found to be by Mr. Whitfield they were removed to the Free Hospital—I should tell you that the other gentleman had nothing to do with our Holborn Union—I be<lb/>lieve he was met on the spot by Mr. Whitfield, and being two medical gentle<lb/>men met together, they thought proper to unite in their report—I went down on 5th Jan., but not before—I did not then learn from Mr. Drouet how many of the children were ill, of what, or how long they had been ill, but Mr. Whitfield on the Thursday, Jan. 4th, attended a special meeting of the board, and in consequence of the report he then made, I was sent on 5th with the proper and necessary persons to remove the children—I certainly saw Mr. Drouet on that occasion, but I saw that he had about a dozen medical men round him, and guardians from a great number of the Unions having children there, and I had no opportunity of having any conversation with him—the medical officer contented himself with examining the children he intended to remove, and gave a list of those children to me in order that I might provide conveyances for them—Mr. Whitfield had examined them the day before, and found that a good many were bad—I should say of the Holborn Union child<lb/>ren, I found about fifteen or sixteen attacked with cholera, perhaps twenty cannot tell—I cannot tell how many in the whole establishment were attacked with it—I brought away 155 of our children; four or five of them died before they got to the hospital—the boy James Andrews was one of those who</p>

               <p>were then removed to the Free Hospital—those who were left were those Who were reported by the medical officer to be too ill to be removed—they consisted of about twenty-rive or thirty—when I went down I believe fifteen of our children were attacked by cholera—we had then 191 boys and girls in the establishment—James Andrews died on 6th Jan.—there was a report from Mr. Drouet to the guardians, dated 30th Dec, 1848, which in the usual course of the weekly return, ought to have reached me on 1st Jan., but it did not reach me till the 2nd—that delay was not accounted for to me by Mr. Drouet—excepting the general confusion of matters there, I had no specific account of that delay—this is the report—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" Tooting, 80th Dec., '48.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the guardians in the habit of visiting the Infirmary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They visited every part of the establishment, everything was thrown open to them—the weekly reports which I have spoken of refer only to our own Union—there were children there belonging to thirteen parishes, we had nothing to do with any but those belonging to our own Union—I had not seen Mr. Drouet's establish<lb/>ment before I went there prior to the contract being entered into—I knew Mr. Drouet by sight, but I knew nothing whatever of his establishment before that time—I rather think that the dietary was submitted to our medical officer before the agreement was entered into, but I am not speaking with confidence—I never had anything to do with any workhouse but our own—in some respects I think this dietary is superior to that of our workhouse, and in other respects I think it is inferior—I have one of our own dietaries here—our dietary has not been altered lately; after the cholera broke out there was an alteration in it: more solid food was given; but I am com<lb/>paring Mr. Drouet's dietary with our former one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that this is a proper dietary, a proper quantity of food for the children sent to the establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is; and I have shown it to the medical officers, and they have thought so—there are some things not quite defined as to quantity which is open to observation—I think from Oct. 1847 to Jan. 1849,1 went to Mr. Drouet's establishment about five times—the other parishes were also in the habit of visiting it at different times—I have repeatedly, wheu I have been there, seen the guardians from other places—there was no particular day fixed beforehand when we might be expected to be there—the gentlemen whose duty it was to go down settled it among themselves, and I myself did not know the day they were going.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On these visits were very minute inquiries made; an inspection of the establishment, and an investigation as to the condition of the children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentlemen who went professed to do all that, and I believe did it-whenever I went I know that I attempted to the full extent of my power, to get all the information that would be serviceable to the guardians—when the guardians went, they had the opportunity of inquiring from the children apart from any control of Mr. Drouet, or anybody else, as to whether they were satisfied with their situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time, upon any visit which you made, ever see any<lb/>thing which you considered improper in Mr. Drouet's establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was one little matter; as you put the question so, I must answer it; in the early part of the year, I think it was in Jan., 1848, Mr. Mayes, who it a builder, and who was as a builder looked to for anything about the pre<lb/>mises, ventilation, or anything of that sort, on going along the play-ground observed that the range of new buildings were built very close to the ground; that is to say, they were not sufficiently elevated to have a draught under<lb/>neath for ventilation, and he said, "You ought to have had air gratings in the skirting of the building"—Mr. Drouet looked, and said, Why, I ordered them, and I believe that they are here;" and on searching it was found that the sweeping of the path had entirely closed them up, and Mr. Mayes said, "Now this is a degree of carelesness that I should not have expected in this establishment; do get them cleared out"—I observed afterwards that they were cleared out—I did not myself know anything of the boy Andrews; I only knew that there were two brothers of that name, James and Joseph, and their father was in the workhouse at the same time—the children, who were removed when the cholera broke out, were those considered to be untouched by it—that was for the purpose of separating them from those who had been affected—they were taken to the Free Hospital, because we had not room for them in our workhouse, and we were glad to get them there—the book from which extracts have been read of the reports of the guardians of the Holborn Union, also contains reports from a great many other Unions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is a book kept at Mr. Drouet's establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as far as I am a judge I think if the dietary were adhered <hi rend="italic">to</hi> in point of quality, that in quantity it is good—the quantity in some respects is uncertain—in looking at it with our own, it occurred to me that ours was su<lb/>perior in some respects, but I cannot tell in what, without again comparing them—it was principally in the dietary for the sick—ours was a very foil dietary, it had been prepared entirely by the medical officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the inferiority of which you speak, applies only to the dietary for the sick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi> F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But all that is said here is "In sickness the diet if regulated by the doctor?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and in ours a full scale is given.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>they were all standing up very crowded: there were no forms or benches, or any means of sitting down to their meals—I looked at the potatoes, and cut open from one to two hundred—I did not find one good one; they were watery and black diseased potatoes—I spoke to Mr. Drouet about them—he told me he gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for them—I said, "Very possibly you might; the pota<lb/>toes are very bad, I think you ought to change the diet"—he said if we paid him better, he could do it—I spoke to him when we were alone with him, not before the children—we then went over the establishment—we went over the whole of the dormitories, and over the new buildings on the left—the whole of them struck me as being badly constructed, but more particularly the lower ones; they smelt very unhealthy, and Mr. Drouet's attention was called to it by myself, and Mr. Mayes more particularly, who is a builder—there was no ventilation at the back, only windows in front, and they smelt very bad indeed—I mentioned it to Mr. Drouet—they were sleeping apartments I presume, but it was impossible to know, as there were no beds there—I was given to under<lb/>stand they were sleeping apartments for the younger children—I think the nurses told me so in Mr. Drouet's presence—Mr. Mayes remarked that it was a pity he had not built the rooms higher from the ground, and Mr. Drouet replied, that he should have enough to do if he paid attention to everybody—we went through the sleeping rooms that were in use: no particular fault struck me there—I did not go through the whole of the establishment, because I was aware from the nature of our own establishment, that it is not worth while to go through all the bed rooms—I afterwards saw the boys in the school-room; Mr. Drouet was there, his brother, the schoolmaster, and, I think, the drill-master,—when the boys were mustered, Mr. Rebbeck said, "Well, boys, do you all belong to the Holborn Union?"—they said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, have you anything to complain of, want of food or anything else; if you have, hold up your hand," and I think thirty or forty at least held up their hands in Mr. Drouet's presence—my attention was particularly di<lb/>rected to the look of the boys; I had seen them daily before they went from our workhouse to Mr. Drouet's, and their altered condition was very visible to me—they looked thin and pallid.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you enter your complaint in the book at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not finished, I had not gone over the whole of the establish<lb/>ment; and I was but a young guardian, I had not been in office above three weeks; that was my first visit—I made a report to the board; I was per<lb/>fectly unacquainted with the routine of business.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the way you have usually done your business in the guardiaps'-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, on that occasion it was; we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not usually have papers to sign—as far as regards the quality of the food stated in the dietary, it appeared very satisfactory, except the potatoes—this was on 9th May—I never found fault with any of the food, except the potatoes, that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you desired the boy to cut the loaf in the usual way, did you tell him whether it was for the young children, or the big boys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Drouet's brother told him to cut their bread up in the usual way, and when it was cut up, I said, "Is this the allowance the boys have?"—he answered, "Yes"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you not weigh it?" because, as a guardian, I knew it was very unsatisfactory in our house if everything is not weighed out, and in nearly all establishments it is usual.</p>

               <p>cholera attacks one place, and spares another close by—I have heard of its attacking one side of a ship and not the other, and one side of a street and not the other—I have read of its ravaging apparently healthy and well venti<lb/>lated places, and sparing those that are crowded and in a filthy condition—I do not know that that is the case—sometimes a regiment on its march will be attacked by cholera, and when the camp has been broken up, and they have removed a few miles, the cholera has disappeared entirely—I heard it the workhouse that the cholera broke out with violence at the same time at Wandsworth, which is the adjoining parish to Tooting—it commenced there before it did at Tooting, but it was prevailing at the same time—I do not know the Hackney Refuge, or Mr. Warburton's Asylum—I did not ascertain whether the treatment and improvement of diet which I directed on the 4th Jan. was attended to, because the children were removed the next day—I think cold is a great pre-disposing cause to cholera.</p>

                  </hi>. I am grave-digger to the poor in the parish. I knew James Andrews; I saw him in Oct, 1848, before he went to Tooting; he was in very good health—I saw him in the hospital when he came back—I fetched the doctor to him, and was in the room when he died—I saw him when he died, and afterwards buried him—I afterwards exhumed him by the direction of the authorities—I was present when his body was examined by Dr. Garrod.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. GARROD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> Some man was present when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; I believe it was the last Witness—I came to the judg<lb/>ment that the boy died from malignant cholera, Asiatic cholera—the body had been buried 140 hours, but it was very fresh, and presented very slight appearances of decomposition; it had no disagreeable odour; it was cold weather—the body appeared to be that of a child who had been considerably emaciated before death, the head was large in comparison with the body, the development of the body appeared rather behind what we should expect at that age, and several of the second teeth had not appeared—the teeth were Hot so forward as I should expect in a boy of that age—most of the first</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090085"/>
               <p>teeth had fallen out, and there was a slight lividity, which is the case with boys of infirm constitutions; it betokens weakness of constitution—the body was very slightly livid, and the akin on the hands and feet was slightly shrivelled in appearance, which you frequently find after death from cholera—on dissection it was found that the layer of fat was exceedingly spare—where there is usually considerable deposition of fat it was almost absent—most of the organs were healthy, with these exceptions, that the lungs were slightly congested; the bronchial glands were slightly enlarged—I noticed that <hi rend="smallCaps">OP</hi> account of their being frequently enlarged in scrofulous and ill-conditioned children, the mesenteric glands were much enlarged with slight deposition of tubercular matter—the external surface of the small intestines was rather pink, and of the large intestines grey; that is a contrast that has been noticed as frequent in cases of cholera—these were indications that death resulted from cholera—the internal or mucous membrane, both of the upper and lower intestines, was congested in patches, and contained some thickish matter, somewhat similar to boiled rice, a gruel-like matter, without any yellow appearance—this matter, carefully examined with a microscope, presented all the appearances which you find in the thick portion of the evacuations in cho<lb/>lera—the blood throughout the whole of the body was of a very dark colour, and of a tar-like consistency, yet not coagulated; that was contained chiefly in the large vessels of the body—the large vessels were generally filled with blood throughout the body, but the small vessels were in general empty, and the tissues of the body bad a dry appearance on dissection—the arterial blood was almost as dark as the venous blood—upon analysis it was found to be very peculiar in its composition; that is to say, it contained very much 1<hi rend="smallCaps">M</hi> water, and therefore a much larger quantity of solid matter than is contained in the blood of adults, and excessively so as compared with the ordinary blood of children dying of other diseases—these appearances altogether perfectly satisfied me that the child must have died of Asiatic cholera; I have no doubt about it—the dark appearance of the blood is universal, when a patient has died in a state of collapse, but not afterwards; for when they recover, and then die, that condition is sometimes considerably altered—the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, were all healthy—I have no doubt that part of the emaciation of the body would arise from cholera—I should think that that appearance of shrinking might be produced in forty-eight hours, but not the absence of fat; I cannot account for such a state of emaciation, by the progress of cholera only, within forty-eight hours, upon a healthy child—I consider that this must have been rather an unhealthy child; it might bare been hereditary, and it might hare been produced doubtless by being improperly brought up, fed, clothed, and lodged; the appearances were con<lb/>sistent with that—I do not know Mr. Drouet's premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a child had been lodged in a room over-crowded with children, and which had been insufficiently ventilated, and if its food had been indifferent and insufficient, would that, in your judgment, have accounted for any of the appearances you found on the body, independent of the action of the cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the time which the child had been exposed to this influence had been long; say for several months, but it is impossible to say—I should think from Oct. to Jan. would not account for it; I would not be positive on that point—it is my opinion that there was a cholera influence somewhere at the time this child died—I do not say it was in the atmosphere—a child insufficiently fed and clothed, and lodging in a dormitory insufficiently ventilated and over-crowded, would doubtless be liable to be affected by influences which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090086"/>
               <p>would not affect a strong and healthy person, and among other influences that of cholera; it would certainly be the more predisposed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> accept the influence of that complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a person of an impaired or weak constitution be na<lb/>turally more disposed to receive the effects of this influence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so; but especially those who are otherwise healthy, but are kept rather low; that is the case, at least as far as our experience of the present epidemic goes; those constitutions which are impaired by bad air, and insufficient food, are more liable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is to say, a child of robust health and good constitution would resist an influence which would be the destruction of one of more feeble habit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bad air, bad food, and bad lodging will contribute to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe those three causes cannot produce the cholera, unless the influence is also present; a certain something is required over and above that—something is required to give the cholera, in order to make those different circumstances operate mischievously; I do not mean to say that the treatment in a prison, the want of generous food, proper clothing, or exercise, would generate cholera.</p>

On 81st Oct., 1848, Mr. Drouet engaged me to go to his asylum, at a salary, to attend to the sick—were were about 1100 or 1200 children then there—I saw no medical book for the purpose of recording the state of health of the children—I kept one—I think nearly 200 children were added to that number about the end of Dec., from St. Pan eras' parish—I have memorandums of the number of tick children that I attended—Mr. Drouet never consulted me as to the extent</p>

               <p>of accommodation afforded to the children in the establishment, or with regard to the ventilation of the rooms, or as to their being over-crowded and having too many beds in them, nor as as to the number of children in a room, nor as to their clothing—when I arrived there was a place called the Infirmary—it was a room in the building—there were healthy children in some parts of the same building where the infirmary was—there were a few patients in the infirmary when I went—three or four weeks after I arrived another sick ward was formed—some of the patients I found there bad been seriously ill—there were some cases of opthalmia—there were a few children not in the infirmary affected with the itch—I can give no precise number—there were several affected with cutaneous diseases of some kind or another—there were not many affected with pure itch—there was a separate ward for those who had cutaneous diseases, so as to prevent their contaminating the others—I tried to get rid of the disease, but I found it very difficult indeed—Mr. Drouet did not object to receiving children with the itch—they were received whether they had it or not.</p>

James Andrews would hare anything I chose to order for him, even porter, or any other support I thought fit—the establishment was generally healthy when I went there—there were very few ill in the boys' ward eight or ten; and in the girls and in the infants' ward there might have been an equal number—I cannot tell the exact number, but it was few compared with the number in the establishment—after I went there many children came with the itch upon them—I did my best to get rid of it—I cannot tell whether I succeeded, on account of the cholera breaking out, and the removal of the children—there were four rooms for the infants, boys and girls—the girls were separate from the boys, except the very little ones—they had the same room by day—the cholera broke out very suddenly indeed on 29th, without any preparation at all for it—I saw no premonitory symptoms—there bad been several cases of diarrhoea in Dec. as well as Nov—there are always some in the establishment—they had recovered from that before the cholera broke out—it then became ne-cessary to remove those who were attacked from the healthy ones—that necessarily created a confusion in the establishment—we had great difficulty in procuring nurses; they objected to come, after having agreed to do so—many failed to fulfil their promise—from 29th Dec. to 5th Jan.

Chapman, surgeons at Tooting, and surgeons to this establishment as well, were called in—they came in the day—I did not myself personally apply for nurses, I only heard it from those who went that none could be got—I believed it at the time—I have no memorandum of the number of cases of diarrhoea there were when I first went—there were forty-two during the month of Nov., and forty-five in Dec.—it is doubted whether diarrhoea is a premonitary symptom of cholera—some say it is, and some that it is not—I do not think it is in every case, not as a general rule—It was not at Tooting, because it did not exist—very few indeed of those who had had diarrhoea were attacked with cholera—I cannot give the exact number of the forty-five who were attacked with cholera.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Sur<lb/>geons, and have been in the profession upwards of twenty-five years—I have been for some time lecturer at St. Thomas's Hospital, and am superintending medical-inspector under the Board of Health In consequence of holding that situation I was sent to Mr. Drouet's establishment on 5th. Jan—I saw Mr. Drouet there; I suppose I expressed to him that I was sent to make inquiry by the board of health; I said it doubtless to some one in the establishment, and I suppose to Mr. Drouet—I introduced myself, and the object of my visit—I went over some parts of the establishment on the Friday, not the whole—my attention was particularly confined to the cholera wards, where the cholera patients were—I also went into the school-rooms—after I had been round the wards, and seen the state of the cholera patients, I considered it my duty, as a public officer, to suggest what seemed to be desirable for the safety of the children—I believe I sent for Mr. Drouet, but I saw him, and stated that I thought there was not sufficient medical attendants, and recom<lb/>mended that he should have three additional qualified medical practitioners, and one physician of eminence, in whom the public would have confidence—I further suggested that there should be in every ward with more than twelve patients, four nurses, two for the day, and two for the night, and if there were less than twelve patients that there should be three nurses; and also that the wards should be less crowded, so that there should not be more than one patient in each bed.</p>

I believe you visited the whole of the establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Saturday and Sunday, and again on the Wed<lb/>nesday—I saw both the healthy and unhealthy wards, the school rooms, and the dining rooms; that was quite with Mr. Drouet's consent, as I under<lb/>stood—I thought the dormitories were too crowded; I speak of the number of beds, not the number of children—I thought that there were too many beds, and that they were too close together—in my opinion that would be injurious—I thought the rooms were not properly ventilated, considering the number of inmates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the number of beds might have remained the same, if more ventilation had been given to the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my impression; there were either too many beds for the ventilation, or not ventilation enough for the number of beds.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The pulses of all were weak, were they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that we examined all, but there was a weak state generally—I cannot tell how many had a weak pulse; it was more than the ordinary weakness of childhood—as Dr. Farr examined the children in my presence, I marked down what was the matter with them—I cannot charge my memory at all as to the number of weak pulses.</p>

                  </hi>., M.D. I have been in practice for several years—I am one of the medical professors of King's College—I accompanied Mr. Grainger to Mr. Drouet's on 25th Jan., at the request of the Board of Health, to examine into the condition of the remaining children—on 20th Jan. I examined the whole of the children of the Holborn Union that were at toe Free Hospital—I think 120 were presented to us for examination; their state was very various; the girls were in better health than the boys, which is almost always the case with children in workhouses—some had very tail limbs, and were pot-bellied—the complexion was pale, and the flesh soft; others, an appearance of health, such as I have generally seen in workhour I children, was observable—about two-thirds, or rather more, had some disease of the skin—the greater number of those being cases of itch, some in the wont or pustular form; some were suffering from broken chilblains, they decidedly differed from the usual appearance of workhouse children, that difference I consisted, in the first place, in the great prevalence of diseases of the axis comparing the condition of their skin with that of children in workhouses, a very remarkable contrast was observed—I never saw so large a number of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090092"/>
               <p>children affected with diseases of the skin, chiefly itch—I think I saw more itch in the eight days on which I examined these children than I have seen for three years past in the hospital to which I belong—forty-five per cent. was the entire number of cases of all the children examined that had either itch or some disease of the skin—that was the most striking feature with regard to their condition that I observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it unusual to see thinness and pot-bellies in workhouse children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; by no means unusual; it is a common appearance—the prevalence of itch in workhouses depends entirely on the mode of treatment to which children are subjected—I believe it is quite possible to prevent it in establishments for poor children—if a number of children are sent in with the itch, I should prevent others catching it, by keeping them in separate wards, and subjecting them to a treatment, which cures the disease generally in four or five days, but always in less than ten days, and not allowing them to go among the other children till they were perfectly well; I should, also, keep a strict watch upon them afterwards to detect the commencement of the disease, and to keep them perfectly clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your opinion, what was the cause of the appear<lb/>ance you observed about the generality of these children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first place, with regard to the prevalence of skin diseases, the neglect of those pre<lb/>cautions to which I have alluded, and which ought to be taken in all esta<lb/>blishments for poor children, because it would prevent not only itch, but other diseases common to children, which are not only communicated from the hands of one child to another, but also by the clothes; indeed, I believe it is more difficult to cure the clothes than it is to cure the disease—this disease being contagious if you once introduce a child into an establishment, it will spread from that child to a large number, perhaps, to the whole, therefore, the cause of this disease most be traced in the first instance to that introduc<lb/>tion having taken place—I judge very much from the state of the skin of a child more than from any other part of the body, and the skin of these children certainly showed that they had not been well managed; they had not received that attention they required as to cleanliness—many of them were in a condition produced by a diet not suited to children, too much fluid and too little solid—a diet which is too fluid, where too much broth is allowed and too little meat, generally distends the belly and produces pot-belly—the usual allowance of meat to pauper children is three times a week, I think—a good deal will depend upon the management of children as to how often they re<lb/>quire meat—if a child is much exposed to the air and takes a great deal of exercise it will require more meat than one who is kept in a sedentary posi<lb/>tion—a good deal will depend upon the mode of management; some require meat more than three times a week, with others it is sufficient—I think if these children had received a proper diet both in quantity and quality, they would not in so large a proportion as I observed have presented the pot-belly, the wasted limbs, and the flabby soft flesh—the flesh of a child should be firm, and the skin clear and healthy, and not rough as it was in many instances—I attribute this condition to insufficient diet as well as to a want of cleanliness—as far as the prevalence of the akin disease was concerned I attribute that in a very great degree to a want of cleanliness—I believe if they had been attended to, not one-fourth of the quantity of the diseases of the skin which I observed would have existed—I presumed from what I saw that the diet was not satisfactory, that it was unsuitable in point of quality and quantity—the skin of a child shows the nature of its feeding as well as the skin of an animal—you know by the skin of a horse whether it is well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090093"/>
               <p>fed, and you know by the skin of a child whether it is well-fed—I judge more by the skin than by any other part of the body how a child has been treated—with regard to the effect that ventilation, and those other matters which have been alluded to, would have on the state of the children, I offer no opinion—I think I ought to confine myself to the want of cleanliness and proper diet; my opinion is almost entirely confined to that—I think it possible that other circumstances may have been in operation to assist in producing the appearances, but I attribute them principally to the want of cleanliness and to unsuitable diet—the condition of the children improved as my visits became later—the state in which I first saw them would undoubtedly, in my opinion, have rendered them more subject to any virulent disease which might be prevalent—it would have predisposed them to cholera, typhus fever or any other disease that might be prevailing at the time—Mr. Grainger and I examined the children together—I did not go over Mr. Drouet's establish<lb/>ment with Mr. Grainger—I entirely confine my opinion with respect to the children to a want of cleanliness and allowance of food.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first examine the children of whom you have been speaking at the Free Hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those belonging to the Holborn Union I saw on the 20th; I saw 120—I do not know what had become of the rest—I examined the whole of the 120—there were sixty-five girls—I think about twenty of the boys passed through my hands—thirty-four of the girls had the itch—they all had cuta<lb/>neous disease, and in five cases out of six that disease was the itch; in others it was interigo—that is not allied to itch—almost all cases of itch may, under proper care, and with every facility for curing it, be cured in four or five days, and many in three—these children had been at the Free Hospital, I believe, nearly a fortnight when I saw them—I do not think many of them could have caught it in that fortnight from the form in which I saw it; because many of them had pustular itch, that is large collections of matter formed on the hand, which takes many days to form, and on other parts of the hand were the scan produced by the healing of those sore places, and many of them had evi<lb/>dently had the disease for a month or two—there would have been no diffi<lb/>culty in the doctors at the Free Hospital seeing those complaints in the form I am describing—it may be called itch in a chronic state, but we hardly apply that term.—we hardly draw a distinction between acute and chronic as applied to that disease; it is in one sense chronic—the advanced stage of that disease has no distinct appellation—pustules form and heal, and others form and heal, and so it spreads over the whole body, and may go on for months—I do not know how many doctors there are at the Free Hospital.</p>

The prisoner was not quite sober on the night in question—he did not shut the shop—he went to bed—he generally takes care of the key—I wanted it, went up-stairs, and looked in his waistcoat-pocket—I could not see it there—he was in bed—his coat was on the bed—I felt in his coat-pocket—I saw a shawl and a piece of ribbon—I showed them to the female servant who was with me—I told one of the young ladies also—Mr. Bensley was sent for, and I went up with him—I only saw one shawl that night, and one piece of ribbon—the next morn<lb/>ing I went to the coat, and saw two shawls and four pieces of ribbon—the shawl that I saw the night before was in the same pocket with the four pieces of ribbon—the other shawl was in another pocket—I did not see that the night before, because I was rather frightened, and went down-stairs—Bensley told the prisoner where they were found—he said he knew nothing about them, they must have been put in for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—he is in the habit of being drunk—he was more drunk than usual that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, in the employ of the London Dock Com<lb/>pany. In consequence of information, I went on 27th March to the West Quay, and examined a room where the men often leave their clothes—I saw a small box secreted, containing two or three ounces of green tea—I searched further, and found a handkerchief containing a similar quantity, at the back of the warehouse—there is a warehouse which had been lately under repair, and the doors of which are not yet put up; it was full of bales of cotton—I went into a corner, and there saw a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of writing-paper—I did not remove it, but searched among the bales, and saw two pieces of rag stuck in—I ex<lb/>amined further, and found this handkerchief containing 11b. 15 ozs. of tea—I put the rags back as I found them, returned to the warehouse, and hid myself where I could command a view of the bales—at about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came, rushed into the place past me, went direct to where the tea was, looked right and left, pulled out the pieces of rag, put his hand in, pulled out the bag with the tea, and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out past me so quickly that I could not catch him—I caught him about ten yards off, asked what business he had there, and what he had about him—he said he had got his lunch—I then caught hold of his hat, and said, "What is this.?"—he appeared <hi rend="italic">stagnated</hi>—found 11b. 15 ozs. of gunpowder tea in his hat, and his luncheon in his hand.</p>

On Tuesday, 3d April, about half-past two o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the Red Cow coffee-house, at Exeter—I was not in search of Hardy, but he answered the description of a person I was looking for—there was a chest in the room—I asked them if they were brothers—Mansell said, "Yes"—I asked if that was their chest—Mansell said, "Yes"—I asked if he would allow me to look at it; he consented, but asked if I would allow them to take it up stairs—I did so, and they took it up together into a bed-room—they put down the box-Mansell took a pistol from his side, put it to his mouth, and Said, "Good-bye, Harry,"—I grasped him, and threw him on the bed, and he dropped another pistol—I examined the pistol he put into his mouth; it was loaded with powder and ball, but there was no cap on it; the other was in the same state—I searched Mansell, and found in his trowsers-pocket a canvass bag containing 114 sovereigns, and in one waisteoat-pocket, one sove<lb/>reign, and in the other, 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a knife, and some percussion caps, loose—on Hardy I found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife; I took the prisoners to the station.</p>

               <p>10th Feb. I went to the office of Messrs.

Brooksbank and Farn, for my inspection, among other papers named in the schedule for the purpose of the cause—an appointment had been made on 7th Feb. by letter, for the 8th—I called on the 8th, but Mr. Hillyer said he had not looked up the documents, they were not ready, and I made an appointment for the 10th—I demanded a copy of it under the terms of the answer, and a copy was given me by Mr. Hillyer, for which I paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the copy in my pocket.</p>

Brooksbank and Farns in pursuance of an appointment you had made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I did not go alone, a person named Boulter accompa<lb/>nied me; he is clerk to Mr. Wilkin, the attorney for this prosecution—Boulter was present at the time of the inspection of the documents that were pro<lb/>duced to me—I cannot say exactly how long that inspection continued, per<lb/>haps we might have been there twenty minutes or half an hour; I should not think more than half an hour; it is impossible for me to swear we were not there an hour; I do not think it was an hour—I will not swear we were not there an hour—there was a variety of documents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the documents handed to you or to Boulter for the purpose of inspection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were laid on the desk—they were handed to me—he inspected them with me on the desk—these receipts were among the docu<lb/>ments that were laid on the desk and inspected by me and Boulter—I do not know whether Boulter had anything in his hand while he was inspecting this particular document—he certainly had something in his hand during the time he was there—he had a pencil in his hand, and copied something from a bill of costs, but I cannot swear whether he had it in his hand at the time of his inspection of the documents or afterwards, when we were copying some bills of costs—a portion of the time I know he had a pencil in his hand—he was making extracts from a bill of costs, whether it was at that time I do not know—I do not remember having the pencil in my hand—I know very little about Mr. Boulter—I have heard it stated that he is a discharged clerk of Mr. Cutts, but I believe it is not so—I have heard that he was formerly in Mr. Cutts' employment, but I do not know it of my own knowledge—he is in the neighbourhood of the Court, outside, I believe—I was in attendance on the Grand Jury but was not called in—Boulter went into the room; he might have been in the Grand-jury room ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mr. Wilkin did not attend before the Grand Jury; I believe Boulter attended for him as the attorney—he went into the Grand-jury room alone, unless In<lb/>spector Penny went in with him, I will not be positive as to that—he went in before any of the witnesses—I believe he had the indictment in his hand—I wont say whether he had or not; it was either in his hand, or else he had previously handed it to the officer, I am not positive which.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. Was any alteration made in this document by anybody whilst you were there?. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None; that I will swear; neither with a pencil or anything else; it was never out of my sight—I had the responsibility of inspecting it, and there was no alteration—I looked attentively at it all the tone it was before me—it went into the hands <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Mr. Boulter last.</p>
               <p>

               <p>you were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever, unless in this way; while I was there I bespoke a copy, and it then went out of my hands into the hands of the clerk of Messrs. Brooksbank and Faro, who I believe is in Court now, and I lost sight of it while the copy was being made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Boulter was no party to the copy being made. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; no alteration could have been made by him or me at the time—Mr. Wilkin was concerned for the other Salmons in the suit—they were defendants—strictly speaking, I can not say that Boulter attended on that occasion as Mr. Wilkin's clerk—I believe the order was for the production to the plaintiff—Mr. Wilkin was concerned for the other defendants—I should say that two clerks of Messrs. Brooksbank and Farn were in the office the whole time these docu<lb/>ments were being inspected—I know by looking at the proceedings, that Mr. Wilkin was solicitor for the other two Salmons, he so appears on the record, as I was informed by one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> our clerks.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The proceedings in Chancery were here put in and read, from which it appeared that Joseph Smith Salmon, a brother of the prosecutor, had filed a bill against Mr. Ctlts, in May</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">praying for the specific performance</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">contract of sale, by which he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Cutts</hi>) <hi rend="italic">had agreed to become the purchaser of Lot</hi> 8 <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">whilst Edmund Salmon, the prosecutor, filed a bill profit that the contract might be set aside for fraud on the part of Mr. Cutts, he not having complied with the conditions of sale by paying the necessary deposit, in the answers of Mr. Cutts to these bills, and in his own bill he expressed his desire to complete the contract, and alleged that he had paid to Edmund Salmon monies on account of the purchase of Lot</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">for which he held his receipts, end in a schedule annexed to his last answer, the dates and amounts of these receipts were set out.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and reside at Weathers field in Essex; I and my brothers Joseph and John were entitled, under the will of a Mrs. Smith, to some property in that county; it was an estate called Saville's Farm in Great and Little Bardfield—that estate adjoins considerable landed property belonging to Mr. Cutts—I first became acquainted with Mr. Cutts when he first came to reside at a place called Little Bard field Hall—I <hi rend="smallCaps">WM</hi> married in 1844—I became acquainted with Mr. Cutts about twelve months before that—I married a young lady who formed part of his family—she was the daughter of his housekeeper, and was living in Mr. Cutts' family at the time I became acquainted with him—Mr. Cutts gave her away—I was I minor when I married, under twenty—I was married by license—Mr. Cutts acted as solicitor to the trustees under Mrs. Smith's will—after my marriage I and my brothers were advised by Mr. Cutts to sell the property—I was it that time under age—Mr. Cutts gave no particular reason for advising me to sell before I was of age—he did just as he thought proper, in fact we had so voice in it whatever; he managed it chiefly; whatever he advised we must abide by the consequences—eventually I and my brothers agreed that the property should be sold, and Mr. Franklin was employed as the auctioneer to sell it; we never employed him—he was employed by Mr. Cutts—he was at that time a tenant of Mr. Cutts—he was an auctioneer and farmer—I was it the sale—Mr. Cutts became the purchaser of Lot 8 for 2,510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had early possession given him of a portion that adjoined his own property—there was a crop on it at the time, which was valued by Mr. Franklin at about 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was. the portion that I was in possession of—he took possession of the whole of Lot 8 at Michaelmas—I have received from Mr. Cutts sums of money since my marriage amounting altogether to 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the first sum was</p>

               <p>50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 5th January, 1847—I received the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in five different payments; all in 1847—I really am not certain of the dates—I did not receive either of those sums on account of the purchase-money of Lot 8—I never re<lb/>ceived the 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the crop—some time after, an application was made to me to give receipts for the money that had been advanced to me by Mr. Cutts—I should imagine it was about December, 1847—it was made by Evans on the part of Mr. Cutts—he came to me and said that Mr. Cutts had asked him whether he had got the receipts, and he told him he had—he said, "You know I have not got them,"and he said, "Will you oblige me by giving those receipts to me"—I had got them in a book, and after some time I said I would not do it for Mr. Cutts, but I would for him, he being my brother-in-law—Evans is a brother of my wife's, and that is why I did it—I had got these sums of money at the time I received them, down in a book—Evans took the receipts down, and wrote the body of the receipt himself, and I signed it—I gave him from the book the dates, and the particulars of the sums I had received—it was at my house—he wrote in my presence part of the paper produced—he wrote the bodies of five receipts, and I put my name to each of them, as it appears there now—the words "o/a lot 8" (<hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> "<hi rend="italic">on account of lot</hi> 8,") were decidedly not there when I signed them; I am posi<lb/>tive of it—I believe those additional words to be Evans's writing—I had a pen and ink in the room when he came—in signing these receipts I used the same pen that he did—I believe there was only one pen; at least, I did not see any other; I am certain there was no other in the room—I believe I had received all those five sums from the hands of Evans.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi> F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We hear that Mr. Wilkin is your attorney in the present prosecution—is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is—Mr. John Boulter is the clerk of Mr. Wilkin—when I first went to the neighbourhood of Mr. Cutts' residence, Boulter was clerk to Mr. Cutts—I don't know how long he continued to be so—he left him—Mr. Wilkin has an office at Great Bardfield—I cannot say bow long he has had an office there—Boulter lives in that house—Mr. Wilkin's name is on the door—I do not know whether Boulter conducts Mr. Wilkin's business there in the neighbourhood of Mr. Cutts' residence; I believe he does—I think Mr. Wilkins had not that office at Great Bardfield until after Boulter had left Mr. Cutts—Mr. Williams, of the firm of Goodwin and Co., was my solicitor in the Chancery proceedings—I believe Mr. Boulter has acted for them in those Chancery proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you believe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he has acted for Mr. Williams in that way.</p>
               <p>Sir F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But has he interfered in any way in these Chancery proceedings in your behalf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! yes, he has—I suppose he has to a certain extent interfered in this prosecution—Boulter made the charge against Mr. Cutts at the Police-office—he has conducted this prosecution—he went with me to Messrs. Brooksbank and Farns for the purpose of inspecting this document—I believe that was after he had been with Mr. Tournay—these receipts were exhibited to us—we remained but a short time inspecting them, merely to look at them and come out again immediately—it was not ten minutes; not more than five, I should think—I only saw that "o/a lot 8" was added—that was the first time I ever saw it on the receipts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Cutts at any time advance you a sum altogether of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; that was before I married—it was in two or three sums, but I believe in three—I believe all that money was given to me by the hands of Mr. Cutts—I never repaid any part of it—I have never paid any interest on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090129"/>
               <p>it—a stage-coach was set on foot by some gentleman at Bardfield, which ran to one of the stations—Mr. Cutts became the owner of that coach, and I purchased it from him afterwards for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never paid him any part of that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was never asked for—all the five sums mentioned in these receipts were given to me by Evans on account of Mr. Cutts—at the time they were given I did not give him any receipts or acknowledgments of any kind; I was never asked—at the time these sums were given me by Evans, the valuation of the crops of lot 8 had been made by Mr. Franklin—I do not know when the contract for that purchase was signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were these monies given to you by your brother-in-law Evans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I believe some at Little Bardfield-hall, others at my own house—I cannot distinguish which of them was given at Little Bardfield-hall and which at my own house—I believe two or three of the first I received at Little Bard<lb/>field-hall—that was where Mr. Cutts' office was—I do not know whether they were paid at the office—they were paid at the hall, and I know very well that two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes were paid to me at my own house, which Evans brought over—Mr. Cutts was indebted to me at that time—there was the crop—I considered that I borrowed these monies, a part of them, and part Mr. Cutts owed me—part I considered was money borrowed from Mr. Cutts, and the other put was in part of money that was owing to me from Mr. Cutts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you now speaking of the five sums? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi> F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it that Mr. Cutts was indebted to you for that you think part of this money might have been in respect of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, there was the crop—I considered that I borrowed the principal of the money, and I considered I should have to pay interest for it—when I say part was in payment, I mean in payment of the crops of lot 8—they were valued at 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we never had any settlement in any way—it was a mere idea of my own that part of that money was in respect of the crops—I suppose at the time I went to ask for the first 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was in payment of the crops, very likely—I do not know what the amount was that was paid me in respect of the crops—it was no particular sum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you imagine that part was to be applied in pay<lb/>ment of Mr. Cutts' debt to you if you cannot tell us what particular sum it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, Mr. Cutts owed me 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I owed him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I considered I was paying interest for that—I have never paid a farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR</hi> F. <hi rend="smallCaps">THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you considered you were to pay interest for that portion of the five sums that was borrowed money, how could you distinguish which portion of the sums you were to pay interest for, and which you were to pay no interest for, in respect of those being payments of money due from Mr. Cutts to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I considered it as borrowed money, except, as I say, that when I wanted to keep my house on, and wanted 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., why I went to Mr. Cutts, and be buying the crop, I thought naturally enough I could have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I consider I borrowed the remainder—I took the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the crop—I mean distinctly to state that the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me in respect of the valuation of the crops. and all the rest was borrowed money—it was the first 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was paid in respect of the crops—I do not know that I asked for payment in respect of the crops—I merely asked him to let me have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I always used to be backwards and forwards at Mr. Cutts'—I wanted some money to keep on with—I merely went and asked him whether he would let me have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or whatever I wanted—I did not at the same time say that I had not been paid for the crops—the applications for the other four sums were made 1st in the same way—there was no distinction between the application for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090130"/>
               <p>the money which I applied in my own mind to the crops, and the other which I borrowed—I never mentioned each a thing—I merely asked for the money at I would if I wanted to borrow money of any one else—there were two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, which I recollect perfectly having been paid at my own house—the first 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note I made application for, was at Little Bardfield-hall in respect of the crops—I believe that was paid to me at the hall—the pay<lb/>ment at my own house was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in two fifties—it was only one payment in two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I said two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes before.</p>

               <p>been informed that he has done some ditching—I never took any particular notice—there did not appear any such great improvements—no doubt money has been expended on it—there might be a slight improvement of a few pounds probably—I have not visited Mr. Letch, the incoming tenant—I have never been into his house since I gave up possession, or since I threshed out my crops—that was after Michaelmas—I cannot state when I finished threshing—I am not at all aware; as soon as I got my corn out—I had the privilege of going to the premises to thresh out any corn before the next Lady-day—I really do not know what time it was—it was in the evening time that Evans came to me for the receipts—we had something to drink both before and after the signing, the same as we had always been in the practice of doing when he came to my house—I cannot say what we had to drink—it was some kind either of liquor or beer—I cannot recollect—I can<lb/>not state to an hour what time he came—it was in the evening time—I do not know what time he left; very likely nine, very likely eleven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Evans sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, pretty well, I believe—I was quite well—I am not aware that Evans had been drinking before he came—he was pretty well when he came—how he was before he left, I must leave—I will say he was sober if you like—I should say he was neither drunk nor sober—my wife was ill in bed—the book that I kept my receipts in was kept is my writing-desk, I believe, in the same room—on my oath my wife did not fetch the book on that occasion—Evans went home that night, at least he left my house—at any rate he did not sleep at my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he first came about the receipts, did he appear to you like a person that had been drinking or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly, oh no—I dare say he had been drinking, but not to take particular notice of—he had not had enough to be labouring under the effects of liquor, decidedly—I should think it was, perhaps, an hour after he came that £ signed the receipts which he wrote, perhaps more; I really cannot say—it was an hour or an hour and a half—I believe there was some drinking between us after he came before the receipts were signed, and we were smoking a pipe together in that same room—we undoubtedly had something to drink, it was very simple what we had—I am pretty well certain we had something before I was asked for the receipts—neither he nor I drank any liquor to make us at all tipsy before the receipts were signed—I do not remember what it was we drank, there was liquor on the table—he staid after the receipts were signed, possibly, about the same time, it might be two hours; I really cannot state—he would have to go between three or four miles home—I cannot say whether he was on foot or on horseback—he was in the habit of coming to my house so often that I did not take any notice—possibly he came in the chaise, most likely on horseback—he went away by the same conveyance that he came by—he came alone, and I think he went away by himself—he was living with Mr. Cutts at that time—he had been living with Mr. Cutts ever since I knew bin—in 1846 a conveyance was tendered to me by Boulter, then Mr. Cutts clerk, which I refused to sign—that was at Little Bardfield-hall—my brothers were there—we all refused to execute it—before Sept. 1847, Mr. Cutts said he would get me a farm of Lord Mornington, professing to be my friend—I think that was in 1846 or 1847—it was often talked about for some time, Mr. Cutts said he would get it for me, and we would manage it between us—the sums of money mentioned in these receipts were handed to me by Evans—I never had any conversation with Mr. Cutts on the subject, or on the advance of money that he had made.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic printer. I have been much employed in the examination of documents, to ascertain the genuineness of handwriting, for upwards of twenty years—I was called upon to examine these receipts—they were then in the possession of a policeman at the police-court—on examining the first receipt, I was struck by observing, through my glass, a pencil-line after the word "Pounds," to write on, I imagine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it through his glass</hi>) I see a broken pencil-mark, the letter "a," the lower part of the "1" in "Lot," the turn of the capital "L," and a pencil-line like the last upstroke of the "8," which is put in ink, and also a pencil-mark with a dash to it—the "a" in ink, representing the word "account," does not cover the "a" in pencil; it is a little below it—the "a" in pencil is still visible—(<hi rend="italic">the Jury here examined the recipts with the witness's glass</hi>)—I see a difference between the former part of the receipt and the latter—the "o/s" in "Lot 8" is not written consecutively following "Received of Mr. Cutts £50"—it is written in closer, with a finer pen, and another coloured ink—it is thrust in—there was plenty of room for writing it conese<lb/>cutively as well as the other part—it was written at another time and with another ink—there is no pencil-line under the words Received of Mr. Cutts £50"—I believe the "o/a lot 8," to be the same handwriting, but written with another pen—the person did not write "o/a lot 8," at the same time as "Received of Mr. Cutts"—it is not written with the same freedom—there is the pencil-mark of the "a" remaining decidedly—it is larger than the "a" in ink, a little over it, and a little under it, and intermingled with it, but a perfect "a"—the ampliate of it does not inclose a space double that of the "a" to ink—it occupies about the same space as it would in the other, and very little more—intermingled with the bottom of the capital "L," and crossing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090133"/>
               <p>it, there is a pencil-mark similar to it, as though the "L "was to take that precise space in pencil—by the side of the figure "8" I see what I should call the principal part of an 8 in pencil—it is a little beyond the "8" in ink—I cannot tell whether these pencil-marks were written before or after the writing, because it has been so much rubbed—there is the appearance of its having been rubbed; I mean that portion particularly over "o/a and Lot 8"—India-rubber has been applied there undoubtedly, and not to the rest of the receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a letter or a word has been traced in pencil, and you traverse the same lines with ink, will it not have a different appearance afterwards from the ink on another part of the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very little indeed, unless the pencil is very thick and greasy; then it would a little, but not where the pencil is light—if the ink covered the pencil, it would be impossible to know which was done first—good ink would cover the pencil entirely—if the pencil came thickly over the ink it would leave a little brown appearance over the ink, and I should know it was done after the ink—I cannot detect it here by this glass—it is all very faint writing—in that particular I would not attempt to form a judgment.</p>

               <p>hands—I remarked with regard to the first receipt that the end of the line was different to the other part of it—after the word "50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I thought "o/a lot 8"' was written with a different pen and with different ink to the other part of the line—on close inspection I saw some lines ruled in pencil—the letter" a "in the top line is pencilled underneath, and at the loop at the bottom of the" I "there is also a pencil-mark, and there is a pencil-line ruled underneath this addition—I do not trace the ruled-line in the upper one—the end of it, the "o/a lot 8," has been rubbed, I should think, with India-rubber—it looks as if the India-rubber was greasy and dirty—I make the same observation with regard to the second receipt as to the colour of the ink of the different portions—the" o/a lot 8 "there seems to bear the same character of writing as" o/a lot 8 "in No. 1, in the same ink and with the same pen—I see a pencil-line under the second and third receipts; and my impression was that I saw it under the bottom of the fourth, but I do not see it now—in the second receipt there is a pencil-mark in the" a, "at the right of the ink—I do 'not trace any pencil-marks in the third, and I do not trace anything now under the fourth—I have not had my attention drawn to the fifth receipt—my opinion is that the ink bears the same character as the other—it is a bluer ink than the body—in the third receipt the words" o/a lot 8 "are in a lighter and bluer ink than the previous part of the receipt, and it has not been written with the same pen—it is a harder and stiffer pen—in the fourth receipt it has the same appearance—the ink is not the same colour as that in the previous part of the receipt, and it appears to be written with a different pen—the fifth receipt has the same appearance as to the ink and pen—looking at the words" o/a lot 8 "in all the receipts they appear to be written with the same pen and the same ink—it is difficult to form an opinion as to whether the signature of Edmund Salmon to all the receipts was written with the same pen that wrote the former part," Received of Mr. Cutts".—it seems to me to be the same pen and the same ink, but it is not the same handwriting.</p>

God—you"—I said, "No,"and he made a stab at me—I warded off the blow with my left arm, and my left sleeve was cut—I had received a cut in the breast—I went up to him and said, "Do you mean that?"—he made no answer—I struck him, and his shipmate dragged him away towards the London Dock gates—I got assistance, and stopped him about one hundred yards off—I left him in custody—I was told that I was stabbed; I was not aware of it; I looked and found the blood trickling down from my breast—I had not seen any instrument—I was taken to the doctor's.</p>

I am assistant to Joseph Hardwick, of 107, New Bond-street, linendraper On Saturday, 10th March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, Bushnell came and inquired for some Jenny Lind caps—we did not keep them—she went out and said something to Smith, who was outside, they both entered, and Bushnell asked for some white cotton stockings—she selected a pair, and then bought a white cambric handkerchief—Smith asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs, and selected one—he paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which the things came to—I packed up the parcel, and they rose to go away, and then Smith requested to be shown some silk dresses; I showed them some—Smith wanted something of a chocolate-striped colour—I showed them about twenty dresses, and said we had none of that description—they requested me to cut patterns of some which I had shown them—I packed some patterns up, and they rose up, and went five or six yards down the shop, when Bushnell said she wanted three or four yards of the pink silk for a child's frock; they both returned, and I cut off three yards and a half—Smith said "We must have some lining for it"—I went about six yards off and got the lining, which, with the silk, came to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I packed them up, and Smith paid me—Bushnell then stooped down—I asked what she was looking for; she said, "For a sixpence"—I went round the counter, and saw the corner of a silk dress projecting from under her shawl—I took it from her, and called a servant to search her—Smith rushed towards the door and tried to escape, a young man caught him, he came back, fell on his knees, and implored me to overlook it, and offered to pay any amount of money—I said I could do nothing of the kind—Bushnell went to a part of the counter where there were no silks and appeared to lean on it; when she moved, these two silk dresses were there, folded up in a way in which we never keep them—they were some I had shown her—Smith asked her if she had paid for those silks—I said he knew very well she had not—she was given in charge—these silks are worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the morning of 27th Feb., between two and three o'clock, a man named Sadler was in my room—he left me, and went down stairs in his shirt—Mary Day threw his trowsers down after him—I went down to look for a constable, and saw Gibson fighting with Sadler—Sadler came up-stairs again, and Gibson too—he was drunk—he tried to get into my room, but did not succeed—he then went over to Morris's room—I went out, and went down stairs—the prisoner rushed up-stairs into Morris's room, and said, "Oh you b—black mare!"—she ran to the dresser and took up a knife—Morris ran down stairs, and the prisoner after her, and she caught sight of Gibson, who was standing in his shirt, between Nos. 1 and 2 in the court, looking up to the window, and she drew the knife across his throat-Morris was at the bottom of the court, looking for a constable—it appeared to me that in the dark the prisoner mistook Gibson for Morris—when she had done it she said, "Oh my God! I have cut <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Gibson's throat"—she was drunk—neither Gibson or the other man were acquainted with her—they did not visit her—she wiped the knife with a piece of cloth; I think a piece of a child's frock, and flung it up into Sarah Morris's room—she then laid hold of Gibson's head and said, "Oh my good God! <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, I shall never rest upon my bed again, for I have cut your throat"—Gibson had then gone into the prisoner's room—she took a washing-basin up full of water end flung it up to Morris's window, saying, "You b—black mare, I will give you this in your face,"—the basin fell down on Gibson and smashed to pieces—I do not know what quarrel they had had—Morris was in bed when the two men were fighting—she had no quarrel with the men—I am quite sure it was the prisoner who cut Gibson's throat—I saw the knife in her hand, but she endeavoured to make it appear that Morris had done it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for several years in New Zealand, and came home as a seaman on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi>, of which the prisoner was chief mate—I joined her at Auckland; we sailed from there on 15th Oct—there was a Jew lad named Solomon Abrams employed on board the vessel in feeding the stock, which consisted of sheep, cows, goats, turkeys, fowls, and pigs—he continued to perform his duty till about 24th Nov., when he was not capable of doing so by weakness and illness—the vessel was then to the west of Cape Horn—I saw Abrams flogged the first time about a fortnight after we left Auckland—it was by the prisoner's orders, because he was dirty in the coalhole—he was flogged on the bare breach with a cat-o'-nine tails made of nine pieces of marline—he was lashed by his hands to the windlass, and had a dozen lashes—the first flogging did lot fetch the blood—he was flogged again about two days afterwards by the prisoner's order—that flogging drew the blood—he was about fifteen years old—he was in very good health when we left Auckland—I knew him on shore—I believe he was flogged the second time for the same reason as at first—the prisoner always flogged him himself—he had a dozen lashes on the second occasion—I do not know how often he was flogged afterwards—it night have been nearly every morning while we were on deck—I was in the chief mate's watch—I never knew him get more than two dozen—that continued until he took to his bed, about eight days before he died—he had no bed except what he brought on board—he slept in the galley, where the live stock were—I should not think he could keep himself clean there—the live stock caused more dirt than he could attend to—in the whole he wat flogged from eighteen to twenty times—I think he died between 1st and 5th Dec.—I never saw any one flog him but the prisoner—I saw the second mate strike him once—I have seen the prisoner strike him with the rope's-end—sometimes he was flogged at the windlass, sometimes over a bundle of hay, sometimes over the spars or over the guns; any place that was handy—his trowsers were always off, and he was stripped to his bare body when he was flogged—his hair was cut, by the chief mate's orders, close to his head—they said he had vermin in his hair, but I did not see any—I should think the vermin of the stock would have crawled to him where he slept—I saw him placed in a tub of cold water—we were then about 55 south latitude, and the weather was very cold—I should think there was about two feet six inches or three feet of water in the tub—the prisoner ordered him into the tub—he did not like to get in at first, and then the prisoner gave him a shove, and he ultimately went in—he had nothing but his shirt on then—as far as I can judge he was in the tub about an hour and a half—he was placed there to wash himself—he was not to say very filthy—he was dirty by knocking about the stock without shoes or stockings on—there was the manure of the animals on him—the prisoner used to come forward while he was in the tub and see if he was washing—he was washing his clothes—he was in a very weak state of health at that time—I did not see that his skin was broken—there was a very heavy fall of snow in the night, and in some parts of the poop it might have been six inches deep, and in some four—the boy shi<lb/>vered all the time he was in the water—after he had been flogged several</p>

               <p>times he got full of sores, the same as any person flogged would—the sores never got well before he was flogged again, and that drew his bottom into a scab—I have often seen the blood come—the last flogging I saw him have was about eight days before he died—he got quite thin and weak—I first ob<lb/>served that about a fortnight before he died—I saw him flogged about three times after that—he slept on one side of the galley, the turkeys were on the other, right opposite him, and the sheep were under him—he could not help being dirty—there were no pigs in the galley; some were in the long-boat and some in the sty, which was between the long-boat and the galley, about two yards from where he slept—he had to clean the galley out every now and then to get the dung out—he had to tread in it when he got out of bed—the cook's galley was on deck exposed to the weather; if a heavy sea came over it must come into the galley—I never did see the sea come over—he slept in a place with a wooden covering and a partition from where the turkeys were—he slept on two boards put on the side, till he got a piece of plank put to keep him from falling out of bed—it was hard weather and cold while he slept there—that in my judgment was not a fit place for him or anybody to sleep in; I should not like to have slept there myself—I remember seeing him taken out one night, four or five days before he died, and placed on the fore-hatch—he was all over sores then, and was not sensible—I did not see any flogging after that—I went to see him after he took to his bed; I was not able to make him understand me—he often complained to me of his treatment before he took to his bed—he complained that he did not get his rations—the pri<lb/>soner always behaved well to me—there was no surgeon or medical person on board—about three weeks before he died his bowels began to get loose, and they continued so till he died—he was often flogged for his bowels being loose—he slept in different places—he was a very good-looking, smart boy when he came on board; tall and thin for his age—after he was dead I observed a lump in his neck, about the size of an egg; I never saw it before—I never saw the captain present when he was flogged—there were about sixteen men on board the vessel.</p>

               <p>there; we had very heavy seas—he then slept in the galley—the coppers had been taken out of the galley, and put-under the top-gallant forecastle—the galley was worse than the forecastle to sleep in; it was more exposed to the weather—he was placed there by the captain's orders—there was a top to it and sides; one door was nailed up, and the other left open—he could not get out away from the dirt—it was not nearly so comfortable as the fore<lb/>castle—he had no hammock; he had a bed place, and two or three blankets—I know he had blankets, because I threw them overboard after he died, with his clothes—the mate gave me orders to do so, as they were in such a dirty state—I was in the mate's watch between four and six o'clock in the morning, that was when I saw Abrams flogged—I cannot say how often he was flogged; it might be more than a dozen times, or it might be less—I should not like to say he had not been flogged twenty times—I recollect his first flogging, that was for making a mess in the coalhole, about three weeks after he came on board—I do not recollect how many lashes he got then—I cannot tell how many days after that it was that he was flogged again; I think it was the next day; sometimes he used to get flogged every morning regularly—I suppose he was flogged eight, nine, or twelve times—his trowsers were pulled down, and he was flogged on the bottom, with a marline similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was flogged for being dirty—it is my belief that he was frightened to come out on deck in the night-time—I never knew him dirty himself in the day-time; he said he could not help it—there was stock on board, which was placed where he slept—I remember his being told to go and scrub his clothes in a tub—I was not there at the time—I cannot say whether he was put into the tub or not—he came to me to lend him my brush; I lent it him, and he was left there to scrub his clothes—I saw him scrubbing his clothes, but I did not see him in the tub—he was all wet at the time; it was cold weather—after he died, I saw two large black or blue lumps on each side of his throat—I remember his being flogged for stealing two bullocks' or calves' tongues, from the galley—he had his rations served out like the rest of the crew, by Mr. Senior, the steward—he got them regularly if he was there; if not, people that were hungry eat them themselves—his share was always cut, and if he left it, anybody ate it who could get hold of it—the crew are not all on deck when the rations are served out; one man is generally sent aft to see them weighed.</p>

               <p>was never flogged—there might hare been five or six pieces of marline to the thing he was flogged with, and he was struck ten or twelve times—I saw the blood come—I cannot say when that was, but it was after two or three times—the tub was what we called the wash-tub, we all washed our clothes in it, and our faces and hands when we got up—we did not all get into it.</p>

At a quarter past eleven o'clock, on Friday night, 16th Feb., I was on duty in Old-street—Clark pointed out a cart to me, twenty or thirty yards off; there were three men in it—I fol<lb/>lowed it, and called out to them to stop—the driver was dressed in a scull cap, and a white flannel jacket; I have no belief as to who he was—I got up to the horse's head, and seized the reins, and stopped the cart—the persons who were in it jumped out, and ran away—I cannot say whether the cap and jacket now produced are what the man had on; it was a cap and jacket of this description—the persons who jumped out ran in the same direction as far as Willow-street—two of them turned down there, and Holmes kept on a-head—I followed, and took him into custody—I never lost sight of him from the time he jumped out of the cart; I am confident he is one of the men—he was stopped by Baker—I told him he was one of the men that jumped out of the cart—he said he was not—he appeared as if he had been running; he was very much excited and agitated—Clark minded the cart and horse while I was running—I found in the cart sixty-six pairs of Wellington boots, and 170 pairs of women's boots, and two pairs of shoes, and three crowbars—the name of "Richard Williams, Turk-street, Bethnal-green," was on the cart; it was then about twenty minutes past eleven—when I first took them it was about a quarter-past eleven—I afterwards went with Ball and Smith to Turk-street, Bethnal-green, about one—Williams would have had abundance of time to get home, supposing he had been the</p>

I went to the warehouse as usual, and I found a van at the door, with empty bottles and hampers—I went down into the cellar, and there was not the slightest appearance of any wine having been there—I stopped the van, and went to Mr. Exley's—on my return home I found this letter, by post, in the prisoner's writing—he did not call on me again—I went to Mr. Exley's office, and saw the prisoner there—he had given me an I O U about a week before, and he offered to meet me at Mr. Exley's—I never got my shares back—I had before ascertained from the prisoner that they were in the hands of Mr. Exley—the prisoner got me to sign a memorandum—he pressed me very much to allow him a week to settle the matter, and after a little con<lb/>sideration I consented—his wife was there, and she importuned me as well—that was on the Monday, I believe, and on the Wednesday I was to meet him at Mr. Exley's, and he was to arrange with Mr. Exley that the shares were to be given up to me—on the 9th Sept.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Salter; in January, 1848, we lived at 7, Palace-row, New-road; the prisoners came to lodge there at the latter end of March, or beginning of April, 1846—the little girl was born there in the following October or November; a boy named John William came home; he was then about two years and a half old—he was a healthy nice child then; I have heard the parents very cruelly use it; the last time was when I was at the foot of the stairs, and heard the father violently beating it; the mother said something, and he said, "D—n its little eyes, I will beat its b—d belly in"—I heard it screaming, and heard him say, "I will knock its b----y brains out;" he then appeared to dash it against the wainscot—the mother was in the room—the child cried very much, and about ten minutes afterwards it came down stairs for a <hi rend="italic">halfpe'th</hi> of milk; it was in a very bad state of crying, and seemed very trembling; he scarcely knew how to walk down stairs—he pulled up his clothes, and said, "Look here, Mrs. Salter, what my father has been doing." I looked at his legs, and from the bottom of the loins to the calf of the leg he was so emaciated, that the blood was raised to the surface of the skin; it was bruises—there were many other such occasions before that, the mother was always very cruel to it from the time it came home; scarcely a day passed but what it was bruised—it was in a very thin delicate state when it left in April, 1848; it was bruised from head to foot—I have given it food in consequence of the cruelty of its mother; the father was urged to beat it by the mother—the language used to be very shocking on both sides—the father used to be away for a month together; but for the last three months, scarcely a day passed without my hearing one of them beating the child.</p>

On 16th March, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I stopped in Long-lane to look at a print-shop—a lady said something—I missed my handkerchief—it was safe not a minute before—some one pointed out the prisoners—an officer seized them, and took this handkerchief from March's pocket—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor and auctioneer. On 31st March I was at the Sutton Arms, Caledonian-road, Islington—I supped there with the landlord, and about half-a-dozen select friends—I was leaving to go to my own residence, about half-past eleven—as I fronted the bar, the pri<lb/>soner stood there with two other persons—I had seen him at my house the day before on business—he said, "What are you going to stand?"—I said, "Anything you like, but it is your turn"—he said, "I have no money"—I said, "Well, have what you like"—I ordered Mrs. Clayton to draw them what they liked—there were three glasses of brandy and water had, one of soda-water, and a cigar—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had one glass of brandy and water—I threw down a sovereign, and said to Mrs. Clayton, "Take for what we have had out of that"—she turned her head to a little parlour to get change, and the prisoner took up the sovereign and put it into his pocket—I said, "Don't be a fool; pull that sovereign out; let me pay for the reckoning"—he said, "I have not got it, I did not take it up, I have no money"—Mrs. Clayton came back, and the prisoner borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of one of his friends to pay the reckoning—he seemed in a jocular mood—I still insisted on having the sove<lb/>reign—we left the house, and came on towards my residence—I could not find a policeman—when we got to a coffee-shop, which was open, I said, "You shall <hi rend="italic">go</hi> no further, I am determined to have the sovereign"—we went in there, and had some coffee—I sent a friend to fetch the policeman—the pri<lb/>soner still said he had not got the sovereign, he had not got any money at all—I saw the prisoner searched at the station—the sovereign was found in the pocket which I pointed out.</p>

In March, 1848, I lived at 3, Harding-street, Woolwich; it is now pulled down—the prisoner was a lodger of mine—on 18th, March she assisted me in cleaning the yard—I went into my room, and she said, "Oh! look at your chest of drawers and your boxes"—I said, "Oh! lam robbed!" and ran to the door to see if I could see any one—she said, "Sea if your watches are gone"—I looked and missed them, and a jacket, three pairs of trowsers, eleven waist<lb/>coats and shirts—I found a shirt in the passage, and two silver watches, one of which had hung over the mantel-piece, the other over the drawers, about three-quarters of an hour before—I also missed a satin dress, and a crape and cashmere shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Woolwich. I was called to attend Ellen Davies—I found a wound between the third and fourth bones of the back—I probed it, it was from an inch and a half to two inches deep—it had just escaped the kidneys—it was a part from which I should not expect much blood—the locality of it prevented its bleeding, there are no large vessels there—it was a triangular wound, which is a wound of a dangerous character—this bayonet would produce such a wound—it had entered the flesh—it was perfectly straight—it had gone by the side of the kidney, where it is soft and fat—it might penetrate some distance without making a wound that would be dangerous to life—if it had been a little lower down it might have been dan<lb/>gerous—I visited her three times a day till the Friday following, and twice afterwards—I attended her from the 12th to the 21st of March—if it had been a round wound, I should not have had half the trouble I had—a triangular wound never heals kindly, when two lips of the wound are closed the other remains open—I was afraid of an inflammation—it was between the spine and the kidney.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at St. Thomas's Hospital. I was there when the deceased was brought in on the Monday morning at ten minutes past two—I was called up by the porter and saw him in the surgery lying on his back, perfectly dead—Meek, the policeman, was with him, and Mary Tay<lb/>lor—he had a stab about two inches below the left nipple, between the fifth and sixth ribs, and about two inches to the left of the breast-bone—the wound was about half an inch in length; it was an incised wound, and was in an oblique direction—I could not at that time tell what it had penetrated, I could only surmise—it had ceased to bleed—his waistcoat and shirt were bloody—an examination of the body was made next day in my presence by our demonstrater of morbid anatomy—on introducing a probe through the external wound, it was found to have taken a direction upwards and backwards, to the extent of about two inches in depth—on removing the sternum and portion of the ribs, it was found to pass beneath the cartilage of the fifth rib, which was slightly cut—it was then traced through the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi>, or the bag which contains the lungs, in which we found twenty-five ounces of dark-coloured blood—that would be at the bottom of the cavity as the man laid on his back; the blood would gravitate there—it was then traced through the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi>, or the bag which contains the heart, and on opening the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> it was found to have gone through the wall of the right venticle about two inches, and there was also twelve ounces of the same coloured blood effused into the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi>—it was venous blood—a man could not survive such a wound as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say it took an oblique direction, did it appear to be done by an instrument pointed upwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should say that it was made in an upward and inward direction—the deceased was a fine roan, five feet nine inches high I believe—he was a well-formed young man, and well-proportioned—I should say he was three or four inches higher than the prisoner, or more.</p>

I heard Taylor screaming "Murder!" and "Police!" and ran to the spot—I saw Bartlett holding the prisoner—I asked who had done it—I looked on the ground and saw the man bleeding-Taylor said, "That is the man,"pointing to the prisoner—I immediately laid hold of him by the two collars, and said, "Have you got a knife about you?"—he said, "No; yes, I have got one in my right coat-pocket"—in feeling his left breast-pocket, as I laid hold of him, I felt something in it—I put my hand in and took from it this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was open—I did not see any particular appearance on it—I then put my hand into his right coat-pocket and took out another knife which was shut—I gave him to my brother con<lb/>stable, Holmer, who came up, and I went with the deceased to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tooley-street. Last Monday morning, about twenty minutes to two o'clock, I was coming down Charlotte-street to go into the Borough—I had been over Blackfriars-bridge—I saw the prisoner with another man, walking together—I had never seen them before—I did not see any other persons walking the same way with them—I heard the prisoner say, "If you will not give me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one way, I will have ft another way"—I then saw him take the penknife out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he said to the one that he murdered, "I want to speak to you"—I saw him open the knife—he made a step while he was palling, it open—the other was going on—he turned to the prisoner again, and asked him what he wanted—he did not make any answer, but stuck the penknife tote his side—after he had done that he wanted to wipe the penknife on ray frock—I was close by them—he was going to catch bold of the skirt of my frock, to wipe the penknife—I would not let him, and he gave roe a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me off the kerb, and in putting my arm out to save myself a spot of the blood came on the sleeve of my frock—I did not fell—I did not go to the police-court to give my evidence, I was not able—from his <hi rend="italic">shaving</hi> me off the kerb it jolted my side, and caused me such pain I could not go—I went by Rowland Hill's chapel, and sat on the step of a door till I was able to walk, I was in such pain—I then walked as far as the Borough—I went into a coffee-shop, and sat down, and stopped there till the morning—I then went to the Court when it was open, out I was not able to stop, I was taken so bad.</p>

               <p>this fire—I went there, and entered the house directly—the shop-door was open; I went into the shop—I seat a man before me, to break open the back-door, to let the smoke out—I have a note, which I made at the time, of the state of the shop: (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—" Some empty tubs, shop-fittings, and things burnt, and some loose fire hanging about: under part of the stairs, and partition burnt; front-shop and back-parlour scorched; egg-chests, and some straw in cellar burnt; two. distinct fires"—that is the note that was furnished to the Fire-office next morning—I examined the tubs; they were butter-firkins; there might be twenty or thirty of them; they were all empty—I saw four half firkins on the other side of the counter; they were partly fell of butter—the empty firkins were standing on their heads on each other, and there was a little butter, about half an inch thick, on the heads; there was a little layer of butter on the beads of the uppermost ones, which I could observe; the prisoner, John Scollard, drew my attention to that—I had asked him what trade he was, and where his butter was, and he said, "What do you call that?" pointing to the head of those casks—the principal part of the shop had been burnt, under the stairs, and some empty firkins; it was not burnt through, not consumed; the flooring was not burnt; the fire had not spread over the whole of the shop, only the partition, and under the stairs—these stairs started from the street-door and came into the shop—there is a recess under the stairs in the shop; the wood was burnt there—the door leading from the shop to the back-room was open, and there is a door that leads from the back-room into the yard—I ordered that door to be opened, to let the smoke out; I suppose it was shut at the time, I did not see it—the fur<lb/>niture and the partition in the back-parlour were severely scorched—there was a bed on the right-hand side, and a sofa under the window—the flooring was not burnt at all—I went into the yard, where there is a trap-door opening into the cellar; it was partly open, and there was a great body of smoke coming from it—I stooped, and saw a glimmer of light; I did not go down—a man named Wilkinson went down by my orders, and I went down a very few minutes after—there was a great deal of water in the cellar, which we had thrown in, and some burnt boards between two uprights, which I took: to be egg-chests broken up—the cellar is right under the shop—from what I observed I am positive the fire in the cellar, and that in the shop, were two distinct and separate fires—I should say, from the appearance, there was only fire in one place in the cellar—the flooring of the shop was not burnt—the fire in the cellar could not have fallen through from the shop; there was not the least cavity—I saw John Scollard in Bermondsey-street, between three and four, and asked him if he was the occupier—he said, "No," his brother William was—I afterwards went into the shop, and William and John were both pointed out to me as the occupiers—I asked William Scollard what office he was insured in—he told me some office over London-bridge, he could not tell me the name, and produced a receipt of his insurance—I said, "Why you are insured for 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Yes"—I asked what he celled himself—he said he was an egg and butter-merchant, and pointed to the butter, as I stated before—they were both present—I said, "Where are your eggs?"—one of my men pointed out to me, and said, "Master, here are some," and took three out of the shop-window—I said, "Are these all you have got?"—he said, "I am rather short at this time of year"—the fire had not extended to the shop-window—I then said, "Where is your butter?"—John Scollard said, "There were forty firkins before the fire happened"—I said, "Where are they then?"—he pointed to the little butter on the heads of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090205"/>
               <p>the casks—I said, "Is that all? I could eat all that"—I then sounded the tubs, and found them all empty—I asked William Scollard for his policy—he said he could not find it, and it was then he produced the receipt—all the stock I saw was the part of four firkins, except four, five, or six pounds in the cellar at the foot of the stairs, and that had no business there—there was a little straw in the cellar, but there was so much water that I could not see it then—there was a very thun skim of butter in the cellar, not thicker than a wafer; there was no butter in the shop, or any sign of any having been there—I made a hole in the shop, to let the water through into the cellar, and there was butter on the surface of that water as thin as a wafer; I should think a very few pounds indeed would have made that appearance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Fire-brigade. I went to this fire in Bermondsey-street, at three o'clock on Monday morning—I went with Henderson to the cellar-flap, it was down—smoke was coming out of the cellar, through a vacant place in the flap—I went down into the cellar directly, by Henderson's directions, and at the further end of the cellar, towards the front shop, I saw a flame about two feet high—it proceeded from about a dozen pieces of board, or <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> of wood, placed on the top of each other—it was placed between two uprights, which supported the floor—those uprights were burnt a little at the bottom—I had previously seen the other fire under the staircase—there was no means of one fire being communicated to the other, they were separate and distinct fires—in another part of the cellar I noticed a few old things, some bedding and chairs, some egg-chests, and two or three bits of coal—they were near where the fire was, and seemed to have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090206"/>
               <p>burnt—the cellar did not appear to have been used as a coal-cellar—there were no signs of coal except those pieces—the flooring under the stain was charred and burnt, and some old tubs on the shelves in the shop, that was, I should say, nearly three feet from the fire underneath—the fire in the back-parlour was occasioned from the fire in the shop, because the door was open—I saw four half firkins of butter on the right side of the shop, and about 10lbs. or 12lbs. of butter in a half-firkin at the bottom of the stairs in toe cellar—I saw some empty firkins standing upside down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the employ of the South-Eastern Railway Company. This order (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was brought by Crawley—he was there when I went there, at seven o'clock in the morning, or it might be three minutes after; it was scarcely light—he had a man and a cart with him—in consequence of receiving this order, twenty-five sacks of flour were delivered to him—there were fifteen sacks of household flour, and ten sacks of No. 2—they were delivered by the order of Mr. Empson—here is the delivery-book—Crawley has signed it, in the name of John Roberts—on 20th Dec. Crawley brought this other order for twenty sacks—I delivered the quantity mentioned to him—he had again to sign the delivery-book for them—they were taken away the same as before—it was about the same time in the morning—they were there when I came—seven o'clock is the time to deliver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Feltham; he consigns flour to me to supply his customers—these orders are not my handwriting, they are forgeries, they were not written by my authority—I had not sold any flour to a person of the name of Wilson about that time.</p>

Q.</hi> What is the way in which this flour is sold in the market, by samples or by description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That all depends on the person who buys it—most persons know the character of flour, and buy it without a sample, and an order is given by me to deliver it—if a person were to get this order, it would not act in the same way as a bill of parcels; it is a delivery-order—I am known as a dealer—it would be known in the trade to what description of flour my order pointed—if my order were brought to a person who knew what the flour trade was, he would know what he was buying, on my order—the flour which is consigned to me is of a particular sort—I have a certain connection that I go amongst, and sell it to—this order is like a dock-warrant—I should buy flour on a note of this kind, if I knew the man whose flour it was, but I should like to know the quality of the flour—I issue perhaps four or five of these orders in the course of a week—I had one cus<lb/>tomer named Wilson—I did not sell to Wilson about that time; he never bought this quantity.</p>

I am a carman and coal-merchant—Peacock employed me on 14th Dec. to fetch some flour from the railway station—he first spoke to me about fetching it as I was washing my van before my own door one morning between twelve and one o'clock—he said, "Holloa, Crawley, how are you?"—I said I was rather slack of work—he said, "I can give you an order to cart some coals"—I said, "I expect a country job; I cannot do that"—he said, "Well, I expect I shall buy some flour worth the money;" and he asked me how much I would cart it for—I told him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack—he said it was to be carted from the Bricklayers' Arms station to his house—I said I would not do it under 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sack; he said he could get it done for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I did not care about it—a few days after, I was coming out of my door to go after some coals in my cart, and he said, "Good morn<lb/>ing;" I said, "Good morning"—he said, "I have got an order for twenty-five sacks of flour, it belongs to a man of the name of Roberts"—he gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) for twenty-five sacks—he told me to go and get them; and he said, "Sign Roberts, or what you like"—he told me I was to get it early in the morning, but it was all coming to his place—to the best of my belief it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon when he brought this order—I said I could not get it away myself with my horse and van—he said, "Can you hire?" I said, "Yes, I can; I often hire from Mr. Boddy, close by me"—we went to the public-house, and had a drop of gin—I think he stood one drop, and I stood another—I went down to Boddy's in the even<lb/>ing; I saw his foreman, and made an arrangement with him for the following morning-next morning I went to the railway station, about half-past six o'clock; I took my own van and horse, and Boddy's man went with me with his cart and horse-when I got to the station I gave in this order to a person there; he said, "You must wait, you cannot have the flour till the delivery-foreman comes"—I went to a coffee-shop, and while I was there, a tall man came in, and in consequence of what he said I went to the station and obtained the twenty-five sacks of flour, leaving the order there—the man who came into the coffee-shop helped to load the flour—I afterwards described that man to Peacock, and he said he thought, by the description I gave of the man, that he was the man of whom he bought some of the flour, of the name of Bailey (that was when we were in prison)—having obtained the flour, I drew it from the station, and took it to Peacock's shop in St. George's-road, near the Elephant and Castle, it was there unloaded, and placed in his shop—I noticed the mark of "J. M." was on the sacks—Peacock then went with roe, and we had some half-and-half to drink—I was not paid in money, I had a sack of oats for my horse and some chaff to the value of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the job came to—he asked me if I had signed the name of Roberts in the book—I said, "Yes;" he said, "That is all right, old fellow"—I had signed the name of "Roberts"—a few days afterwards, on 20th Dec, I went again to the station—it was on Monday morning, about half-past six o'clock, when I started from Boddy's—I took an order there for twenty sacks—this is the order, I received it from my wife on the Sunday night when I came home, and she told me something, in consequence of which I got ready, and went on the Monday morning—I got Boddy's man and one of his horses—the order I got was signed "Roberts"—I got the twenty sacks, and took them to Peacock's house—I was paid for that in corn and chaff—he asked me if I had signed the name of "Roberts"—I said, "Yes;" he said, "That is all right, old fellow" Peacock said he bought the orders of two men, Bailey and Wilson; and had</p>

I had been drinking; if I had been sober I should have given every information—Peacock did not tell me not to tell anything about it, or to disguise anything—when I was locked up, he came to my wife, and said I was an innocent man, and what was done was done by his desire; she was broken hearted about it—Peacock told me at the time why he wished the name of Roberts to be used—he said he had bought it of a man named Roberts; and said, Sign Roberts, or what you like, it is all coming to my place"—I had never fetched anything from the station before—I have taken goods there, but I never fetched anything away with orders—Peacock keeps a corn dealer's shop—I believe he took it two or three years ago from a man named Perry—I was taken up, and Peacock came before the Magistrate—to the best of my belief I was only examined once before the Magistrate—Peacock did not appear on that occasion—he went to my wife, and said I was discharged from custody—I saw some books produced at the office, they were in a handkerchief—I believe Peacock brought them himself—I do not think they were looked at—I did not direct my attorney to summon Peacock to appear—he did summon him, and he appeared.</p>
