               <p>I live in Cherry-tree-alley, Golden-lane. On the 19th of December, I remember the witness Meason was at my door; we happened to go out, and we saw a little boy holding him; that is the boy, the prisoner, and the other two, they were pulling of the bag, but they ran away; there were things on the ground when I went out of the house; before I could see what they did; the child had not power to cry thieves, but he cried murder; I called to Mr. Matravers, and said here is a robbery; he got the little one, and the prisoner Milton presented me a watch case, with a string and seal, that was within ten minutes of the time as nigh as I can guess; he would have given it to the constable; but the constable ran by him and would not receive it; it was a watch case, with a string and seal; I gave it to the constable, his name is Matravers; I saw Mitton once go down our alley, never before, he gave me the watch case to give to the boy that was robbed; he said so, and he came after me to my own door, and said he, d - n it, or d - n you, (I do not know which) I will see that you give it him; and away he went.</p>

               <p>How came you to take it? - I took it from him, and gave it to the child that very instant, within ten minutes of the robbery; the boy remained with me all the time; we took care of him, for fear the rest should be gone.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time the prisoner Damant was holding Meason up, was the bag taken out of Meason's hand? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I live the corner of Cherry-tree-alley, on Saturday the 19th of December, at one o'clock, I was coming home, and going to knock at my own gates; I am a cow-keeper; I heard murder cried in my alley; if it had not been murder cried, I should not have looked out; we run, and at the bottom of Anchor-street, I took Damant, and brought him back to the place where the robbery was committed: the lad said, that was the boy that held him, while the other men robbed him; the things were about; I said give them to me; there was one silver case; a young man met me; I cannot swear to him: says he, Sir, I have the property; but I could not catch the thief; I said give it to the proprietor, and he gave it to Mrs. Stubbs; it was offered me by one of the thieves that robbed him; I do not know who it was that offered it to me; afterwards I received these and all the things from Mrs. Stubbs; there was some property found in Anchor-street.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Stubbs. Look at that watch, is that the watch? - This is the same.</p>
               <p>The Boy. This is the same case, the glass is broke.</p>
               <p>Court. When did they get the bag out of your hands? - About one o'clock; Damant laid hold of my arm before they got the bag from me; then he got hold of me.</p>

               <p>Was you sensible of the blow? - Yes, I was sensible enough; they caught me by the throat; their nails were stuck in my throat; when I was in the ditch one man came upon me directly, and another held my throat, and two were rummaging my pockets; they took my watch; and I had two guineas and some silver in this great coat, which I have on at present; they took my watch from my fob, and tore the buttons off besides; I put the money into my great coat pocket, all but one guinea; and I had silver in this left hand breeches pocket; they took that also; they took every farthing I had, which was about three guineas, in money; they took a handkerchief: it was a silver watch; one man throttled me in that manner, that I could hardly swallow for three or four days, and I can feel it now; and there were the marks of his nails in my throat; I was sensible the whole time: they were with me about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a long while? - I cannot say just to a minute; but I dare say it was near that.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A fine moon-light night, as bright as day: I never saw either of the four men before to my knowledge: they were going to strip me; they were getting off this coat, but somebody disturbed them; I believe it was a man on horseback; and they went off, they went toward Chelsea again; they had taken this hat, which I have, and when I got up I begged my hat very hard; I got out of the ditch, and asked for my hat; and one of them turned back and d - d my eyes, and swore he would kill me if I did not turn my head the other way; while I was in the ditch I begged for mercy, and to have my watch; and one man said, d - n my eyes I will take and kill you if you say another word; I just turned myself round, and they were on the full run; and I picked up my hat, and ran after them, to see which way they went; I followed them till I came to the green, there I lost sight of them; not till then; just over the stile I lost sight of them; and the blood poured down, that I really got faint and weak, and I returned home.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the persons who committed this robbery? - I do.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - These three men at the bar were the men that robbed me; as for Durham he was the most desperate man I ever knew; I am equally sure of them all, by my own eye.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - There were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130010"/>three in soldiers clothes, and one in a darkish coat, which is Newton.</p>
               <p>What is it that you swear to them by, by their faces, or their clothes, or what? - It is not by their clothes; it is by their faces.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of any other weapon besides the bludgeon? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How many of them spoke? - When they came up they began to stop me.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it that said, d - n you, where are you going in such a hurry? - That was Jones.</p>
               <p>Which was the man that had the bludgeon, and struck you? - Durham.</p>
               <p>What did you observe Newton do? - He rifled me.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery did you see them again? - I believe it was a week after.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them again? - As soon as I saw them I knew them all again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Newton's Counsel. Why when you came to the publick office, in Bow-street, I suppose all these men were in irons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Newton had? - He was cut very much.</p>
               <p>These were shewn to you as the persons who had robbed you? - They were.</p>
               <p>At the time you went to Bow-street, you expected to find those that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I observe that the letter which was sent, and which you have put in, informs you that the persons who had robbed you were in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And before that some little part of your property was found, so that you came there in full expectation that you should see the persons that had robbed you? - I could not say till I saw them; but I came with that view.</p>
               <p>You say these people might be ten minutes with you; I dare say the time appeared very long; it probably would to any man under such circumstances? - I cannot say as to the time; it might not be so long.</p>
               <p>There were three of them in soldier's clothes? - Yes; they had slouched hats.</p>
               <p>I need not ask you whether you was considerably alarmed and frightened? - I certainly was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrol under the direction of Bow-street; on Monday night, the 11th of January, I went out, and staid out the whole of Monday night; and coming up from Brentford early on Tuesday morning, on this side Kensington, I met two persons in haste; they told me of Gardiner being robbed, and we went in pursuit of them; and about five in the morning, in the Fulham-road, we came up to the three prisoners; there were three of us; we immediately endeavoured to secure them; they began fighting, and a desperate scuffle insued; at last, we secured them, and got them handcuffed; near the place where Newton was engaged with one of the men, I found this old handkerchief, with a steel watch chain, and a parcel of seals and trinkets to it; it lay in a little heap in the handkerchief; I heard something rattle when I picked it up; and I found a small pocket handkerchief in Newton's pocket, marked; I found no other property that the coachman owned.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can safely swear to my chain, and every little trinkum that is to it; and this handkerchief, to the best of my judgment, is mine.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on the handkerchief? - There is P. A. or something of that sort; I picked it up some time since; but I would not swear to it on any account; the mark is like the mark, and the handkerchief is like the handkerchief I lost.</p>
               <p>Maynard. Durham, whom I laid hold on, had this bludgeon in his hand; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130011"/>this bludgeon was found near the place where Newton was; my partner produces another bludgeon; Durham and Newton were in the same dress; Jones had a drab great coat on.</p>

               <p>I was one of the patrol; I was with Maynard; I assisted in apprehending these men; Maynard picked up the handkerchief and watch chain near to the place where Newton lay, near to the side of the road; Maynard searched all of them, and took every thing that was found, the cotton handkerchief was taken from Newton; I was present; I seized Jones first, and he had this bludgeon under his coat; the other bludgeons were picked up after the fray was over; one we picked up, the other was brought by a stranger; I collared Jones; Durham had a bludgeon in his hands when he was first taken; Maynard was in great distress; I went to his assistance, after I had almost knocked Jones on the head.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol; I assisted in taking these three men.</p>
               <p>Had they any weapons? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they any thing to defend themselves with, or to attack you with? - No; we found the three bludgeons in the road.</p>
               <p>Was there any scuffle between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was the scuffle? - With our fists; my foot slipped, and Newton lay across me; I laid fast hold of him by his hair, and he could not do me any damage.</p>
               <p>Then, you fought only with your fists? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you soon down? - Soon down; in getting hold of Newton, my foot slipped, and I could not recover myself; Newton remained upon me a quarter of an hour; Hughes helped me.</p>
               <p>When you was down in that manner, could you see in what manner the others were scuffling? - No, only I heard Mr. Maynard, the captain of the party, call out murder! murder! several times.</p>
               <p>Did you see how they were fighting? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>How do you know whether they fought with fists or weapons? - Hughes told me he came up to Jones, and took this bludgeon from him, and beat him with it.</p>
               <p>Do you call a bludgeon a weapon? - I do not call it fire-arms.</p>
               <p>I did not ask you about fire-arms; I should think a bludgeon a weapon, and a dangerous weapon? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>But you told me the three bludgeons were picked up in the road? - That was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Newton had no bludgeon; and in the end of the scuffle, you took but two bludgeons? - There were three found on the spot.</p>
               <p>You, the patrol at that time, only secured two? - The three were found in the road.</p>
               <p>How many did you find yourself? - I found none.</p>
               <p>Who did find any? - I do not recollect; three were found on the same morning, and we brought them to town with us.</p>
               <p>Were they all three brought in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they all three brought in by strangers, or did any of the patrol bring them in? - We brought them in with us; we picked them up in the road; I cannot say who picked them up; I was in the house with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Newton. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. Your counsel cannot speak for you. If you have any account to give of yourself to the jury, where you was; or if you have any thing to observe on the evidence, you must do it yourself.</p>

               <p>I was going to Battersea about five in the morning, and I saw these two prisoners as I was going along Putney-road; I was just behind them, and the patrols laid hold of them two, and took me.</p>
               <p>Are you in the army? - No.</p>
               <p>What way of life was you in? - I lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130012"/>with my aunt, who kept a wine vault; I was going to see a cousin at Battersea.</p>
               <p>Court. Where are the wine vaults? - In King-street, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Jury. My lord, in consideration of the good character of Newton, the jury beg to recommend him to mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. I am always glad to listen to the recommendation of juries on such subjects; I will tell you why in this case I cannot accede to it, because these men have been guilty of a great deal of unnecessary cruelty in the perpetration of their robberies; they have added an unnecessary barbarity to robbery. The duty we owe to the public, for the sake of protecting honest persons who are going about their lawful business, ought not to suffer us to shew such persons any favour; and therefore, though I am very sorry for that prisoner Newton, and particularly for his youth, and with respect to the good character that has been given him, it is impossible for me, consistent with the opinions I have held during my whole life, and which I have constantly declared in public, to give the least countenance to your recommendation.</p>

               <p>Is your warehouse part of your dwelling-house? - Yes; when I came down in the morning, the door of the dwelling-house was on a jar, and it rather alarmed me; I observed it fast the evening before; and part of my property being missing, I was flurried; over the door there are some windows; and I observed above the door, the window was broke; and part of the glass was withinside the warehouse, and part in Oxford-street; I did not find any of the screws forced; the bar had been lifted from its situation; it dropped down to its natural center, as put on by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Could a person by putting their hand into the window which was broke, remove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130014"/>that bar? - No; the door was open when the window was broke; there must be some instrument let down to lay hold of the bar, and to raise it from the catch; I saw that there had been a kind of a friction, from the brightness, which I suppose was the instrument that had been let down; no other part of the house had been broke; I did not know either of the prisoners; I went immediately to Litchfield-street; and the first part of my property that I thought was mine, I found at Litchfield-street; I should suppose it was on the Wednesday after; it was in the possession of Kennedy the constable; it was a part of the Irish linen; I saw nothing else; there was no mark, but according to the number of these cloths that follow one another regularly; and I thought there was a part of my private mark, but part of it was gone; had I been on my oath, I think I must have identified it: either on Wednesday or Thursday, the woman prisoner was called before Justice Barnfather; and her pockets were searched immediately, and there were duplicates found of Payne the pawnbroker; there I found a part of the black velveteen, and a part of the thickset; I had great reason to believe it was my property, because it corresponded with our's in the meanness, and was not well finished; but there was a piece of paper with the private mark of the gentleman we bought it of; but I am not acquainted with it; our private mark was removed; I know nothing of the man prisoner; nothing was found on him; he had pawned the piece of black velveteen.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Stiles. Look at the place which the last witness has spoke of as being washed; can you say in your judgment, whether it has been washed or not? - It appears as if there had been some water put upon it, and that it has been rubbed with it; when the cloth is folded up as it comes from Ireland, just about the place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130015"/>where the blue mark is; sometimes it may so happen that it is not there; but we generally mark it near the maker's private mark, about four inches from the edge of the earth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My wife washed one end of it, to see how it would wash.</p>
               <p>Court to Stiles. Is that usual? - It is generally supposed that they would wet a corner in such a case.</p>
               <p>To Kennedy. You said this two pair of stairs of room was the lodging of Leonard? - He was brought to the rotation-office at that time; and the watchman belonging to Marylebone had got the key from his wife.</p>
               <p>Is the other prisoner his wife? - She goes as his wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner John. Yes, in wedlock my lord.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mrs. Barnes: I went to bed the same time as the last witness: the doors and windows were all shut; that cellar door I fastened with the bar myself; I fastened the street door, and a cellar door, and a door against the court; I was first up, about eight in the morning; and I found the door wide open against the court, adjoining the cellar door; that door was locked and bolted with two iron bolts; the door at the top of the cellar stairs was open, and the bar was down; there was a piece of oak lying over the cellar window over night; it was fastened between the stones of the pavement; not nailed; that piece of oak was taken up whole, and set against the wall; the person must come in at the cellar, by taking up that board, and by my finding the cellar door open; there was a chink in the cellar door, wide enough to admit a knife or an instrument, so as to lift up the bar; I missed the pewter the first thing; I am sure they were there the night before; the things were in the kitchen; the handkerchief was in the drawer; we did not know to whom it belonged; it had been there five or six weeks; I do not know how it came there.</p>

I told him I had; he then said, d - n your eyes, you b - r go along; and he let go of my hat; I run towards home, about thirty yards, as fast as I could; the moon shone very bright; and I turned round to look at them, to see which way they went; they turned to the left, from the way I was coming; and they made over the bridge, towards the Thatched-house, in the Lower-street, which is a bad swampy way, in this weather; I ran into Cross-street, thinking to meet them; I came round, and in Thatched-house-row I met them both again; there was nobody in the street to call to for assistance; there was nobody but a poor old woman just behind them; I stopped and looked at them both full in the face; I was quite close to them; one of them (but which I cannot say) said as they passed me, d - n my eyes, that is the b - r we have done; they then crossed the road, and ran down the Elder walk; I never saw the prisoner again, till he was taken, which was last Tuesday night (January the 12th) I was sitting at home with my family, about seven, or a quarter after; when this witness, Browne, came to my house, and produced two cutlasses and a pistol, and laid them down, and said, how do you do; do you know these? I took up the cutlasses, and said, I did not know them; I took up the pistol, and saw the notch, and told him if I was dying, that was the pistol that was held to my breast the night I was robbed; I went to the Mitre with the patrol, and there I saw the prisoner: I was very much flurried at seeing the pistol again: I walked into the room; there might be fourteen or fifteen people in the room; there were some that I knew, and a many strangers; I pointed to the prisoner, and said, how do you do, young man? he said, he did not know me; I told him, I knew him perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130025"/>well; I then told these people, that he was the man that pulled the hat over my face, and held the cutlass to my head, while I was robbed; I saw no more of him till I went to Bow-street, the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Look now at the prisoner; at this time are you positive that that is the man who stopped you, who pulled the hat over your face, and held the cutlass to your head? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Have you the least sort of doubt about it? - Not the least in the world; I gave that description of him at the office the next day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>What description did you give of the prisoner, at Bow-street, the day after the robbery? - I told them he was a young man, of five feet eight inches high, rather slender made, with a round hat, and drab coloured coat, with a short tail; it was not a long coat; and that the other who held the pistol, I thought, was about five feet four inches high, he had on a round hat, and a drab coloured coat, and was a stout made man for his heighth.</p>
               <p>And can you swear that you had an opportunity of taking so much notice of the prisoner, as to be able to give that description of him? - Yes; for when he first came out I was as much as fourteen or fifteen yards from the trees; the tree stands about four or five yards from the posts; I took particular notice of him, for he came all the way with the cutlass in this manner (over his head) which made me take the more notice of him; and of his dress also: the moon shone as bright as it could shine: a very fine clear evening it was then: he advanced towards me as fast as he could walk; he did not make a run of it.</p>

               <p>But you had no further opportunity of making any observation of his person, after he had pulled the hat over your eyes, till the robbery was over; did you see his face after the robbery was over, when he told you to go away? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then the observation you made upon him was, as he advanced to you, and when you met him again at the Thatched house? - Yes; and it was so light that I could swear to the coat and waistcoat that he had on; the waistcoat is the same now; and I believe the coat is that in which he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Had you a full opportunity to observe them when you met them again? - Yes, I had a full opportunity.</p>
               <p>Had you mentioned any thing about the notch in the pistol to any body, before the pistol was produced? - I had mentioned it to two or three people that I knew, and particularly to a gentleman's servant, that lives with Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>When you went to the Mitre, on Tuesday last, was the prisoner pointed out to you by any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be as much at large as any of the other persons that were in the room? - Yes; I saw no difference; he was leaning against the dresser when I came in.</p>
               <p>He was not in irons, or any thing of that kind? - No; I saw no irons, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>How long were they robbing you? - A minute and a half, I believe, or two minutes; they were a considerable time robbing me, and keeping my hat down in that manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was picked out, was not my hands tied with a handkerchief? - Not that I observed; I looked at their faces, and not at their hands.</p>

            , on duty as patrol: about seven in the evening, going betwixt Cross-street, Islington, and Canonbury-place, I saw the prisoner behind a large elm tree, and advancing towards him, I seized hold of him; there were two more behind the tree, close to him, near the footpath; at the same time I heard something fall; and the other two ran off; I cannot be positive who they fell from; I then delivered the prisoner to Mr. Whaley, and ran after the other two; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130026"/>the night coming very dark, I could not see to overtake them; I returned to Whaley and Jennings, who were on the same spot; and I looked on the spot where I heard the cutlasses drop, and found them both lying there; I picked up nothing else but the two cutlasses; the prisoner was brought to a lamp, and searching him, I found this pistol in his coat pocket, Jennings and Whaley being present.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - No; the prisoner was taken to the Mitre, in Islington, to be further searched; I was sitting down at the Mitre when Hodgson came, for I was not well.</p>
               <p>Did any body point out the prisoner to Hodgson, at the Mitre? - No, I am sure of that; there might be fifteen or twenty people in the room; Hodgson picked out the prisoner directly; Hodgson had seen the pistols and the cutlasses before we went to the Mitre; his shop was in the way to the Mitre: he observed there was a notch in the stock of the pistol; and said that was the pistol that was held to his breast; and I believe he said his right breast.</p>

               <p>Browne. It was the tree highest to the footpath, on the left hand, on the road to Canonbury; and the prosecutor shewed me the tree, which was the same tree he came from, when he was apprehended.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner the 19th of December, between seven and eight in the morning, at the top of Oxford-road, towards the fields; he had a bundle on his shoulder; I retreated; after he passed me about ten or fifteen yards, I laid hold of his bundle; I perceived it was some animal; I followed him about two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards: when he perceived I followed him, he threw away the bundle, and endeavoured to escape; I laid hold of him, and he told me the bundle he had was given to him by a farmer, or some man in the country, to take to Oxford-street, who had given him a shilling; I asked him why he threw away the property; he answered me in French; he said he could not speak English, that the property had only been delivered to him, to take it to Oxford-road; I brought him back to the bundle; and in endeavouring to bring him back to the bundle where the property lay; he would not take it up any more; I asked him where he lived? he said he had no abode; I begged of him to take up his bundle, and go with me; he said he would not; so I with two or three more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130028"/>young men, put the bundle upon him, and went with him to the watch-house; when we opened the bundle, it was the hind part of a sheep, with half the skin on, which belonged to that flesh; it was quite cut right through; cut across; it was the hind part; the two hind legs; we examined him, but he would not speak English, any more than now, he would insist upon it, that this bundle was given him by a man in the country, to take it to Oxford-road; he did not say what particular place; I asked him; he said he did not know any other place, but that he was to take it to Oxford-road; Mr. Bond came and owned the skin.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the prisoner any knife? - We did not examine him directly; but when we did, which was about four hours after he was taken, he had no knife upon him; his clothes were full of blood, and part of his shoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Have you seen the side of the sheep? - Yes the mark was across the loins, I marked it down the head and across the shoulders, and there were two crosses besides across the loins, which is the mark that the salesman puts upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose the salesman puts his mark upon the whole lot, that he is to sell that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your own mark so particular that you could venture to swear to it? - There was my own mark upon it, a cross with red ochre; the butchers generally mark different marks, I can venture to swear to the skin from that mark; the drover told me he had found the other part of the skin, his name is Starkey, he is not here.</p>
               <p>(The skin produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Bond. Take up that part of the skin that belongs to the hind quarter, and tell me if there is any mark upon it that you can swear to? - There is no part of my mark on this part of the skin; here is the saleman's mark.</p>
               <p>Does that piece of skin indent and tally with the other? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>Is there any certainty that these two pieces of skin must at first form one skin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is impossible to say whether they do or not, for one is wet, and the other is quite dry.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect what the mark was, that was on the other part? - It was a dot across the face, and ochre all across the loins, and the salesman's mark, the same as the other sheep; the two parts were certainly parts of that sheep that we lost.</p>

On the 16th of December last, in the morning, I observed that somebody had been trying to take away my pump, the over night; the spout of it was very much bent; the pump stood in a back yard; the wood is fixed to the house, and the lead is fixed to the wood; being in London the next day, I was on horseback; and the turnpike man asked me to alight, and shewed me the pump; I had not missed it before I went to London; the turnpike man's name is Henry; I knew the pump; it was the whole of the pump, as far as was above the ground; I went home to see if mine was gone; and it was; and I let him know; I knew it by being so particularly bent in the spout; I observed no letters upon it: I did not compare it afterwards, being so very positive it was mine: it is not a large pump, and the spout very narrow, remarkably narrow; the pump is here: I went to the turnpike with a friend: I saw the prisoner three or four days before this happened; he used frequently to pass through the house; ours is a publick-house; and the prisoner and his master live in the Mews; they are chimney-sweepers: after looking at the pump, I sent my servant for it; and from the description of the patrol, I apprehended the prisoner; and he came to me and acknowledged that he had took it, after some persuasions.</p>
               <p>Court. You told him it would be better for him if he confessed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- HENRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am employed at present, on the road, as a patrol man. On the 17th of December, between seven and eight in the evening, I perceived the prisoner passing by my box, which is just by Tyburn turnpike; he was coming from Paddington; he had a bundle, which seemed very heavy; I came out of my box, and went up to him, and laid hold of his load; I perceived it was of substance; and asked him what he had? he said, it was lead, he found it in the road; it was wrapped up in a bag; and was going to take it to the watch-house; I laid hold of him, and brought him back towards my box; and he dropt it down so gently, while I was going to my box, to get my piece, that I did not even hear him drop it; and he made off; I made a noise, but could not catch him that night; the next day I saw him again: I took the lead to the turnpike; the turnpike man is not here; the next day the proprietor took it away; but I did not see him: I saw it at the turnpike the next morning, the 18th.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that the lead which you saw the next day, was the lead you had brought there? - By the bend of the spout I can. In the evening of the 18th I saw the prisoner again, at the prosecutor's, where he was sent for; I could not altogether so well swear to him, it being dark, though his voice I knew; and by his size, I could well guess, but could not positively swear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner now makes a very different appearance? - Very different.</p>
               <p>Can you swear he is the boy? - By nothing but his mere confession.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I had three half crown pieces in my pocket, and I had but one remaining: I said to the watchman before she was searched, that she had robbed me of half a guinea, and seven shillings, in silver.</p>

               <p>The person I sell fruit for in Covent Garden went out to spend the evening; I had been to take care of her children; I was coming home, within four or five doors; this person met me, and spoke very familiar to me, and asked me how I was; I concluded he knew me extremely well, and I made a full stop; when I looked at him I perceived he was a stranger; I said, I fancy my friend, you have made a mistake; He said, no, I know you very well; and he laid hold of my hand; says he, will you have any thing to drink? I said I would not; it was very late, and was near home, and had a child to mind, and did not want any thing to do with him; he told me he would provide for my child if I would go with him; he still kept hold of this left arm: he put his hand into my bosom, and behaved very ungenteel to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130034"/>me; then he put my right hand to his breeches, but not to his pocket; then I insisted on going from him; when he found I was not agreeable to his wishes, he said, you have robbed me; I said, of what; he did not mention any sum, but said I had robbed him: I had an opportunity of going before the watchman came; but I staid; when the watchman came we went to the watch-house; and I was searched; there was nineteen shillings and sixpence in silver, and nine pennyworth of halfpence, and one bad shilling found upon me. I hope you will take it into consideration, for the sake of my child: I never was here before: my mistress was here yesterday; but she has a delicate constitution, and the weather being bad, I do not know whether she is here to day.</p>

On Thursday last one of the witnesses brought to me a spoon fork, broke in two, to know if it was Sir Richard's; I took it to my master; I examined the plate, and I missed two spoon forks: and very soon after Mr. Shipley, the other witness, brought the other spoon fork; I counted them on taking possession, three weeks before; I do not know how long either of them had been missing; I was very sure the crest was the same as the other; I can say nothing of that which had no crest, only it answered in pattern: the prisoner was apprehended that evening; I found him in custody, and knew him; he had called on me the day before; he said, he was going into the country; he staid ten minutes: he was in that room called the buller's pantry; the key was in the press; and I was called to answer my master's bell, for two minutes; I left the prisoner alone, and found him alone.</p>

               <p>I drive the Limehouse stage. The prisoner told me his master had given him a saddle, because the dog had gnawed the stuff of the lining out; I believe it was this day (Thursday) five or six weeks; I saw him at the Britannia, Limehouse; he did not shew me the saddle; he said, there were plated stirrups; next morning I took out my corn bag, and carried it into the house, and met the prisoner at the door of the Britannia; says he, there it is; what will you have to drink? he did not give it me: I saw the saddle lay at the top of my coach box: we had a glass of liquor each: I put the saddle into the boot, and drove off; I took it to Mr. Talbot, Whitechapel-road; he told me to call again; he said he could not afford to give above twelve shillings; he asked me where I had it; I told him I suspected it was stolen: I asked nothing for it: I said I would send the man himself; I left the saddle, and went to Mr. Blakeman, whose servant I knew the prisoner was; I met the prisoner as I was going; he asked me how I came on? I said, I would tell him presently: I think I should know the saddle again: the prisoner came half an hour afterwards, and asked me how I came on with it; I told him I could not tell him, till four o'clock.</p>

I cannot swear to it; but I missed one of that description; the prisoner was servant to me when I first missed it; he went off directly: Foster informed me of the loss of it, of a Friday, about five weeks ago: I had a new saddle besides this; I bought this saddle of Mr. Talbot about May last.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to know how long it is since you received sentence of being transported? - Sentence! why that is nothing to the case: what makes you put such questions here? you know what I am come here for.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I do not know; you look in the book; you know.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you the goods here? - Yes: on the 9th, the Saturday before last, about four in the afternoon, the little boy came to my house with one of our patrols from Whitechapel; he told me that the boy was robbed of a bundle.</p>

               <p>From what house? - The Duke's Head in Wildford-street.</p>
               <p>Who were the three men you took? - The prisoner and two more: the goods were not there.</p>
               <p>Where were the goods? - They had a dispute among them, in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he never was guilty.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you get these goods? - I took one of them out; he says, you go with me to another public-house, and I shall deliver you the goods; I left two men in possession of the prisoner, and I went to another public-house in Petticoat-lane; and then he sent for his brother; and he told his brother that he should go to Woolpack-alley, in an open cellar, and he would find the property; I sent one of our patrols with him.</p>
               <p>Then you was not present at the time of finding the goods? - No.</p>
               <p>How did these goods get into your possession? - The brother of the prisoner, and the patrol brought them to me.</p>

               <p>What did you do with the goods afterwards? - I delivered them to Mr. Emanuel; he took them to his house.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the goods at the time? - Yes; there is a piece of cotton that I marked (produced); this is the same; this is the mark, 1367, 2880.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So it was Silva's brother that gave them to you, and you let him off? - He ran away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say before the justice, that the window was broke, and puttied up before? - I do not believe I said so; the window was broke and puttied up, and had been so since I lived with my master; and I have heard him say that it it had been so for seven years; the window was in the same state I had ever known it.</p>
               <p>Court. What was there standing in the window of your master's shop, at the time you heard the window crack? - Sets of knives and forks papered in a roll for shew, that was usually placed there.</p>
               <p>Were these within reach of a hand? - They laid close to each pane of glass, therefore some of them could be drawn through the broken pane; there is always one knife and fork outside of each paper, for shew; there were about three papers against each pane.</p>

I pursued him; he ran a little way up the lane, and crossed to Wild-passage, on the opposite side of the way; I got to that passage before the prisoner: he crossed the way immediately, and ran into Duke's-court; Mr. Minns was at the corner of the court, and I called to him, there he is, that is him: Minns pursued with me up Duke's-court; Williams followed after: the clerk at the public office, in Bow-street, was the person that stopped him; he is not here; I saw the prisoner stopped in Duke's-court; we brought him back to the shop, to see what was missing; there was nothing missing, as I found, or did learn; I observed nothing in the shop window.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me now remind you of the situation in which the prisoner stands, and ask you whether you are sure you saw the prisoner's hand in the window, or whether he was attempting to put his hand in? - No, his hand was through; I am sure of it; it was his right hand, not the hand next me; his coat was not through.</p>

               <p>I am a cutler in Drury-lane; on New Year's day, about six in the evening, my man, Williams, says he told me something, but I did not attend to him; in that instant Carns gave an alarm; he opened the door, and said, thieves! thieves! but did not come into the shop; in consequence of that, I went immediately to Duke's-court; and Carns had ran after the prisoner; and when I came up, he said that is him; I pursued him, and hallooed out stop thief! stop thief! and in Duke's-court, he was stopped; I am sure the person stopped, was the man pointed out by Carns; he never was out of my sight; after that, he was stopped by a man, who I understand since, is the principal clerk at Bow-street office; I collared the prisoner, and brought him back to my shop window; and I observed the glass was broke, a very large hole, big enough to put my arm in; I looked through the glass, to see if any thing was lost from the window; nothing was lost; I perceived one of the sets of knives that were tied up, was moved from the situation in which it was placed; my knives and forks are placed opposite to the glass, and as close as possible: and one set of the knives was pushed from the glass at a greater distance.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was it when you had the alarm first? - It was a little before six, on the first of January; I had lighted candles upwards of an hour; this pane of glass has been cracked and puttied up for seven, or I may safely say ten years; but this day it was in its usual security; that I can safely say, because I frequently observed it whole that day, when looking at the window frame which Williams had that day painted.</p>

I said, nothing, I am going about my business; I went up this court, and they came after me, and challenged me with breaking the window: I said, you know my master, and I told him who he was; Mr. Dean of Petticoat-lane; he said, I know him very well; but he would not let me send for him; and they took me to Tothilfields.</p>

               <p>I am a horn turner, No. 26, Petticoat-lane; I know the prisoner; he was my journeyman at that time; I sent him on New Year's day for some horn tips; and I had asked him several times to go to different persons to enquire about them, and see if they had any; and that very morning I gave him a guinea to go to Old Montague-street; I gave him a guinea; he brought it back, and he told me they had none; then I told him to finish his work, and go up to Oxford-street, he went away from me about half after three; he has lived with me ten years, with me and my father; I was with my father; he had been apprentice to my father; he had his time given him at my father's death; about three years ago, he was taken very ill at his work, and I did not see him for some time; but between that time and this, he has worked for me three different times, and I never found any thing in him dishonest; we used to trust to him; but of late I have left off trusting any body; the week before he had earned fifteen shillings, and that week he had money owing him; I might owe him half a dozen shillings; he did certainly make the work that Mr. Minns had, about a week before; he made it in my work-shop; that was handles for butcher's steels: was he at large again, I should employ him again; for I never found any body that I had more reason to trust.</p>
               <p>Minns. I knew his master; he is a horn-turner; and his father was a very honest worthy man; I deal with the young man, the same as his father: there was not a steel handle in the window he was at.</p>

               <p>There was a dispute between the prisoner and the coachman; and the coachman called me, and gave charge of this woman for flapping the door of the coach, when she went out: I took them both to the watch-house: I put her into the coach: the prosecutor was in the coach, rather intoxicated in liquor: I took them all to the watch-house. The prisoner took some silver out of her pocket, and looked at it; then she put her hand into her bosom, and took out a purse, and looked at it, and what was in it; then she put back the purse, and took some silver out of her pocket, and paid the coachman; and gave me sixpence to drink her health; I suspected her, and told the constable; and he sent for them in; I brought in the woman, and the gentleman: the constable asked him where he had spent his afternoon; he said where; and that he had ten guineas in his pocket; but he could find only one half guinea; the prisoner was searched, and in her pocket was found nine guineas in gold, four shillings and sixpence, and three halfpence; I said there is a purse in her bosom; she was searched, and it could not be found; we took her backwards, and stripped her of her outside clothes; then we shook her under petticoat, and out of it dropped the purse.</p>

               <p>I was constable of the night. I produce the purse. What Daley has said is true. The prisoner said, the prosecutor had got his money again: and as she was a married woman, her husband should enter an action against him, for cuckolding him. The prosecutor swore to the purse that night; we shewed him two others, he described his own.</p>

               <p>On Sunday evening, the 8th of November, I was going to suppet, in Holborn; and just as I came out of my own house I met this gentleman, near Wood-street; he asked me how I did; he asked me where I was going? I said, to Holborn; he said, it is a very cold evening; he said, you shall have something to warm you; we had four sixpennyworths of brandy and water; he said, he would see me safe where I was going; we got into a coach; he ordered it to drive into Holborn; he said we should have something more to drink; and we went into a house; and he called for eighteen-pennyworth of brandy and water, and then for another eighteen-pennyworth of brandy and water; then he called this hackney coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to Whitechapel; and from thence to the Bagnio, in Goodman's-fields; I did not chuse to go in there; then we came back to Holborn, in the coach; we fell into discourse; I told him I had lived in a publick-house, and failed in business; and he seemed to take a great liking to me; and he said, that twenty or thirty guineas was no object to him; and I went with him in the second coach; and he made me a present of a couple of guineas: in the second coach he would have given me his watch for security; and he offered me twenty or thirty guineas; he said, he wanted just such a woman as me for a long time: the gentleman knows in his own heart and conscience that I did not rob him, nor take any thing from him; I neither meant to leave him: the gentleman knows what passed in the coach.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Had you any watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was safe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this woman in your life? - Never, nor I should not know her now, if it had not been for the other witness.</p>
               <p>Bristow. When I was searching her, she said she was a married woman; and then afterwards she said that this was her master, and she had had three children by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130052"/>him: she came out in her shift, in the watch-house: she said, she was a married woman; and her husband should bring an action against the prosecutor, for cuckolding him.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is her way of life? - Her husband is a master chimney sweeper; he carried on a great trade: she and her husband are separated.</p>

               <p>I was subpoened on Wednesday about eight; this prisoner has been a master sawyer; I knew him to have a good many tools; he came to me the latter end of July, and said, do you know any body that wants a steel saw? I want to dispose of it; I said, I should like it, but have no money; and I went to this Mr. Tovey, and asked him if he wanted to buy a spring saw; he said, yes; and I sold it to Mr. Tovey, on the 14th of August, that very week I was sick on my benefit club, and I received my ten shillings on the 17th of August; I had the saw full three weeks before I took it to him: whether it is the same saw, I cannot tell; it is a saw that has been in use at Mr. Tovey's ever since the 13th, and so knocked about, I think it impossible to swear to any particular mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My wife will not produce me the book of receipts it is in; I have sent for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Concerning the tinder-box that was found on the prisoner, it was my property; I gave it him; I know him to be a hard working honest man; I never heard any thing else of him: I know his friends.</p>
               <p>Court. A man snatching a thing from a person is not a robbery; about four score years ago, it was held so by a very great authority; now the law is, that there must be some violence used by the thief, towards the person that is robbed; independant of the mere act of taking the things out of their possession; or there must be a struggle: now, in this case, if the bundle had been taken from the person, it would have mounted to a robbery, but the taking the umbrella does not amount to a robbery; as far as the bundle was in question, there was a struggle between them about it, and if after that struggle, he had got the bundle by force, it would have been a robbery: it is very much like snatching off a man's hat; if done without any threat or menace, it is a felony, and not a robbery.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I went from the watch-house with you, to New-prison, was I any way confined? - Only I took hold of you.</p>

               <p>Court to prosecutor. When did you see your money or your watch, before you was robbed? - I had it in my hand coming down the Minories: I went to see what it was o'clock; I swear positively the prisoner was the person that took the watch out of my pocket, and no other; I saw it in his hand with the string, holding it up over my head to the woman; I had a pint of beer, and I believe, and am sure, there was above the money I put down in the indictment; every identical thing was taken from me, and my handkerchief; but I would not put it in the indictment; I did not think it worth while; I mentioned the handkerchief to the watchman.</p>

               <p>I am the night beadle at Whitechapel: the prisoner was brought to the watch-house: Mr. Tate, when he came in, seemed to be very much in liquor; he made a kind of a stagger towards our door in the watch-house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130058"/>Did he talk like a sober or a drunken man? - The chief of his talk was, that the prisoner had robbed him of his property; I set the charge down in the book; the watchman said in the presence of the prisoner, that there was another man in company, who ran away from him; I asked the watchman if he knew him? he said his name was Bassett: we went and took Bassett out of bed.</p>

               <p>I arrived in London five days before this happened, in consequence of a warrant I received from the Navy-office, to join the Otter sloop of war; I was going down Rosemary-lane to see a person of the name of Alexander M'Enzie; I went inadvertently into this public-house to get a pint of beer; I belonged to the Oriel, a seventy-four, before this warrant was sent to me from London to Plymouth; my general character depends on his Majesty's Navy; going into the house, my prosecutor went in near on the same time; his foot slipped up the step; I was behind; I was in the public-house about the space of ten minutes before he charged me with the robbery; I went out into the tap-room, and was searched by his request; I had nothing about me; the night was so exceedingly dark, that had I met an old acquaintance, I declare to God I could not have known him; further, the prosecutor in his deposition before the justice, has varied; for he said I walked away; now he says I ran away.</p>
               <p>(The deposition handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Did you drink with the prisoner? - No, I did not: he said I did, but I did not; nor yet was he ever searched; he offered to be searched before the justice, but the justice said it was of no use to search him.</p>
               <p>Did you say he walked away? - First he walked, then he ran; then he walked into the house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say before the magistrate, that he walked? - Yes; I said he ran, and then walked, and then ran at the later end.</p>
               <p>Court to Pentelowe. In what condition did you find the prosecutor, as to his figure and appearance? - He might be a little in liquor; he did not seem any way dirted much; he looked a little reddish about the face; his clothes were all over mud.</p>
               <p>Court to Langhorn. How did he appear to you? - Why, he was muddy, very muddy; all his back was muddy, and his face; but I saw nothing about his face either of blows or redness.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prosecutor the next day? - Only the Monday.</p>
               <p>Did you see any mark or any blow about his forehead, or any appearance of it? - No</p>

               <p>I am a coach broker: I live the corner of Liquor-pond-street, Leather-lane; I deal in old carriages and harness: on the 21st of September, the prisoner at the bar was in my shop, when I came home, he told me he had some harness to sell; he turned them out of the sack; he asked me three guineas; I told him they were of no use to me, and to take them away; he produced a letter, desiring me to put down the price at the bottom of the letter; then we made a bargain for a guinea; he took the guinea, and went away: they were brass coach-harness, with a crest; I repaired them, and put new terrats, and hung them out for sale; and Mr. Freeman bought them; he gave me thirty-three shillings and six-pence for them: they were hung at my door.</p>

               <p>I was going up Holborn, after some lime, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, going to paint some wainscot in a house, to burn the ese off; and as I was going up Holborn, a man overtook me at the end of Hatton-garden, and said, George, where are you going? I said, to get some lime in Red-lion-street; I turned round and looked at him, and he asked me to carry that for him a little way; he said it hurt his shoulders; accordingly I took it from him, and he told me to follow him, and he would shew me where to take it; he went about half way down Leather-lane, and shewed me Mr. Dale's, and gave me a letter wafered up, with Mr. Dale written on the face of it, and told me I was to bring three guineas, and he would wait in that street till I returned; and if he did not send that, the price was in the letter; I went and knocked at the door, and staid half an hour, and a woman let me in, and asked me to call again; she sent me to look for him at a public-house; and his wife broke open the letter, and asked me my name; I told him where I lodged, and that I was to have three guineas; he said he should not give three guineas; he turned them out of the sack, and gave me a guinea, and put it in the letter, and his name underneath it; and he gave me the letter back, and the sack, and I came to the man in Hatton-street, and I told him; he read the letter, put it in his pocket, and gave me half a crown, and parted from me; and I went where I was going before, for the lime, and I went to work.</p>

I said, no, but asked him what he had taken from the shelf; he denied it, and said he had taken nothing; I said I saw him take the watch from the shelf; I told him if he did not give me the watch immediately, I would call my mistress down; she was up stairs at that time; he said he had no such thing, and I might search him: I called down my mistress; and when he saw her, he went to the gate; then my mistress and me followed him, and brought him back to the kitchen; I called my master; he questioned him about the watch; and just before the constable came in he told my master, if he would forgive him, the watch should be returned; the watch was in the blue cloth which covered his muffins; the constable found it there; I saw it found.</p>

               <p>I saw the coach run down Oxford-street very fiercely, and the first wheel struck the post, and the second threw it over and split the post in two; I sat upon a half sieve on the step of a door; I did not see where she was before the coach was overturned, the woman was brought on the basket where I sat, and sat down some time, and her head was bleeding; her hat or bonnet was off, and her shoes, and a man came and put her shoes on; I called to her several times and she made no answer, she went off in a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Did you see the coach before it was overturned? - Yes, it was coming along the street.</p>
               <p>Could you at all judge on what occasion the coach was overturned? - No, I could not indeed.</p>

               <p>I saw the Aylesbury stage coach on Sunday evening last, about four o'clock, at the Old Hat, and changed horses there; I came up to town with him; an accident happened in Oxford-street; there were a couple of coaches standing side by side, and the coachman halloo'd out three or four times before he came to them, and they did not draw off, and it being a dark foggy night he could not see the post, and he ran foul of it, and overset the coach; the deceased was laying down on the side upon the roof of the coach; she sat close to me on the roof of the coach; she fell off of it, and I along with her, and the rest that were there; the man was very sober, he never drank any thing while I saw him.</p>

               <p>Court to Huckey. Did you take notice what was in the box? - It was impossible; I took out a bill of parcels of Mr. Slade's; I should not know it again; it amounted to four pounds, fourteen shillings, and three-pence; I kept the bill of parcels, and took it to Ashmore, as I think (the bill of parcels produced); this is the same amount; I set a mark on it.</p>

               <p>Court. How many coaches did you see turn in that manner? - Somebody called coach; and then Mr. Fox tried to get the job; and then another coach turned out of the rank, and drove down Fetter-lane; the cry for the fare came from the right hand side, where he turned about.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOX sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coach master; I drive my own coach: there was a call in Fetter-lane; I tried to get at it; but Mr. Martin's coach, which I saw as I passed it, got before me; I did not see him take up any fare: he went briskly up the lane.</p>

               <p>I live servant at the Green-yard. I remember a man bringing a coach, the 12th of December, about six o'clock; the prisoner is the man; he said, his name was John Green; he said, he found it near Snow-hill, without a driver, and that it was a stray; they get one shilling each horse, and one shilling for the carriage; I pay that by my master's orders; the owner pays nine shillings; the prisoner came again the next day, with another coach; and told me his name was Thomas Green; then he recollected himself, and said, I told you last night Johnny Green; Oh! says I, I shall not alter it; call in two hours, and I will pay you; mean time I sent to Mountain, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coach was a strayed coach.</p>
               <p>Have you been an old coachman? - I have been a piece of a one, in my life time.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Five and fifty. I have no witnesses.</p>

I asked him when he came to the door, if these were his breeches; he owned them: the prisoner held two shillings between her fore finger and thumb, and said, I gave that for them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought this hat to pledge with me, on the 8th of last November, I believe; I have no memorandum; he had four shillings in pledge.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my hat I believe, to the best of my knowledge, by the buckle; I cannot positively swear it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel, to Prosecutor. When did you first lose those hats? - The goods were moved the 14th of November; and I went before the magistrate fourteen days after.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner done work for you before? - He had.</p>
               <p>Was there any account subsisting between him and you, for work done? - There was; we had not settled our account; I think if the balance was properly settled, I should owe him nothing; I objected to his bill, and would not pay it.</p>
               <p>Was you served with a subpoena? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before he was taken up? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>How long after this, did you charge the prisoner with this offence? - Two or three days after this subpoena was served.</p>
               <p>What time was there between the time that these goods were removed, and the time you received this subpoena? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it a week? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it two days? - It might be.</p>
               <p>Was it more or less? - It might; I cannot say; the prisoner told me he had taken the hats out of the cart, and he could not deny it.</p>
               <p>Did you get the duplicates from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long after that, did you charge this man? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that this conversation passed, that you talk of? - It might be ten or twelve days; Carter said he took the hats, and the prisoner said the man has got his hats again.</p>
               <p>Have not you offered if he would give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130079"/>you a release from the debt, to give him a release? - I have not; I do not know what a release means.</p>
               <p>Have not you promised to forgive him, if he would forgive you? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you not know now, that there is a release preparing? - I have heard such a talk not half an hour ago.</p>

               <p>I removed the things for Mr. Baillie, and I had the hats, and I pawned them: Mr. Baillie promised never to trouble me; then several days after, I could get no settlement, and I served him with a writ; then he served me with a warrant, and took me to the justice.</p>

            ; I desired the boy to hold the candle, and ordered the butler to open his drawers, and unpack his boxes; he then unlocked three drawers; in the first I found two or three quires of writing paper in a leather case; I examined the paper, and looked at it, and asked him if it was his; he made me no answer; I repeated the same question two or three times; he then said it was mine; I said, if that be the case, I shall certainly take it; it was office paper; the next thing I found, was the top of a loaf of double refined sugar, about one pound; (I had made him no promise or threats at all) I asked him whose that was; I was obliged to put the question to him again, once or twice, and then he said, it was mine; I said, then I shall certainly take it, which I did: the next thing I found, was a paper bag of sugar tied up, and broke very small for use; I asked him whose that was; he said it was mine and I put it on one side: the next thing was a whole pound of coffee, as it came from the grocer's, with his paper and string on it; I asked him who that belonged to; he said, it was mine; and I put it also on one side: searching further I found another parcel of sugar broke, of the same quality as the other that was in the bag; I also found a bottle of flour of mustard, as it came from the shop; I then found a brush, which the other servant claimed: I then asked him how he could be such an ungrateful fellow; and he asked for mercy: I believe I said; I fear you have a halter about your neck, it depends on me, whether I shall pull it tight or not; that was all the answer I made him; I then pursued my search, and I found some books in one of his boxes; I did not claim them that night; I then found a key with two wards, one at each end; he said it was a park key; it did not strike me as a thing of any consequence, and I put it back: in another box amongst his clothes, I found a pot of raspberry jam; he said that was mine; then I told him, he could not think of staying in my house, but he must have his plate and every thing ready in the morning, and what I should do with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130084"/>I did not know, and I ordered him and the boy to bed; accordingly in the morning when I came down, my son looked over the plate while I was in the room, and agreeable to the inventory we found it right; but having suspicion I had lost wine, it occurred to me that I would try this key, and I insisted on his unpacking his things, which he had packed all up and corded, and I took out the three books in the indictment, two of which had my own hand writing in, but the law book had not; I cannot say whether they were the books over night, but I remember seeing the law book over night; for I asked him if he had been studying the law; he said those three books were mine, and I had the key tried, and it opened my wine cellar: I saw the evening before, a winder wrapped up in paper, in one or other of his boxes; he had three or four boxes; he told me the over night, when I asked him what it was with some suspicion; that it was a winder of a clock of his in Gravel-lane; in the morning I took it out, and said, surely, this is the winder of a register stove, and he said it was mine; I tried it with a new stove up stairs, and it fitted exactly: my son took out this little silver thing from one of his boxes; it is a silver wax-light; it does not belong to me, but in the inside, was a silver top of a cork, with ring marked brandy; I asked him whose that was; he said it was mine; then we found in his box, a silver thimble, and a bit of thread lace, wrapped up carefully in a bit of paper, about a yard of very narrow mecklin lace, they were both claimed by my daughter, and he said were mine, and once or twice more he hoped for mercy; I made him no sort of promise; but then I was very well satisfied who plundered me, but that I had not yet made up my mind, whether I should go to Bow-steet, or not; but that he should call of me on Wednesday, (this was Sunday morning); I asked him if he wanted any money, and I gave him seven guineas on account, and he left my house directly: after he was gone, on enquiry I was more dissatisfied, and thought it was a debt I owed the public to prosecute him: on the Wednesday morning about twelve, he came to my office, and I had then one of the Bow-street people to take him, and he was taken into custody; the property has been in my possession and my servant's, from me to him, and from him to me; in fact, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. Had you any house-keeper in your family? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was the proper person to have the custody of your stores? - The stores that had been in general in care of the butler; were such as oil and vinegar, and mustard, and those kind of things; but not sugar, because the sugar is in general hung up in the kitchen, and is delivered to the butler for the purpose of breaking it only.</p>
               <p>He said they were your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many of them, for instance, a loaf of sugar, if delivered to him to break, might have remained in his possession without much hurt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose those two books had been delivered to the cook, to assist her in the kitchen? - They had.</p>
               <p>That cook was the prisoner's wife, and was gone to lay in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she expected to return? - Yes, because she was so good a servant.</p>
               <p>Those two books which had been delivered to the cook for her use in the management of the kitchen, were found in in the custody of the butler, locked up in some drawers belonging to her, in his care? - They were packed up in the morning; but over night they were in the drawer.</p>
               <p>He came according to your promise on the Wednesday? - He did so.</p>
               <p>You charged him at first, I believe, with petty larcency, in taking a ready dressed fowl? - I meant only to indict him for a petty larceny.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether this is,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130085"/>or is not a key of the park? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I can prove it is.</p>
               <p>I believe you sent to him since, to pay him his wages, which he refused to receive? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>There had been no warning given him? - No, the cook had been pressed to return, and refused it; they were going to set up in a shop.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I should think this winder of the register stove would not be of much value to any body, but the owner of the stove? - I do not know.</p>

            , with a girl with them; the girl says, here is the watchman; damn the watchman, says the prisoner, if he speaks a word we will do him; I went ten after that; and at eleven I was standing at the watch-house door; and the two men and the girl were coming from the dancing school; so, says I, what you are come from the dancing school? yes, d - n your eyes, you b - r, says she, we are: I cried the hour of eleven and twelve; and at a quarter past twelve I heard somebody in the back lane; I put out my light, and came to Mr. Weatherall's door, very near the paling, up jumps Goodrick, with this rosemary, and the prisoner after him, both out of the garden; I knew them before: they had both rosemary under their arm, a good deal, an arm-full each; I followed them as close as possible; but when they came to the front I walked up sharply, and they made a bit of a run; and at the Cannon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130090"/>they dropped them; that may be about ten or twelve houses from Mr. Weatherall's: I took up a bit, and found it the same as a bit I had picked up before, where I saw them come over the rails. They made off, and went up towards the town. I have known the prisoner seven years.</p>
               <p>Look at him: are you sure he is the man that came over Mr. Weatherall's pales with the rosemary? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man that went to the Cannon with Goodrick, and dropped some more there? - I am positive of it.</p>

               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - Cloudy; very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Any moon at all? - I do not think there was; none to be seen.</p>
               <p>Then it must be pretty dark? - No, it was not over and above dark.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call out? - Because the prisoner knocked me down twice last year in the back lane.</p>
               <p>Was he punished for that? - No.</p>
               <p>How came the man to assault you, and knock you down twice? - We had a bit of a tussle, and three or four more women and himself came and begged my pardon; and I forgave him.</p>
               <p>Had you and he been very good friends at this time? - No variance. I did not see him during the week that he was not taken up; I waited to let my master know; I did not take him for this offence: he was in prison.</p>

               <p>I live in Great Windmill-street, St. James's. On Tuesday, January the 14th, between four and five in the evening, I lost a leather strap, with a large quantity of pots.</p>
               <p>DENNIS M'CARTY sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of January I had information of a great number of pots being carried up two pair of stairs in Star-court: I went up stairs; the door was fast: I got a constable, who is here: I found the pots at No. 2, in Star-court; and the prisoner was putting a lock on the door; when the constable came he broke open the door; and these pots were in a quilt or rug in the bed; and Mr. Freeman took them. I am sure of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury. This is an indictment against the two prisoners at the bar, for stealing the various articles you have just heard enumerated by the officer of the Court, the property of the Countess of Berghausen; and, Gentlemen, it must be confessed that the Countess has acted very imprudently in this business; in order to explain which I must trouble you with a short part of the countess's history: Gentlemen, this lady married the Reverend Mr. Henley, who, some time after after their marriage, unfortunately became a lunatic; after which the prisoner Loy, alias Molloy, who represented himself to be a major in the Irish volunteers, got acquainted with the countess, and took every opportunity to ingratiate himself into her favour; and they lived some time together as husband and wife; he told her he was a gentleman of rank and family, and had a high station in India, and wished her to accompany him thither, which she consented to, after some persuasion, but upon condition that he would sign an instrument in ten thousand pounds penaltry; binding himself to treat her in all respects in every sense of the word, as the fond, tender, and affectionate wife of his heart; the phrase in the instrument, which I will repeat; is the fond, tender, and affectionate wife of his heart; and he was to treat her in every respect in a manner due to her exalted rank and station: this bond was executed, and they soon set sail for India, and although she always supplied him with cash, yet as soon as he got her on board, he treated her most brutally: after they arrived at India, they lived together for some time, but his treatment was such, she was obliged to separate from him: after living some time time apart, he again renewed his addresses to the countess, and prevailed on her to return to him: after some time, Gentlemen, he represented to her, that he had received advices from England that her husband was dead, and that it was fit they should come to England, which they accordingly did; and he then expected that of course she would then make him her husband; but this, in consequence of his repeated ill treatment of her, she was not very disposed to do: however, she after some time consented; when they arrived in London, they took a house and servants; and then the major who had, as it appears, kept up a criminal correspondence with the other prisoner Goldsborough, introduced her to the countess as his cousin; he had before talked of her as his cousin, who had lived in the family of Sir

            , where the other prisoner Payne was a footman: Gentlemen, on the last day of the last year, the countess was prevailed upon to go out of town to a relation at Norwich, and the major and she went in their own carriage; but very soon after they set out, Mr. Molloy thought it more agreeable to ride on horseback, and took an opportunity of examining the mind of the prisoner Payne, to know whether him and the other servants had any disinclination to a new mistress; he found Payne a proper tool for his purpose: Gentlemen, when they came to Norwich, he used her so ill, that she suspected he had some design against her life; they separated and came to London; and at Ingatestone Mr. Molloy proposed that the countess should come to town in a stage coach that was passing; she consented, a place was taken, and she got into it; he was to have come on horseback, but he got into another stage coach, and took all her luggage out of the coach, and put it into his own; he told the countess, that as they probably should be very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130100"/>late in London, it would be better to sleep at the inn where the stage coach should stop; she made no objection, in this way they arrived in London, when she came to London, the countess from discovering that her luggage had been gone, was alarmed; she went to her own house; when she came there, she learned, that the circumstance I am now about to state to you, had taken place on the last day of the old year: and major having written a letter to Goldsborough, under the name of Miffin, she and Payne went to the countess's house: Mrs. Goldsborough was described as the cousin of Mr. Molloy; she said, she came there to take care of the house; and the other prisoner was to take care of her; the very first thing she did, as she told a woman that was there, that she wanted to look into the rooms; that person, whose name was Mrs. Rich, told her, she believed she could not do that, for they were locked; says she, I have a key that will open them; in which was all this property; she took some trifling articles out; some sweet meats, and a bottle of brandy, and carried them down stairs: in the course of the evening she brought down a couple of silver tea urns, and shewed them to the servants; nothing else particular passed: the prisoner Payne went out; Mrs. Goldsborough proposed that there should be a candle left for him; and that he should have the key of the street door; what the object of that was, did not appear; but nothing was done then; the fact was not perpetrated till the next day. In the course of the evening Mrs. Goldsborough said, the servants might go out, as it was New Year's Day; and in the morning they went out, glad of a holiday; upon which Mrs. Goldsborough sent Payne for a cart, and all those articles, with several large trunks, were immediately packed up into the cart, by Payne and Goldsborough, and carried to an inn, at Snow-hill; this appeared to a neighbour to be a very extraordinary proceeding; he had not seen these two people there; and it struck him as a remarkable circumstance; in consequence of which he did what was extremely proper, he followed the cart to Snow-hill; it was accompanied by the two prisoners; when they came to Snow-hill he left them: they went there and entered this property into the warehouse, with directions to send it to Milford Haven, the next day; it was directed to Mrs. Miffin, at Milford Haven; and the prisoner Goldsborough took a place for herself in the waggon, by the name of Miffin; they continued there till the next day, when the landlord went there to stop the progress of these goods, for his rent; when he came there Mrs. Goldsborough, without much hesitation, paid him the rent, in the name of Mrs. Moffatt: in consequence of this, information was given at the publick office, in Poland-street; and some of the officers belonging to that office went to Snow-hill, where they found these two prisoners, Molloy and Goldsborough, in bed together, waiting to take their journey, with all these articles. When these people were searched, in the pocket of Mrs. Goldsborough were found bank notes, to the value of two hundred and ten pounds; which she said were given her by her cousin Molloy; and the prisoners said, they were all going to Ireland. Gentleman, at present I have not stated to you any material circumstance, by which you may connect Mr. Molloy as an accessary before the fact; but previous to his going out of London, on the very day before, he went to the lodgings of the prisoner Goldsborough, and gave her written instructions how to proceed; these instructions are in court, and will be produced to you gentlemen; in them he says,</p>
               <p>"my love, take the two new trunks, and separate every thing of mine from her's; and every thing you think I have bought; every thing of muslin and callico, you know is mine: take all my new shirts, and as many dozen towels and handkerchiefs as you please, and all the plate, but one spoon and fork; for it will be all your's; and I hope in God, will make you and me happy for life; I shall write to you, Mrs. Moffatt, Milford Haven;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130101"/>and you write to me, to be left at the post office, Norwich." Gentlemen, I am perfectly well aware that my lord sitting here, in a court of criminal jurisdiction, will not try whether there is a civil right existing in Mr. Molloy, to part of this property; nor can I say whether the countess will contend it with him; I can only prove that here is a clear palpable felony committed; that it is a felony, about which there is no dispute, if these things were not Mr. Molloy's property; but if Mr. Molloy had a right to this property, undoubtedly I cannot expect that other persons who remove it, by his order, should be found guilty of felony, by your verdict; but if you find a general order given to the prisoner Goldsborough, from Mr. Molloy to do as she pleased; if you find this man availing himself of the improper and immoral confidence placed in him by the countess; if you find the prisoners Goldsborough and Payne, changing their names, not like persons supposing they possessed a right, but like persons committing a felony, in that case, gentlemen, you will consider all these circumstances which will be fit for you to attend to, under the directions of the Court. Gentlemen, it has been said that these articles are the property of Mr. Molloy; if there is a spark of evidence of that sort, I am sure for one, I shall not press the prosecution; but if I can satisfy you that for a great while past, Mr. Molloy has had nothing to live on but the wages of his prostitution; and if respecting this woman, I can shew you that he regularly received her annuity; If I can shew you that she entered into engagements in India, for purchases which Molloy as her agent, had purchased for her; if I shew this was all her property, you will attentively consider the case. Gentlemen, I freely admit that it is not an idle assertion of claim to property, that will shield a man against a prosecution for a felony; but wherever there is a clear undoubted right, it ought not to be tried in this shape. Gentlemen, it does not occur to me that there is any circumstance that I have not stated. I shall call the witnesses, and then you will dispose of the prisoners as you shall see proper.</p>
               <p>Court. Here are three prisoners. Molloy is indicted only as accessary before the fact; the other two as principals; their cases must be considered first, whether guilty or not: now the orders were -</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow to Blacketer. Give me the letter which was found on the person of Goldsborough.</p>
               <p>(Delivered into Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. The case must depend on this letter; for unless it can be made appear that the prisoner Goldborough was guilty of a felony, they must be all acquitted; therefore, take it by steps: first of all the case is, that this woman, the prosecutrix, and the prisoner Molloy had lived together on very improper terms for a long time; there was at least a mixture of their property: but in order to constitute felony to this woman, you must shew that she expressly and explicitly knew that the articles she took were the property of the prosecutrix, and not of Molloy: the letter does not import that; but on the contrary, it imports to her that all the property that was there, belonged to Molloy; now, no matter whether true or false, if she acted under that idea: the letter directs her to separate every thing of his; and when you come to the general direction, it is, they are my goods, I have a right to take them; I shall leave her a spoon and a fork, but as to the other articles, they are your's; it looks not favourable certainly to the prisoner Molloy in a moral light, because he was acting in a very disgraceful manner; but that we have nothing to do with in this indictment for felony; therefore, I cannot say in this evidence, that I can tell the jury they have a ground for felony; the property you have got again; I am glad of it, for I think it is a very disgraceful business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I am desired to state, that I shall be able to prove that this woman, Goldsborough, had lived in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130102"/>the service of the countess, and therefore, as far as there might be in point of legal construction, a mixture of property, she knew which was the countess's: then I submit, whether the general order, together with his own phrase,</p>
               <p>"Take what you</p>
               <p>"like," compared with the conduct of this woman and Molloy writing one to another, and sending the servants out of the way, and being found at the inn waiting to pursue their journey with these things, might not be a ground to leave the case to a jury; however, if in the end, there is a strong opinion in the mind of the Court, that this case cannot be made out, it will not become me to press it any further.</p>
               <p>Court. It is so strong a one, that I cannot find what to leave to the jury; for however improper their conduct, I must state something which really amounts to a felony; and I cannot on this state of the case, say it amounts to a felony, though it is a most cruel thing to attempt to get the property away.</p>

After I had been in Berkshire three or four weeks I wrote to town for the old harness, and it did not come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. It will be very material for us to ascertain dates a little. I believe this man lived in your service about eight months? - I cannot pretend to say, he may or he may not; I do not recollect the time at all that he lived in my service.</p>
               <p>Does not your recollection go to more then half a year? - Upon my word I cannot say; I totally forget.</p>
               <p>Since you have kept a carriage, have you had many coachmen? - I have.</p>
               <p>I believe he was taken into custody for this charge, in December, 1789? - It was, Sir.</p>
               <p>I believe you was present at the time he was apprehended? - I was.</p>
               <p>You was present when he was taken off a horse at Windsor? - I was.</p>
               <p>In whose service was he at that time? - In Mr. Cibber's.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether he went from your service immediately to Mr. Cibber's? - He did.</p>
               <p>I believe the new harness had been made three months before this man had quitted your service? - I believe it was made a considerable time; and they were both in use a considerable time; it may be one, two, three, or four months.</p>
               <p>But which should you venture to say, one or three? - I certainly would not venture either; I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Then I must trouble you to take time to recollect, whether for three months the new harness had been in continual use: do you believe it was above three months? - I am willing to allow it might be two or three months.</p>
               <p>I believe at the time you parted you was in considerable displeasure with this man? - I was.</p>
               <p>How soon after August was it that you received information that your harness was not forthcoming? - I cannot tell; it might be a considerable time.</p>
               <p>I have not the good fortune to understand what you mean by considerable? - It might be a month, or five weeks, or less, or more, after the 12th of August: I had not a thought but what it was there.</p>
               <p>So that there was a considerable interval between the time you had missed the harness, and the time of his apprehension at Windsor, in the service of Mr. Cibber? - There was.</p>
               <p>Was there any device on your harness? - There was my crest.</p>
               <p>May I crave the name of your harness maker? - The man that made it, his name is Froome: the man's name that made the new harness was Hutchins.</p>
               <p>Was the same device on the new as the old? - Yes, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. M'Neal ever employed by you? - Yes, he was; but never about harnesses; he is a coach maker, occasionally employed by me.</p>
               <p>I believe your old harness was in the end found in the custody of M'Neal? - It was, I believe; it is now sent abroad, I understand.</p>
               <p>When this coachman was engaged, did you make a bargain with him? - I did of course.</p>
               <p>Does it happen to you, among the coachmen you have employed, to recollect the terms of that bargain? - Perfectly.</p>
               <p>I will trouble you to state them: I believe at first he asked twenty six guineas? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130104"/>This will be very important; I must trouble you to tax your recollection; I believe in the end, the standing wages agreed on, was twenty two guineas, together with other articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One guinea for boots? - My memory does not serve me.</p>
               <p>One guinea for breeches; does your memory serve you to that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he was to have the old wheels, in order to make up this sum? - I perfectly recollect he was not to have them; I never allowed either old wheels or old harnesses to any coachman; I do not remember that any thing was said about it.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about the old harness? - Nothing to my recollection; I can venture to say, to the best of my recollection, upon oath, that nothing was said; I mean to swear that if any thing was said, that I never agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Explain to me what these articles were that were to make up the twenty-two guineas, to be twenty-six guineas? - I believe I gave him twenty-five guineas a year, to the best of my recollection; I do not keep such a very minute recollection.</p>
               <p>I must not compliment away a man's liberty? - I think it was twenty-five guineas a year.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you, the agreement was twenty-two guineas a year wages; what other agreement did you make besides? - I believe there were boots and breeches, and a number of et cetera's which the coachmen generally have, but I will not say on my oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Pray do not be in a hurry, Mr. Crespigny, the boots and breeches we know all the world over, are two guineas; and the old wheels, though they cost us eight pounds, sell for one? - I know nothing about the old wheels; I never made any agreement for them.</p>
               <p>Did your former coachman account for the old wheels? - No, never: I believe they were the first wheels I had ever wore out.</p>
               <p>I believe you wrote a letter to the prisoner from Bath? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you tell us the date of that letter? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Or about what time it was? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>How long was it before this apprehension? - Oh! it was a considerable time.</p>
               <p>I do not get a bit further, by the word considerable, do you mean several days, or several weeks, or several months? - I mean two, three, four, five, or six weeks.</p>
               <p>You believe six weeks? - I do not believe six weeks.</p>
               <p>I believe you stated to him, that in case he did not return these things, you agreed to prosecute him? - I certainly did, but I did not know the nature of the offence at the time I wrote that letter.</p>
               <p>However such a letter conveying at least to him, an intimation of that kind was written? - I certainly wrote something to him; I can have no objection to the letter being read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have the very words stated in my brief; however, the import of it was, that if he did not return the harness, he should be prosecuted:</p>
               <p>"I find</p>
               <p>"you have under pretence of my giving it</p>
               <p>"to you, taken away the plated harness</p>
               <p>"out of my stable; in case you do not</p>
               <p>"return it, I shall give orders to my attorney</p>
               <p>"to prosecute you for the same." - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe that was previous to the application, made by your attorneys, Messrs. Wallis and Troward? - I do not know of such application; I did not authorize them; I authorized them to do what was right in the business.</p>
               <p>Have you happened to be in your carriage on some nights, when the old carriage was used, and broke, at the theatre for instance? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether your lady had forbid the use of it in future, and desired that the new should be always used? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was lady Sarah with you on any of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130105"/>these occasions? - I remember there was an accident happened one time.</p>
               <p>Upon this man being discharged, did he, by your desire, deliver you an inventory of the things in the stable? - He did.</p>
               <p>Have you that inventory here? - I certainly have not, for in fact, I did not read it.</p>
               <p>Do you, or do you not know, whether this old plated harness was, or was not included in that inventory? - I certainly do not know, because to the best of my recollection I never read the inventory.</p>
               <p>I believe there were some glasses that were included in it? - I do not know; I believe he delivered on my account the coach-box, or something of that kind before the time he left me.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you paid him, did not he give you any account then? - I had advanced him wages occasionally, or paid either a month or five weeks wages; I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you no receipt from him? - I had a receipt for six or seven pounds, which was all the wages then due to him, and which was in full of all demands.</p>
               <p>Have you that receipt here? - No, I have not; I have it not even in town; I am sure I did not pay him more than twenty-five guineas, that was the precise sum I paid him; I only recollect that from a number of &amp;c's. it came to twenty-five guineas a year.</p>
               <p>But then there was three guineas more than the wages; it therefore must have included something over and above the wages? - Of course it must have been for something or other which induced me to give him the money; I am sure it was not relative to the present question; I paid him twenty-five guineas a year, and he found his own boots and breeches, and was to make no extra charge to me.</p>
               <p>In whose care was the old stables left in town? - In the care of nobody.</p>
               <p>Was this harness laid by as unserviceable? - I understood it was forthcoming when I called for it; I knew it was perfectly useful; it might want repair; I recollect a trifling accident that happened to it, of no consequence whatever, which I suppose detained me about five minutes.</p>

               <p>I am butler to Mr. Crespigny; the prisoner made a complaint to me on the day he left Mr. Crespigny's service, which was in London, to the best of my recollection, that Mr. Crespigny had used him ill, as he would not give him the old harness; by reason, he should work it in the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that in the morning before he went to Peckham? - I think it was; I will not be sure, but I think it was.</p>
               <p>How soon did you mention this to Mr. Crespigny? - After he missed the harness.</p>
               <p>You did not take any particular notice of it at the time? - No, I heard he went to live at Mr. Cibber's some time, for a week or a month; then at Mr. Sibbal's, he continued living in the character of coachman, till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Then you understood from the prisoner that he was asserting a right to this harness; that is, that he claimed it as a perquisite? - Yes, I understood it so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. That was after your master and the prisoner disagreed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And after his time was over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He staid over the time as your master could not get a coachman? was not he complaining of this as a breach of promise in your master? - He seemed to speak of it as his own property.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coach-maker in Margaret-street, Cavendish square, some time between the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130106"/>12th and 20th, or about the 20th of August, the prisoner came to my shop; I was at home, he told me to send for the coach box, hammer cloth and footman's cushion, and that the harness was his; he asked me if I would buy the harness, which he deemed was his property: I had worked for Mr. Crespigny before, upon which I told him that the harness was in a very indifferent state, and would require a new plate and furniture, as the silver was worn off the pieces; (I knew the harness though I did not see it then,) and that it would not be in my power to buy the harness at such a price as a hackney-man would give, or those it would suit; therefore I told him to send it to my shop, and that I would let him know from time to time what people offered for the harness; the harness came the next day to the best of my remembrance; my labourer brought the aforesaid things; the coachbox, and the harness also; the things were at my shop a few days; I had not seen the prisoner till a guinea and a half was bid, which was in the course of a few days; I thought that was not the value, and therefore did not send to the coachman; he did not know their worth; then two guineas were offered the next day, or perhaps the same day; and after that there was two guineas and a half bid; which if they were my own, I would have sold them for; I was so engaged in business that I omitted to acquaint the coachman of the offer, and the same evening, the same person that offered the two guineas and a half, and said he had particular occasion for such a harness, that if the person to whom they belonged would take three guineas, he would have it, if he would pay for putting on new plates: on the 4th of September I saw the coachman, and told him that if it suited I would put on the plates gratis, and he should have the three guineas to himself; the prisoner said, he was going to his place and wished me to give him the three guineas; this was on a Saturday, and having use for money, I wished him to defer it till Monday; the prisoner said the sum was so trivial, it would make little difference to me, and I paid him the three guineas, and the person sent for the harness three or four days after; this harness belonged to Mr. Crespigny; I knew it from the crest, and I had mended it several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The harness had the crest upon it, as it had been used to have when it was brought to you to mend? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was of opinion he might have got more by selling it to hackney-coachmen, than by bringing it to his master's coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it was full three weeks in your possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Hanging up in the public shop, inviting the inspection of every body? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With the crest upon it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner talked of it as his own property, having become so by a perquisite? - Intirely so.</p>
               <p>Do a great many gentlemen give their servants their old wheels and harnesses which they send to the coachmaker's? - They do: I had every reason to believe it was his, from another circumstance. Some time before, Mr. Crespigny ordered me to put a new lining in his phaeton, which I did, and the coachman had the old lining, and there was no fault found: I did not account for it; we never do: that which was his master's, he told me to keep for his master, and to keep it dry.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Crespigny. Had you ever made any agreement about the harness? - I never made any agreement.</p>
               <p>Had you ever in point of fact, any harness worn out before? - No.</p>

             and Mr. Crespigny, that I was fearful -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That I object to.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not evidence? - I know the circumstance from the man's wife coming -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. What the prisoner's wife said, is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130107"/>not evidence? - The prisoner came to me; I cannot ascertain the day exactly; but from little family circumstances, I make it out to be quite the latter end of October, or the beginning of November. I never was the servant to Mr. Crespigny. My husband was employed as a kind of agent for Mr. Crespigny, to transact some business relative to the letting a house: the man came to my husband to make up the business: I was at home: my husband was out: I was at dinner: from intoxication, his discourse was so incoherent and abusive, I cannot relate it; speaking of Mr. Crespigny and the family in a very high degree. The most material thing he said, after saying a great deal against Mr. Crespigny, the result was, that if we would let Mr. Crespigny know, if he would take two guineas, which the harness was sold for, he would send it him: I then told him his wife had been frequently at our house, and she offered three guineas? his answer to that was, that they sold for that, and it was more than they were worth; and they were bought by a person who was very eager to have them, going into the country. One thing I perfectly understood, that he said, if he lived with Mr. Crespigny again, he would cheat him every minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When did you think this incoherent discourse of the drunken coachman, important enough to repeat first? - I perfectly recollect it.</p>
               <p>Among the rest of the abuse, perhaps he accused Mr. Crespigny of keeping back from him that which was his for perquisites? - He mentioned the harness in the course of the conversation: that he looked upon it as much his right as his wages.</p>
               <p>A part of his abuse of Mr. Crespigny, was the keeping back from him, that which was as much his right as his wages? - Yes, if you call it abuse.</p>
               <p>Was not a good deal of his conversation directed to that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I shall call no witnesses in such a case; and I advise the coachman to say nothing.</p>
               <p>Court. The only question is, whether this is a trespass or a felony; and I state it so, that it may not go abroad, that if you acquit the prisoner, that he has obtained the harness as his own property: it is by no means to be understood that servants have a civil right to lay hold of the property of their masters and keep it as wages.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday last, the 6th of January, I was in the City at the Jamaica coffee-house, and dined with some gentlemen, and drank too freely: a woman followed me, and asked me to give her a glass of wine: by and by I fell in with two men and a woman, and this woman began to abuse me; then the two men and women immediately attacked me; neither of those women are the prisoner: I got away from them, and was determined to get into the first public-house: I was going to my lodgings, and the corner of this lane I met with the prisoner. I was very drunk at that time. She conducted me to a house, and followed me into a room in that house. I sat down on a chair, and fell asleep: I have no recollection till I awaked: then I missed my money; on missing it, I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and insisted she had taken it from me. The master of the house came in; I laid hold of him, and called out for the watch. When I awaked, this woman was in the room then. A number of other women came in, and all laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130108"/>hold of me; and I got several blows; I called out murder! and made a great many other noises. The constable searched the prisoner, and has some money: I only swear to the purse. When I entered the house, there was in the purse seventeen guineas and a half; it is a netted purse; I cut off the tassels as there was a hole at each end, and I tied a knot at each end.</p>

               <p>When did you last see your purse? - At the Stock Exchange coffee-house, about nine or ten; then there were sixteen whole guineas, and two half guineas, and some shillings: I counted my money at the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This was on twelfth night? - I believe it was; it was the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>At the pastry cook's there was a great crowd? - No, Sir, it was eleven before I came past there: I will not swear that; but I do not think I could have been in the house at ten.</p>
               <p>This woman conducted you to this house on your application? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went, I suppose, arm in arm: are you sure she is the woman that went in with you? - I am sure that is the woman.</p>
               <p>You never had any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you at all jostled or hustled about by the people in Fleet-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Much? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>It was in Fleet-street that you was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No, never had.</p>
               <p>When you awoke, this woman was in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And when the watchman came, he did not give you that assistance you expected: you talked of sending for my lord mayor and Sir Sampson Wright? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you the next day desire this woman to go about her business, and offer ten pounds to have nothing more to do with it? - No, Sir; no part of that is true; I said I had lost a considerable sum of money, and that I did not wish to be detained in town, as I understood she would be committed to Newgate; then a bill of indictment was to be found, and all this would be attended with a vast deal of expence; and I thought if I had the money that was saved, the ten guineas and a half returned, I would let the woman go.</p>
               <p>She is now indicted, you understand, for a capital offence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, as you are sober, I will thank you to tell me whether this is your signature? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is what you signed and swore to the next day before the magistrate? - That is the evidence I gave there.</p>

               <p>"of people; that he ran into</p>
               <p>"a house in the neighbourhood for protection,</p>
               <p>"which house he is since informed</p>
               <p>"is No. 2, Great Shire-lane; that to the</p>
               <p>"best of his recollection, the next morning,</p>
               <p>"the prisoner Bethia Atkinson followed</p>
               <p>"him in; and when in the room</p>
               <p>"in that house, he thinks she took out of</p>
               <p>"his breeches pocket, the purse now produced,</p>
               <p>"which is his property; it then</p>
               <p>"contained to the amount of sixteen guineas</p>
               <p>"in gold, and some silver."</p>
               <p>Is that your deposition? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, after having sworn in that deposition the next morning, that you believed to the best of your recollection, the woman was the person; how came you to have any doubt about it? - I have stated the same just now.</p>
               <p>No, you have not, you answered you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130109"/>never had any doubt about it? - That is the woman, to the best of my recollection; I cannot speak only to the best of my recollection; I swear positively, as far as I can swear, that is, to the best of my recollection; as far as I can recollect a person's face.</p>
               <p>As far as you, who was mortally drunk, can conceive, you think that is the woman? - I mean that is the woman that followed me into the house, and was in the room the next morning; in drawing up that deposition, that is just merely playing upon words.</p>
               <p>Now was you sure it was a pastry cook's shop, with all its illuminations? - It is what I call a cake house; I believe it was a cake house.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now, that there was no crowd at this cake house; you said before the justice, it was an assemblage of people? - I recollect the gentlemen asked me if I was struck; I told them no, I was pushed a good deal; they asked me if I received any blows; that is what I call jostling, as I conceived, with a view to take away my purse.</p>
               <p>Now drunk, as you was, will you venture to swear that you ever felt your purse, after you went through that jostling? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner did not ask you for wine? - No: I firmly believe the jostling was done with that view.</p>
               <p>What are you by profession? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>What, a man of fortune? - I have hitherto lived on my fortune, and I fancy I can live on it a little longer; I live at present at Godalmin, in Surry; I do not keep a house there just now; I have never kept a house in England: my wife lodges at Godalmin now, at the house of Mr. Payne. I went from England to Jamaica, in April, 1782; and I landed at Falmouth about ten weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Where was your residence in town that night? - I came from Godalmin the preceding night, and lodged at the Angel inn, and was to have lodged there that night.</p>
               <p>Court. You say in this deposition that you think she took the money out of your breeches pocket; what do you mean by that? - By saying that, I say, I suppose it must be her; and I do not think it could be any body else; and by the purse being found upon her; and I think by her being in the room, and the money and the purse found on her afterwards: I did not see her do it, nor do I know she did.</p>

               <p>I live in Shire-lane. About half past eleven on Twelfth night, the prosecutor came to our house and called for a bottle of wine, sat down in the parlour by the fire side; the gentleman fell asleep by the fire side, leaning against the prisoner who sat next to him; and in a quarter of an hour he awoke, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be very drunk when he came in? - Yes, he got up and went into the yard to the privy, and staid a considerable time; the woman went to him; they came in again, and the gentleman said he wanted the watch; I asked him if he had lost any thing; he called watch! several times, he gave me no answer; there was nobody in his company but the woman; I sent for the watchman and he came; then he said the prisoner had robbed him; after he awoke he appeared more collected than before; while I sent for the watchman he two or three times desired the woman to go, and opened the door and bid her go, but she hung about him crying; the watchman was going to take her to the watch-house; I told him it would be more prudent to search her first, which he did, and he took out of her pocket ten guineas and a half, and a halfpenny, and a purse.</p>
               <p>Was the money in the purse? - No, it was not; it was in her pocket; the watchman put the purse and money in his breeches pocket, separate as he found it; I did not go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130110"/>Mr. Garrow. I believe the room you was sitting in, is very near to that in which this gentleman was? - Very near, an adjoining room</p>
               <p>In that room you and your wife, and three young ladies were sitting? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard no disturbance or quarrel between these people? - No, we never suffer that.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are a set of regular formal questions that you put, and when they are answered you are satisfied? - We do not know whether they know one another or not; and therefore we always ask the gentleman if he has lost any thing.</p>
               <p>The gentleman pressed her to go away about her business, and she would not go? - No, she hung about him and cried.</p>
               <p>He has told us that he had slept from eleven, till betwixt twelve and one? - It was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge, it was not quite twelve when he went into the yard; I always shut my house up at twelve.</p>
               <p>What is your's, a tavern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A licenced tavern? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where are you licenced? - A wine licence.</p>
               <p>How long have you kept it? - About eight months.</p>
               <p>Now the next day, did you see these two people together? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he wanted to get rid of the woman, and make an end of this prosecution? - No, I never saw them after that night.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner, drunk or sober? - Very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Bradley, did it ever happen to you in your life, to have any body run into your house for protection? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>And I dare say, if you should live to be a thousand years old, it never would occur again? - I cannot say; they might have got drunk together before they came there.</p>

            , which charges him with the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury; and it is certainly not necessary for me at this time of day, to make to you any observations on the nature of this offence, we all know and feel it; the observation has been often made, and as often assented to, that unless this crime is suppressed by severe punishment, it is impossible any thing we enjoy can be sacred. Gentlemen, I shall state to you some of the leading circumstances of this case; the defendant is by business a shoe-maker, he was in the situation of journeyman clicker to the prosecutor, who keeps a large shoe warehouse, in Bell yard, Temple-bar; he married a relation of Mr. Yarrel, his sister I think, and he advanced him a sum of money: one cannot help being extremely sorry, that between relations like these, disputes of a civil nature should exist, and it certainly increases one's anxiety, that such a person should be under the necessity of prosecuting such a relation, and exposing him to an infamous judgment; but if people will contrive the ruin of those who have protected them; the consequence must take place, and you and I must do our duty.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you state these to be brothers? - I state them to be brothers in la</p>
               <p>Court. Has this action of trover been tried? - No, it has been non-prossed.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not it possible that in an action of civil right not tried, that this can be accommodated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. All that has been very properly done out of Court, and I can appeal even to Mr. Silvester, whether I have not gone even half way to effect it.</p>

               <p>Court. I am sure it will be the recommendation of the Court, and I am sure the Jury will join in that recommendation that it should be settled: surely, it will be much more proper to all parties; for if it should end in a conviction, the conviction of one is such a disgrace to the family, that one would think a man would sooner, even if satisfied of the fact, consent to its being settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If the parties will make an intire end of litigation, but if we are only to stop here, it will answer no purpose. My Lord, as this has been, I think, very improperly the subject of agitation before you, it becomes my duty to inform you why I do not consent to the proposal; I would have abstained from saying any thing about attempts and compromises elsewhere; they ought to be always in their nature, and they generally are, sacred and secret; and ought never to be mentioned in the face of a public court of justice: if they can be settled out of court, it is good and well. Gentlemen, it may seem strange that the proposal made by the counsel on the other side, and made with considerable address, and which has at least a pleasurableness about it which might recommend it, should not be acceded to by me. Says Mr. Silvester, on the part of Mr. Yarrell, it is insisted there is a sum of money due: the defendants say there is not; now, says he, go before an arbitrator: why, gentlemen, I should betray my client, Mr. Yarrell, if I was to agree to this; because it would be permitting this man, whom I undertake to prove guilty of perjury, to go discharged from the effects of a conviction, and have no verdict passed against him, but to be at liberty to tell the same false tale again before an arbitrator, to substantiate his demand: for my client I am ready to do this; they are related; it is a pity they should tear one another to pieces in a court of law: it is better to make an end of it. Now see whether my proposal is not quite as fair as that made on the other side: we have protected you: we have given you the means of having any property to claim: we have put you into trade because you have married our sister; therefore, now give and take; execute general releases, or else we must go on: and I tell you now, gentlemen, if you have any doubt about the case; if this gentleman who chuses to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130116"/>on at the hazard of conviction; for I do not put it upon a balance or a nicety; if you do not feel, and are not convinced that the defendant knew perfectly that there was not a guinea due, and that the whole was a fabrication and falseshood, I am content you should acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury. The accounts should have been inspected by their friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am told that I shall be able to prove to you that they were so inspected, and nothing was due. Gentlemen, the assignment for perjury is upon this affidavit: he swears that

             of Butcher-row, Temple-bar, Middlesex, shoe-maker, did on the 2d of July last, unlawfully take divers goods and chattles of the property of this deponent, of the value of two hundred pounds, and upwards, and convert them to his own use; and for which he is indebted to this deponent: the assignment is, that in truth and in fact, Yarrell had not taken divers goods and chattles, and for which Yarrell was not indebted to him: the issue therefore is, whether on the 2d of July, Yarrell had unlawfully taken and converted to his own use, the goods of this man, for which he was, and is indebted. Gentlemen, it is a very unusual proceeding in an action of trover, as this is, to hold a man to bail, and make an affidavit of debt in the first instance; it is a very uncommon proceeding: however, in this case he thought it convenient to make such an affidavit. The circumstances on which these goods were taken, were these: Mr. Candeline being, as I observed to you, a journeyman shoe-maker, and having no property of his own, married a sister of Mr. Yarrell; and he set him up in business, and gave him the means of going on: Candeline gave him a bill of sale, that if Candeline should pay him the sum of thirty pounds on the 4th of each and every month, till fully satisfied, then judgment not to be executed; but in default, then the judgment was to be entered up for the whole, or such part as was unpaid. Gentlemen, it was for some considerable time that these parties went on together amicably; and the execution of the bill of sale was suspended; at length, Yarrell having reason to suspect that Candeline was going back, and having clear right to take his own property, did execute this bill of sale, and took possession of these goods; and after he had so taken possession, this man has sworn that they were unlawfully converted by Yarrell to his own use. Gentlemen, I shall be able to prove to you, that at the time of executing this warrant of attorney, Candeline knew that he had a clear and a distinct right to enter up these securities that had been given to him for the purpose of being entered up; and that he had not converted them to his own use; and that the execution was perfectly legal. Even now, after stating this case, I shall have no objection to do what is right: if the jury will take the trouble of settling that account between them, I shall be content.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was not through fear I offered this; but seeing they were brothers, I interfered before I read my brief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Yarrell. If Mr. Shelton will take the trouble of it, there is not a better man in the king's dominions; if he reports there is nothing due from you to Candeline, in that case, there is to be an end to all matters in difference?</p>
               <p>Mr. Yarrell. I am sure I shall be clear in my accounts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Yarrell. Are you ready to do that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then Mr. Shelton is to examine all the accounts, and every thing he thinks necessary between these parties; and that if he shall find there is any thing due to these parties, of course that is to be paid; and if not, he is to order the parties to execute a general release.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130117"/>233. WALTER GAGE was indicted for wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
               <p>The case opened by Mr. Knowles as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please you Mr. Recorder, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. This likewise is an indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury, made by the defendant, in the Marshalsea Court, to hold the prosecutor to bail; in this case you will have none of those difficulties arising from family connections; but it will be a case in which, if the evidence comes home, to bring the defendant's guilt to him, you will be ready to convict, and make an example of men, who are always eager enough to take advantage of the distress of others. The defendant is a Bailiff of the Marshalsea Court: the prosecutor is a young Gentleman of some fortune; he had been imprudent enough to run up a bill with a Mr. Thornton, who keeps Haddock's Bagnio, Covent Garden, in the sum of twenty pounds, seventeen shillings, and three-pence; he employed his attornies, Messrs. Field and Brown, to take out a process, in the Marshalsea Court, against the prosecutor; Gage, the defendant, was the officer employed to arrest Mr. Fyott, the prosecutor of this indictment; he arrested him as he was going into the Bedford Coffee-house, to dinner; Mr. Fyott had then eighteen guineas in his pocket; the debt and costs amounted only to twenty-three pounds odd; he said, I have eighteen guineas, give me credit for the rest; the officer received the eighteen guineas; he, himself, undertook to be responsible for the residue, which was about three pounds, eighteen shillings; the officer, Gage, the defendant, said, he would call on Mr. Fyott, in a few days afterwards, and receive the balance; Gage did call several times on the prosecutor; the prosecutor did not see him; and therefore he thought the readiest way would be to make this, some how or other, amount to a sum that he could hold him to bail, and arrest him for; he of course made the affidavit upon which he is now indicted; that the defendant was then indebted to him in ten pounds, and upwards; without which he could not have held him to bail: he arrested him at the New Hummums: the sum for which he arrested him, he said, was twelve pounds, odd; but he, out of great generosity (the generosity of a sheriff's officer is very remarkable) said, he would remit all but ten pounds, ten shillings: Mr. Fyott was taken at a nonplus; he was in this lodging, with a lady: if he meant to bail this, of course he must send for friends, and expose his situation; there was no other remedy, but to go to the spunging-house, to send for bail, or pay the money: Gentlemen, if a young man had any modesty at all, he would rather pay an extra sum that was not due, then account to his friends for such a situation: he took the latter remedy, he paid six guineas down, and he and the lady joined in a note for four guineas more: now I certainly have this difficulty to get over; this man has this confirmation of his account, that the prosecutor has, on a certain occasion, paid him part, and acknowledged that the rest is due; that is a standing obstacle to surmount; but I trust it will appear to this Court, that he paid that under fear and oppression, that it never was due, and that the defendant knew it, that the defendant took the advantage of his situation, to make him pay that money, and then he thought he was perfectly secure: gentlemen, I prove it this way; I have a witness I shall first of all produce to you, the attornies who proceeded against him on the original debt; I will prove to you, from a gentleman who saw the transaction, that he paid eighteen guineas to this man: now how is the residue to amount to ten pounds? why, gentlemen, I will prove to you that this man applied at the place where he found the prosecutor, desiring the waiter, and desiring the hair dresser, if he owed them any money, to make it over to him; and under this idea he has made the affidavit of it: I shall prove by another witness, that he has very recently before the arrest, applied to this gentleman for the balance, under four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130118"/>pounds: it will certainly throw this burden on Mr. Gage, to shew by what means this debt, which was originally under four pounds, came to this sum of ten pounds: though this young gentleman having been in imprudent connections, and being forced into the payment of a sum that was more than due, I am sure you will not suffer him to be injured in this way, nor this man to triumph in this case. I shall call my witnesses. If he does not give evidence to you, to satisfy you that he had a rational belief of that sort, you will take the fact of his having got the money from this gentleman, by this means, into your consideration; and consider whether he is not guilty of the charge in the indictment.</p>
