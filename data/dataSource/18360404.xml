                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, and live at No. 3, Wellington-street, Woolwich. On the 17th of March, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, as night, as near as I can judge—I saw the last person up in the house—I examined the doors and windows that night—they were all safe—the fastenings were all on, and the bolts right—the shop window is a projecting square window, about six feet long, fastened with a bar and two bolts at the end; and the door was fastened with two bolts and a lock—I was awoke about half-past one o'clock in the morning by the cracking of glass—I immediately got out of bed, and an to the shop door—my bed-room is on the ground floor, about seven yards from the window—when I got to the shop door, I heard the glass tricking as if it was outside the window—I put off the top bolt of the door, and heard some persons running from the door, from the outside, very quickly—I could not tell whether it was more than one person—At that mo<lb/>ment I gave an alarm, as loud as I possibly could, to the family up<lb/>stairs—my father and mother, and brother-in-law—I then unbolted the lower bolt, and unlocked the door—I went outside, and by the light of the gas-lamp, which was about thirty yards distant, on the other side of the way, I distinctly saw a quantity of glass immediately under the bar of the shop-window—there was a piece of gold among the glass—I took that up, and came inside again, and got a light—I saw nobody—when I came inside, I found the second pane in the window from the door, broken—it appeared as if it had been forced by some power from the outside—there are five shutters outside the glass, and a bar—the bar was sprung in a semicircular form—that bar was outside the window, and a hard shell was placed inside the shutter, between that and the lower rail of the win<lb/>dow—it was an ornamental shell for the mantel-piece—that kept the shut<lb/>ters out at the spring that they were at—there was about an inch aper<lb/>ture</p>

               <p>between the outside sill of the window and the inside of the shutter from that it appeared they bad forced the glass by some instrument—I can scarcely think an arm could have been got in, unless it was forced by some other arm to keep it out, unless the bar was more sprung to admit an arm, as the further the bar came, the shutters kept tighter, as there was none of the shutters down—I found a gold watch-chain was gone, a silver guard, with a silver slide to it; several brooches, among which was a coral one; and a stone brooch without a stem: a gilt ornament for the hair; a cornelian heart, with a gold loop; and other things—the value of the different thing gone was about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had seen these things the night before—they were quite safe in the window when I went to bed—in the inside, between the inside sash and the outside sash of the window—if they broke the window, and put any instrument in, they might reach them with the instrument—the chains laid on a piece of plate glass on two iron brackets, and above that the silver guard hung—it appeared as if an instrument had been put through and cut the silver guard in the centre, and pulled it out of the loops; and the piece of plate glass was split right in the centre for the chains to drop into the aperture; but two of the chains fortunately had dropped the other way, inside—there were several flint watch-glasses broken, and came down with the other things, falling into the aperture—I then went and dressed myself, and came out and gave information—I have seen some of the things since—I have got the two slides of the chain—I got them from Nathan Hart—they are mine—I know them—they are a particular manu<lb/>facture—I have not the slightest doubt about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Huntley Bacon, Esquire. of Bounds-green in the parish of Tottenham. I remember in March last, some sheep having been worried—James Scoot is a shepherd, in Mr. Bacon's employ—on Sunday morning, the 20th of March, I went out about eleven o'clock and went into a field called the Hilly Field—I observed five men at a short distance from Dampford Wood, as I stood in the Hilly Field—I did not know all the men at that time—I knew Page—I cannot say I knew any other exactly at that time, I did not see them distinctly enough—I made my way down to the wood, and saw two men run down the wood—as they were running away I said, "It is no use for you to attempt to run away, I am determined to have you"—I know Page was one of the two men—I could not see exactly who the other was, for the boughs, and one thing to the other—I had a gun with me—there are hares and rabbits is that wood, and I have seen them—it is a part of my employment to look after the preservation of those things—I noticed a dog running towards me, and I shot it directly after that I saw another dog, my gun was not loaded then, I could not shoot that—I said, "Look out, shepherd, and shoot that dog"—Scott</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040012"/>
               <p>was in the same field with me—in consequence of what I said he shot the dog directly—the dogs were what are called <hi rend="italic">lurchers</hi>, not grey-hounds exactly—the shepherd and I then went down the bottom of the field, over the hedge, towards Mr. Rhodes's ground, and there we saw the five men—I suppose they were all the same five men that I had first seen when I got into the field—Page was one of them, Charles Kitley was another—I cannot say exactly to be positive that I can swear to any other—when we saw these five men they began to <hi rend="italic">let out</hi> in a most violent manner, saying, "Shoot the b—b—"—they were standing towards me as I got to the end of the wood—they were on Mr. Rhodes's land then)—they went before me, face to my face—they stood at the bottom of Mr. Bacon's land, in Mr. Rhodes's fields—I should think I was about sixty or eighty yards from them when they used those expressions—Scoot was with me at that time—they then followed us—we turned back—seeing five against two. I said, "We must go back", and I went back with Scott, in a direction for home—I ran up the field, and they followed us—they ran for the space of, I suppose, four-score yards—I had reloaded my gun then, and the shepherd as well—went hey had pursued us for the space of about eighty yards, Kitley got over Mr. Rhodes's hedge, and ran towards us—there is no gate in that field—there are some bars—it is not a proper stile—they are bars to keep the stock asunder, because the quick of the hedge is bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the place where the prisoner got over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether he got over the bars or the hedge—I was running away from fear, and my back was towards him—it was not a great distance from that place that he got over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he ran towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—he pointed a gun a time or two—it appeared to me to be more at the shep<lb/>hered than me at that time—them, shortly after, he pointed it at me, and fired immediately—he fired at me—he had not pointed the gun at us more than two or three times—I thing not more that twice—I turned round to look at him at times—my face was towards this face when he fired—I did not see that Kitely had a gun when he first pursued us—I never pursued them—I think he was as near as fifty yards when he fired—I am quite certain that he gained upon me after he first ran after me, before he fired the gun, for I had to run up hill—when he fired, I heard the contents of the piece rattle over my head more like a hail storm than anything—the contents struck is the boughs at a considerable distance from where I stood at that time, being me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you afterwards see the makes where the contents struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never looked.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you Standing in the open ground, or among tress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was standing in open ground between trees—the tress were from ten to twelve, or not above fifteen yards from me—from ten to fifteen yards—at that distance I could hear the shots striking the tress above my head—If I had looked at the tress, I might possibly have ascertained how high above my head the shots had struck—I think it might he ascertained if there had been marks suffi<lb/>cient so that we could have seen them—there were no leaves on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040013"/>
               <p>tress—a shot coming at the distance of fifteen yards with such force as to be heard, might possibly make a mark on the bark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that shot scatters very considerably out of a gun at the distance of fifteen yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the piece a great deal—the musket I had would lay marks into a tree above fifteen yards off—shot scatters more at a long distance than a short one—I am not a game<lb/>keeper—I am connected with sporting—fifty or sixty. yards is a good dis<lb/>tance for a gun to kill, but it will do it—shot keeps compact for some dis<lb/>tance when discharged from a gun, and then it scatters—many shots are carried round a good distance before they scatter—it is a bad piece that will not carry forty yards, and then keep round—it is not for the advan<lb/>tage of the sportsman to scatter the shot—a sportsman would have a much better chance of killing a bird by the shot scattering, but he would not kill a hare in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now it the shot scatters at fifty or sixty yards, would not the boughs be struck as well as the trunk of the tree? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the tallness of the tress—these were large elm tress—they have branches or boughs—I will swear the shot did not go twenty yards above my head—I never ex<lb/>amined the tree—I was standing when the man fired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had the least notion of striking you, would he not have a much better chance of doing so by running up closer to you and then firing than at a distance of fifty or sixty yards, if he intended to hit you instead of frightening you by firing over your head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The reason he ran was to get near—he ran the distance of about fifty yards—he would not have had a better chance of hitting me if he had come within twenty yards—I should not have stood still—I made no indication to prevent his coming near me—the five men had one gun among them—I and the shepherd had a gun each—the shepherd was within three or five yards of me when the shot was fired—I thing he went to examined the trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure you heard the shots rattle against the trees at your back, when the man fired at you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain of it—a gun loaded with shot will wound seriously at fifty yards—many guns will kill at sixty, and some few at seventy yards—I heard the shots pass—if he was nearer to me he might have killed me—he gained on me by pursuing me through the field, before he level led the gun the third time, and shot at me—it was after the other man called out, "Shoot the man" that he shot—the shepherd did shoot directly after Kitley fired at me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you cannot say how high the trees were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can<lb/>not—they were very large elms—bigger round than my body some of them—the boughs were above my head—I do not suppose they were two yards above my head—some were lower and some higher—I suppose some of them were but a short distance off my head—some of them were in less than my hand's reach—the prisoner were standing on Mr. Rhodes's land when I first saw them—they were coming towards the wood, which is Mr. Bacon's property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you seek among the boughs for marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were little boughs opposite the trees which were not upon the tress—hedge boughs—I thought it useless to look among those little boughs for such things as that.</p>

               <p>o'clock that morning I was out with French in the neighbourhood of Damp ford-wood—I was about two hundred yards from French—when I got to the wood I heard him call out to me, and I directly went in the direction in which he was—a lurcher passed me, and I shot him—I did not see any men at the time—I went to the corner of the wood directly, and saw five men in Mr. Rhodes's filed, adjoining the wood—I knew page at the time, I saw him among the five—Kitley is anther of them—Kitley had a gun with him—on observing that there were five, French and I turned round, and they all made directly towards us—Mr. Bacon's field joins Mr. Rhodes's—we were in Mr. Bacon's field—we had not been in Mr. Rhodes's field—we were in Mr. Bacon's field when we saw the men—we turned round to go towards home, and all the five men followed us—they got over the hedge into Mr. Bacon's field—we ran a little, and they ran a little—they gained upon us—when they got into Mr. Bacon's field, they all cried out, "Shoot the b—b—s," and various words of that de<lb/>scription, and Kitley followed us up with the gun, running—he was nearer to us at last—he had run faster than his companions—he got within about fifty yards of us before he fired—I stopped to look round, and he pointed his piece at me twice—when he got within fifty yards of us he fired his piece at French by the sound of the shot—French was from three to five yards from me at the time—it was hilly ground—French had stopped be<lb/>fore he was shot at—there were elm trees before us as we ran—French turned round, before he was shot at, towards the men who were pursuing us—I distinctly heard something strike the trees—that satisfied me that the gun was loaded with missiles of some description—after Kitley shot, he turned round and ran away; and the I discharged my gun at him—I was not particular about the direction I shot in—it was more merely to frighten them—he might have got about ten yards when I shot at him—when he level led his gun at meat first, I; levelled my gun at him—I did not do so before he levelled his gun at me—my object in doing it was merely to deter him from coming near—I saw Kitley and Page in custody that even<lb/>ing—I do not know what Kitley is—I believe him to be a labourer—I know Benjamin Skinner.</p>

Q.</hi> I do not know whether you know one of these men was in the habit of killing little birds to stuff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—the men were on Mr. Rhodes's ground at first, and came on Mr. Bacon's field after us—it was within five minutes after we had shot their dogs that Kitley fired his gun—the gun I had was a common fowling-piece—the men had only one gun among them that I saw, and that gun was dis<lb/>charged—they had no time to load their gun again before I fired at them—my gun was loaded with powder and shot, I believe No, 5, shot, which is very small—partridge shot—that would kill a partridge thirty or forty yards off—I cannot say whether my gun would kill a bird at fifty or sixty yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am groom to Mr. Williams., of Wood-green, Tottenham. On the Sunday morning in question I was in Bound's-green-lane, a bout eleven o'clock—that is close to Mr. Bacon's ground—I heard a gun fired towards the wood—it appeared to be close to the wood—I saw five men run out of Dampford wood at first—Cartwright and page are two of the men—I do not know the others—they ran down the field, to<lb/>wards Mr. Rhodes's ground—they ran over Mr. Bacon's field into Mr. Rhodes's ground, adjoining it—they were followed by French and Scott—I went towards French and Scott—I saw them turn back, and these men</p>

               <p>made a halt, and then went after them—they made some oath, and then ran after them—I then heard a gun fired again—they were out of my sight then—I saw the five men—I could not see French and Scott, when I got where the men were—they were going through the wood at the end of the gateway, at the end of the wood through the gateway—they were dragging the two dogs—two had got each a dog, dragging them as they were dead, and one had a gun—one of them said, when I got near them, "Shoot the b—if he comes near us"—that was after I heard the shot fired.</p>

In consequence of what I heard, I went to Mr. Bacon's house at three o'clock on Sunday, and from what I learnt from French there I went in pursuit of Charles Kitley, in company with Fowler and another constable—I went after the whole of them, in fact—I found Kitley at eleven o'clock at night near the Green Man public-house, at Muswell-hill, in the parish of Hornsey—he was in the road, coming from the Green Man, and Page was in the path—I took Kitley into custody—I did not know him at that time—I asked his name, and he gave me the name of King)—I heard Fowler ask Page his name, and he also gave the name of King—I afterwards knew where Page's father lived, but did not know at that time—I took Cartwright into custody about one o'clock in the morning of the following day, at page's house, in a shed adjoining the dwellling-house, sleeping with his clothes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Benbow public-house, Golden-lane—I was barman there. On the 20th of March, the prosecutor came to the public-house from twenty minutes to half-past twelve o'clock—we shut up about half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night—he asked for a pint of beer—I served him with the porter—I saw the prisoner, Wm. Absolam—he asked Prior whether he would drink—Prior said he had beer of his own—then William Absolam said, "Will you give us a drop of yours?'—it was not said jeeringly at all—Prior said, "No, keep your own company"—he did not say that very sharply—then William Absolam pushed him down with his two hands violently, as if in resentment, not in play at all, but angrily, and Richard rolled on the top of him—he had not spoken to him—he fell right down on the top of him with force, so as to keep him down—the hands of both were directed towards the prosecutor's pocket; and when he got up, he said, "I have lost my money"—that was when the police<lb/>man had taken the prisoner off to the station-house&amp;—; directly he rose from the ground he said, "I have lost my money."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Crown-row, Mile End-road, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, On Saturday night, the 12th of March, at half-past eight o'clock, I was sitting at work in my shop—the window was broken—I heard it broken—it was suddenly done—I observed a head in the broken pane of glass—I am quite certain the pris<lb/>oner Smith is the person whose head came thought the pane—it was not large enough in admit the whole of his head through, but there was not a bit of glass as large as a shillings left in the square—my wife ran to the door first—I at first thought it was a person intoxicated, but Smith did not move, because he was well aware that we could not get out, for my wife first ran to the door, and found it fast—I went myself, and found it was fast<lb/>ened from the outside—I immediately pulled away my wife, and with the assistance of my wife and daughter, forced the door open—I found it was tied with a cord, but I got my hand in, and three nails of the latch broke by my forcing it—the rest were drawn—I then got out, and saw three lads running—had it been daylight—I could have seen them further, but from the lamp of a butcher's shop I could see them running—a rope was tied on the latch, and then on the scraper of the door—when I got out, I found the three persons running—I had been very ill for several days, and for two days I was in bed, and I was sitting at work with my nightcap on—I had not been out of bed above three hours, and I dare say they thought I could not run—I did not know either of the prisoners before—I did not see Smith's face through the glass, it was his head&amp;—; when I got round the counter, I heard two shoes drawn out of the window—I missed them from the window—there were three lads running together—I was confident it was not a boy who stood under the window, by the bulk of him, and his jacket, he had a cap on, and of the three lads Smith was the most bulky—I am con<lb/>fident he is the person I saw through the glass—I only saw the top of his bead—I did not see either of them stopped—I called, "Stop thief"—I have no particular reason for saying Smith is the person whose head I saw through the window, only by his dress—I saw him brought in custody the same night, and he appeared to be dressed the same as the person whose head was through the window.</p>

Finsbury, Last Tuesday night, the 5th of April, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, I had been at Green which on business, and was going home—I was sober—I was going through Kent-street in the Borough, and two men came and pinioned me, one on each side—my two hands were kept down so that I could not help myself—I had a person named England in my company, who had walked all the way from Green wich with me—I never saw her before—my arms were pinioned by two men—there were three altogether; and while the others pinioned me, the third man, who was the prisoner, drew my watch from my pocket—I saw him do it, and saw him with it in his hand afterwards—I had not power to resist at the moment—it was taken by force—as soon as the two that held me let me go, I jumped forward, and seized the chain of my watch—the watch was then in the prisoner's hand—I attempted, as far as I could, to get posses<lb/>sion of the watch—when I was holding the chain in my hand, the prisoner struck me on the chest—I seized him with my left hand—he struggled to extricate himself, and get the watch; and he and I both fell in the kennel, and there we rolled both in the mud, before I could get at liberty, and get the watch from him—in the mean time the female called the police; but in the first instance when the prisoner drew the watch from my pocket. I cried out that I was robbed—while we were down rolling in the kennel, he stuck, me, and I struck him to extricate myself—I got up, and kept hold of the chain, and got the watch from him—the policeman came up—I told him I was robbed, and gave him the watch—the prisoner never got away—he was never out of my sight—the other two men ran away—I could not swear to them—they kept back, I could not see their faces.</p>

               <p>for at his request—I am sure it was the 20th—he was then ill in bed—I was again sent for to his house, on Tuesday afternoon, the 26th of January—I went both on Tuesday and Wednesday—he was very bad indeed on Tuesday, and not in a sound state of mind, in my opinion—I mean deli<lb/>rious—I inquired of him with attendance he ad; and in consequence of what I heard in answer to that inquiry, I recommended a certain course to be taken—I saw him again on the Wednesday morning about nine o'clock, in consequence of a message—in consequence of a request made to me I went for Mr. Cumming and we went together to Captain M'Ken<lb/>zie's house, and we both saw him—I had given an explanation to Mr. Cumming of the treatment he had been undergoing, and Mr. Cum<lb/>ming recommended that course to be discontinued—I do not person<lb/>ally know whether it was or was not continued—I went again on Friday, the 29th, in the morning—the prisoner was then present—I was at the house before he arrived—the prisoner, on arriving asked how Cap<lb/>tain M'Kenzie was—the reply was, "Very bad"—he went up stairs—I went into the room with him—the prisoner did not say a word in my presence, but looked a at me and then at Mr. Kenzie, evidently conveying a meaning—after a lapse of one minute, M'Kenzie told me to leave the room, and said his wife must be mad to think of having me in the room, and I also to stop with the medical man—in consequence of those expressions, I left the room—the prisoner afterwards came down stairs to the parlour where I was—I asked him his opinion of Mr. M'Kenzie—he said he was decid<lb/>edly better—I told him I differed with him—I thought him as bad as a man could be to be alive—I told him I understood he had been taking Morison's pills—e bowed assent and said he had—I asked him for what disease or disorder he was doctoring him for or treating him for he—he replied he was eradicating his former disorders or diseases, and he would be a better man than ever—I then asked him if there was any occasion to administer such enormous does—he replied there was, and asked me if I had ever partaken of them—I told him I had not, and God keep me from ever doing so, I had seen sufficient of their effects; alluding to M'Kenzie—he then said he had treated him the same as he had treated his wife and family—he told me I was one of old school, and fond of the faculty'; but if I knew the numbers they destroyed yearly I should not be surprised to see how the bills of mortality were swollen out—about that time the hair<lb/>dresser left the room to shave Captain M'Kenzie and returning a minute, saying that vomiting had taken place—the prisoner wet up stairs to see him—I did not go up-stairs myself—the prisoner returned in a minute or two down stairs, and said it was very trifling, that the hair-dresser had disturbed him after he had recently taken medicine—he asked me if I had any fur<lb/>ther questions to put to him—I observed, "Are you aware you have been administering medicine to man in an unsound state of mind?"he said he had not referred to Mrs. M'Kenzie, who was then in the front parlour—she corroborated my statement and said her husband was out of his mind, or had been out of his mind—he the admitted that he might have been a little light headed, but it was to of any consequence—at this all, I belive that passed that morning—the prisoner then left the house, and I went into the be room—I found M'Kenzie much worse and in great pain—after leaving the house at the request of thedecesed, at eleven o'clock, I went to Mr. Cumming, an the said he would attend—after that I met Captain Allen about one o'clcok in the day and we met about eight o'clock in the evening at Mr. Kenzie hose—when I got there the prisoner was in</p>

I believed him is a most hazardous state, form the expression of his countenance and him appearance—I believed him in the most imminent danger from the moment I saw him—he was extremely weak his eyes very mach sunk—he breathed with great difficulty; and altogether his appearance was that of a man in a very hazardous state—I conversed with himhe was not able to converse with me easily—he could not—he attempted to answer a question I put but was too exahusted—the first would he said was, "Allow me a mo<lb/>ment to breathe, and I will endeavour to tell you"—I then questioned him as to the remedies he had taken—he told me the purpose ha had in view in taking the medicine; next he gave me an account of the medicine itself—I examined his knee-joint—I found his knee affected with acute rheumatic inflammation—it was swollen, hot and painful—the swelling extended half way up the thighit was the right knee—he complained of</p>

               <p>no other pain till I put the question to him—he made no complaint but of his knee—but I put other questions, and he told me he had other pains—the chief pain was at the put of the stomach—the disorder in the knee was not at all connected with the disorder in the stomach—I examined one of his motions—it was what is generally termed a watery motion, and float<lb/>ing in the water, were long thick ropes of mucus six or eight inches long—it was the mucus form the bowels—I believe it was such a motion as is produced by irrelative purgative medicines—if he had said nothing, I should say it was such a motion as is produced by strong purgatives—I explained to him, that the disorder in the knee had no connexion with the disorder in the stomach—after hearing what medicine he had taken, and for what purpose, I did not think fit to have it continued, but I had no charge, and could not direct it to be discontinued—I merely given my option, that the consequences would be fatal if they did continue—I said, he might recover if he took about a little sip of barley water, or chicken broth, and took no more medicine—he had complained of thirst, and I though it she only proper nourishment; it might have partly supplied the lost of the mucus which had been carried of f—from the first I thought him in a highly eritical state, and told his friends so—I called on Thursday the day fol<lb/>lowing to inquire how he did, and I was sent for on the Friday, and saw him—he was decidedly worse that when I left him on Wednesday he was in a state of looking abut him last he had dose on Wednesday, though very exhausted then; he lay now with the eyelids half covering his eyes, and the eye still more sunk—the breathing was preformed with great distress—his voice was merely a whisper-when he was spoken to, he raised his eyelids; but the moment the excitement of speaking to him was over, the eyelids dropped again—it was about eleven o'clock in Friday that I saw him—I felt his arm and found the pulse eat very nearly 130—it was just countable—his akin was very cold and clammy—the arm above the elbows, was blueish or purple it was my opinion at that time he would he—no person of competent skill could fail to see that he was in danger on the Wednesday and on the Friday I found him nine worse—I declined to act as a medical man for him without assistance—in consequence of hen Dr. Cobb was called in to assist me—I told the deceased I would not attend other<lb/>wise—he was not in a condition to take medicine after I saw him on Fri<lb/>day—I directed, on the Friday fourteen leeches to be applied to the knee—I saw him again about eight o'clock the following morning—he had passed a very restless night and was still worse than on the previous even<lb/>ing—Dr. Cobb was not with me at eight o'clock on Saturday—he was about one o'clock in the day—the deceased was still worse—I thought he was rather better when Dr. Cobb saw him with me in the middle of the day but do not now think he was better—he was sensible)—I though the case not hopeless on Saturday—I still thought there was a hope of his getting better—Dr. Cobb did not thing it proper to administer any thing by the stomach and I agreed in that—not above five grains of gum arabic was administered—I administered <hi rend="italic">enema</hi> to him by the direction Dr. Cobb, and again a second time—I saw him again on the Saturday night latehe was the very much worse—I did not think any thing in the shape of medicine would be of the least use to him—I saw him on Sun<lb/>day night—he was in dying state—I and Dr. Cobb saw him on Sunday morning and night—I left him at ten o'clock at night in a dying state—I have not the slightest hesitation in saying, he died from ulceration in the stomach—the destruction of the cubstances in the stomach—I know the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would be the effect of an ordinary person taking twenty or thirty pills night and morning for days and night together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The effect would be, that at the first dose the bowels would be cleared out—by a repeated done they would be irritated, and the mucus secretion, the lining of the bowels, brought away—by repeated doses the bowels would be irritated, and, by con<lb/>tinued irritation and action, inflammation would be brought on—it depends on the state and strength of the stomach—an over dose of gamboge would kill anybody—gamboge is ranked by Dr. Paris and others as poisonous—above twenty grains it is a direct poison and would act as such on the stomach of most persons—it is my opinion that if there was half a grain in each pill, forty pills would be a direct poison—I do not think anyone could live taking thirty or forty gains daily not taking them at one time and re<lb/>peating the dose for two or three days the effect would be death, I belive—it would produce a mortal disease, a disease that could terminate in death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If ten drops would stimulate 100 drops would act altogether in a different way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—a small dose of calomel will produce a great deal of testing and uneasiness to he intestines, and a larger dose would produce a comfortable evacuation—I have administered aloes for twenty twenty years—I never found it do so—I have tried it and taken it for years.</p>

                  </hi>? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to say aloes in proportion to its quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes and in my judgement very regularly—I have four years used the gamboge pill, which is gamboge and aloes—I never gave more than three at once—I have repeated them, but never ordered more than three at one time—I was asked before the Coroner, my opinion of the cause of the decease's death—the difference between the pills No. 2 was told me in the room, but at this moment I do not remember it—the gamboge pills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040053"/>
               <p>that I have administered, contain one grain or gamboge each—I have for<lb/>gotten the difference between No.1 and No.2 of Morison's pills—I may happen to hit on the proper description but I do not know which are the stronger—I do not remember haring before the Corner, that Captain M'Kenzie had always a less dose administered to him than was recom<lb/>mended—I have heard Mrs. M'Kenzie say to day that she omitted to give No.1 at night three times and gave No.2 in the morning without giving no.1a tall—and I hard her say that Mr. Salmon said No.2 ought not to be given without No.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, as a medical man whether it is quite fair to judge of the effect to medicine, when it is told you are not to give No.2 without No.1, and do so—is it fair to judge to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if a me<lb/>dical man sends two medicines, with a particular object in view, under<lb/>standing the complaint he wishes both to be given—generally speaking, it is not fair to give a less quantity than a medical man orders and judge of its effect—if the medicine is gamboge and aloes we know what it is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a patient id told, "Don't take No.2 Without No.1, "is it fair to judge of he effect of No.2 if No.1 is left out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it is—I heard Mrs. M'Kenzie say to day that No. I never operated on the bowels—I judge of the effect of the medicine administered not of the quantity—the directions of the prescribing medicine ought to be atten<lb/>ed to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose No.1 is omitted would a person of com<lb/>petent skill be able to detect it, from appearances on seeing patient? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I send a dose of purgative medicine at night, and it has no effect in the morning it is very natural to inquire if the medicine has been taken—I do not know what complaint the deceased made to the prisoner—from what I saw of him on Wednesday I should say, it would be highly dan<lb/>gerous to give even a small quantity of this medicine on Thursday in the state his stomach was in—it would not be consistent to administer two spoonful of powdered pills of Thursday or Friday—I do not thing a man at all acquainted with the us of medicine could have failed to know that, if he was acquainted with disease—the exhibiting of two table spoonsful of these pills powdered on the Thursday or Friday was very likely to pro<lb/>duce death—it is very difficult to enter in to the varieties of cases—medi<lb/>cine may be throw off the stomach very quickly—very great quantities of quicksilver have passed through without injury at all—I consider it was not consistent with safety to administer any medicine to him a tall in the state he was in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgement regard being had to the appearances you saw on Wednesday would a person of competent skill have repeated the medicine we have heard described, in any form under such circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Respecting competent skill, it is very difficult question—it required a person acquired with disease—Captain M'Kenzie did not complain of disease, but the pain in his knee—it required a medical man to know he was affected with inflammation of the stomach—nether the gentleman who attended nor the patient himself knew he was affected with irritation of the stomach—there is often a high degree of inflammation of the stomach. with very little pain—I have heard Mrs. M'Kenzie state that she repeated to Mr. Salmon the complaints made by her husband, of the pain in his stomach and below it—that would certainly call the attention of person of competent skill to the state of the stomach—he would not be justified in administering the medicine again, from the state in which the deceased was</p>

               <p>on the Wednesday—the effect of two table spoonsful of pills would be to in<lb/>crease the inflammation, and hurry it into a state of gangrene; and it is my opinion that would account for the appearances I found on examining the body after death.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D I am a physician and have been practising as such for fourteen years in London. I am physician to the London Hospital I was called in to see Captain M'Kenzie on Friday night, to make an ap<lb/>pointment to see him on Saturday morning the 30th of January and in consequence of the at appointment, I met Mr. Cumming there about one o'clock—I found Captain M'kenzie in a state of extreme depression and exhaustion; and in my opinion labouring under a fatal disease—I was informed by Mr. Cumming, on Friday evening, of the particulars of his illness, and the mode in which he had been treated—the statement made was, that he had taken a large quantity of Morison's pills—an evacuation was show to me on the Saturday it contained mucus, mixed with a good deal of fluid, and slight spots of blood—I cannot swear to the fact of slight spots of blood being mixed with it at that moment—the mucus had issued from the intestines, because it was mixed with feculent matter and bile—the mucus was the secretion from the inner lining of the bowels—I ordered mustard poultices to be applied to the pit of his stomach, and the same diet as Mr. Cumming had ordered, with a small quantity of mucilage given to him from tie to time together with injection s—the object of my treat<lb/>ment was merely to sustain life—I did not see him again that day—I saw him on the Sunday at noon and at night—I continued the same treatment with little variation, not administering to him any medicines, except broth and the mucilage; I think, just at last when the case became entirely hope<lb/>less, he had something to moisten his mouth—I directed enemas to be admi<lb/>nistered composed of strong beef soup, and a small quantity of brandy mixed with it—it was to sustain life—I afterwards attended at the examination of the body on Monday at two o'clock and took notes of it at the time (<hi rend="italic">reading them</hi>)—"Monday, February 1 three o'clock twelve hours after death—liver rather large and congested, but no active disease—<hi rend="italic">peritonœus</hi> free from inflammation or other disease—stomach much contracted—along the middle of the egret curvature exceedingly inflamed, with tow spots of ulceration, and one about the size of a shilling, at the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> the mucus membrane throughout the whole course, of the intestinal canal, inordinately injected with dark-closured blood—in many parts, more particularly the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jejunum,</hi> the mucus membrane had the appearance of <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> effused within its substance and greatly softened—at other parts, the membrane was so thin as to give the appearance of ulcerated destruction—the <hi rend="italic">coecum</hi> colon, especially the ascending and descending protions, was a mass of yellow pulpy matter, mixed with feca<lb/>lent matter and mucus—this matter did not distend the intestine by its bulk, but <hi rend="italic">coecum</hi> was extremely distended by air, and had numerous small black spots like commercing gangrene—on opening the knee-joint, a considerable effusion of <hi rend="italic">lymph</hi> was seen, but no marks of common of long continued inflammation or ulceration—in the head the vessels were rather protruded but nothing denoting disease"—with the exception of the stomach, there was no appearance about the body sufficient to account for death—there was abundantly sufficient in the stomach and bowels to ac<lb/>count for the cause of death—I should say, unhesitatingly that the irrita<lb/>tion in the stomach and bowels cause those appearances—inflammation had cause the ulceration the the stomach and bowels—I cannot take on</p>

               <p>myself to swear from were inspection what caused the inflammation—the appearances in the stomach and bowels had reference to taking drastic medicines k—gamboge and aloes I large quantities are calculate to pro<lb/>duce those appearances—it is impossible to say how long the yellow pulpy matter had been it the colon—it might have been many ay, for it was in that portion of the intestines which it might have lodged in many days—I saw some pills in the room—I know now what they are composed of—they are aloes and gamboge—I did not chemically examine them, and do not know of any thing els except form hearsay—I have heard Mrs. M'Kenzie examined to-day, and have heard her describe the quantity of pills she ad<lb/>ministered to her husband—a repetition of the quantity she states, I think, might cause those appearances, it would be very improper to administer on the Friday two table spoonsful of powdered pills, in the stale she has described him to her in—a person of competent skill would assuredly have seen, by the appearances that that was not the mode of treatment to be followed—inflammation of the stomach and bowels sometimes arises sud<lb/>denly in the course of an illness—I am of opinion from the appearances after death, this could not have been what this teamed primary or <hi rend="italic">idiopathic</hi> inflammation—it is impossible to form any judgement about how long before death the inflammation had originated—I cannot name anytime to be cer<lb/>train that it might have been going on—it might have been a few days—it is impossible to say—perhaps from forty eighty hours up to four days ulceration—inflammation would necessarily precede ulceration—inflammation of the bowels varies very much in its character—ulceration supervenes inflamma<lb/>tion in a very shot time—it requires nicety; of judgement to discover that the stomach and bowels are in a state of inflammation, as it does to dis<lb/>cover all disease—if a person of competent skill had seen him on Friday for the first time, he would have seen he was labouring under destructive mischief of some vital organ—I should think a perosn of ordinary skill, attending him for days before would be able to detect inflammation of the stomach and bowels on the Friday and in my judgement it would be very improper to go of administering the same purgative medicines.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see him before one o'clock on Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him twice on Sunday and on no other occasion—I saw him three times altogether during life—the disease of which he died had established itself unquestionably on the Saturday—I will not undertake to give an opinion how long—it must have been certainly more than twenty four hours—it might have proceeded from the medicine he took—as I have no proof that it was given I say, "might"—if I had proof of it being given, I should say it was cause enough to produce the disease by the administering of the medicines Mrs. M'Ken<lb/>zie has described—I believe these medicines, administered in the manner she describe, would necessarily produce that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment no patient could escape dangerous and alarming illness by taking medicines in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said that, and do not mean to say so—in his case it did so, I believe but others taking the same medicine might escape—I am aware of some of the ingredients of Morison's pills are gambage and aloes—those ingredients are poisonous in consequence, but not absolutely fatal, and it depends on the mode in which it is administered—I think five grains of the compound of aloes and gamboge administered twice a day for a week night produce fatal consequence if they produced inflammation at first and then were administer afterwards—if it was given to the times the amount in other cases I believe it might not produce those fatal consequences—I believe it might he administered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040056"/>
               <p>to ten times that amount without producing deleterious consequences—I speak of the compound of aloes and gamboge—but I will now speak of them separately—five grains of the compound, night and morning for a week, under some circumstances I believe, wold produce poisonous and destructive consequences, or it might not—it entirely depends on the con<lb/>dition of the patient—a very large quantity might be taken without pro<lb/>ducing any mischief—I presume a large quantity might be administered with benefit—it is a matter of very nice judgement to know when you may repeat large quantities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the largest dose you have been in the habit of administering of the compound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should ay three grains of gamboge, with from seven to ten of aloes, is a full dose—I am aware that very much larger doses can be taken without producing deleterious effects because they produce a purgative effect and nature relives herself by those means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Perhaps you do not agree with the last witness, that if a particular quantity of medicine procures a certain effect double that quantity will produce double that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends on the medicine—that applies to some medicine—I belive opium, in a moderate dose, given to double the amount twit produce a certain the effect double certain circum<lb/>stances—if the dose he very much increased, the effect is generally very different—most medicines have their effect according to the quantity administered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you name any medicine which throughout the whole quantity which could be given ha its effect in exact proportion to the quantity ad<lb/>minstered <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a mathematical question certainly not—most medi<lb/>cines do—it would depend on what five grains of aloes were administered for, whether it would do good—ten times that quantity would not produce ten times that effect—I cannot name one medicine to enable me to give you a precise answer.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you, although you cannot mathe<lb/>matically speaking say if five grains of medicine produce certain effects, ten will produce just double that effect; do you, in point of fact, find a more powerful effect produced by the grater quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; cumstances on the time constitutions—they are medicines which if given constantly, require the nicest watching—I gave heard Mrs. M'Kenzie say she gave a smaller number of pills that she was directed—in my judgement, those omissions would not tend at all to the injury of the patient but quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that observation apply to the total omission at night, or to the reduction of the quantity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The reduction of the quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether the pills differ in the materials they are composed of or in their strength? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not undertake to say, but I believe No. 1 contains no gamboge a tall—my opinion that by not giving No. 1 at night it would not produce so great an irritation as if both had been given—I mean at that period of the disease—supposing inflam<lb/>mation to be begun the use of aloes and gamboge would be unquestion<lb/>ably prejudicial to the patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you form any judgment how much it would take of these pills powdered to fill two table spoons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a mere guess and sup<lb/>postion—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040057"/>
               <p>weigh for grains each—it is a very rough guess, but I should say from twenty to fifty—I should say the two spoons would be filled with fifty—if that quantity were given on Friday mornings ininflammation having set in, it would be a further means of mischief of course—it would not account for the appearances I found after death—not so soon—if doses of the same medicine had been administered for days before, their combined effect would produce the appearances I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F. POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware of the difference of No.2 and No.2? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not, no exactly—as I a general al rule, 1 think it very unfair to judge of the result of a peon's directions whether he is a medical man or not, if they are not followed it is a very unfair thing to disobey the directions of a medical man at any time, if you trust in him—if he directed twenty to be give and only ten were given, land he was told twenty had been gives, that would unquestionably be calculated to mislead hi a to the effect of the dose—I cannot conceive it could lead him into a rash administration of the medicines in this instance—I should not conceive it possible any body could take thirty grains at night and thirty in the morning for weeks and days together—I believe it is so, because we have evidence, of it—if he found certain effects wee not produced by what he ordered, and thought was taken he would be likely to increase it—if he was told twenty had been taken he would unquestionably ascribe the effect to twenty and not to ten.</p>

               <p>practice and sound principles of Hygeanism with the practice pur<lb/>sued by medical men in general—the Hygerists acting on conviction derived from experience apply one remedy composed of innoeuous ingredients for the removal of all diseases, which, as arising in one body, they consider must originally arise from one cause existing in that body—those opposed to the practice of the Hygeist apply innumerable remedies many of them containing poison in a state of temporary naturalization to the cure of all diseases and of one and the same disease—they also treat local diseases by local remidies, either by internal medicines, which they suppose and are taught to belive, will act particularly on the part effected; or, by external remedies drawing to the surface of the skin by blisters, or diverting the humours from their only, natural course through the bowels by local bleeding—the Hygeists, therefore, practising I unison with their doctrine apply one remedy and believe but one cause to exit; because they find by experience observation and inquiry, that all natural effects flow from some natural cause; and that the removal of that cause it the destruction of those effects which remedy is a harm<lb/>les vegetable compound la as a purgative to he utter expulsion of all mi<lb/>eals of sufficient strength and searching properties to penetrate and draw out, from the various localities of the human system, all the acrid and corrupt humours which the Hygeists and which their practice abundantly confirms is the only cause of the multifarious forms of disease which afflict humanity-the practice of medical men in applying innumerable and opposing remedies to various diseases afflicting one body, and to one and the same diseases can only be defended on the supposition that the human body unlike all natural productions is no governed by one grand and general agent tor principle; but that although intimately and inseparably connected in al its parts and organs it is wholly distinct, different and unconnected with regard to the pains and infirmities afflict<lb/>ing and impairing the various parts an organs—comparing the principles and practice of both doctrines, it is scarcely necessary to remark that the Hygeists proceed on positive reasoning funded on natural deductions, while those opposed to hem can only account to their practice by nega<lb/>tive hypotheses all and totally opposed equally to nature and to reason—thus by a plan of treatment so opposite in its nature, so uncertain in its effects an so injurious in its tendency the lives of hall persons who are suddenly passe from the treatment of the Hygeists to that of the doctors are placed in the greatest jeopardy—and to this mode of treatment pur<lb/>sued in this case, I do most solemnly attribute the melancholy death in this instance—in confirmation of this, look at the thousands and tens of thousands who employ the medicine recommended by the Hygeists in their various aliments; and in no case has an inquest been held, where medical men have not interfered with the beneficial administration of this medicine—in the case before you, I strongly protested, both to the deceased as well as to his friends against their Proceedings fearing at once the evil consequences before stated, an now so lamentably rue—in this no<lb/>hing can show the absurdity of their practice more than the fact that a man under the influence of an active purgative and his bowel suddenly stopped; and that followed which all reflecting persons must naturally ex<lb/>pect, namely infammation—on the contrary had his bowels been kept in a state of solution by the continued exhibiton of purgatives the cause of the inflammation which ensued would have been removed and a return to health he would have been the consequence—this is no chi<lb/>mera—you will ave an opportunity of hearing positive testimony</p>

               <p>in confirmation there f—I will now shorty state the particular of this case and my connexion with it—I visited Captain M'Kenzie on the 22nd of January by his express desire for the first time after he had the affection of his knee, which was an old complaint of his and which had existed in this instance about ten our twelve days pervious to his sending for, me and which he state had been brought on by a cold, through getting wet—it consisted of a contraction of the muscles of the knee joint with some degree of swelling and considerable paid—in fact an acute rheumatic affection—I found he had been taking Moraon's pills of his won accord; but now knowing how to proceed with them he sen for me, a and I advised him to the best of my ability and experience—by gradually increasing the doses he got up to twenty of No.1 at night, and thirty of No. 2 in the morning which were the largest doses I ever ordered and never in any shorter time than twelve hocus between, did I order them to be adminis<lb/>tered the contraction of the knee joint soon gave way to this treatment, and he was sealed to put his leg straight in bed which before could only be in a bent position—so far the case was proceeding satisfactorily with the exception or and increase of pain, but confined wholly to knee—here it will be necessary to mention an important fact, elucidated from the widow, and which was wholly unknown to me before—she stated she did not give the doses I prescribed—so that while I was calculating upon the effect of thirty pills, and judged from the supposed operation of that number, she had only administered twenty and in like manner lessened the various does I have prescribed—hence my administering forty pills to the deceased which was the dose mixed by me illiquid was grounded on the supposed want of power of a much larger quantity than was actually given—therefore, the species of deception coupled with the application of of a blister to the knee unknown to me, all tended to thwart my proceed<lb/>ings—what would he said in the case of a regular medical man sending his mixture or draught labelled to be give to his patient in a certain way, if the attendant chose to alter the quantity according to their whim and fancy?—would it not be monstrous to charge the doctor with the conse<lb/>quences that minds rise in such a case?—in all probability such dose as forty pills would have been thought necessary had the patient had the number given to him that had been prescribed—Gentleman you must not let your minds be led astray but the apparent astounding number of pills given in this case e—calculating a number of small pills is very erroneous way of arriving at any just conclusion—suppose, for instance, it was worded in this way, "About a table spoonful of this moisture to be given, "would it in that case strike your mind as so preposterous?—and yet the same power of medicine would exist—I now beg leave to hand you a powder, which is forty of No. 2 pills pulverised; and I am sure, from the quantity there appears when in powder, and which ha been stated to be two table<lb/>spoonsful (but I have no hesitation in saying it would take beyond six hundred or seven hundred pills to fill, when powdered,) it would have a different effect on your minds to forty pills in the whole state—therefore, the only way in which you can arrive at a proper conclusion on the subject, is by paying particular, attention to the evidence of the witnesses which will be examined in my defence—remember that experience is the only test of all knowledge—you will have it in evidence that persons have not only taken the number which was given to the deceased but three times, and even fur times that quantity in one day an the invariable result has been cure—how therefor can it he said that in this case I acted either</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040061"/>
               <p>rashly or negligently, looking a the experience which I have had—it has been argued that if a beneficial effect can be produced by a small number such large doses must of course be injurious—this argument, although plausible, is fallacious for experience(our only safe guide in such matters) aburr<lb/>dantly teaches us that very large dose of the same medicine does not always produce a more violent effect a smaller one; and that the operation of a drug depends not always on its own intrinsic properties but on the particular circumstances under which it is administered—it will be necessary he to mention the fact acknowledged to me by the deceased, that so far from his being that robust hearty man some of the witnesses would instate, he had repeatedly been laid up with serious illness when abroad—not a very long time back, he was in the hospital, in Jamaica, for three months, with fever and never was able to do without taking im<lb/>mense doses of calomel, above 100 grains at a dose which he acknow<lb/>ledged if he was obliged to continue, would undermine his constitution; in fact, he was a bloated and a very bilious subject—the apothecary states, that he ordered him chicken broth instead of medicine e—of what use could such things be to a man in he state he was while the inflammatory action was allowed to go on unchecked? and that which before was entirely local being only in the knee, gradually extended itself up to he stomach, which was aided by the application of leeches depriving the knee of a part of its resting—it cannot he pretended for a moment that I attended him for again having never received or expected to receive any fee whatever, it being contrary to the terms of publicly offer; nor was the medicine even purchased of me; therefore, nothing but a desire to do him good could in<lb/>fluence me in attending him. I will now just draw you attention to what has been sworn against time as as to my representing myself as a regular medical man—when I was informed on the Friday evening that they had called in a doctor I expressed a wish at al events to se the deceased, which the wire refused to allow me to do; and on my still urging the mater she fetched from the next room a person whom I did not then know, but whom I have since learnt, was Captain Allen; he in a very abrupt and unceremonious manner se asked me who I was and by whose authority I had been attending his friend, and if I had my diploma in my pocket; all of which was aid I breath and with great has t—I looked at him with surprise and sarcastically said, "Do you expect media men are in the habit of carrying this diplomas in their pockets? and as to my authority, I have a grater than any diploma could give me"(meaning thereby, that I considered my experience in this medicine superior to a diploma and which I am sorry to see, they have misconstrued to my prejudice)—and then I said, "I have attended here by the express wish or Captain M'Ken<lb/>zie "Gentlemen I have never held myself out to the world as a medical practitioner; and it must have been perfectly well known to the family and friends to the deceased, that I was only what I ave always represented myself to be an agent for Morison's pills—I then repeated my wish to see the deceased; but he in an authoritative tone, me I should not, unless I liked to wait the arrival of the physician whom he expected very shortly—I replied, I would wait and did a considerable time but no physician made his appearance; and at last, on my urging injustice of prevent<lb/>ing my seeing he deceased, who I knew in the morning of that day had every confidence in me, they last consented, and the wife accompanied me to his room when I was informed by the deceased, that it was contrary to his his wish that medical man had been called i, that his friends had</p>

               <p>insisted on it; and also observed that Mr. Cumming on hearing he had been taking Morison's pills, said he was a poisoned man—knowing the bad effects which usually result from the doctor's treatment following the Hygean, I pointed out to him the folly of allowing his friends to interfere in a matter which so much concerned himself and of their pretending to judge of medicine which they confessedly knew nothing about—his answer was he was obliged to yield there being so many against him; and after taking me by the hand, and expressing in the warmest terms his thanks for my attention, requested that I would see him the following day. You will bear in mind this all took place when, according to the evidence of Mr. Cumming, he was in a state of collapse—I afterwards shortly pro<lb/>tested to his friends against the course they were pursuing, and warned them of the probable consequences; at the same time adding the was in perfect safety if left to my treatment, of which I felt full convection—on the following day I went accompanied by Dr. Lynch, but we were positively refused admittance to his room by Mr. Gray and Captain Allen—we then went to Mr. Cumming, and asked him several questions—in reply to which, he said he thought the deceased would do well; but in his opinion, he had been over-purged, and he was endeavouring to give tone to the stomach; and now after bent there days under the doctor's hands his death is attributed tome, gentlemen I have now ben practising with this medicine nearly seven days, and within the last two or three years, the number of persons seeking my advice have increased considerably owing to the success which has attended my labours and in every instance my advice an attendance ha been perfectly gratuitous, Gentlemen, I would ask you, as fathers of families, whether you would not consider it tyranny in the extreme, if the law prevented your giving to your wives or your children, when ill, that which you would have every confidence is, and which you think would restore them to health—and recollect, the same law that would operate to prevent my administering to my fellow-creatmen that which I know will do them good, would also prevent you. Gentlemen I am so thoroughly convinced to the utter harmlsesseness of this medicine, as well as of its power in subding disease in all its shades and bearings that had I a thousand lives wold trust them all to this medicine—and I have reason for such confidence, having received immense benefit from it in my own person; therefore, personal experience is the basis on which I have ventured to administer it to others—I have had occasion severe attack of influenza, to take eighty pills per day; namely forty at nigh, and forty in the morning, an with the happiest results—I have had four of my own children ill of the scarlet fever, al cured by this medicine as well as whooping cough and measles with a variety of there complaints and is no instance has any other medicine been administered; and the result has invariably been successes—this is unlike the medical me, who very spar<lb/>ingly take themselves, or administer to their families, the drugs they send in such plenitude to their patients. Gentleman I call on you well to consider what may be the effect of your verdict in this case—you may, by a just verdict this day establish on a firm footing the medical liberty of the subject or by upholding prescriptive rights, for no other reason than because they have been hitherto upheld, support and perpetuate the most injurious domestic tyranny that can exist in society—give reason and free inquiry on this subject full scope an they will uphold the truth, by bring<lb/>ng false opinions and all the offspring of ignorance, prejudice, and self<lb/>interest before their severe tribunal and subjecting them to the test of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040063"/>
               <p>close investigation. Gentlemen I ask of you justice—strict an unbending justice—it is not my cause alone, it is as much your own cause—if a mono<lb/>poly in medical practice be upheld, no improvement can tae place, except from one of their own body—the only verdict which the evidence brought before you will warrant that of "<hi rend="largeCaps">
NOT GUILTY</hi>." and which verdict, I am confident, will alone bear reflecting on by you—in fact any other verdict would be monstrous in the extreme, actuated as I have been by the very best feelings that ca possibly influence the human mid—that of doing my afflicted fellow creatures good—and the experience I have had, both on myself another, fully Justices me in advising the use of this medicine. Gentlemen, recollect that if medical gentlemen were successful in curing their patients there would be no room of the practice I am engaged in, as every on has a prejudice in favour of them, until they are taught by pain<lb/>ful experience the truth, that their practices not based on those sound principles which insure success—this system of medicine is now become entirely a party afair—look a the immense power arrayed against it; namely, the entire medical body, which but few honourable exception—look at the influence this body of men have in society—the power the law has put into their hands)—a dangerous power, and one which however right items gone by is not fit to exist now—in many instances have I known in a country town a tradesman persecuted and deprived of his business, by the secret influence of the medical man of he place, merely because he was guilty of the crime to selling Morison's pills while his own medicines might sold with impunity—I merely rmention this to show that if it were not for the intrinsic worth of Morison's medicines in them<lb/>selves. the opposition arrayed against them by the whole bodily of apothe<lb/>caries and druggists would be more than sufficient to crush them; and should not the testimony of such men against this medicine of which they confessedly know nothing be at all events received with great caution? The doctors of the present day designate Harvey the great discoverer of of the circulation of the blood, immortal but they know that their medical forefathere considered him quack, and persecuted him because he had been hold enough to declare a great truth which truth was opposed to their preconceived notions—the public are now beginning to see that they are the greatest quacks who cannot cure heir patents; and they the best physicians who can cure them, whether licensed or un<lb/>licensed. Gentlemen I leave my case in your hands trusting you with do your duty in the first place to your own consciences, by an unprejudiced review of all the evidence brought before you; by which alone you can do your to that society for which form a part and of which you are hare as delegates. It appears to me there are two points of importance for your consideration in this case; first, was it or was it not a proper medicine to administer in this case? an the next point is was it administered in proper quantities?—a satisfactory answer to this question can only he had from the testimony of of those who have had practical experi<lb/>ence in the mater, an snot from he speculative opinions of medical men, who confess they know nothing whatever of this medicine, having never analyse the pills, no have they ever used them—and cannot therefore be acquainted with their effects whether taken in less or in greater quantities, or, indeed, in any quantity at all—and beer in mind, it is not the supposed component parts of this medicine, and which are stated to be different by different chemists but the compound, as a whole, that determines its cha<lb/>racter.</p>

On the 19th of March, the prisoners were cutting chaff in the barn, they were his labourers—Fenson was going out with a waggon and three horses to London, to fetch a load of grains—the allowance is about thirty pounds of hay for three horses, and a bout three quarters of a pack of corn—just before he set off from the yard he took a bundle of hay, about fifty pounds, and put it on his wagon—he went into road—I</p>

               <p>went and told him he was a pretty fellow to take the hay away—I took the hay back again into the barn—I gave Hallard the hay in the morning to cut into chaff, but it was Fensom that took it and put it on the shafts of the wagon—he was to take thirty pounds—but I gave him that and the corn before this.</p>

"I dare say you find it so"—she said "Yes, I have been standing over large fires, cooking three dinners a day"—the man was then outside—he said to her, "Come along"—she said, "I do not think I shall go out this evening"—he said, "Come along," and they went out, and at half past twelve o'clock we went up-stairs, found the door locked, and the key gone—we found the bed had been stripped of every thing—this is the quilt—blanket, and sheet, which came of the bed.</p>

He is a clerk in an insurance office—Thomas East came on Saturday morning to ask for a room for himself and son, a little boy—I said he could not well have it that day—he said he must if he could, as he had just come from the country, and was at a public house, which was expensive—he said he was a cabinet-maker, but was not in employ at present—I said if he was sober, and a good work<lb/>man, I thought I could get him work—I said, "I suppose you can give me some reference"—he looked at the room, and asked if there were good sheets—I said they were good common sheets—good enough for my chil<lb/>dren, and good enough for me, when I had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said he could give me a reference to a person in Henry-street—he staid in the room I should think five or six weeks—he did not pay one farthing, and I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he was a pensioner—he asked me to let my servant make a fire that night, and she did, and then he went up into the room, and after a while, he said, could I lend him a mug to get some porter in—while he was gone I went up-stairs, but the door was locked—I have since found that that night a blanket of mine was pawned—I did not see the woman, but I understood she had been harboured there all along—one day my servant asked if she should clean the room out, and he said, no, his sister was out of place, he had got her there, and she should do it—I lent him a pail and brush, and he came down with his sleeves tucked up, and said he had given it a good cleaning—he said he had been a sailor and could do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper's labourer, and live in Easton-street. On Friday evening, the 4th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, I was coming from home, and going to Laystall-street—coming up Mount Plea<lb/>sant, I saw two young men scrummaging or fighting together; I could not well tell which—I went on one side—I passed them—Parr after me, and caught me round the waist, and threw me into the kennel—I did not know him before—he thew me down and doubled his knee into my belly—I lost my senses then for a bit, and laid flat on my back, with my heard be<lb/>ing bruised against the paved stones—when I recovered, I got on my hands and knees—I found my watch lying on the pavement by the side of me—the buttons were all torn off my waistcoat, which was torn open; and I found my watch-fob pulled right out of my trowsers—I got up, and put my watch into my side-pocket, and buttoned my coat—I followed the pri<lb/>soner Parr into Pool's-buildings—he returned from Pool's-buildings into Laystall-street, when I met a policeman, and gave him in charge—the policeman took him into a wine-vault to search him, and asked me for the watch—I delivered it to him—I lost the seals and things, besides the watch—they were all lying by my side—I picked them all off the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a steel pen maker, and five in Baynes-row, Clerkenwell. On the 4th of March, I was coming down Baynes-row, towards Mount Pleasant, about nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner insulting every person they met—they stopped a seafaring man, and he pushed them away from him, and passed on—directly after that I met the prosecutor coming along Mount Pleasant—the two prisoners pushed him about ten yards—the prisoner Parr turned round, went up to the prosecutor, took him round the waist, threw him on the ground, and knelt on him, and drew his watch from his fob—when he saw me he let the watch fall on the pavement—he got up and staggered away, pretending to be intoxicated, and went round into Pool's-buildings—I brought him out of there, down to the prosecutor, who was standing in Mount Pleasant—there being no policeman present, we let him go, and followed him till was we went a police<lb/>man in Laystall-street, and then gave him into custody—the prisoner Snell was ten yards off at the time Parr knocked the prosecutor down—Snell was staggering about at the time—he went to the workhouse, and we took him into custody at the workhouse, in bed, about an hour afterwards—when Parr was waiting with the prosecutor, after he had thrown him down, Snell called to him to come on.</p>

"then I am to be murdered because you did not see it done?"—he said, "Then I'm b—if you do your duty"—by that time the policeman and the prosecutor went away—the wife desired him to go to a doctor and get the wound dressed—I think it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to two o'clock when I heard them come back again—I heard nothing then till I saw the prisoner brought thought his next door neighbour's house—that is all know—I believe the prisoner struck the prosecutor, but in his own defence—he never went out of his own door by what I saw—I saw the light shine through my binds, and the door shut again directly.</p>

I should search the house—she went into the room the third time, and when she came out, she called Wilson, who was present, to give them to me—she gave me five stockings, which I pro<lb/>duce—I then asked Ford what she had done with the other pair—she said she had pawned them at Mr. Hawes' for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a gown for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked her again whether she knew any thing about Mrs. Dudley's table-cloth—she said she had pawned that for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I draw it to a yard in Pearl-street, St. George's—when there, the bones are picked out by woman and put into tubs to be sold—on the 3rd of April I found the prisoner concealed in a tub—he was taking bones out of another tub and putting them into two bags, one of which he had got full—I said, "You rascal, I have got you at last; I have been a long time looking for you"—he said, "Pray, Mr. Harley, forgive me, I will never do so again"—I have lost a great many bones and rage—I am sure the bones which the prisoner had were mine—they are worth half-a-crown.</p>

On Friday evening, the 4th of March, I was on duty at the Foreign Office—I was a window-clerk at that time—I stand at the window, and receive foreign let<lb/>ters and the postage which is paid for them—on that afternoon the pri<lb/>soner came to me with some letters, and wanted the postage for them—he was the President on duty that evening—he said he wanted the postage to send the letters with the money to the Inland Office—he said they were letters for the Inland Office—he asked me for foreign letters to the amount of the same postage, to send with them to the Inland Office—that was to discharge myself from the money which I gave him—I am charged with all the postage of the letters I receive at the window, by some one who looks over all those letters, and they know what money to charge me—if I had given the prisoner the money he asked for without giving him foreign letters to the same amount, I should have been charged with more money than I had in my possession—I took notice of the directions of some of the letters he brought to me, and afterwards saw them in the prisoner's hat—he went to the fire-place after he asked me for the money—that was before I gave him the money—he went and sat down by the fire-place—his hat was on the bench in a little place parted off from the rest of the office, where the presidents generally sit—there were letters and newspapers in his hat—he had newspapers, as well as letters, from me when he asked me for the money—I noticed that the letters in the hat had the same directions on them as those he brought to me—I took the letters out of the hat, and copied the addresses—the prisoner at that time was sitting by the fire a short distance of—this is my cop (looking at it)—this was not the first time the prisoner had asked me for money in the same way—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was the amount of the postage I gave him—he mentioned the addresses of some of the letters for which he wanted the postage, and I saw them also—I gave him the money shorlty after I saw the letters in his hat—I recollect the addresses of the letters the prisoner mentioned to me—they were Halifax, Curacoa, and Madras—he did not tell me any other addresses—I saw Mau<lb/>ritius on one—the one for Madras was a newspaper (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>)—this is the one for Curacon—this is another—here is one with Mauritius on it—that is one I saw, which he did not mention—I was present when the prisoner was examined at Mr. Peacock's office on Saturday, the 5th of March—he was asked if he had any letters, and he said no—he was then asked if he had any in his drawer, and he said he had none—next day I cast up the amount of postage on the letters which I found in this hat—it was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the sum the prisoner had asked me for.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual to give him money and letter without making inquiry when he asks for them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have no right to ask him, certainly—I should not have given him money without his producing letters—he has asked me for money with letters, but not without them—I do not require to see the letters—If he held them in his hand it would he quite sufficient—I had not time to take down the full addresses of the letters, and I did not think it necessary—I did not do it for both those reasons—the Foreign Office is a large room, much about the size of this court—there are two fire-places. One for the messengers, the other where the clerk generally sit—all the clerks in the Foreign Office are entitled to come into this room, messengers and all—the windows are opposite the fire-place and the door—(looking at a plan of the office)—there is a screen between the door and fire-place, and the window at which I was on duty—it is ten feet high, I should think—it goes nearly the whole length of the room—when the door of the screen is shut the persons at the fire-place cannot see the window where I am—that door is exactly opposite the window at which I was placed—the door in the screen shuts with a spring of its own accord—it must he held or fixed to be kept open—I often leave the window to go to the fire-place in the course of the day—I leave nobody at the window then—it is closed—it has a slide, which is fastened by a catch or spring—that spring is in bad condition—I had left the window when I looked into Mr. Barnes's hat, and nobody was behind the screen—there was a messen<lb/>ger at the further end of the room, with whom I had no communication—I am a permanent clerk in the establishment—it is the course of the post</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Office at the Post Office. On Friday, the 4th of March, I was on duty at the window in the Foreign Office—I came on duty there about five minutes after six—the prisoner came to me at seven o'clock, and demanded 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some letters which he said were to go to the Inland Office—I gave him that sum—he came about five minutes afterwards, and desired to have 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for two newspapers addressed to Mauritius and Madras—I paid particular attention to what he did and what he demanded that night—I was present at Mr. Peacock's office, on Saturday, the 5th of March, when the prisoner was pre<lb/>sent—Mr. Peacock asked him whether he had any letters about him—he said, no, he had none—he asked if the letters for which Mr. Young had given him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the night preceding were forwarded—he said, "Yes; undoubtedly"—he was asked if he had any letters in any part of the Post Office, or in any of his drawers—he said, "No."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose these letters to have arrived at the office under a mistaken impression that they should come to the Foreign Office, how should they be conveyed to the Inland Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would go through the tunnel, according to the usual course of business; but if, instead of sending then through the tunnel, the President comes and asks for money, I am bound to give it to him—it is not the proper practice orfont the President to come himself for the money—he ought to send the letters by a messenger—Mr. Barnes has done it—the messenger should take the letters to the bag clerk to receive the money, and the money and letters are forwarded immediately to the Inland Office by the tunnel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not, on that night, the Malta, Indian, Brazil, and Buenos Ayres monthly mails require to be made up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am certain of it—I am</p>

               <p>as far as possible convinced of it—I cannot take on myself positively to say so—if they were made up that night, it would cause a great dead of additional business in the Foreign Office, and would require considerable attention on the part of the President—but there could not have been a great influx of business that night, because the mails for Malts and India were in time on the Wednesday—a foreign mail night does not require the attention of the President more than any other night—his attention is required every night—he is longer on duty, no doubt, but he should pay the same attention on another night as on a foreign post-night—there is a greater influx of letters in the Foreign Office on a post night than on another night—that would not require greater attention at the time—the office is longer open—the fatigue would not he greater in time—a man would he more fatigued at the close of a foreign-post night than on another night.</p>

Yes; he might make a mistake—my occupation in the office is more busy than his I have occasionally made mistakes myself in business, and have been re<lb/>proved—not over and over again—it has occurred—I have been reproved several times for mistakes I have made—I am not aware of Mr. Barnes being compelled to assist at the sorting-table—I have known him to do it once—will swear I have not known him do it oftener—he may have done so on other occasions without my knowledge—the President is obliged to perform various duties in the office, and is referred to on all occasions of difficulty—questions of difficulty frequently arise—I cannot give any ides of the number of letters that come in on a foreign post-night—they are so numerous—there is an account kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the kindness to look at this newspaper, directed to Granada—if a paper came directed to that place, would it not be referred to Mr. Barnes, to know whether it was to go to the West Indies, or to Spain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should have known where to send it by the direction of Granada—when I first went into the office, I was frequently obliged to refer to Mr. Barnes in matters of difficulty, but not latterly—I have occa<lb/>sionally—I should think there are thousands of letters come into the Foreign Office on the foreign post-night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger in the Post Office. I sometimes stamp letters in the Foreign Office—there is a different stamp for every day—I have the night number book—the letter addressed to Mellish, at Halifax, was stamped on the 2d of March—the number of the stamp is entered every morning in the book—this number of this is 166—I do not know whether that indicates that is came into the Foreign Office on the 2nd of March—I suppose it indicates that it should go forwards on that day—I cannot say that it indicates that it came into the office that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the senior President of the Foreign Office. Mr. Barnes and I were alternately on duty, one in the morning, and the other in the evening—this book contains the dates of each day, with the figures belonging to the day—the stamp on this letter indicates that it was stamped at the Foreign Office on the 2nd of March—at the close of the business the messenger delivers the stamp to the president—he sees that the impression is correct in the book, and affixes his signature in proof of it, and then burns or destroys them—the stamp is never used a second time—this Curacoa letter was stamped at the Foreign Office on the 29th of February last—the number is 145—this letter to New South Wales was</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have not been examined on this business before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am the superintending president—we are never called deputies, nor ever were—Mr. Darlot was the late deputy comptroller—he was not a president—if letter of this description are de<lb/>layed, they sometimes bear a double stamp of the day on which they are forwarded, as well as on the day the mistake might happen, but such oc<lb/>currences are extremely rare—it never occurs except a letter is found on the floor, or any thing of that kind—I understand the practice of the junior clerks—I have been through every grade myself—that is the general course of proceeding at the office—it is uniformly the case for the juniors to succeed the seniors as they are removed—I never, to my knowledge, omitted to forward a letter—there is a junior clerk on duty every evening, for the purpose of examining newspapers—they draw them from their bands, when they appear suspicious, to examine the date, to see that there is no writing—sometimes there is invisible ink made use of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not the presidents, on busy days, occasionally assist the junior clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—they might put their hands to a trifle—I mean if the president finds the business flag, and thinks the juniors want looking after, he would go to them for that purpose, and perhaps show them how they should do it—the juniors do want considerable looking after—they are very young men, at first—it is occasionally necessary for the President to reprimand them—the habit of counting letters is a matter of consider<lb/>able difficulty to acquire with facility and rapidity, but they come to that progressively—they are Iiable to make a great many mistakes at first—the duty given them at first is proportionably light, till they gain experience—I have never been present officially when Mr. Young and Mr. Barnes have been on duty together—I may have looked in at the office when I have been passing—I have done so in the qualified way I have mentioned—I have no doubt of it in the way I express, but Young may have been on duty or not—I do not remember—I do not go in once a month perhaps—it is impossible to notice who is on duty when I am not on duty, in reference to any given period—I have been on duty with Mr. young—he is a very good officer, and I never no doubt he is improving daily—he could not be a good officer without having improved, as they are quite novices at first, and know nothing of the duty—I never knew him make a large mistake—the mistake in counting up silver and copper is one they alone have to do with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When they send in a bundle of letters, has not the President to report on the accuracy of their statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has; but I said silver and copper—that is between the clerk and the person putting the letter in.</p>

               <p>court, to be called upon to explain acts of official negligence, or other official acts, whether of omission or commission, has excited very sensibly my feelings, and I hope to be pardoned if I say my indignation—Gentlemen, at the outset I must remind you, that I held the responsible situation of President of the Foreign Post-office, a situation which necessarily gave me the control of every act of duty on the part of the officers of that depart<lb/>ment—in every case I was authorized to use discretionary power, and to de<lb/>tain letters if there was any doubt as to the accuracy of their direction of the mode of forwarding them—I am accused of having embezzled small sums of money, and not forwarding the same to the Inland Office—all that I can say to this, is that if any such monies came into my hands for any such purpose, they were, with the letters, for<lb/>warded to the Inland Office—I say, "If they ever came into my hands. "for the first charge bears the date of Wednesday, the 2nd of March, which you have not now before you—on that very evening the Malta, the Buenos Ayres, the Brazils, and the Indian Mails, in addition to the ordinary mails, were made up; and it was with considerable difficulty that they could be prepared for dispatch—I believe the amount of postage received that evening, between five and seven o'clock, equalled, if it did not exceed what is taken on grand post nights, which are Tuesdays and Fridays—but, gentlemen, I am unable to state the exact amount, as an extract from what we term the night charge-book, in which the sums the window-man receives are entered, has been denied me, although I applied by letter to the President for it—my exertions, in addition to the confusion of the evening, may be estimated; for though I was President, and had no obligation to stoop to so menial an officer, I delayed settling the window charges, that I might assist at the sorting table; in fact my presence was constantly required in every part of the office—if I had any letters or money for the Inland Office, I should have sent them there directly, just as I received them, to have kept my table clear—I say, that, not only on post nights, but on every evening, there is an immense pressure of business, and a variety and multiplicity of things to attend to, which it is next to an impossibility that I or any one else can remember, as it relates to every transaction—Gentlemen, it is notorious that Mr. Young, who has been before you, is a very had reckoner; and I, as President, have had very frequent occasions to reprimand him on that account—no account of the transactions of the kind of which I have been speaking are ever kept—many letters going from the Foreign Office to the Inland Office, are completed at the moment out of hand—there is no account kept or taken, likewise, I should mention to you, on the otherwise of the tunnel, the Inland side, of what monies or letters are received—therefore that sum for letters and newspapers, which Young says he believes he gave me (8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) on' if you bear in mind, according to his deposition, he had not previously seen those letters—that some letters were found in my drawer is certain, but it is a circumstance that happens to every public officer, and has happened to myself after twenty-seven years of service—can an act; call it negligence if you will, or rather by its true term, call it accident—is it possible that these letters, from among hundreds, nay thousands, were mislaid, and I neglected them purposely?—is it to be concluded that I intended to steal them?—is it intended to say I intended to steal the postage on them?—as to receiving from Arrowsmith or Young the sums of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., (or as I think in my agitation I may be incorrect as to the amount,) I can only say I have no recollection on the subject—Gentlemen, my house was searched, the peaceful abode of my</p>

               <p>wife and family, and were letters and newspapers found? No—does it not rather prove as strong as proof can be, that the suspicion attached to me is false?—Mr. Young has said that I asked him for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for letters from the Inland Office; and he stated that he did not give it to me at the time, but he did give it to me about a quarter of an hour afterwards, Now this is important, because there is no proof that he gave it to me at all; and this brings me from half past four o'clock to half past five o'clock, when he tells you I was asleep before the fire, and the letters were in my that—he has admitted to you, that he had not given me the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before he saw the letters in my hat—has he satisfied you, Gentlemen, how it happened, that he, a public officer like myself, should see, what must have appeared to him a neglect of duty—should see me asleep before the fire with fatigue, (and those letters, which he must admit, if I had the money for them at that time, ought to have gone down the tunnel)—has he explained to you his neglect of duty, in not awakening me and reminding me of mine? But my Lord and Gentlemen, there is the messenger Craddock, a very respectable and steady officer, for what I know to the contrary, and he says he was on duty on Monday evening from five to eight o'clock, and no such letters came through the tunnel—suppose, as might be the case, that I overlooked them at the moment for the night, and that I put them into the tunnel next morning—I do not say that this was the case—I do not, I cannot, pretend to have any recollection of it; but can you believe me guilty of purloining such sums?—is not the smallness of their amount a proof of my innocence instead of my guilt? Gentlemen, need I further trespass on you concerning the present charge—I am convinced I need not—I almost think I hear you saying to each other, "Can it be possible that this man, who is in the receipt of £500 a year—can it be possible that such an indivi<lb/>dual could have hazarded his situation for the paltry sum with which he is charged?" At all times, if I was in want of money, I could readily procure it from my friends—can you think that, I who have filled in society the station of a gentleman, a man of education; and estimating at no mean rate the blessings which attend those advantages, with a wife and five children—having the approbation of my constant friend, Mr. Henry Free<lb/>ling, the assistant secretary to the Post-office—I ask of you—I request—I desire—I implore you, Gentlemen, to look at these facts, and then, can you conceive it possible?—can you conceive it credible, (even put it is a lower grade of words)—that such a man as I now stand before you, after twenty-seven years of service, during which I trust I have been an honest servant of his Majesty—that I could be mad enough—that I could be such a fool as to put my myself—my character—my family—my existence, all in stake for the value of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman and cashier to Mr. John Lowdon. I was in the shop on Saturday morning—the prisoner called me to him—he said, "Enter this lawn to me"—he was speaking of this lawn—that is not the piece Mr. Attenborough produced—he had not then arrived—there was no one to enter it but I and my brother—I have not entered it—when he told me to enter the second one, he said, "There is 7 1/4 of it, but I do not believe it measures that length"—I said, "To be certain, we will measure it"—but, at the same time, I put down 7 1/4 yards in my book, when he told me there was 7 1/4 yards of it, before we measured it—when he measured it, he said it measured not quite 6 1/2—then says he, "It is not for me, but it is entered to me"—I replied, "It is very strange I should ester it to you, if it is not for you"—he said, "Oh, never mind, just make a memorandum of it"—I did not any thing more to it after that—he said, when I questioned him again, that he was going to Spring-street, but he did not tell me where to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner came on a Friday evening, about half-past seven o'clock—I do not know whether I took this lawn my<lb/>self, or one of my young men; and I, seeing that he put one or two question, went up myself—he offered to pledge this seven yards and nearly one quarter of lawn—when I had taken it, I said to him, "What do you call this?"—says he "Linen"—I said, "No, it is not linen"—he said, "Cambric, aye, cambric"—he said, "No, it is not cambric, I think it is lawn—very fine Irish"—from his very confused manner I was doubtful, and asked where he got it; he said his sister bought it to make the fronts of a set of shirts—I asked the prisoner his address, he said, "No. 1, St. James-place, Hampstead-road"—I asked where he worked, he said, "That is no business of yours; if you do not like it, you may give it me back"—I said, "I cannot do that; if you will give me where you live, you many rely on my treating it with all the delicacy I can"—he then said, "I live at Bell and Bentley's, in Chespside"—I at last let him go—I went that night to Bell and Bentley's—I then went to St. James-place—I found he had lived there, but had left—I made some inquiries, and found the prosecutor—this is the piece he brought me, and which I took to his master's.</p>

I went to the Jolly Sailors public-house to sell oysters—the prisoner asked me, being a countrywoman, to drink with her, which I did—we came away about two o'clock in the day—she said, did I know where she could lodge—I said, no, I had no bed, but that on which my husband and me slept—she said she would make any shift—I said, if I could hear of any place, I would let her know—I went out and met her again about four o'clock, and the she asked me again—I had not the heart 10 refuse her, having a young baby in her arms—I took her in, and had a little soup for my husband's supper—I left her a little of it—I went out a little while, and while I was gone she went away with these things—the woman saw her going and followed her, and then fetched my husband and me—we followed her and husband sent for on officer.</p>

At half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 30th of March, the prisoner Birmingham ran after me in Ox<lb/>ford-street, and asked me to treat her—the public-house were shut up—she asked me to go to a friend of her's which I did—that was at the corner of Crown-street, Soho—knowing her as an old customer, we went up-stairs—I was in the room about seven minutes—she was with me all the time—I was not quite sober—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given for some drink—that</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper at the White Horse. I left on Monday evening, the 21st of March, about a quarter before ten o'clock—the office is up the yard, and is part of the house, but there is no inlet to the office but from the yard—there is no communication with the dwelling-house, except by going through the yard—you must come out into the yard to go the house—there is simply a covered way from the office to the tavern, so that you can pass along without going into the rain—it is part of the house—the rooms over the officer are bed-rooms for gentlemen stop<lb/>ping at the tavern—when I went away at night, I left my desk double locked, and a bar of iron went inside the lid of the desk through the bottom of the desk, where there is a plate of iron which fastens with a padlock—I left the porter in the office when I left—his name is Greenland—he is not here—there was £6 silver, loose in the desk—there were two parcels also which seemed to contain money, which had come by the coach that evening, and which I placed in the desk.</p>

               <p>for security—I do not know myself what they contained—there was also some silver in a bag which was not taken, as something last over it—I was sent for between six and seven o'clock next morning by the porter, and found the desk had evidently been forced open—the padlock had been forced, the tongue of it wrenched up so as to allow the how of the padlock to pass it, and the brass work of the desk-lock had been forced—I missed those parcels and the loose sil<lb/>ver—I examined the office-door—that had not been forced—I made in<lb/>quiry, and on questioning Fletcher, in consequence of what he said, I went in quest of Duncan, and gave him into custody—I found him in the passage of his mother's lodging—the officer searched him, in my presence, and in his boot found four shillings, two of them were new—he told me something at the station-house—I made him no threat or promise—it was entirely voluntary—the officer told me he was crying—when I entered the station-house he was crying, and as soon as he saw me, he said, "I did it, Mr. Maskell, and will tell you all about it"—he said he got into the York coach, which was brought from the coach-factory, and stood in the lane—that he got inside the coach, and remained there till it was drawn into the yard again, at the gates being closed, and at one o'clock he got out, and let himself into my office with a key that he had got—that he took a poker and forced the padlock, and then forced the desk and took the two parcels and the money—that he had been instigated to do it by another boy—he said that he had got a light with some matches and a candle, and that when he had done it, he got out and got into the York coach, where Fletcher saw him, and remained there till the gates were opened, and was drawn in the coach into Fetter-lane—that he then got out, and went to the house of another boy not in custody, and opened the parcel—took out the money and placed it in a cream-jug, to remain there till the matter had blown over—that he took five shillings and spent one, and the remaining four shillings, were in his boot—he said one parcel contained sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and five shillings, which he afterwards corrected, and side was seven shillings—and the other parcel contained a good deal of money—he did not know how much—that they placed all the money in a cream-jug, to save it till it had blown over—he formerly had something to do at our yard—the principal park of the loose silver in my desk was new money, and two of the four shilling found on him were new.</p>

I received instructions respecting the prisoner, which made my attention to him more exact, and my memory more accurate—letters received at the receiving-houses, in different parts of the town, for inland and foreign delivery, are made up in bags for the evening, to he delivered at the Post Office—it often happens that Colonial letters are put into the foreign instead of the inland bags—(<hi rend="italic">the evi<lb/>dence given by the witness in the former case, page 1016, as to the routine of business at the Post Office, was here read to him, which he confirmed</hi>.)—when letters come by mistake into the Foreign Office, they are sent to the Inland Office, by a tunnel, with the money—the money ought not to come into the hands of the President—he ought to send the letters by a messenger to the bag-clerk—that is the usual course of the office—the prisoner had been in the habit of coming himself, in<lb/>stead of sending a messenger, to get the money—I had been spoken to to pay particular attention to Mr. Barnes—on Wednesday evening, the 2nd of March, I was on duty as window-clerk—I came on duty between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and remained on duty all day till half-past seven—the prisoner came to me, about a quarter before five o'clock, with three letters, which he said were to go</p>

               <p>into the Inland Office, and it required 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as the postage—he also read out the amounts of the postage of each letter—one amounted to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say where it was for, but it was very peculiarly marked—I am swear to the appear<lb/>ance of the letter—the others were 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (looking at a letter)—I believe this is the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. letter, as far as I can state—it has a penny-post mark on it, which is another thing which made me notice it—it was a busy might at the office; but at the time he brought me the letters I was not doing any thing at all—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he came about five minutes after, and brought two newspapers, which he said were going to the Mauritius and Madras—he got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—he came again be-seven and eight o'clock, and asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a letter which was to go into the Inland Office—I think he mentioned that it was to go to Nova Soctia✗—I told him, as I had not a letter agreeing with the amount 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he must go to the examiner of the bags, Mr. James—a Nova Scotia letter would property go to the inland office—I was present on Saturday, the 5th of March, at Mr. Peacock's office, when the prisoner was examined—Mr. Peacock came down to the Foreign Office, and he went up with him—Mr. Peacock asked him whether he had forwarded letters which he had been in the habit of coming for the postage for to the Inland Office—he said, "Yes, of course"—he was asked if he had any letters in his drawer—he said, "No"—he was asked if he had any about his person—he said, "No"—when he was told he would be searched, he acknowledged that he had some in his drawer—he was told by the solicitor it would be necessary to hare his person and drawer searched; and he said, a short time afterwards, "Now you ask me particularly, I recollect I have four or five letters in my drawer'—he never said he had any about him that I recollect—two foreign letters were found on his person.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a clerk in the Post Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three years and a half—I am very conver<lb/>sant with the general routine of the Post Office duties—I expect to rise. as we are in the habit of doing, as vacancies occur—when a President is re<lb/>moved, I come rather near the presidency—Mr. Barnes's situation pro<lb/>duced him about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, I rather think—he has always been consi<lb/>dered a very able, intelligent gentleman, and an excellent officer, knowing the duties of the Post Office very well—but not performing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell us this gentleman was not active, able offi<lb/>cer who performed his duties well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do—I have been frequently with him in the office—it was his business to superintend my conduct—it does not occur to me not to make mistakes—the duties are not extremely intricate—it requires no skill or experience at all to make up bun<lb/>dles of letters—it requires to he done with great expedition on busy days—the business ought all to be completed by twelve o'clock—Mr. Barnes has assisted the junior clerks on busy nights—in doing so, he has undoubtedly done more than his own personal duty—it is the usual way to sent the money through the hands of a messenger with the letters to go to the Inland Office—it is the usual and proper way with a president—when Mr. Barnes did it, it would alleviate the duty of the messenger—Mr. Barnes would be entitled to transfer the money he receives for the postage through the tunnel by the hand of a messenger—he was not compelled to carry them to the tunnel himself—if I had been disengaged I would have done it, if he had asked me—we are all together in the office, but not pro<lb/>miscously—the messengers are on one side, and the clerks on the other—there are fire places in the office, round one of which we(the clerks) gather, and the messengers round the other—the President and clerks mix round the fire—the messengers are in the habit of stirring our fire—the messen<lb/>gers are not allowed to come and sit with us—they come when we send for them—I do not know whether the President gives security to the Crown for the situation he holds—I am in the habit of attending the window, but I am not called the window clerk—it I a term used among us—there are seven of us altogether—Mr. Barnes may have sent the money to the tun<lb/>nel by any of the inferior clerks—probably if he had asked a President he would not have objected; hut there being only one President on duty, he could not ask him—there are two Presidents, and a superintending Presi<lb/>dent in the office—there are sixteen clerks.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you say Mr. Barnes was in the habit of coming to you for these letters, did you ever refuse him on any occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the usual course is to send a messenger—I could not object to Mr. Barnes having the money and letters from me—he might think proper to send the messenger to the tunnel—my business finished about thirty five minutes after seven o'clock, on the 2nd of March—I think Mr. Barnes finished about eight o'clock—I can say it is before twelve o'clock—his duty would finish at eleven o'clock—that was the time of their leaving every night, except post nights—that is the time they are authorized to leave—on Tuesdays sad Fridays they are sometimes there till after twelve o'clock—he is not obliged to sleep at the Post Office on Tuesdays and Fridays—I cannot tell whether he slept there on the Wednesday night—there is a bed room and sitting room on purpose for the President—I believe Mr. Barnes has a wife and family, and a house in the country—I know he has been in the habit of sleeping at the Post Office on busy night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time do you go away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Tuesdays and Fri<lb/>days at twelve o'clock—on other nights it varies—I always sleep there myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mr. Barnes came to you for the letters, he came at a time when you were particularly at leisure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I had no<lb/>thing to do at all—I was not employed on any thing at the time—my at<lb/>tention was not then drawn by any important office business—that did not give me an opportunity of examining the letters particularly—I could have done it—he came to me the second time about five minutes after—he might have come at a time when I was more fully employed; and he did so, between seven and eight o'clock—he was first asked in the So<lb/>licitor's Office whether he had forwarded the letters he had been in the habit of receiving the postage on—I was asked at Bow street what he said at Mr. Peacock's office—I do not think I made the same statement on that occasion—I answered the questions that were asked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have the mistakes, which you say have occurred, occurred when Mr. Barnes was President, or when any body else was Pre<lb/>sident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both—no mistake was ever made by me which subjected me to any police inquiry—there is no great nicety required in conducting let<lb/>ters through the tunnel—there is a person appointed to do it—if any body else chose to do it, he has nothing to do but walk to the tunnel and put it in—the messenger merely comes to our fire place when called, and leaves again—the number of window clerks on duty at the same time varies—there was none besides myself on duty on the 2nd of March—I was the only window clerk that night—Mr. Barnes did not order me to take the letter and money to the tunnel—I did not hear anybody ordered to do so—the tunnel closed that evening at eight o'clock—he had from</p>

               <p>five to eight o'clock to send the letters through the tunnel—i said nothing to him about receiving letters out of the usual course, because I had no bu<lb/>siness to interfere with a superior officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the President had sent the messenger to the bag-man, and the bagman had received the money and the letter, what would be the messenger's duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would take it, with the money, to the tunnel, and put it into the box to be conveyed over—that is the usual course—he would leave the foreign letter with Mr. Barnes, and take the money and inland letters to the tunnel—it would be the messenger's duty to take the money and the inland letter to the tunnel—he might or might not have to carry the foreign letter, it might be handed to him by the bagman himself—he might take the foreign letter to the President.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at no. 7, Shire-lane. It is a lodging-house for girls to live in—they out the rooms for girls—I live in the first floor, and have done so for the last three months—I met the prosecutor in Fleet-street, just by Temple-bar—he cam up and said "Where are you going?"—I said, "Home."—he said, "Have you got a room of your own?"—I said, "Yes"—and took him up-stairs—he said he would give me two or three shillings, instead of which he only gave me one shilling—he had satisfaction for it, and then tried to wrench the shilling out of my hand because I would not let him stop any longer—he caught me by the throat—I hallooed out "Murder"—and two or three young women came up stairs, and young man came up, but that was not the prisoner—the prosecutor could not get the shilling from me—he threw me down violently—I don't know the young man's name who came up—I never saw him before—he was in his drawers and shirt—he was quite a stranger—he came down and pulled the prosecutor away from me, and took his hands from my throat—the prosecutor tore my shawl all to pieces—the young man is here—i will swear the prisoner was not there—I did not see him—he was not there at all—he never came of the house—there was a violent knocking at the door, and he went to know what was wanted—he was stirring fire, and went to ask what was the matter—I did not run down stairs till he was taken in charge—I never saw the poker—no man went to the door with a poker, that I saw—there are poker in all the rooms—there was no fire in my room—only one of the girls are here, as I could not tell who they were hardly—the prisoner was not in the houses at all—I can swear he was not there—I can, indeed—I had my shilling after all—the man took no money from the prosecutor at all—he took my shawl and pulled him away from me—the prosecutor did not lose a half<lb/>penny—nobody took hold of his waistcoat pocket—I never saw the man before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-trimmer, and live in Great New-street, Fet<lb/>ter-lane. I work there now—I was in this house, in Shire-lane, with a young woman who is behind—she was quite a stranger—I was at the top of the house, in bed and asleep—I went to bed about ten o'clock—(I was in the house once before—i do not know one of the girls)—I was asleep, and heard a tremendous noise, and call of "Murder"—the young woman said, "For God's sake go down, and see what is the hatter"—I put on my trowsers, and pushed the door open—I ran in, and he got this woman down, and nearly strangled her—I got between them and parted them—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I gave her a shilling, and I will have it back again"—the girl said, "You shall not"—I said, "Do not have a piece of work here"—there were blows struck amongst them, but I kept the blows off him, and off the girl—another girl came in, and I kept the blows off for peace—they both fought like devils—I kept them off, and said, "You had better go away young man"—I said, "What have you got round your arm?"—he had the girls's shawl—I said, "Go away; I will see you shall not be hurt"—the shawl was given up, and I saw him safe out of the room—I was in my drawers—I never saw the prosecutor in my life before—as soon as I put him of the room, I went up-stairs again, and do not know what happened afterwards—I went to sleep, and heard no more of the case—I came down with nothing but shirt and drawers on, and had no waistcoat or night-cap on—the prisoner's hair is black—I have light hair—I was never in a row before in my life, but I do not like to hear a female call murder—I saw no poker—there was no fire in our room—I was never in the other rooms—there was no fire in the girls's room, nor any poker—there might be a poker and tongs, but the poker never stirred out of its place—i did not take the poker myself—that happened down stairs—the prisoner was in the house down stairs—I never saw him. but it appears he was in the house—it appears that he went out and struck the man—i will swear the prisoner was not in the room at all—I believe he was in the room down, stairs, in the parlour; because, when the prosecutor knocked at the door, he went out to know what was the matter I have been told so but I never saw—i have been to the house since I left my address there, in case I should be wanted on behalf of the innocent man—I left word where to come to me—the prosecutor was not robbed at all—he gave a shillings, and wanted to rob the girl of her shawl—I did not turn him out—I never went down stairs—I did not go to the street door.</p>
               <p>---- ----. I am an unfortunate girl, and live in Shire-lane. I know the last witness, by his being with me Friday night—I met him in Fleet-street—I had seen him once or twice before, but not to know his name—he only slept with me one—Friday night was the first time I had any thing to say him—I have spoken to him in the street before, but nothing further—I was never with him in that house before—I am quite sure of that—except seeing him in the street, he was quite a stranger to me be<lb/>fore I met him—about ten o'clock there was a great noise, and I directly said there is murder being called—he put on his drawers, and went down stairs—he was down stairs a quarter of an hour—when he came up he told me what bad passed down stairs—I kept in bed—I did not get out—I know the prisoner by this living down stairs with his wife in the parlour—I never knew anything further of him than peace and quietness—I never saw any harm of him—I do not know what age his wife is: she is older than I am—she is not the mistress of the house—I pay rent to the lady next door—she rents two houses—I cannot tell how his wife gets her living—they live in the parlour—I dare say they have a poker is their room—I have been there a month—he lived there before I went—I cannot say how many girls were in the house at the time, for I was not out of my bed—there are about seven rooms in the house, I think—I lodge up-stairs, at the top of the house—the door of the house is always open, for people to come in and out.</p>

I cannot say whether it is Holy or Little Trinity-parish—on the 31st of March I went there in the afternoon to look for the foreman—my master has a warehouse there, on the second floor—I found the prisoner on the top of the stairs, with a basket containing fourteen decanters, which had been taken from a shelf in an inner warehouse—there was another man with him, he was not secured he ran down stairs, and left a hat and decanter by the side of the basket—the prisoner lifted a basket from his shoulder and ran up two or three stairs—in two or three minutes he come down, went down on his knees, and begged pardon—he begged I would him go, and said he had been into it by the other—I left him in charge of a man on the first floor, and fetched Forrester—i found the warehouse door open—the lock was shot, as it would be when it caught and there were marks on the door, as if a small instrument had been applied to wrench it open—there was a hay fork near, and the marks are such as that would make.</p>

I said to Mr. Brown, "You had better go and apprehend this man," giving a description of the man—I was then sent again to Clerkenwell—I was again examined at Worship-street—I asked Brown if he had apprehended the person—he said "No" and I was committed—I had a friend came to see me here—I said, "Have you heard about the apprehension of this man Elderfield"—he said, "No"—I told him to go to the office and inform the magistrate of the person, giving him a descrip<lb/>tion of the man—Graves the officer from Worship-street, came down to me—I was called to Mr. Cope's office—he brought a little note with him with the name of the person on it—he said, "Is this the person you want?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—he said' "Perhaps I can find the man; I do not know whether I can or not"—he went away, and I never heard any thing more of him, till my wife came down and told me that the man had been apprehended and examined at Worship-street, and they let him go again—as to my knowing the things came through a dishonest channel—I knew it no more than an infant unborn—I understand the man has since absconded—he was apprehended and I could do not more than I did, as an individual locked up in jail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Post Office. On the 4th of March I was on duty at the window—i came on duty between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and remained till six o'clock in the evening—Mr. Arrowsmith was with me part of the time—we told up some money at three o'clock in the afternoon—that was part of the money we had received in the course of the day for forwarding letter—we separated the gold from the silver and copper—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in copper—when I had counted the money I placed it in a drawer by my side—the gold was on the lid of my charge box, by the window—a person could not reach it from without by putting his arm through the window—after counting up the money Mr. Barmen and Bailey the messenger were in the office besides us—Bailey was not near the box after I put the money there—the prisoner is a Presidents in the Foreign Office—he came to the office about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—the money was then lying where it had been before—I was at the window, and Mr. Arrowsmith was at the fire-place—while I was there Mr. Campbell came to the window, outside—he belongs to the Post Office—he had something to say—after he said what he had to say to me, the prisoner came to the window and spoke to him—I went and stood behind the window and when Mr. Campbell went I closed the window—I left the alphabet which we call the window, and went to the fire-place, leaving the prisoner in the alphabet where the window is—(I bad counted the money twice before Mr. Campbell came up—Mr. Arrowsmith counted it with me—we had a reason for being particular in counting the money—the prisoner came to the window two or three minutes after we had last counted it, and it was not touched by any person from the time I counted it till he camel—the prisoner stood at the window two or three minutes—he then came and opened the door of the screen, and looked out, and then closed the door again—the screen is between the window and the fire-place—it would hide day body at the window from the sight of any one at the fire-place—he came out afterwards, to where we were standing, and we returned to the window—he staid in the office—we counted the money again, and found that one sovereign was missing.</p>
               <p>

               <p>except myself—the prisoner was near enough to have taken it—I had some packet of letters counted and made up—they were counted by the amount of postage, in parcels of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—shortly after I missed the money I found one of the packets was much smaller than I had left it—that was shortly five o'clock—I found 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of letters wanting—the money I produce from the office must tally with the letters I produce—the prisoner knew that—shortly after seven o'clock, he came to me and told me the parcels after me)—he parcels of letters 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—(he counted the parcels after me)—he told me if I would write an allowance for that amount he would sign it—I did so, and he signed it—this is it; "Allow 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., J. Barnes"—it is dated on the back—it is an old ticket of mine—that is the docket he singed—it makes even the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wanting—I am sure I had not miscounted the letters that day—the signing of this paper for the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would make up the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which would ac<lb/>count for the sovereign—this "J. Barnes" is the prisoner's hand—writing—this making an allowance is a very unusual circumstance—i never knew it happen before—I have been in the office fifteen months—the proper course if a mistake is made is to re-tell the letters by a third person, and deduct the amount deficient from my charge ticket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that a person intending to steal a sovereign, and supply a portion of the money in letters, must have counted the postage on them, to see how much they amounted to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no necessity for his counting them—he might have guessed at it, as they were parcels of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—the manner in which we usually place them are in 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels, and they appeared to be told up—I cannot myself tell whether they were told up, but they stood in a box in the manner we place them when they are told up—if he had taken half of one of the parcels, it is most probable he would have got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, or something very hear it—there is a great variety in the postage of foreign letters, but there was not much on that day—it was not an idle day, but there were only regular mails made up that day—there was not much to do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183604040213"/>
               <p>at that time of day—not till about five o'clock—less on that day them any other, because longer time was allowed to put the letters up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Barnes night have walked into his private room to secrete any thing he chose, as you were not busy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not allowed for the pre<lb/>sidents to go out of the office—they have done it, but it is contrary to rules—he might have gone up to his private room—I missed a sovereign—I counted the money by design.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing whatever to prevent you, if you thought he had taken the sovereign, to have had him searched on the spot, and called in assistance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an objection—there was nothing to prevent my doing so if I chose—I was desired by Mr. Wagstaff not to mark the money—there was no search made—the sovereign was mentioned to Mr. Barnes himself by the solicitor next morning—i do not know whether Mr. Young was present—i think he was there was no search made for the letters that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Mr. Barnes had taken letters that must they not have been detected on his person, if he was searched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they might not, because he might have sorted them off to their different destination—there would not be say postage inquired for—Mr. Barnes charges the postage to the junior—he might have left them if he contermplated a fraud; but it could not have been discovered that the had taken them; he might have sorted them off without it being discovered that the had taken them—it would have concealed his part in the transaction—the sorting of the letters is done at the left-hand side of the of the room from the fire—they are sorted off in two boxes on the left-hand side from fire-place—they are two boxes, with the separate countries written on the different boxes—Mr. Barnes having got the letters, might have sorted them off in these boxes, without its ever being known that he had that them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>Campbell was—there is a board of considerable width outside the window, to prevent people coming hear it, on purpose that they may not take the money; and there is one inside also—it is placed so that a person outside should communicate with the person inside, to put in letters and pay postage—Mr. Campbell came between half-past four and five o'clock and I counted the money about that time—we could have taken the prisoner at the moment if we had an officer—we never desired by the superintending President not to do so—we could not do it without anthority—we had authority to devise the plan—Mr. Wagstaff is the superintending President of the Foreign Office—he was in the Post-office that day—I went out of the Foreign Office after having missed the sovereign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing to prevent your going to Mr. Wagstaff and in<lb/>forming him of the fact, and getting an offer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know how to act exactly—there was nothing to prevent my reporting it to Mr. Wag<lb/>staff and he might have done what he pleased—there is always an officer in attendance at the Post Office—I could have followed Mr. Barnes till six o'clock to see what he did with the letters; but Mr. Young's duty was at the window.</p>

SCARLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take this plan in your hand (<hi rend="italic">handing him one</hi>) the window opens into a hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Campbell came to that window—a person putting his hand in at the window would first come to a stone✗ ledge—he would have to reach his hand over a wall, which is three-quarters of a yard—there is then a wooden ledge, inside the room—a person's area must be about a yard and a half long to reach the box—the peculiar situa<lb/>tion of the window would prevent a person reaching his body in—Mr. Wag<lb/>staff had desired em to be very particular in observing the different thing I had accused Mr. Barnes of—Mr. Wagstaff was not on duty, I believe, at the time I made this discovery—i made a reported to him that night—then were two bundles of letters with the money—we do up a bundle, amount<lb/>ing to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that is the usual amount of a bundle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it never vary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the usual mode—I never knew it very, but it might have been done so on this occasion—I cannot swear they were counted up—we never tell them up till they come to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the last bundle might be less then the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SCARLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe the size them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were nearly of an equal size—they appeared 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bundle—if the money had been taken away and the letters left, it would have excited suspicion—I did not look at the letter afterwards—the sorting begins at six o'clock—it would not be a remarkable circumstance to sort letters before that—if these letters had been taken, they might have been sorted out, and sent to their destination, so that they could be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Police Office, Hatton-garden. On the 15th of March I was in Church-street, St. Giles's in company with Hall, Reynolds, and Palmer, all belonging to the police—I went to No. 8, Church-street, to the one pair of stairs room, and found the door fastened—I was followed by Reynolds—we endeavoured to force the door, and after some difficulty did so—I saw the female prisoner standing in the middle of the room, and the male prisoner on the right hand side, near the fire-place, in his shirt sleeves—they were tucked up—I had heard the woman call, out, before I got in, "What do you want?" or something of the sort—previous to seeing the man, I heard something rattle like money—it was just about the time that I forced the door open—the prisoner hands were very black—I took him away from the past where he stood, near the fire-place—the fire was very brisk indeed—I proceeded after that, to search the fire-place, and observed a iron spoon in the fire, red hot—on a chair very near the fire-place I found a metal spoon, with the end of it partly melted off—on the table I found a pair of scissors, and also a small piece of mental, which had been melted—on the right hand hob of then hob of the fire<lb/>place I found two shilling, and on the left hand bon one shilling—they were quite warm at the time I took them off the hob—the two are dated 1817, the other 1820—I afterwards proceeded to search the fire-place more particularly, and up the chimney, on a ledge, on the right hand side, as far as I could reach with my arm, I found a mould for shillings, which I handed over to Hall, to take care of—I searched farther, and on the same ledge of the chimney I found another mould, for half-crowns, which I produce—they are made of plaster-of-Paris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's Mint, and have been so nearly twenty years. I have examined the articles produced—there are three plaster-of-Paris mould; one for the casting of half-crowns one for a shilling, and one for a sixpences—they all appear to have been used for the purpose of casting coin—the date of the sixpenny-mould is 1816—there are two counterfeit sixpences produced which correspond with that mould, and, I believe, have been cast in it—they correspond in all respects with the mould—there are one or two trifling accidental marks on the coin, of which I find corresponding ones on the mould, which enables me to be<lb/>lieve they have been cast in the mould—here is a mould for casting shil<lb/>lings, the impression of which bears the date of 1820; and I find, among twelve conterfeit shillings produced, eight of them correspond with that mould in all respects—the half-crown mould has been used, but there is no coin of that date—the coin is made of Britannia metal, which is a mixture of tin and antimony; and the spoon is of the same metal—here is an iron spoon, which appears to have been on the fire, and to have some white me<lb/>tal in it similar to the spoon—it is possible it might have been used for melting the white metal—this plaster-of-Paris is the material of which the mould are made—the scissors night be used to clip the superfluous metal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an innkeeper and coach-proprietor, and live at Banbury, in Oxfordshire. I saw the prisoner at Banbury on Thursday evening the 10th of March—i had some slight knowledge of him before, but was not acquainted with him—I first saw him under the gateway of the old George public house, at Banbury, on Thursday evening—I was led to him by a young man whom I had employed to sell five horses in the market—he took me to the prisoner—he said he was about making a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> for our of my horses, for this one, if I was agreeable—I said I should like to see the <hi rend="italic">chop</hi>—I said to my young man, "Is this the gentleman you mean?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are about to make a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> for four of my horses, I under<lb/>stand?"—he said, "Yes, if you are agreeable"—I then said I could not make out exactly which four he meant, and went into the stable to see the horses—the young man had got one which I had told him not to being—I said I should not part with that one, but if he thought well I would make the bargain with the other four—he said he would not have that taken away, for it was the best of the lot, and he could not think of parting with his horses without I gave more money—i said I understood the horse was a <hi rend="italic">roarer</hi>, and I had rather not <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> with him—he said mine was worn out, and his was very valuable—I said we might as well go into the house, which we did, and there we made a bargain for four of my horses and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this one of his—I gave him my four horses and a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horse he had—I asked him who he got it from, and whose it was—he said it was a gentlemen's horse and the gentleman had used it in a four-wheeled carriage—he did not say the bought it of him—I asked it the horse had not been in coach-harness before—he said no, it was a gentlemen's horse, and had been in a four-wheeled carriage and the only reason he sold it was because he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—I said, "If your horse is all right, he is worth a good deal of money; but my young man says he is a roarer"—I told him twice I had rather not have any thing to do with it, but if it was all right, it was a valuable horse—he said the gentleman's sole reason for selling it was that it was a roarer, and he did not like to hear it make a noise up the hills—i gave him a check on purpose that I should get his name, and I wrote down the name he gave me at the time, and have it here—he said his name was, I believe, "John Brown, Byfield, Near Oakingham, Berks"—I am not quite certain of his Christian name—I said, "Oakingham is in Rutlandshire, is it not?"—he said, "No, in Berkshire"—I got the horse home—I suspected it was not a roarer, and thought he could not have got it honestly, said and I came up to London to Smith fields—I got there on the next Friday week, and saw the prisoner there—I told him the horse had proved a stolen one—he said, "the devil he had; then of course you must have your money again"—he wanted to know how it was found out—I said, "A gentleman's servant has been to my house, and owned it"—I do not know what an<lb/>swer he made—i said, "Of course you know who you had him of"—he said he bought him of a man as he was returning from Henley fair—I said, "You know the man, do you not?"—he said, "Not well enough I am afraid;" but he said, if I could go home with him, he could find the man he bought him of—the wished to call me aside afterwards—I said, "What have you done with my four horse?"—he said he sold them</p>

On the 18th of March, the prisoner called on me for the purpose of bying a keeper ring—I went to get the key of the drawer, and on my return missed her from the shop, and a shawl—I looked out, and saw her in the street—I ran after her, and she ran—I caught her in the next street, and she had the shawl in her possession then—I had not sold it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Turrell, a gardener—who lives at Blackheath. On the 5th of April I was at Greenwich Fair, looking at the shows—the prisoner cut my gown, my petticoat, and my pocket, and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I caught him by the collar with my left hand, and said, "You naughty boy, you have cut my pocket"—he said, "No, mistress, I have not; my brother is here—my brother is here"—and he swung himself out of my hand, and went under the steps of the show—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and I lost them—I found my gown, petticoat, and pocket had two holes in them—I had felt my money safe two minutes before, when I had my hand in my pocket, and I suppose he heard the money rattle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter out of employ—my last place was at the Crown and Anchor booth, at Greenwich fair.

I was sitting with one young woman—I did not ask him to drink—I might have drank out of his pot—he did not shake me to awake me—he was standing before me agitated when I awoke—previous to this he had no money, for he borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of one of his fellow-workmen—he said he was gone to the booth while I went for the police<lb/>man, and he would come and pay for a pot of beer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 29th of March about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Walworth—I received information, and went to the Crown at Peckham—I saw Wilson playing in the skittle-ground—I said, I wanted him, to step out with me—he came out; and when on the road I asked him, if he had seen Hastings—he said he had not since last night—he said he was with him from eleven o'clock until half-past eight o'clock—I took him to the station-house, and took the shoes off his feet I went to Mr. Fletcher's garden—the foot<lb/>marks exactly corresponded with the nails in his shoes—there was marks of more than one person there—I went to search the house where he lives—I found nothing there; but I saw the ground in his mother's garden had been disturbed—I got a spade and dug up there five cloaks, all buried under ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No.5, Artillery-place, Bermondsey, Mr. William Everett put me and my brother in to take charge of the premises—he formerly occupied the house, and left it for the purpose of its being pulled down—the house does not belong to him—he was the former tenant—he</p>

               <p>pays the rent for it till it comes down for the Rail-road—I have every reason to believe he is not settled with by the Railway Company—my bro<lb/>ther works for him as a labouring man, and sleeps in the house as well as myself—on the 30th of March I was sitting in the parlour, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and heard a stamping over my head—it was a sin<lb/>gular noise, and lasted for a considerable time, at least an hour—I had not been out during the day, and did not think any body could be in the house—after hearing the bell-wire pulling by my side, and the tea-things rattling, I became alarmed, and was too frigntened to go out immediately—in the course of a short time I saw the two prisoners open the door, and come into the room—when they saw me they retreated—I followed them—they went through the passage to the stair-case—I followed, and got up to them on the stair-case—I instantly caught hold of Griffiths, and said to him, "It is you that have so frightened and alarmed me"—he said nothing to that—Callaghan was in the front, and Griffiths behind him—there are same small stairs leading to the yard, and the oil-cloth was torn—I hit Griffiths, and said." You worthless villian, it is you that alarmed me; I have a sword in the next room; had I known it, I would have run it through you"—both tried to make their escape, one before the other, and they fell to the ground—I then ran to the front of the house, and gave an alarm—Griffiths was coming through a crowd which I had round me, and I caught hold of him by his bo<lb/>som, and saw he had my pillow-case—Goodman afterwards came to my assistance, and he found out the other prisoner—there were two holes made in the wall, and a brick taken out at a time—the hole was boarded up—it is of an immense size, and would either lead to the stable or the back part of the house—you can get into the house through the wall—it is the wall of a garden—if a person came through the hole, they would first come into the garden—there was, a short time ago, a hole under my kitchen stairs, but that has been blocked up—I found the articles named in the indictment disturbed—some were mine, and some my brother's, who lives with me, and also his wife's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Mortlook, and live at Merton, in Surrey. On the 26th of March, I had to send my goods down to my husband—I was then living in Tottenham-court-road—I sent them by the errand-cart man who lives at Merton—I expected to go with him; but when he came, I could not go—in consequence of some circumstances, I thought it necessary to go to the Elephant and Castle, between ten and twelve o'clock at night—I took the wrong road, and got down to Peckham, and had to inquire my way back to the Elephant and Castle; and in order to get home as quickly as possible, I thought I would hire a cab—I saw the prisoner with a cab—I asked him what he would take me to Merton for—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked if there were any turnpikes—he said yes, them was one—I asked what the toll would be—he said 5 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, unless he would take me for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and pay the turnpike, I could not go—he agreed, and I got in—he said it would make no difference if I gave him the money then—I gave him three shillings and four sixpences, which was all I had, except one farthing—he told me to wait, while he went across the way, and he went—I waited, and he did not come—I got into the cab; and, instead of his coming, three men came to try to get me out—I re<lb/>sisted, and would not get out—the prisoner found they could not get me out, and he came himself, and insisted upon my getting out of the cab—he said, what did I do in that cab—I told him I had paid him the money to go to Merton, and till he took me there I would not get out—he said he was not the man, and knew nothing about it—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man who had the money—he insisted upon my getting out, and said he would pull me out—I dared him to do it, and he got up to push me out—I called the policeman, who came and took him—I told the policeman he was the man I had paid the money to—the prisoner made no answer—I am quite sure he was the man who had the custody of the cab when I first of all went up, and the person to whom I paid the money—he sat in the cab when I went up, and he went away, and left me there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I knew nothing at all about the case till the men came, and told me that a woman was in my cab—it was half-past twelve o'clock before I got on the stand—I took a gentleman to Peckham from the same stand at a quarter past ten, and did not return till half-past twelve—I then went to the cook-shop to get my supper. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I went up close to the cab, and spoke to the driver—I cannot say how many cabs were on the stand, but his was the last one—I did not go out of sight of the cab, nor more than five yards from it no other cab came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. This man was drunk, and the prosecutrix was intoxicated—if not drunk, I have witnesses to prove all this—I was in the gentleman's company, (Mr. Phelps,) and never left the Red Cow, at Peckham, till a quarter past twelve o'clock.</p>
