Smith felt for my buckles; says he those are silver; yes, says I, they are; says he, we must have them: they took no farther notice of my buckles, but seeing my chain, they asked for my watch; my buckles were very strong made, however massey they are, in trying whether they were silver or not, one of them was broke; I then pulled out my gold watch and gave it to them, and a metal chain, and three gold seals. I had very fortunately made a present of a gold chain which I had a few days before; just as I was handing the watch, says Smith, to me, I do not believe there is a guinea in the purse; yes, says I, you will find there is: and says I, there are some papers of consequence; I had a draft for two hundred guineas in the purse. I must confess that their behaviour towards me was such, that gave me, notwithstanding my fright, some degree of courage; they did not use one bad expression, they behaved extremely civil, more than I could expect; I then said, gentlemen, it is a metal watch, and a metal seal, they are of little consequence to you, I should be obliged to you for one of the seals, which has my coat of arms on it: the man that held the bridle, says, why d - n me, give it to the gentleman, give it to him; that is the man that is not here. Smith tried to tear off the seal, but he could not; and I said it goes on a swivel, if you will give it to me I will take it off; but Smith would not trust me with the watch, and he held it while I took off the seal. I said, have you spit your spite? they said yes: then says I, shake hands, and Smith shook hands with me, and he wished me a good night, and I wished them good luck; that was full eight minutes, it was the longest day. I wish I had the least doubt of them, I wish I had.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt? - Oh, none; I swear to him both by his face and his coat: I wish I had any doubt, I should be glad to save the lives of two fellow creatures; they had their hats on, round hats; these two men were quite near my chaise, the other man I could not positively swear to; I did not see them till I saw them at the Justice's the Tuesday following: I believe this was on the Tuesday before. I never recovered any of my property.</p>

That gentleman's father found me, and summoned me up; his father is a carpenter; I lived near St. Thomas's Hospital; I have changed my habitation lately; I do not know the prisoner's occupation.</p>

I went to bed the 12th of July, about ten; I was not alarmed in the night; I was called about five in the morning; my house was all fast when I got up. One of my lodgers concealed himself in the kitchen after we were gone to bed; there were spring locks and bolts; and he opened the door to give the property out to another; he owned to it; the prisoner

               <p>On Saturday evening, the 16th of July, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, and asked for some muslin; I shewed her some; there was another woman who had come in about ten minutes before, and said she must be served immediately, or could not stay, who asked for the same kind; it was rather dark, and the prisoner asked for a light; I said she had better take it to the door to look at it, as I had no person to get a light, for a friend of mine came in at the time, and being rather embarrassed with the two customers, and suspecting them, I asked him to attend on the prisoner, while I attended on the other; I went again to the prisoner, and she had fixed on some muslin, and asked the price; I asked her eight shillings and six-pence; she said she wanted two yards, and would give me eight shillings; just at that moment my master Mr. Hinckesman came, and I told the prisoner to go to him, and he would cut it off for her; I then counted my muslins, and found one piece gone, and told the other person to write on a piece of paper, and take it to Mr. Hinckesman, that I suspected the prisoner had taken a piece of muslin; he let her go out, and I followed her, and brought her back into the shop, and I saw her drop this piece of muslin from her.</p>

               <p>Your master came in before this could have been removed? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Treadway. After this woman was in your custody, she was left alone for a considerable time, and might have gone away if she had chose it? - She might certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was with her? - Simmons was with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Simmons. On your suspecting that these persons did not mean what was honest, and the other pressing you to attend to her, you directed your friend to attend to the prisoner particularly, whilst you served the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was then particularly directed to attend to this woman, and to see whether she did any thing that was wrong? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that whether your friend saw the muslin removed afterwards, of course you cannot tell?</p>

He said he wanted nothing, and said, that he would have all that ever I had got.</p>
               <p>Did he say nothing before that? - No, nothing at all; only he would have all I had got. I desired him to let me alone, and let me go home, he would not; he put his hands in my pockets, I made a noise, and he knocked me down, and took all I had for any thing I knew; I got up as soon as I could, and charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>What did he knock you down with, with his fist or his hand, not with any instrument? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he get your money before he knocked you down, or afterwards? - Afterwards, while I was on the ground; he took two guineas, two shillings, and some halfpence; I cried out; nobody came to my assistance; I did not quit sight of him; I got up, and charged the watch with him, and he was taken to the watch-house, as nigh as I can guess it was near the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What is the watchman's name? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you ask her any questions, prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Atkinson, on Monday morning you came up to me at the corner of the Little Sanctuary, you came and took hold of my arm; did not you walk with me to the corner of Love-lane? - No; I never saw you in my life before you attacked me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. For shame, woman, consider what you are about here, I am standing for my life! My Lord, she took me to the narrow lane, very near over her shoes, at the back of the Plow, in Love-lane. - There we went together, she asked me if I would go and lay with her; I told her no, I had a wife at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. About how long was the man with you? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed between you? - No conversation passed at all, he came up, and said he would have all that ever I had; I was not willing to part with my money, and he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him in these ten minutes while he was insulting you? - said nothing at all, but called out.</p>
               <p>Where did he hit you? - Over the breasts, a man is more powerful than a woman.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be in liquor? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor yourself? - Yes, a little.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation respecting the prisoner, in which you said you did not mean to hurt him? - No, I said nothing at all but that I would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>You never acknowledged you was in liquor, and did not intend to prosecute him? - No; the Constable has my money; he left me sixpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>How came you out so late at night? - I had been with my sister in Holborn at tea, and I got a little drop of liquor, I was in company besides.</p>
               <p>What company was you in? - I was along with the man that I live with, he was drinking, and I was drinking with him.</p>
               <p>Where was you drinking with him? - I cannot tell, somewhere in Holborn.</p>
               <p>At how many houses? - At one or two, he would not come along, he would have more liquor; we fell out and parted, so I went one way and he went another, that made me have this misfortune.</p>
               <p>When had you seen your money before you lost it? - I saw it in Holborn.</p>
               <p>On what occasion did you look at it in Holborn? - I looked at the money I had got.</p>
               <p>What made you look at it? - Because I insisted on having the money from the man I live with, I thought I could take better care of it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200017"/>What sort of man is he? - He lives in Westminster, his name is Young, I live in Westminster.</p>

I went round and met the prisoner and the woman, she said, this man has robbed me of two guineas; the man was walking a middling pace from her, not very fast; she ran after him, he knew me, he spoke to me, I stopped him: she came up, and would have made it up for the two guineas.

The prisoner said, he was sure she had not two guineas. Says I, my friend, it seems very odd; says he, she had no money at all. I searched her first, and found sixpence, and a halfpenny on her; and he would insist on my searching him, so I searched him. Says I, what money have you got? says he, I have a farthing. I found a good farthing upon him; he had a blue jacket on, I shook it; says I, what have you got here in the left hand pocket withinside? says he, it is some halfpence; then I put in my hand, and pulled out some halfpence, and I this quantity of money, and laid it down on the table; it was all loose, I spread it, and there were two guineas among it. The woman said, them are my two guineas. The man was frightened, and could not speak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did the woman say any thing about being knocked down? - She said she had been pushed or shoved down.</p>

I went with her into this Love-lane, and there she wanted me to lay with her. I asked her what I should give her, and she said a shilling; I gave her a shilling, while I was giving her that, she was rifling my pockets with her own hand; she shoved her hand and mine into her pocket; I got the money out of her hand, and I thought it was my own, and shoved it all into my pocket.</p>

               <p>I became first acquainted with the prisoner at an inn, the sign of the Providence, the 12th of May. We came from Paris to London the 25th, at four o'clock, at Charing-cross, we dined together there, and he took me from there to a Mrs. Smithers, in <placeName id="t17910720-12-crimeloc63">Downing-street</placeName>

Minett's and Fector, in London; I always went to the Bank, to change the notes in gold, always by the advice of the prisoner; we went together besides to Mr. Hammersley's, we received the notes on Monday morning from Mess. Minett and Fector, and on the Tuesday following, went to get the money in cash from Mess. Hammersley; but as it had a month to run, I did not get but half, all in gold. I put all my money in a trunk at Mrs. Smithers's, my bank notes in my pocket-book in the trunk, on Tuesday the 31st of May.</p>
               <p>Where did you spend the day? - On Tuesday I put the money in about eleven o'clock, and went out walking, and afterwards dined near the theatre, about half past four; then we went to the play, and almost immediately after we went in, the prisoner left me in the pit; he begged my pardon, and would be back immediately, and I never saw him till he was taken. I went home about eleven o'clock, conducted by a young man, and found my trunk locked with a key; I opened the trunk in the presence of three people, and found every thing gone. I had the whole amount of the remittance that I brought from abroad, the prisoner counted it for me, I do not know myself. I lost a diamond ring, seventy double louis d'ors, they were all in the trunk; I had part of it in a little bag by itself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. When you was in Paris together, did not you live as friends? - We did; he told me he was a Scotchman, and would interpret for me.</p>
               <p>Then you came from Paris together as friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you arrived in London, you looked upon him as your friend? - On my arrival in London he offered me his lodgings, for he said where he lodged there was always a spare bed.</p>
               <p>When you was at the lodgings at Mrs. Smithers's, there you always treated him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200019"/>as your friend, for he went as your son? - We always eat together.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the people of the lodgings, Mrs. Smithers, and every body there, looked upon you as related? - I never saw the mistress till Monday.</p>
               <p>When you went to Minett and Fector's did you carry a bill there? - I carried a draft.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body that spoke French there? - Nobody spoke French there.</p>
               <p>Then all the business that was done at Minett and Fector's, was done by the prisoner for you? - It was.</p>
               <p>When the money was received at Minett and Fector's, did not the prisoner receive the money into his custody? - Minett and Fector gave him some Bank of England notes, and I went with the prisoner to get them changed.</p>
               <p>Were they given to the prisoner? - They were, and then we went to the banker's.</p>
               <p>Did he change them at the Bank? - He did.</p>
               <p>Whom did you trust to receive and count the notes? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money, or you? - I gave it him in a little bag.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go to the Bank? - To change the bank-notes into money, because the next morning the prisoner was to put me in a situation with the cash to advantage, and he said it was easier to place out cash than bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then he changed those bank-notes into gold for the purpose of placing out your money more easily? - I got all into gold for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner, or did he not, keep the custody of the money, after he had got it at the bank? - I put it into my own trunk before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When you went to Mr. Hammersley's, the business there was conducted by the prisoner the same as on the day before? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was it taken by you into your possession? - It was.</p>
               <p>When you were on the road together to England, had you any conversation together about merchandise? - No, never had.</p>
               <p>When you were at your lodgings, did you trust entirely to that man? - I did, he gave me to understand he was a captain of a vessel.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your way of life in your own country? - I am a French <rs id="t17910720-12-viclabel64" type="occupation">gentleman</rs>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. How many apartments had you and the prisoner at Mrs. Smithers's? - I occupied an apartment of his, he having made me an offer of a bed; there were two apartments, one where the prisoner slept, and one where I slept.</p>
               <p>In fact then it was the prisoner's lodgings, and you had an apartment through the prisoner's courtesy; which room was it you left your trunk in? - In the room where I slept.</p>
               <p>When you came home, after having been at the play, you found your trunk locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had this trunk ever been used by him and you in common, to put the things in? - I locked it for the greater caution, to preserve my cash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where had the prisoner proposed to spend the evening after the play was over? - He said he was going to sup with Mr. Rose, Mr. Pitt's Secretary.</p>
               <p>For what end was he to sup there? - He was to obtain his protection for me, and to employ my money to advantage.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by employing your money to advantage. He said Mr. Rose had been with Mr. Pitt for thirty years, and he would put me in a way how to employ this cash.</p>

            , she lives in Downing-street, Westminster; Mr. Delarade and the prisoner came to her house on the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Who took the lodgings? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had he ever lodged there before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200020"/>Who did he describe he took it for? - He said he took it for his father and himself.</p>
               <p>How soon after he had taken it did Mr. Delerade come there? - In the course of half an hour, in an hackney-coach.</p>
               <p>What did he bring with him? - They brought two trunks and a portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Which of the apartments were these trunks put into? - The largest trunk and portmanteau were put into Mr. Delerade's room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, on Tuesday, what time they went out? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did they return together? - No; only one of them returned in the evening, which was the prisoner; he came there about half an hour or three quarters past seven.</p>


               <p>What passed between you and him that evening? - When he came, he asked me to fetch him two sheets of paper, which I did, and carried them up to him, and delivered them to him with the change of the shilling he gave me to buy them; about ten minutes after, he paid me the lodging, two guineas for the week he had just been there, and half-a-guinea for myself, and desired me to get a porter; I told him I did not know readily where to get one, but I would get him a coach; I got him a coach, and he went away, and carried the trunk which was in his room with him.</p>
               <p>What was to become of his father, did he tell you? - He told me that his father would be home in the evening, and that he should return on the Saturday for the farthest: I asked him particularly how long he should stay; he said he could not leave his father any longer than Saturday, and therefore at the farthest he should return then.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did Mr. Delerade return? - About eleven in the evening.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you see the prisoner? - Not till after he was brought up from Bristol.</p>
               <p>I believe you received every thing for what was wanted of the prisoner? - I received every thing from the prisoner, I never saw a halfpennyworth of the prosecutor's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You seemed to have been with the prisoner all the time that evening almost, you only left him while you went out for two sheets of paper? - Yes, I went out for the coach besides.</p>
               <p>Where was he all this time? - In the dining-room.</p>
               <p>With his trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he paid you for the lodging? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>And told you he would return again on Saturday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore there could not be many minutes that he could be in this room by himself? - The whole from his coming in to his going out was not above a quarter of an hour in all.</p>
               <p>And then he went away in that coach? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then whether he had got any thing of the prosecutor's you do not know of a certainty? - That is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From the time that Mr. Delerade went out, did any body go in, that could have taken Mr. Delerade's property, besides the prisoner? - Nobody went in but himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He told you Mr. Delerade would return that evening? - He did; and he told me there would be an interpreter come with his father, that would tell us what he would want, and what he would have done; but that the interpreter was not to stay in the house.</p>
               <p>You understood that they were father and son all the time? - I did.</p>

               <p>I believe he refused telling his name? - He said he never slept in Bristol; but afterwards I found that was not true; and I went to a place where he had lodged, and there being some drawers in the room locked, I applied to him for a key; he said, at first, he had no key; at last he gave it me, and I opened the drawers, and found nine hundred guineas, now deposited in the Bank, and some double louis-d'ors (I cannot positively say whether there were twenty-five or fifty-five now), and twenty-nine single louis-d'ors: here is a pocket-book (produced) in which I found eight Bank-notes, including two Dover-bank bills; a purse, containing twenty-three guineas and a half (produced); here is a false watch (produced); here are two rings (produced), the one is an hair-worked ring, and the other is a diamond ring; a pair of knee-buckles, and a pair of shoe-buckles (produced); and I found this watch on his person (produced).</p>

I went to No. 21, Gray's-inn-lane, and I found the name Everett there, a midwife, not the prisoner; I made all the search I possibly could, and at last I went to a green-stall in Portpool-lane, and asked if such a person was there? They said there was, she came there on Thursday. I went up stairs and knocked at the door, and she opened it, and Mrs. Annam being with me, came in, and she saw the cap was hers; she went out and got a constable, and when he came she said she would give every thing up if there was no more said about it. She produced the gown, and there was two duplicates behind the mantle-piece, one of which led to the shoes, and they were taken out of pawn; nothing else was found.</p>

We asked him how he came by them; he said a man gave him a pot of beer to carry these three saucepans from Waltham-green to Lime-house; we knowing certainly, that he did not come honestly by them, took him into custody, and brought him to Govent-Garden watch-house.

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel: the prisoner at the bar pawned a watch with me on the 17th of June, between eleven and one; I had never seen him before, but I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are not the master? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Where is your shop situated? - No. 30, Red-lion-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Your master drives a good deal of trade, I believe? - Middling, Sir.</p>
               <p>A great many people came into your shop in the course of that day? - Many.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by your knowledge? - He is the man I took the watch in of.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - I cannot say positively, it was between the hours of eleven and one.</p>
               <p>Might it not be between twelve and one?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200030"/>- I believe, as near as I can form a recollection, it was rather before twelve.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular mark or any particular way of knowing the prisoner at the bar; how long might he be in the shop? - He might be in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What made him so long; was you chattering about the watch all that time? - Nothing particular, but what we ask other people; I asked him if it was his own watch; he said it was; he said he had had it a long while, but he had never pledged it before.</p>
               <p>What did you give him for it? - Half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you enter it in your book? - I did.</p>
               <p>Have you the book here? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>No, we can never get the book of the pawnbrokers here; what was there about his person that should induce you to know him again; how was he dressed? - He was dressed in a smock frock and trowsers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. What time did you miss your watch? - Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>How long might the prisoner be, after you missed your watch, before he was taken into custody? - It might be half an hour after eleven.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. He was taken into custody about ten minutes after you missed your watch? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with Mr. Lemon, the millwright? - I don't know.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Flint, and carry parcels out; on the 6th of July, Wednesday, I was coming from Great Eastcheap from London-stone (Mr. Flint lives on Fish-street-hill) I was going to Mr. Flint's other shop in Marybone-street, Golden-square. The prisoner followed me from Great Eastcheap down Watling-street to the corner of <placeName id="t17910720-24-crimeloc132">St. Paul's</placeName>

                        targets="t17910720-24-off130 t17910720-24-crimeloc132"/>; I had a bag of haberdashery goods, which I was carrying.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see this bag made up before you went out, do you know what was in it? - Yes, there was 149 pair of common stockings, twelve pair of silk and cotton, thirty-six night caps, and twelve thousand pins; I had some ladies chip hats beside this bag, and I laid them down for fear they should get damaged. I had put my bag down before. While I did this I told the man to let the bag alone, notwithstanding he made off with them; I made the best of my way after him I could, I took up my hats and the knot; I did not overtake him; he was overtaken in Shoe-lane, but I had lost sight of him just before he ran down Ludgate-hill, when he went from me; I first saw him after he was taken in Shoe-lane, in the hands of the constable, and the constable delivered back the parcel to me; it was carried from Shoe-lane to Guildhall, and a few parcels taken out, and the rest carried to Mr. Flint's, those taken out have been kept, and are here now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You was carrying your parcel on a knot, was not you; and your knot broke, and your parcel fell in the dirt, and you was encumbered with a parcel of chip hats at the same time; the man helped you up with the knot and your goods? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now attend to me, and do not suffer any blame you may have had from your master to tempt you to excuse yourself; you had more than you could conveniently carry, when your knot broke? - I had.</p>
               <p>Did not he offer to assist you to carry part of these goods? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>How far did you and he walk together? - From London-stone to the corner of St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>Where did he take the parcel from you? - The corner of St. Paul's.</p>
               <p>Tell me which corner of St. Paul's it was? - The other side of St. Paul's, at Eastcheap.</p>
               <p>The man took your goods from that corner, and at the end of St. Paul's he turned down Ludgate-hill, and you walked all this way together? - No, I could not walk on with him because I had the hats.</p>
               <p>Were not there plenty of people in the streets? - There were.</p>
               <p>How far was you behind him all the way? - Very near him at one time.</p>
               <p>Why you could have stopped him a thousand times between Ludgate-hill and Fleet-street? - I halloo'd out once stop thief.</p>
               <p>When you came to the Old Bailey was there any thing particular going forward<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200034"/>there, was not there a scaffolding out? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>I wish still you would remember the caution I gave you. Your master is displeased with you, naturally enough you have had a good deal of anger from your master about it? - I could not help it.</p>
               <p>No, I am not now scolding you at all, my little lad. Your master is rather a rigid man, always prosecutes when he loses any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master is a pretty sharp man, as sharp as a flint, and as much fire in him. Do you remember stopping looking at the scaffolding in the Old Bailey? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why it was the day when eight unfortunate people were to be executed; on your oath did not you stop to see what it was erected for? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you told by the prisoner what it was erected for? - No.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>When you came up to the man he gave up the goods, and said he was carrying them for you? your master had cautioned you against letting any body carry goods for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he was very angry with you? - I could not help his being angry with me, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Jury. At first did you oppose his taking the goods, or did you believe he was carrying them for your ease? - I supposed he was taking away the goods.</p>
               <p>How happened it you did not make an outcry, and repeat this outcry all the way along Ludgate-hill and Ludgate-street? why did not you run after him? - If I had ran after him I should have damaged the chip hats.</p>

            , and begged him to take care of the prisoner and goods while I went in search for the boy. I found the boy near the bottom of Fleet-street, running as well as he could, having some fine hats in a paper, which seemed rather to obstruct his running. I brought the boy to the goods, and had them all to the magistrate, and these goods were taken out of the bag, and given to me to keep to be brought here, and I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did I hear you right when I heard you say you was a constable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had followed these people some way, and you had a suspicion of them? - I followed them down Watling-street.</p>
               <p>When the man and boy arrived at the very place where they could do their business, you left them? - If I had found he gave them to the boy again at the next pitching block, I should have thought nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Why did not you then answer the question directly; how long was it before you found the boy after you got the prisoner? - After I had delivered the man to London, I met the boy on the run, in the road in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>How many minutes do you think it might be from your leaving the man to your finding the boy? - About two minutes and a half, it could not be more.</p>

               <p>I am a ticket porter. I know nothing more than stopping the prisoner in the street, by the desire of the constable; he had a bag upon a knot half full of things; he was walking pretty fast, but not runing.</p>
               <p>(The goods produced and deposed to by Mr. Flint.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Flint. How long was it after the matter happened that you first saw the boy? - I was sent for from Mitre-court, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>You did not reprimand him? - I did not scold him, I might say, what a blockhead you must be for doing so.</p>
               <p>You are certainly a man of a mild temper? - That is certainly a proof of your penetration.</p>
               <p>Now give me a direct answer, did you or did you not treat this boy with a good deal of anger on this subject? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You never did scold him? - I did not to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>I must have a positive answer? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You swear then positively at last that you did not scold him? - To the best of my recollection I did not; I should be glad to know what scolding is?</p>
               <p>I do not know how to explain it better, did you damn him, call him a rascal, and such things? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not feel hot or angry? - I don't know that I did at all; if I upbraided the boy, it proceeded more from a matter of admonition in cool terms, than from anger.</p>
               <p>Then you did not scold the boy at all? - I tell you and the Court I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>On your oath was not the boy scolded very much and violently abused? - No, at no time whatever on this occasion, I swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Then if he hath sworn to the contrary, he has sworn directly false? - I wish to be understood, I might upbraid the boy, but not in an air of passion; I do not recollect I ever abused him at all on the subject at all.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you saw the boy after this affair happened? - At Guild-hall.</p>
               <p>Did you upbraid him in an angry manner? - I think I did it in the same manner as any man would in the same circumstances.</p>
               <p>Give me a direct answer, was you or was you not angry? - I tell you I do not recollect I was, if I was it was in a very small degree.</p>
               <p>Mr. Flint, for shame! do give me a direct answer to a direct question? - I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any recollection at all about it? - I do not recollect at all about scolding him.</p>

               <p>The same day I was out, I was going to Oxford-road, to fetch some glass for one of my masters; coming along Watling-street, I met this boy, and his load tumbled off his head; I helped him up with it, and going along with him, I told him if he would put his load down I would take it up and assist<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200036"/>him. I did so, and we went all the way to the Old Bailey; he then asked me what the mob was about there? I told him. He asked me, which way I should go? I told him I should go down Shoe-lane, as the way to Marybone.</p>
               <p>Court to Prior. When you stopped him did he say he had the goods from a boy? - I cannot say that, but he said he was going to carry the goods to Holborn.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200037"/>Did you go into a room with her? - No, I did not, I only went into the court.</p>
               <p>Was any other girl in the court? - Not in my company, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What sort of watch was it? - It was a silver watch, with a steel chain, a metal key; I lost besides a guinea and a half crown; I did not perceive her take these things, I missed the things before I left her; my watch was in my fob, and the guinea and half crown in my pocket. I had a pair of nankeen breeches on.</p>
               <p>Was these breeches down at all? - They were not.</p>

               <p>Have you ever recovered it? - It is in the constable's possession.</p>
               <p>When did you last see your money? - I felt it in my pocket in a quarter of an hour before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Was that all the money you had? - No, it was not, I had a guinea and 2 s. besides, which I lost also, but this guinea and 2 s. when I came to the watch-house, I found was put into my coat pocket, by some means or other.</p>
               <p>When you missed this money and watch, had you left the woman or the court? - Neither, I stopped her at the instant.</p>
               <p>Was any other woman near her? - There was another woman came up the court, that she spoke to, but I did not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Was she within her reach? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar the other woman? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Did you see her give any thing to the other woman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not feel the money go at any time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was the money in a purse? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Now we all know that at this time breeches are made pretty tight, could it be possible so any person to take your watch and money out of your pocket, and you not feel it? - So it was, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you was tolerably drunk? - I was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pearson. As you was so drunk, how can you know I was the woman? - I am quite sure of it, I was sober enough for that.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of June, about six in the morning, I found this room was broke open, the pannel of the door was taken out, and the things gone, which I locked up over night, and lost my waistcoat and six dozen of oranges, which were under my care for a gentleman. I looked over the field, and I found one of the cruets, but nothing else; the next day I saw the things at the Justices.</p>

I said No. 11, Sir; then, says he, I am very right, I came from Mr. Booth to take your jack down. Then the prisoner came in after him, and the parlour door was open. I ran up stairs. He locked the door when he went out, and when I came up the door was locked. I had put the spoons on the slab, half dozen desert spoons, I missed them directly, they were all taken away, and this man came up with three spits in his hand and the jack, and was going out of doors with it; he got out of the street door, and was as far as the parlour window; I saw a shoemaker come along, and I asked him to stop him, as he had robbed our house; I saw him stopped, I never lost sight of him. The watchman took him, his name is Cockshaw; nothing was found upon him.</p>

Gentlemen, undoubtedly when any body contemplates such a wretch as that is, of so tender years, and recollects that he stands at this moment, one may certainly state on the brink of eternity, to be rescued from inevitable ruin only by your verdict; the sensation of such a person must be undoubtedly very painful. Gentlemen, in the course of the administration of justice, many very, very painful scenes present themselves; but inasmuch as we live in a society governed by laws, which are indispensibly necessary for the security of us all, now and then, however painful it may be to do it, examples must be made even of persons of the tender years of the unfortunate being at your bar. Gentlemen, the offence imputed to him, if it should be made out by the evidence, is of a sort undoubtedly the most atrocious that any person can commit; it sets out in the destruction of property, probably for the purposes of plunder, and none can say to what an extent it may reach; the death of many, many innocent persons is but too often involved in the perpetration of the offence, and therefore the security of society requires that whereever a case is fairly and fully made out to the satisfaction of a Jury, that Jury should discharge their duty; and some recent examples of some persons extremely young one would have hoped would have prevented the repetition of such crimes, by teaching<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200043"/>the youngest persons in society, that if they are endued with malice enough to put people's lives in hazard, their own lives must pay the forfeit. Gentlemen, I wish I could tell you there were doubts, I wish I could tell you satisfactorily to pronounce this boy not guilty. Gentlemen, you are to judge by the facts, if they are strong and cogent, if you find that this fire, which is imputed to him, could have happened by no other hand than his, it will be your duty to say so by your verdict; you will not look to the right hand or to the left, but you will do your duty to look always at that with an eye of mercy, and to take especial care not to give more weight to the facts given in evidence against him, than those facts compel and wring out of you, and to endeavour if you can to pronounce him innocent. Gentlemen, in trials like these very difficult and very important points of law sometimes arise; on the present occasion, neither my Lord nor you will have any such trouble; he that runs may read. There is no pretence to say that these premises burnt by this offence belong to the prisoner; there is no pretence to say he had any interest in them; there is no shadow of a question in point of law: therefore it will be entirely for you to decide that it must grow out of the fact. Gentlemen, the prisoner was employed as a <rs id="t17910720-32-deflabel177" type="occupation">pot boy</rs>

                        targets="t17910720-32-victim385 t17910720-32-viclabel178"/>, he lived with him some time, and after he had quitted his service, he was taken back to that service in the month of June; on the 29th of that month, between eleven and twelve, the prisoner had been directed to go to bed, which he did; the family retired to rest, every thing was made secure, no appearance of fire, no possibility of its happening in the way in which afterwards happened, but by design. In a very short time after a lodger, of the name of Hall was alarmed by a smell of fire; he got up, and when he came down stairs and went to the cellar, he found in the passage, which led towards the door, a quantity of, the remains of an old shirt burnt, the partition burnt, so that a dog might creep through it; a part of the door-post burnt, so as to reduce it to charle. From a variety of circumstances, and on the boy's coming down stairs nearly dressed, immediately after the alarm, he was secured, and his apartment searched. There will be no doubt about the law: the law and reason is this; that if any man shall burn the house of another, he shall be guilty of the offence imputed to him by the indictment; and if he shall do that, which in the second count is imputed to him, his punishment shall be equal, namely, if he shall set fire to the house of another. It is now past all question, that if you in the smallest degree burn the house of your neighbour, though you have done it, as some of the cases have been, by burning your own, which if it extended no further, would be only a misdemeanor; yet if you burn also the house of your neighbour, it will be the offence of arson; and the question always will be who is the person guilty of the fact, upon which the law arises. Gentlemen, on searching the person of the prisoner, they found upon him, in his pocket, a flint, a steel, and some matches; and on searching the bed to which he retired, there was found a tinder box. Gentlemen, it would be extremely difficult to account for any honest and laudable purpose for which he could be possessed of such instruments: it is by no means an inconsiderable circumstance that they are not found together; but that the tinder box is left in his bed-room, that they are found in his bed, and the matches and other implements necessary for kindling the light found on his person, in his pocket. Gentlemen, this could have happened by no other means, it could not have happened from without, it could not have happened from within by the means of any other persons for they will be called to you as witnesses; how then could it happen? I am afraid the conclusion is too pressing and too strong, that it happened by the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, I have now told you only such circumstances as are extrinsic of any account this unfortunate creature has given himself; and if there are cases in which a jury may rely on circumstances, it is in cases of enormity,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200044"/>for persons are not to be expected to call in witnesses to see their enormity, but some care, some precaution, some address will be used, in order to perpetrate offences like these, when no eye shall be looking on. Gentlemen, I am afraid I have stated facts enough already; but if more be wanting, I have a full and ample confession of the prisoner at the bar, which I cannot suppress; I have enquired, and you will enquire particularly in the case of a person of such tender years as the prisoner, whether any thing was said, to induce him to make the confession; whether either his fears were alarmed, his hopes encouraged, his mind set off its centre; or any thing done, that could induce him for a moment to believe he was benefitting himself by the story he was telling. I am told no such thing was done, but that this is the effect of that contrition which now and then is to be found in the minds of the most guilty, and that he made the confession. Gentlemen, if it is necessary to say more, it will be this, that if you should be of opinion to satisfy yourselves, that he had no hope, that he had no threat used to him, you will receive his confession; but I conjure you, on the part of the prosecutor, not to receive a tittle of the confession, which will be sworn to by the witness, if you should be of opinion, that at that time he made it, he had the most remote and distant idea, that it would tend to benefit him; I ask you to attend to it, only as far as the other circumstances, which cannot lie, shall appear to give it veracity; and to make it appear, that the prisoner made it merely voluntarily, and with a knowledge that he was doing that which might by and by impute to him a capital offence. Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses to you, and I shall have discharged a very painful duty on the part of this prosecution. Much will remain for you to do: it will remain for you to examine with the most scrupulous nicety every syllable that shall be produced: it will remain for you, under the able assistance of the Judge, to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, to attend to their conduct, and to weigh their oaths, and to judge of it, as if you was about, on the verdict you are to give, to sign your own death warrant. Gentlemen, I am afraid in deciding on this case, you will sign the death warrant of the prisoner at the bar. I mention that to you only to put you on your guard: I mention it only to caution you, and to request you to deal with him, as you would expect that a jury of your country would deal with a son of yours of his years. Standing before such a tribunal, Gentlemen, before such a tribunal he will stand with all the safety that belongs to innocence. Gentlemen, after such a caution, I have discharged my duty, I meant to have done so at least, and your verdict, I am sure, will be perfectly satisfactory.</p>

               <p>Did you keep the Wheatsheaf on the 5th of this month? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, very well; he lived with me six or seven years backwards and forwards; he came to me the 28th of June; he was there just eight days; this accident happened on the 5th of July; he came to me in the capacity of a pot-boy; he always slept in my house from that 28th of June; on the 5th of July the prisoner went up, to go to bed, about half past eleven; all the family went to bed at the same time, within a minute; there was Mr. Hall, who is here, my family consisted of my wife and self, no maid, no servant but this boy, and about twelve lodgers; we were alarmed about twelve; we went to bed at half past eleven, in the front room, one pair of stairs; when we got up, my wife struck a light, and we opened the door, and there was such a smother and smoke, I said, Suke, we shall never be able to get down stairs, we must get out at the window; but my wife said she would go down stairs at the risk of her life; and Mr. Hall and she went down stairs, and I followed them down below stairs, just in the kitchen, which is under ground, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200045"/>they were throwing water on the fire in the passage; I saw the boy at the bottom of the stairs as soon as I came down, he was perfectly dressed except his hat and his shoes, even the handkerchief about his neck; I saw the boy before I came to the fire; I met him just by the bottom of the stairs, before I came to the tap-room, which is on the ground-floor; I said to the boy, I struck him, and said, I am afraid, you dog, you have set fire to my house, and I desired him to go to bed; I immediately went down to the fire, which was burning at the door of the cellar, in the passage; the cellar-door was on fire next to the passage, and there was some straw on fire, and the remains of a shirt, against that door; the door-post was burnt to a cinder about a foot and a half high, and part of the bottom was burnt away; I could put this hat-crown through it; then Mr. Hall put some water on the fire, and rubbed the fire out with his hands; the fire was put out with water, and we brought away the straw and the old shirt: the floor is pavement: I went up stairs, and took the boy out of bed to the watch-house; the boy would not say any thing; I told him, if you will confess, I will not take you to the watch-house; when we took him to the watch-house of St. George the Martyr, in Bedford-street, I gave charge of him; I saw him searched in the watch-house; there was a flint and steel, and one match, and two keys, I saw taken out of his breeches pocket; nothing else was found upon him at that time; he had no use for such things; my wife, or the maid, lighted the fires, not the boy; the prisoner was ordered down to Bridewell that night; I came back, and we went and searched his bed, and there I found, on turning down his bed, a tinder-box and tinder, and some matches, five or six, between the sheets (they are here); the tinder-box was covered.</p>
               <p>Court. When you took the prisoner to the watch-house, was the door of his room locked or not? - It was locked, and I put the key in my pocket; I unlocked it when I returned; I have had them ever since. (The tinder-box, tinder, matches, and part of a shirt, produced to the Court and Jury.) Mr. Hall took up the remains of the shirt and the straw in my presence; he brought it up to my bed-room door, and I put it in paper, and have kept it ever since; I had seen a shirt hanging on an ale cask a short time before, about four or five, the afternoon of the fire; the cellar-door was open all day; it was not locked that night; it appeared to be a boy's coarse nasty shirt; I understand it belonged to the last boy.</p>
               <p>At any other time was there any thing else found, either in the house, or on the person of the prisoner? - Nothing else: I saw the prisoner on the 6th, at Justice Clarke's, on Clerkenwell-green; he said very little the first hearing; he was had up again.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this your tinder-box? - Yes; I saw it that day, over the mantle-shelf in the kitchen, at twelve or one, or two, in the course of the day of the 5th, before the fire.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with certainly, that that is your tinder-box? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Was there any hope held out to him, or any threats, so as to induce him to confess? - There was no more then than there is to me now; I did not hear any thing; but the magistrate spoke very civilly to him.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, were there any hopes held out to him that he should not be prosecuted? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Or any threat? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that examination taken in writing by the magistrate at the time? - I believe Mr. Clarke took down something, but I do not know what he wrote.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - No, nor ever was asked to do it: at the third examination there was a sheet of paper taken down, but I did not see the prisoner sign it, nor nobody asked him to sign it, or else I do not doubt but he would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know whether Mr. Clarke wrote what the boy said? - I believe he wrote nothing else but Mead's confession about White.</p>
               <p>That was a charge about another person who was taken and discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know at all whether the justice's clerk took down what the boy said to the magistrate? - Yes, there was a great deal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200046"/>taken down by the solicitor to the fire-office.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear the boy give an account of this transaction at a time when the clerk did not take it down? - Yes, he said a great deal at that second hearing.</p>
               <p>At that second hearing was any thing taken down by the justice that the boy said? - He pretended to take it down; he did not read it to me; he was writing something; he told me he had taken down what the boy had told him about the other boy; I told you he had taken down his confession.</p>
               <p>The boy confessed the same the second hearing as the third? - The magistrate was asking the boy questions, and the clerk was writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At the third examination the solicitor of the fire-office took it, and not the justice's clerk? - Yes, the justice's clerk gave it up to the solicitor; he said he was more capable.</p>
               <p>Court. If the solicitor did it for the justice's clerk, that would be the same thing; then I really am of opinion that what he said cannot be received. - There was another boy taken up, and he was discharged last Thursday, and this boy was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of people are they that lodged in your house? - Very good sort of people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not my mistress say, when she came down, that she found other people below besides the boy? - My wife never told me so, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a girl down between five and dark, three or four different times, of the name of Norris? - Yes, such a girl was there, I believe, between four and five o'clock; the girl did go down once, to my knowledge; and I desired her to go down and fetch her father a light; I was down fifty times, I suppose an hundred, after that.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to this bed of his, did he sleep alone? - He slept alone.</p>
               <p>Was there any other bed, or any body else slept in that room? - Nobody from the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Jury. What reason have you to suppose the boy brought the straw down? - Because there was no one else goes into that cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let me see if I understand you; in that porter cellar was some straw; had any body, except yourself, your wife, and the prisoner at the bar, recourse to that cellar? - No one at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. I thought you said there was a girl went for a light? - She went down into the kitchen, but not into the porter-cellar; besides, I went down fifty times after she was there; I was there after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you lock that cellar-door? - About a quarter after eleven that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me understand you right; you say you sent this boy to this cellar in the day; you went into that cellar, and your wife, and this boy, and you had lodgers; now then this cellar was open to all your lodgers to go down into that cellar? - No lodgers had any business to go there.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came the straw to be removed, and where was it after you locked the cellar-door? - We found it after the alarm of the fire.</p>
               <p>How came you not to see it before? - Because it is a passage we do not go into; it is at the farther end.</p>
               <p>Court. In locking the cellar-door, and going up to bed, did you not pass that passage where the straw and fire was? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the straw might be in the passage, and you not see it, because you came from the cellar-door another way? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Attend now a moment; I want to know, whether, in going from your cellar-door, after you had locked it, and going to bed, you passed that place where afterwards the fire was? - No, we did not pass by that place at all; that was found against the door of the spirit cellar.</p>
               <p>You have two cellars; one is a porter cellar, and the other is your brandy cellar; the one which hath the porter is open during the day for to go into to draw the porter; now how far distant is the brandy cellar from the porter cellar? - A good distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200047"/>Out of sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you could lock your cellar-door, and go to bed, without going near that door where the fire afterwards was? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you prepared to say, that any straw, any quantity of straw, was missing from the cyder cellar? - There was; I missed it immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say you missed it immediately; how soon did you go into the porter cellar to see whether there was any straw missing? - Immediately on the alarm of the fire, and I had extinguished it, I went into the cellar, and was immediately assured that some straw was taken from that cellar.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had any cyder been taken out that afternoon? - None.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that you went to the porter cellar immediately on the fire being extinguished; did you then unlock it, had you the key? - I had, and I did this before I took the boy out of bed; and I said to my wife, Suke, there is some straw gone.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner, I have lodged in the house of Mr. Carwardine twelve months, I have known the prisoner between four and five years, he was a potboy; I went to bed on the night of the alarm about eleven, and the boy was ordered to bed before I was, but what became of him I cannot say; and I suppose I might be talking with my fellow-lodger about a quarter of an hour after I went up in my own room; he slept in my room, and I went to bed; I was no sooner undressed and in bed, but I thought I smelt fire; I looked to see if I had put my candle safe, and laid down again; I could not be satisfied but there was a fire in the house, and got out of bed, and went to the table, and took the extinguisher to see if all was safe, and got into bed again, and laid for about a minute, and found the smell of fire increase; I says I will not lay here to be burned, and jumped out of bed, and called Mrs. Carwardine; I was on the one pair back-room, the landlord sleeps on the one pair front-room; the stair-case was all in a smoke; for God's sake, says I, you have not put out the fire; the stair-case is all of a smoke; I went down to the ground-floor, and got to the backdoor and opened it, and called out to the watch to bring a light; the husband said to to the wife, Suke don't go down; she said she would go down if she lost her life, for she should be suffocated; she went down first, and I followed, and a part of the door of the spirit cellar was all on fire; for God's sake, says she, where is some water? and she unlocked the cellar-door; I went and fetched a pail of water from the kitchen, and throwed some on it, and just as I was coming out of the kitchen with the first pail of water, I saw the prisoner standing near to the bottom of the stairs of the kitchen-floor; the kitchen-floor is under ground, I just saw him as I run by with the water; he had his hat off and his shoes; I believe he had every thing else on.</p>
               <p>In what manner do you think the cellar-door was set on fire? - The watchman came, and I put my right hand up the corner, and drew out that straw, with part of an old shirt.</p>
               <p>(The straw produced.)</p>
               <p>Was this straw a part of the general mass which had been burning against the door of the cellar? - This was.</p>
               <p>Court. How much was you dressed? - Nothing but my shirt on and my night-cap.</p>
               <p>How was the landlord? - I believe he had nothing but his shirt and breeches.</p>
               <p>How was the woman? - She had nothing but her shift and night-cap.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body come down stairs before you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor heard any noise? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it appears to you, that you was the first person that gave the alarm, and you had been out of bed some minutes when you saw the boy? - I was.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are the stairs very wide? - Not very wide stairs, I suppose they might be six or seven feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200048"/>Supposing the prisoner to have gone to bed when he was ordered, he must have come down the stairs by your door? - He must, but I did not hear him when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>You was in conversation with a person before you got to bed; did you hear any body go down then? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do after you took this straw out? - After I had scraped the straw out, I took it up stairs, and said this must be done on purpose; and after the fire had been extinguished, Mr. Carwardine said to the boy, you young scoundrel, you have done this; and said he would take him to him to the watch-house; I told him to tell me whether it was an accident, or whether he did it on purpose; he said he knew nothing about it; we took him to the watch-house, and I said to Mr. Carwardine, if that boy sleeps in this house to-night, I will not; I saw a match, flint and steel taken out of his pocket at the watch-house; on my return from the watch-house, I went up to the bed where the boy slept, and found some matches, six, or seven, or ten, and a tinder-box between the sheets; and then Mr. Carwardine called a person, who lived in the two pair of stairs back-room, to see what was done.</p>

               <p>John Mead's examination. Deposed that he was turned of sixteen last December, that he came to live with Mr. Carwardine the second time on Tuesday night was a fortnight; that the fire happened a week afterwards, by his being persuaded by White to do it; and deposed that White met Mead in Eagle street the Thursday before the fire, and that White spoke to him and asked him if he lived with Mr. Carwardine, and he said yes; that White said he wished he had staid a little longer, for his intention was to have set the house on fire, and if he could get it done, he would give Mead half a guinea. White proposed it should be set on fire on Tuesday night, and proposed to meet Mead in Eagle street; he went up to bed about half past eleven, staid till his master and mistress got up stairs, and got a light from a lodger, then went into his own room again; then went down stairs, and set fire to some straw he had prepared in the afternoon from an hamper, and put a shirt which he had taken from the cellar on the straw, and returned up stairs to his own room; in ten minutes Mr. Hall gave an alarm; his master met him on the stairs, and sent him to bed again; his master fetched him out of bed soon afterwards, and had him to the watch-house.</p>

            . The first alarm I had of the fire was from Mr. Hall: he said, here is a fire, for God's sake we shall be all burned in our beds; I opened my door, and there was such a smother, I could hardly open it.</p>
               <p>How did you leave your house before you went to bed? - There was no fire in the kitchen for hours, nor any candle but what I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>How long before you went to bed was the boy sent to bed? - He and I went up to bed at one time.</p>
               <p>Had he a light to go to bed by? - No, we never allowed a light.</p>
               <p>Therefore then, if he had a light, he must have got it in a clandestine manner, and against your orders? - He must.</p>
               <p>Now proceed to tell us how you found the place? - When I came to the bottom of the stairs, I could hardly fetch my breath, I just opened the kitchen-door, and Mr. Hall halloo'd out, here it is, and I found the fire was against the door of the spirit cellar; that door was always kept locked, and never kept open.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen the door? - I had not seen the door after I went down for some spirits, about eleven or twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Had any body occasion to go to that cellar-door after candle-light? - No body at all, it went into the coal-cellar, and where we kept cinders.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the boy was searched? - I was not, he was not searched at home.</p>
               <p>Who gave him his key to go to bed? - The key was in the door; there was a young man that slept there sometimes, but he had not slept there for some nights.</p>
               <p>Who made his bed that day? - The chare-woman.</p>

When the watchman came he said that he did not know me, that he could not swear to me; no man can swear to the wrench, I have had the wrench above a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. By what circumstance do you know that wrench to be your's? - By having the fellow to it; they were both made out of one file; I am sure it was in the basket that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No man can swear to the wrench.</p>

               <p>I live in Piccadilly; I am a silversmith: she came into my shop about five in the evening, and offered to sell these spoons, on the 14th of June, Whitsun Tuesday; I asked her what she asked for them; says she, weigh them, and you will know better what to give me; I asked her what name this was upon them; she said, I do not know, there is no name that I know of; says I, here is some person's crest, is it yours; where did you get these spoons; says she, it is of no consequence to you where I got them; if you do not like to buy them, give them to me again: at last, with a deal to do, she told me that she got them from the Marchioness of Buckingham; that she was a distant relation to her Ladyship, and received them as presents from her; I kept the spoons; nothing particular happened; then I asked her where she lived, and she gave me a right direction where she lived, in Little St. James's-street; I asked her if she had any objection to my going with her to her lodgings; she said she had not; I said I would go with her; instead of which, I went out at the back door, and went to the place where she said she lodged, and inquired and found she did live there; and about six or seven days after, I found out to whom those spoons belonged; I went to the Earl of Clanbrassil's house with the spoons, and shewed them to the servant that opened the door.</p>

               <p>I saw the spoons when the last witness brought them; it is Lord Clanbrassil's crest and coronet; I missed five on Tuesday the 14th, between two and three; I was going to lay the cloth.</p>

Prisoner, there is an objection that appears on the face of your indictment, which does not affect the merits of your case; but, however slight it may be, you ought to have, and you shall have, the benefit of it; therefore no sentence must be passed upon you till the next session, and then you will know the opinion of the Judges.</p>

             came on the Wednesday following, and took her away: I kept the mare at some little meadows, with an acquaintance, where I lodged, his name is Scott, he is here present; a miller took the mare away, and they sent for me, and I met them at Pinner, and the mare was in Pinner-park; I worked at Pinner; I left the mare at the meadows in the morning, at Norwood; Mr. Redford owned her as his mare, and I gave it up to him, and he sent the mare home by the postman; I and Redford went after the prisoner, and found him under a hedge, between Radcliff and Ulstree; he laid down; and I went up to him, and told him a man had owned the mare, and he must go with us; Mr. Armstrong was with me; he said he would with all his heart; he said he would give an account where he swapped another for it; I had him up to Ulstree, and from thence to the justice's, and he was committed.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200055"/>(Mr. Redford describes the mare: a blaze in her face, one white foot behind, about fourteen hands high, a bay blind mare; she was six years old, worth about four or five pounds; she had a broken knee, a sort of a nag-tail, crossed leg behind.)</p>
               <p>Court to Baldwin. What was this miller? - He was a man that took the mare out of the meadow for the sake of the guinea reward.</p>
               <p>- ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a baker: I met this man with the mare on Saturday morning the 18th of June, between seven and eight, and he offered me this mare to sell for six guineas and a half; it was about four miles from where she was stolen; I looked at the mare, and I saw she was blind; he said she was not, she had only got a ball eye; I told him I thought he did not come by her honestly, and he pulled out a paper out of his pocket, that he had swapped a horse for this mare, on the 1st of May, at the Crown, at Great-Marlow; he asked me when I should be home; I told him I should not be home before eight o'clock; and I told him I had a mare, and I would make a rap with him; I am sure the mare he had is the prosecutor's mare; I saw the miller give him the mare: when he brought the mare up on the Saturday night, I refused her, and he went off with her to Pinner.</p>

               <p>I swapped this mare with a man at Marlow: if I had stolen it, I would not have laid about the place.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. How long have you had this mare? - Since the 17th of last May was a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Garrow, and the Case by Mr. Fielding, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship: Gentlemen of the Jury; the charge which is now brought forward against the prisoner at the bar, my learned friend has stated to you to be that of having obstructed an <rs id="t17910720-41-viclabel233" type="occupation">excise officer</rs>

When I look at Gentlemen of your appearance, I am convinced it cannot be necessary to enlarge on the necessity there is of executing those laws which are made for the preservation of those people concerned in the collection of the revenue: indeed, at this time of day, wherever we turn our eyes, and attend to that information we receive daily, we have great reason to be content with the happy constitution and government of this country, and with the administration of its laws, as that administration takes place in this country; but, Gentlemen, there could be no support of the constitution, there could be no support of the government, if, after the establishment of taxes, which we all know are necessary to be imposed, when those taxes are imposed, there must be people employed to collect them, and that those officers require protection. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge on this; you will at once feel it: Gentlemen, no prosecutions of this sort, and indeed no prosecutions instituted by any of the public boards, ever can come before a jury without the approbation of the crown officer; the Attorney-General is immediately consulted; he judges of the propriety of submitting that complaint before a jury, before any such complaint can be submitted; and I believe I may say it is known to the learned Judge, and many others, that there has not been any one person ever prosecuted by him, but on the strictest necessity, and even then with the utmost lenity. The conduct he would have prescribed to himself I shall endeavour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200058"/>to follow, it devolving upon me to discharge his duty; and at present I think it my duty especially to follow that plan, not at all to inflame your minds on any accusation that shall come before you, but rather to require you deliberately to examine the evidence, and if upon that evidence there should be any doubt, he will be best satisfied, the public will be best satisfied, and you will be best satisfied, in giving a prisoner at that time the advantage of that doubt. In the present instance, the witnesses you have to hear will not be many: the state of the case is this; on the 17th of April, 1790,

            , being on his duty, and surveying some of the people in his neighbourhood, he observed the prisoner at the bar, in company with three others, all on horseback, and their horses loaded with tubs, as they call them; they are the little tubs in which they smuggle brandy; one of the parties were leading horses, and these horses were loaded with tubs; Andrews, as his duty was, went to the foremost man, and attempted to take hold of that foremost horse; when the prisoner, and two other persons not in custody, came towards him, and made use of the most opprobrious language; not contented with that, they immediately struck him with a large weapon, and which might by possibility have subjected them to a higher indictment: they then meditated more severe usage to him; but, recovering immediately from his blow, he crept through a hedge, and endeavoured to make his escape through a garden; the prisoner and another, on horseback, leaped the hedge, and pursued him; there was a little cottage near there, into which Mr. Andrews luckily escaped; if not, probably it was, from the pursuit that was made by those men, that they would have gone on to some greater violence that might have hazarded this man's life: therefore, gentlemen, you see it is for this offence, which as soon as communicated to the commissioners, which was the duty of Andrews to do, they put it into a state of inquiry: Andrews was examined; the nature of his character, and the usage he had received, called for a public inquiry, it called for public punishment; the evidence therefore can only be, as to the main fact, from Andrews himself: now, gentlemen, it happens with us in this country, that as we are satisfied with the testimony of one man, so it frequently will happen, that that testimony, if aided by the corroborating testimony of three or four others, is sufficiently convincing; and if the evidence you shall receive from one man, namely, Andrews, when aided by the conduct of the man himself, his demeanour and behaviour; and if that man, so standing before you, and so demeaning himself, appears to deserve your credit, you will give the same credit to one as you would give to the testimony of four; particularly when there can be but one witness, you will think it your duty to attend to those circumstances from whence your opinion of him is to be founded; and it is my desire, that if, from any thing about the man, you see there is any thing suspicious, or doubt that his story is not founded in truth, of course you will immediately discharge your duty by rejecting such testimony altogether: on the contrary, if his behaviour be such as to demand your credit properly, you will be as much satisfied with that evidence coming from a single witness, as if from more: but on the present occasion there will be a corroboration of the testimony of Andrews, namely, the testimony of a woman to whose house he luckily escaped, and who was witness of his treatment; she will tell you the situation of this Cooper being with his people, but she will not affect at all to identify the persons of these prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this offence was committed in Sussex, but it is tried here; it so happens that, from the operation of a very beneficial act of parliament, and which was found to be essentially necessary in the revenue laws, that many offences committed and prosecuted in those counties where smuggling was carried on, it was found over and over again, that prosecutions instituted, properly supported by the most indubitable testimony, yet there was unaccountable partiality, and conviction was almost impossible;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200059"/>therefore it was that the legislature thought fit, on proper inquiry, that the proper officers should have it in their power to bring the trial on in another county; no man will be dissatisfied, when they consider all these prosecutions are generally brought in this Court, where I may say, without any flattery to you, gentlemen, I always see the most respectable jury that this country can afford, so far that prisoners have the benefit of it: there is a little inconvenience now and then attending persons being brought up from far counties to make their defence here, as they cannot so readily come at their witnesses that may be necessary for their defence; it is far to bring them; and therefore, in cases where there may by possibility be evidence that would resist the accusation, I do acknowledge that observation should have its full weight with the jury; but in the present case, according to the circumstances I am stating to you, it is impossible, in the nature of things, if you believe Andrews, that there could be any witness on the present occasion that would not be equally offenders with the prisoner; therefore, on the present occasion, that observation does not apply with him; for, however I have already stated to you the nature of this offence, I have already stated to you the necessity there is of protecting the officers of the revenue; to gentlemen of your description it is impertinent to make any comment on that; the officer must be protected, the taxes must be collected, and these laws are alone made for the protection of those gentlemen who are fair traders; for certain it is, that smuggling very much indeed interrupts that class of traders. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance, which always will lead a jury with considerable satisfaction to the discharge of their duty on an accusation of this sort; if they are satisfied with the evidence before them that the accused is guilty, I think they will in general be satisfied with their verdict of Guilty, inasmuch as the example of punishment will certainly promise a very considerable public advantage, not only to the revenue, not only to the officers, not only to the fair trader, but to that very class of men that are induced to that sort of traffic which is called smuggling: certain it is, that, by means of the efficacy of the law, of late years that class of men have been very considerably diminished, and in proportion labour and agriculture considerably increased, so that their families enjoy the benefit of these salutary provisions. Gentlemen, I will not trouble you any more on a case like the present; you will hear Andrews; if you are satisfied with his evidence, although but one witness, you will with equal satisfaction say the prisoner is Guilty; if you are dissatisfied, either with his story, or appearance, or any thing in the world, of course you will reject his testimony, and acquit the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Was you out on your survey that day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you fall in with any smugglers? - I fell in with some smugglers, that is, four men, having in their possession seven horses, all loaded with tubs, small casks, that contain about four gallons.</p>
               <p>What do you call them? - Half anchors.</p>
               <p>Were they slung? - They were slung in the same manner as smugglers usually carry them, and thrown across their horses. The men were all on horseback, they were leading the other horses.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them? - I knew three of them.</p>

               <p>You have no doubt? - Not the least; I was crossing a lane, and I saw these four men coming up, having seven horses, and the first man was leading two horses, and I attempted to seize these horses, to stop them; he kept going on the lane, and I found I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200060"/>could not secure them; then the prisoner at the bar and the other men came up, swearing in a terrible manner, with oaths and imprecations, they seemed determined they would murder me.

I looked back, saw the prisoner, and Milton, coming after me, full speed on their horses; I had just time to reach the fence; they were threatning and swearing terribly at me; at the same time I got over the fence, and they came up to the fence, and there they swore very much indeed, and swore they would give it to me the very next opportunity.</p>
               <p>How often before this had you seen the prisoner? - I had seen him many times, the very Saturday before I met him at Milton's, loaded with tubs; I attempted to take him then; I know him to be Milton's <rs id="t17910720-41-deflabel234" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>What did these two people, or either of them, say to the man who came bloody? - I do not know what they said.</p>
               <p>The man was very bloody however? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Yes, you do? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Gentlemen of the Jury, it falls to my lot on this occasion to defend the present prisoner at your bar; and, gentlemen, it happens very unfortunately indeed for the prisoner at the bar, that he has such very poor assistance, but as he has called for that assistance, he is entitled to the best exertions I can give him on this occasion. With respect to the general principles that Mr. Fielding, the Counsel for the Crown, has laid down in the beginning of his speech, I perfectly coincide with every one of them; I agree that if taxes are imposed the collectors ought to be protected; I also perfectly coincide with him in the character which he has thought proper to point out of our present worthy Attorney General; I am sure that I can agree with him to the full extent of that description; I am perfectly convinced, and very ready to declare, that a more honourable man in the situation which he now fills, never was placed in that situation. But having got rid of that, we are again necessarily driven to the question which you are to decide, and the question that my learned friend, Mr. Fielding, stated to you certainly does lay in a very small compass indeed; and, gentlemen, the real question on this record is, whether the prisoner was one of those who assaulted, hindered, opposed and obstructed Mr. Andrews, who states himself to be a collector of excise, in the execution of his duty, and while he was in that execution? Now, gentlemen, in order for you to judge on this case, it will be necessary to advert to the evidence, as I think Andrews has stated to you, and I am under the correction of his Lordship if I am wrong, that he does not recollect which of the persons, either Cooper or whether the other person knocked him down, certainly I am right, though corrected by Mr. Garrow; he did not knock him down. Now we will see whether I am correct and right; that he did not strike him at all, I believe, I am in the recollection of every body that hears me; that when he was first asked he did say he did not know that the prisoner ever struck him; but when he was pressed a little, he does say he was the person that struck him several blows on the arm and head; so that by the exertion of that ingenuity, which you have often had opportunities<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200062"/>to admire, he is brought to say at last that he did strike him; it would be very material for them to have produced this woman, if she could possibly have identified the person brought to her to be Andrews; instead of that in the way in which Andrews himself stated it first, and then altered his tone; and when you come to the woman, who says she does not know a single feature in Andrews's face; will you presume against the defendant, who comes here upon his own surrender, that which neither of the witnesses have dared to state; this is the single question you have to try, under circumstances that certainly on their own testimony have made it doubtful; but thank God it is for you to decide, and not for any one individual in this Court. My learned friend, Mr. Fielding, has alluded to the inconvenience of being tried here; at the same time he talks of the very great benefits to be derived from this act of parliament. Mr. Fielding certainly on this occasion blows a little hot and cold; it is necessary for the justice of the country that the act of parliament should protect the officers in the collection of the revenues, it is necessary that the trial should be had where they shall have a fair and impartial one; but surely it is of equal service to individuals that they should have opportunity, poor and destitute as they are, particularly in these countries bordering on the sea, that they might have the means of procuring some witnesses, and in order to speak in their behalf farther, they might have witnesses if the act of parliament had given them means; and I am sure you will presume it so to have stated some facts which might have been necessary to have led you to the discussion of the present subject; instead of that, here is a man brought, at a very great distance indeed, poor, without a farthing, save what his miserable friends have been able to pay his Solicitor and Advocate on this occasion; he has not a farthing for witnesses. Where are his benefits? I cannot conceive how they accrue to him; therefore I say when you have a doubtful case before you, when the prosecutor has contradicted himself, at least mended his evidence; and God forbid you should encourage witnesses to mend their cases; when you have a woman coming before you, whom they mean to prove a fact, which, if it had been proved, certainly would have been a great corroboration of the prosecutor himself; instead of that she comes here, and says she does not know a single feature in his face; for God's sake take into consideration the situation of the defendant, that how little able he is to make that defence, feeling the common feelings of humanity, you must presume that he might have had witnesses to have proved his case, which would have left no doubt. Gentlemen, I shall set down with a perfect confidence on this subject, knowing, as I do, that you have given perfect attention to this case, as you do to every other case; and knowing, as I do, the prisoner will have every advantage from a compassionate jury he ought to have, and which, by the law of this country entrusted in your hands, he will receive.</p>
