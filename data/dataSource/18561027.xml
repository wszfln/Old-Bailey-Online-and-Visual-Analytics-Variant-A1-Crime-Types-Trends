I knew the pri<lb/>soner in Mr. Norrington's service; he used to bring the rolls of a morning—on 24th Sept., about 20 minutes past 7 o'clock in the morning, I saw him at my aunt's house—he had two quartern loaves—he put them down on the stool, and left them; he did not say anything, he left directly he had put them down—we dealt with Mr. Norrington—I had not ordered any loaves to be brought that morning, I always order the bread—I afterwards gave the same loaves to Green, the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, residing at Chard, in Somersetshire, In 1814 I was clerk to a Mr. Clark, a solicitor there—he died long since, and I succeeded to his practice—I have lived there upwards of forty-six years—I have been mayor of the town three times—I am concerned for four noblemen, and three or four county magistrates—in Nov., 1814, in conse<lb/>quence of a message coming to Mr. Clark's office, I remember going over to the residence of a person of the name of Hood—Mr. Clark was not in the way—I found that Mr. Hood had died that day, suddenly—the message that came was from a Mr. Phelps, in whose hands the will was, and who lived in the neighbourhood—I think he was a little farmer, or something of that sort—Mr. Hood was a gentleman of fortune—when I got there Mr. Phelpi gave me the will of Mr. Hood—it was sealed up—I opened it, in the pre<lb/>sence of several persons, and examined it to find who were the executors—I saw that Mr. Holman and Sir William Hood were the executors, but the property was given to Sir Alexander Hood—the executors were mere exe<lb/>cutors in trust for him; the bulk of the property was left to him—the following day I went to the house of Sir Alexander Hood, which was about thirty miles from Chard—I kept the will till the following day, when Mr. Holman, one of the executors, came to Chard, and took it from me—I gave it to Mr. Holman, in the same state that I received it—I was not then pro<lb/>fessionally concerned for the executors; Mr. Pratt, of Glastonbury, was; he is since dead—it was sent by him up in the ordinary course, to be proved at Doctors'-commons—I afterwards understood from Mr. Pratt that an affida<lb/>vit was required with respect to some erasures that appeared on the face of the will, and, in consequence of that, I made an affidavit, which is annexed to the will—I think two affidavits were made in reference to that, one by me, and one by Mr. Phillips—this is mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the other was to prove that the alterations, or the erasures, were in the testators own handwriting—the object of my affidavit was to prove that I had delivered up the will in the same state that I received it—those alterations do not affect the disposition of the property in the least—(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi>+ It is all a forgery together)—I had seen Mr. Hood write—I believe the whole will to be in his own writing—I had seen him write on one occasion, but I think I had received notes from him also, but it is so long ago I cannot charge my memory—I certainly believed it to be his at the time—with the exception of making that affidavit, I had nothing whatever to do with the proving of that will—I never admitted to the defendant that I had uttered that will, knowing it to be forged, or to any person living; impossible; it cannot be a forgery; it is the testator's own handwriting—I never admitted that, or any<lb/>thing</p>

               <p>his handwriting; probably I should—he lived a good many years after Mr. Hood, but I saw very little of him, for he lived in London—I should think he lived in the neighbourhood of Chard three or four years after Mr. Hood's death, but I am not certain—<hi rend="italic"> (looking at a paper</hi>) I am not certain that the signature to this paper is Mr. Phelps's; I think it is very likely it may be—I could not swear it, I believe it to be his writing—I have seen a printed copy of a declaration made by Phelps at the Mansion-home in 1844—it is to the effect that he declares that the signature to the will in not his—that was not an affidavit made in any proceeding—he was a very old man then, living in London—that was a voluntary affidavit—I remem<lb/>ber seeing a copy of it, upon which I called upon Mr. Phelps, and asked I him how he came to sign such a document—his answer was, "I have looked I at the will, and I should say it looks exactly to be like my handwriting but I don't recollect ever witnessing the codicil, and therefore it cannot be"—that was the explanation; and that was the very person in whose custody I the will was, and who gave it to me—lie was not benefited by the will, he was disappointed—he expected a legacy, and did not get it; he told me so himself.</p>

On the morning of 18th Sept I went to Mr. Ullathorne's house—I observed the balustrades of the area—I found a dirt mark, as if a rope had been round them, and on the area wall there was dirt as if of shoes going down—I found this rope ladder under a laurel tree in the garden, near the front area door—this ladder looks as if it had been covered with tar lately; it is very sticky now—on 22nd Sept I was with Dyas, and found the prisoner in a house in Queen's-row, Bayswater, a little after 9 o'clock in the ntorning—he gave his address in a first floor front room of a house, No. 40, Uxbridge-street—I went there, and found this chisel, this bradawl, and this hammer—I saw Dyas search a box in that room—he found in it a pair of trowsers—I took this chisel and bradawl to Mr. Ullathorne's house—I examined the pane of glass at the staircase—there were marks on the putty—I made a mark with this bradawl by the side of the other marks, and they corresponded exactly—it had been inserted between the glass and the frame, to loosen the putty, and get the glass out—I examined the marks in the side door, and made a mark with this chisel, which corresponded exactly with the marks in the door—I examined the window, and found marks corresponding with this chisel.</p>

On Thursday morning, 18th Sept, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was on duty about twenty yards from Mr. Ullathorne's house—I saw a person passing the end of the gardens, from Lansdown-terrace, towards Notting-hill—I observed he had light-coloured trowsers on—I had seen the prisoner before, and I have no doubt, from what I saw that night, that it was the prisoner—he passed me sideways, and, from his general appearance, I thought it was the prisoner, and the next morning I heard of the robbery—on 22nd Sept I took the prisoner, with the last witness—I had been in search of him from the 18th till the 22nd, in company with the officer Clark—we saw him once, but not to take him into custody, till Monday, the 22nd—we took him at Mr. Yeardyea—he gave his address, and I went to search the room—I saw dark find the chisel, hammer, and bradawl—I searched a box which was in the room, under the bed, and found in it this pair of trowsers, with marks of tar about the legs—I searched the prisoner when I first took him to the station, and found on him a knife, a pipe, six postage stamps wrapped in paper, a tobacco box, an old coin, a small pocket book, several pieces of paper, and a piece of a comb—the postage stamps were in the left breast pocket of his coat, wrapped in the paper produced with the writing on it, and another piece of paper outside—when I found them, the prisoner said, "You don't mean to say they came out of my pocket? I don't know anything about them; I have had none in my possession since I came from the war"—I had preriously been to the prisoner's lodging after him, on the morning of the 21st, the Sunday after the robbery, about 5 o'clock in the morning, with Clark—we could not find him there—we went to the same lodging that he told me he lived at.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corrugated iron manufacturer, and Government contractor. I carry on business at Millwall Poplar, and Arthur-street, City—the prisoner came into my service about four years ago—he re<lb/>mained, I think, two years and upwards—he was then discharged, and afterwards taken back again, about April, 1855—his duties were those of general clerk in the office in town, and also at the factory on some occasions—it was part of his duty to keep an account of the wages which he paid the men—his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he remained in my service until June last—I then discharged him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book in which he kept an account of the men's wages—ha drew the money by handing me a slip of paper, purporting to contain the amount of money he would want for the wages and other disbursements on Saturday evening—he would give me that paper on Saturday morning, and I either gave him a cheque or cash for that amount—it was his duty to pay the men that money, and to enter it in ihat book—the first column contains the names of the men, and the number of the job, and the work on which they were employed—it was always stated by number, not by name—these columns would contain the hours that they worked, and also by a figure denote the job at which they worked—the amount of hours is brought out at the end, and also the amount of money—the last column contains the total amount supposed to be paid them on the Saturday—on the week commencing 31st Dec., and</p>

               <p>ending 5th Jan., a man named Thomas Wells was in my employ—he came into my service on the Wednesday—according to this book, he did not work the whole of the day on Wednesday; he worked seven and a half hours that day—this is in Neary's handwriting—the entry is opposite the name of "Day"—on the Thursday and Friday he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> stated to have worked the full time, that is ten hours—all this is placed opposite the name of "Day"—there was a man named Day in my employ that week, I think he was employed at Aldershot—the men working at Aldershot are not in this book—there is an entirely separate account kept for the men at Aldershot—ten hours is also placed against Wells on the Monday and Tuesday—he was not at work for me on either of those days—I do not know that of my own knowledge—by holding this book up to the light, I can discern a pencil line carried from Day's name on the Wednesday, covering over the Monday and Tuesday, and connecting the name of Day with the seven and a half on Wednesday—he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per day—if he had worked from Wednes<lb/>day to Friday, the amount that should have been carried out would have been 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount actually carried out here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making a difference of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the last column the red ink line has been scratched out, and a black one put in—that is the pounds line, where the "1" is now inserted—there is <hi rend="italic">also</hi> an erasure in the shillings line, that is perfectly discernible by the absence of the red line—the last name but two on that column is "Thomas Wakeling"—this is for the week ending 7th March—Monday is the first day on which he is stated to have worked for me—he is stated to have worked ten hours that day, ten hours on the Tuesday, Wednesday the same, Thursday seven and a half hours, and Friday ten hours—Saturday would not appear in this page, it would go on to the following week—the total amount brought out here is four days, seven and a half hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—supposing that he came on the Wednes<lb/>day, and worked seven and a half hours, and ten hours on Thursday and Friday, the amount he would have been entitled to would be 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the red ink line separating the pounds column from the shillings has been scratched out, and the "3" put in; it has evidently been written on an erasure, the "1 "is quite distinct before that, and has been scratched out—Wakeling was paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a day's work of ten hours—if two days were added, it would make the amount 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added.</p>

I paid away the two notes which he had first given me—on 6th Oct the prisoner came again—he said, "I have come again to see you"—he asked for some ham and beef again—I served him with some, and a piece of German sausage, and three penny loaves—he produced another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and wrote his name, "Richard Barford;" and then he said, "I had better write my whole name," and he put "Crump" over—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I placed it in the cash box, underneath the last I had received—on the follow<lb/>ing day the two first notes, which I had paid away, were returned to me as forged—the prisoner came to the shop that afternoon; he said he wanted some beef—I told him I could not serve him with any more beef, and I had a charge against him for passing forged notes—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I gave the notes to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 53, Flower and Dean street, Spitalfields. On Monday night, 13th Oct., I was going along Brick-lane with another man—I do not know his name, he was a Land Transport man, and he lodged in the same house as I did—I dare say he is now at work at the docks—as we were going along we came up to the prisoner and some women—the man that was with me struck one of the women with his elbow as he was passing, she turned and said, what did he do that for—he made some saucy answer, and she struck him—the prisoner then came up, hit the man, and hit me in the face with his fist—he made a second blow at me, and I kept it off with my hand—he put his hand towards his pocket, made a stroke at me, and cut me under the ear—it is now strapped up—I said, "Oh my God! I am done!" and fell against the pawnbroker's shutters—I put my hand to my head, and the blood came all over my person and my clothes—the people took me into a doctor's shop, and the doctor attended me—I do not know what became of the prisoner, I was senseless—I pointed out the prisoner to the policeman the next day in Keate-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, a general practitioner. On Monday evening, 13th Oct., about half past 9 o'clock, I was called to the police station to see the prosecutor—I found a deep wound on his back, pene<lb/>trating to the rib, about half an inch long—it was a clean cut wound—under his right ear I found a flesh wound, about an inch long, only just penetrating through the skin, not to the bone—it was a very clean cut wound—it was not dangerous in itself, but it was in a dangerous neigh<lb/>bourhood, not far from the jugular vein—it might have been done with a knife—I do not think it possible that it could have been done with the fist—it might have been done by a ring on a finger, if the ring was very sharp—the edges of the wound were not jagged, it was a clean cut—I should think both the wounds had been done by a small penknife—I I dressed them both.</p>

I received informa<lb/>tion, and on Friday night, 19th Sept., I watched the barge <hi rend="italic">Edwin</hi>, at Nine Elms—there were three other officers with me—on the Saturday morning about 6 o'clock, I saw the three prisoners come across Battersea-fields, in a direction towards the barge—they went into her—they went into another barge first—they took some considerable trouble to get into this barge—when they got in, Beard went aft; he lifted up the scuttle, and looked into the cabin—Fordham let go the head rope, and Smith loosened the oare—they then commenced pushing the barge ashore towards a draw dock—I immediately went alongside of the barge, and Beard and Fordham jumped on to the other craft that were there—they had been pushing the barge in the direction of the draw dock, but they did not get there—I told the other officers to take Fordham and Beard, and I directed my attention to Smith, who was still in the barge—he could not get out, because the barge was then floating ahead—Smith had the hitcher in his hand—I said to him, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, I hare <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> you again"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Nailed</hi> me! what have you <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi> me for?"—I said, "For those oats that are in the barge's cabin"—he said, "Oats in the cabin in the abin!

I said, 'Yes,' and I asked him where the barge was, and he walked along where there was a lot of rubbish, and showed me the barge; he said we were to land them out there; I told him I would be there in the morning; I was proceeding home, and I saw Smith and Beard; I asked them if they wanted a job; they said, 'Yes;' we met at 5 o'clock, at St. George's Church, in the Borough, to go and get these cats, and were walking along where they shot this rubbish; we saw some barges; Smith said, 'There is no oats in either of these barges;' he then got to this barge, and he lifted the tarpaulin and looked down in the cabin and said, 'Here are some oats here;' he said, 'We can't unload them here; there is a place where it will be most proper to unload them;' and as we were <hi rend="italic">shaving</hi> the barge along, they came in the boat and took us."</p>

On 29th Sept did you go with Mr. Borras anywhere? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, between 11 and 12 o'clock, to No. 1, North Pole-street, Hoxton, which is Stevens's lodging—he gave his address there—I there found one squirrel boa, one pair of squirrel cuffs, one parasol, one cravat, one fur orna<lb/>ment, and some paper, seven or eight sheets, such as is used in warehouses—on returning to the prosecutor's warehouse, I saw Stevens there—I showed him this property, and told him I had found it at his lodging, and it had been identified by Mr. Borras—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of it—he said that he purchased the boa and cuffs at some retail houses in Shoreditch, about twelve months since, and the parasol and cravat he had purchased at different shops—he said, "The ornament I did take, and the paper."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Swan with Two Necks. Robinson was in my service, he has lived with us twice; nine years altogether—he was general manservant and cellarman—the only manservant—his name is George Kirk, but he was always called William—I know the cupboard—it is a sort of a lumber cupboard, where dirty pipes are kept, which Robinson had the collecting of—it is a cupboard I never scarcely went to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the maidservant go there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might, or might not—it was used more by Robinson than by anybody else—it is on the staircase, and if any person went up, they would be in danger of striking their heads against the door—my orders generally were that the door should be kept shut—we go by that cupboard to go to the bedroom.</p>

               <p>where the knives are cleaned—I have known Stevens for some years; he has been in the habit of coming to my house to have his dinner for some time—he would have a steak or a chop cooked in the kitchen—I saw these things found—they were not there with my knowledge; certainly not—I gave the officer a skin—I found that on the floor in the coal cellar—the same cellar that the other things were found in—I know nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business, in partnership with three others, in Aldermanbury; we are wholesale warehousemen, and deal in furs and parasols—we do not sell by retail, except to friends, not in the ordinary way—Stevens was in our employ in Sept.; he had been about two or three years—he was assistant porter, his duty was to take out parcels—we have a large warehouse, and a good many rooms are filled with articles—he would have access to everything, and particularly in the fur room—he had no authority to dispose of any—I do not know of any purchase made by him—I have not sold him any, and if any one else had sold him any, they would have been entered in the books—I have looked at these articles—these are what were taken to Gordon—I find my mark on them—I know them to have been in our warehouse—the two sets left at Gordon's are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know these others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you manufacture them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and sell them to retail dealers, and wholesale dealers also—there are many others in the trade, but not so largely as we are—we are considered the largest in the trade—you would not find our goods in wholesale warehouses in the City, but in Man<lb/>chester, and Glasgow, and other country places.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Some of the property has got your mark, and can you speak to that without hesitation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the property found at Stevens has no private mark on it, the private mark is taken off—when a customer buys an article, it is usual to take the private mark off—these cuffs, and fur boa, and neck tie found at Stevens's, none of them bear my private mark—we sell hundreds and thousands in the year—I should not swear that I have not sold these particular articles, but to the best of my belief I have not—I may say the same as to this parasol and this tie—I should not like to swear this ornament is mine—I would not prosecute him for these bits of paper that his victuals were in—when the officer found this paper, it was perfectly clean—it was not in the state it is now—I do not say that this paper was ever ours—the prisoner admitted it—we are not paper makers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson's Defence.</hi> Stevens came and brought the things to me; I did not know that they were stolen; he did not give them all to me; he laid them down against the knife house; I told him I did not know what to do with them; he came to me in Newgate, and said, "I shall have a counsel, and if you will say one thing, I shall get off;" I said, "What is that?" he said, "Say I did not give them to you, it was another man;" I said that I should apeak the truth about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was twenty-one years of age last birthday; I am now in business on my own account, as a timber mercant. My father was in partnership with the defendant Fossey—they failed in Dec., 1855—they were bankrupts in Jan. of the present year—the partnership had lasted twelve months—before that, I had been clerk to Fessey, when he was in business alone, from 1852 down to the time of his partnership with my father—in the years 1858 and 1854 Mr. Walker was a customer of Fossey's—during those years large quantities of timber were supplied from Fossey's premises to the premises of Mr. Walker, I should think, at least, to the amount of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Walker's factory was at Millwall, and his counting-house in Arthur-street West, near London-bridge—I was acting in the management of Fossey's business in Sept., 1853—when timber was sent from Fossey's to Walker's, delivery orders were sent with it—they were in the form of these notes (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—this is one of them, "Ferry-road, Millwall, Poplar, Sept 21, 1853. Deliver to John Walker" certain deals. "For George Fossey, Thomas J. Steel"—this is in my handwriting—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—I Wrote it by Mr. Fossey's direction—it purports to be an account of goods delivered from Mr. Fossey to Mr. Walker, in the month of Sept., 1853—the total amount of it is 884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after that account was made out, Mr. Fossey desired me to go to settle the account with Mr. Walker; that is to go and ascertain that the items were correct, and then get paid—I told Fossey that I should not like to go, or I would not go; I said there were certain discre<lb/>pancies in the account, and I should not like to go; I would sooner have him go himself—I do dot think anything was said at the time about what those discrepancies were; Mr. Fossey knew that there were certain over-charges in the account—he said he would go himself if I would not—I do I not remember making any observation at the time as regards the items; I think nothing more passed about the particulars—Mr. Fossey and I had frequently talked over the overcharges to Mr. Walker—he told me that to anticipated that Mr. Walker would stop payment, and he thought it right or advisable to charge extra, to make up for any deficiency hereafter; some<lb/>thing to that purpose—he took the account from me, and I understood he would go himself—soon after this conversation he showed me this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "I have got this bill of Mr. Walker"—this is Mr. Walker's acceptance; it is for 865<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated Oct. 13, 1853, payable it four months—I think Fossey showed me this bill the same evening that we had the conversation abotrt taking the account to Mr. Walker—I expressed my surprise that he had got the bill for that amount—the first item in this account is, Sept. 1, 8,570 feet of yellow boards—they were not sent on 1st Sept—I had been a party to the settling of the Aug. account—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the last item in this account is 3,570 feet of boards, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a deduction of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the Aug. account, for discount, at 5 per cent.—I had settled that account, allowing that discount—when I returned home, I told Fossey I had settled the account—he said it was an unusually large discount to allow—Neary was not present on that occasion, he was afterwards; either the same day, or a few days afterwards, at Fossey's house—Fossey said to him that it was a large discount, and how could it be made up—(this was in the beginning of Sept.—we generally settled Mr. Walker's account on the 13th or 14th of the following month, as we sent in the account in the previous month)—Neary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270052"/>
               <p>proposed to charge extra for timber, to make up for the discount which was allowed to Mr. Walker on the previous month's account—it was agreed that that should be done—Fossey said, "Be it so"—there was a note made for the 87 three-quarter boards on the following month; it was agreed that 87 yellow boards should be charged again in the Sept account; those boards that were not sent—on 1st Sept. 87 three-quarter white boards were sent—there were no boards sent corresponding with the entry in the Aug. account—I find in the Sept. account 40 inch and a quarter yellow boards, 660 feet, on 20th—I do not find any delivery note corre<lb/>sponding with that item—I know that there was a lot of inch and a quarter boards charged in Sept. which were not delivered—there are two parcels of 180 boards charged here—one of the parcels of 180 was not delivered; I do not remember which of them—on 21st Sept here is 22 feet of yellow battens 1100, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 26th there is 30 boards, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe those boards were not delivered—I cannot swear that they were not, but I believe not, I think not—on 28th Sept here is a charge of 100 boards at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were not sent—I find here a delivery note for those 100 boards on 28th Sept., I remember writing it in Fossey's counting house—Fossey and Neary were there at the time it was written—I think Fossey was then; he was either in the counting house, or in his own house—Neary came down in the course of the evening to see Fossey about it—there was a delivery note for a certain quantity of timber, which had not got this 100 fourteen feet deals—that note was destroyed at that time—Neary brought it, I saw it contained sundry pieces of ash, and other things, which had been sent—it was proposed that that note should be destroyed—I do not remember who spoke first—Neary said to me, "I have brought down this note for these goods, for you to insert the items," or something to that effect—it was proposed that there should be 100 fourteen foot deals charged in another delivery note—that was proposed by Fossey, by Fossey and Neary together—they were together—I do not remember which it was that spoke; it was proposed that there should be a fresh delivery note made out, the old one destroyed, and 100 fourteen foot deals inserted in the fresh note—this note was then written by me, by Fossey's desire—it contained the 100 fourteen foot deals that were not delivered—the paper was to be made to appear an old note—I do not remember who suggested that—it was made a dirty note, some dirt was put on it to make it appear an old note; I am sorry to say that was done by myself—all that I have stated occurred in the evening when Fossey and Neary were present—the note was then handed to Neary, and he took it away with him—the boards sent from Fossey's to Mr. Walker varied in width—the extreme width was eleven inches—the extreme width of flooring boards was nine inches; there were some narrower than that, none wider; that is, all that I saw delivered—I saw most of them—the delivery note of Sept 6, 1853, is for 3164 feet—that represents running feet—I cannot say that I was present when those boards were sent out, I might have been—I lived with Fossey, and boarded with him—I have often seen Neary there, always of an evening—I do not know where he lived at that time, I believe somewhere at Peckham, or the Old Kent-road way—he used to go with Fossey to the public houses about, occasionally, the City Arms for one place; I have seen them there together.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell your father that you had, during the whole of the month of Sept., 1853, day after day, been entering in Fossey's books accounts which you knew to be false, for the purpose of cheating Mr. Walker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect—I kept the books at Fossey's—I believe the false entries, to which I have spoken to-day, are in my writing—this is the journal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is not the book in which the delivery notes are copied, it is the book from which the account is made—the delivery notes would be copied from the day book—I believe there is a day book—I have not got it here—I do not know anything about it—this book is in my writing—I do not know that the whole of it is, these entries of Mr. Walker's are—this was copied from the day book—a portion of the day book was in my writing, and a portion, I should think, in Mr. Fossey's—I say that I have occasionally spoken of this to my father, but he was not aware that it was to such a large extent at the time he put—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in—he objected to it, but I strongly recommended him to establish me in the business with Mr. Fossey—my father did not know of the frauds—I have occasionally told him that Mr. Fossey was in the habit of charging extra or charging over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell your father that in the single month of Sept you assisted Fossey to rob Walker of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know that I did; I do not remember—I do not remember that I told him that Fossey had charged Walker 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra—I do not remember telling him anything about it—I do not know that I did not, and I do not know that I did—my father and I have talked over the matter of his investing his 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my becoming a partner; but you must consider my age was only seventeen then—I told my father that I thought Fossey was a very good man for me to go into partnership with—I told him it was a good opening; my father did not think so, he always objected to it—I led him to believe it was a good business, and I thought I should do well—he strongly objected to it—I knew at that time that Fossey was in the habit of doing this kind of thing, but I did not put the construction on it that he was a swindler and a thief—I knew it was wrong, and I feel now too grieved—I told my father of it; I told him Mr. Fossey was in the habit of charging extra goods to Mr. Walker—I do not know that I told him that Fossey made me enter false items in the account—my father has remonstrated with Mr. Fossey for sticking it on—he did so before he went into partnership with him—I was present, and heard him.</p>

               <p>on to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., did your father remonstrate with Fossey in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, because this went on for Sept, Oct., and Nov.; for three or four months, I think—it might have been four months—it was a systematic sticking on—I cannot remember how soon after Sept. it was that I told my fafchef, and he remonstrated with Fossey; it might have been in Oct., I cannot say—it was at the time thin was going on with Mr. Walker—it might have been in Sept. or Dec., I cannot say; it is three years ago—it was done just the came—it does not appear to have occurred to any of toy family to go and tell Mr. Walker of the sticking on—my father never interfered in the business at all—it was never proposed to my father to invest this 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till two years after this took place—he did do so—my father had forgotten the circumstance; at least, he might have done so—I cannot say that he had; he might have forgotten the subject; I never thought so mnch about it—I never said to my father, "Do you think it is right for you to go into partnership with that rogue, and let me succeed to the partnership?"—I never called Mr. Fossey a rogue to my father, or said anything to that effect—my father was aware, I keep on saying that my father knew that Mr. Fossey was in the habit of sticking it on, or charging extra, or something of the kind, but he did not consider it anything fraudulent—I made the acquaintance of Neary in the year 1853; he was in the habit of coming to Mr. Fossey's house, and I met him there, I being boarding in Mr. Fossey's house at that time—I cannot say how earty in 1853 I made his acquaintance, it was at the time when Mr. Fossey was supplying Mr. Walker with timber—I do not think I knew him previously to the summer of 1853—I cannot say what time it was, it knight hare been earlier than the summer of 1853—I do not think it was—I cannot my whether I had been much in bis company previous to Sept, 1853; I do not know—the first time of our forming an acquaintance With each other was at the time he was clerk to Mr. Walker—I never visited it his home—he had not visited at my father's house previous to Sept, 1853, that I am aware of—I cannot remember whether I had met him at taverns or anywhere previous to Sept, 1853—I had no intimacy with him previous to his coming to Mr. Walker as clerk; that might have been in the year 1809—I do not know that anything occurred previous to Sept, 1853, to induce him to think he could entrust the proposal of a gross fraud to me—I have spoken of plain, deliberate proposals of gross fraud made by Neary to Fossey—nothing that I am aware of had occurred to induce Neary to think he was safe in proposing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that he came in boldly, in the presence of a witness to propofc to Fossey that Fossey should rob Walker, and you help him to do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Neary was in the habit of coming in, evening after evening, to Mr. Fossey's—the thing was eventually proposed in my presence—I did not start when he first miesrested it, and say I would have nothing to do with it—when Fossey became bankrupt, the business at his yard stopped altogether—I set up business in the same parish, not next door to him; I should think 100 yards off in the same line of business—I began in Feb., I think—I did not apply to Mr. Walker to deal with me—he has dealt with me within the last two or three months, to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not remem<lb/>ber that I had applied to him to deal with me; I had not offered to supply him with timber—I sent some circulars out in Feb., I do not know whether I sent him one—I cannot remember—I may have done so; I do not know that I did; I should not think I did; I do not think it is possible I did I will not swear it—I cannot say that I did or did not, but I do not think</p>

Linklater's office—I first toid Mr. Walker about these frauds either on the 12th or 13th Aug., in the year—I had been in business for myself since Feb.—Neary used to come to Fossey's of as evening—those evening visits commenced in 1853, I cannot say in what month—I do not remember—I cannot remember whether they took place in Sept.—I saw him there a number, of times—I cannot swear to the number of times, I should say quite fifty times; it was alter btrioett hours, when, the office was shut, and the yard gates shut there were, two galles; the foreman had charge of the key of the large gate, and I had the key of the smaller gate—Neary used not to come through either gate, only as the time when he came from Fossey's house into the counting house—if he happened to go there, he used to go through the smaller gate—I used always to let him hire in if he went with me—there were other servants about at that time—there was Bacon, he is here, and there, was a boy named <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—I have not seen him here—I do pot know of any one else—they used to stay till 5 or 6 o'clock, it depended on circumstances—if we were busy, they would stay longer, if it was daylight—in the summer time we have not doted the yard till 8 or 9 o'clock sometime?—Fossey's house was some way from the count<lb/>ing house—these interviews took place at his private, house—he had two servants at his house—the 3570 yellow boards is, I believe, charged twice; the last item in the Aug. account, and the first in the Sept. account—the 1 Aug. account was settled, I think, about 14th Sept.—the goodb sent out were entered at the time in the day book—they were noil entered in the ledger for six or nine months afterwards—they were then entered from the day book, I think—I do not know where the day book is—there were three books, the ledger, the day book, and the delivery note book.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know enough of the business to know, that in order to ascertain how much timber he would want, it would be necessary to take the square feet of every floor in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not done in that way—Mr. Jackson, who is the clerk to Mr. Walker, was in the habit of coming up, and saying, "Well, Mr. Fossey, how much flooring have you by you?"—"Oh, 40 or 50 square"—"Well, send it down;" and as fast as it was used up he would send for more—in order to ascertain that we had got 40 or 50 square feet, it would be necessary to multiply the length by the breadth, and then divide by twelve—that was not done by person in</p>

               <p>Fossey's employment—the running feet were charged as twelve in some instances—the linear feet was reduced into square feet by that process, to other customers, you must understand—I should think it was easy to ascer<lb/>tain the squares that would be wanted for any particular home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corrugated iron merchant, and a contractor, of Mill wall and Arthur-street West. I was so during 1853 and 1854—during that period Neary was a clerk in my employment—during that year I had extensive dealings with Fossey; I should say I had paid him 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that year—towards the close of 1854 I was obliged to call my creditors together, and compound with them at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, up to that time I had paid Fossey many thousands; I cannot recollect the amount—it was Neary's duty to keep the bought book and the ledger at the office—I was wholly engaged during the day in the contracts that I was making for different persons—in Sept., 1853, I had a large contract to send out wooden houses to Australia, for which I was dealing with Fossey—the wood was usually ordered verbally from my factory by my managing man, Mr. Jackson—it was not known at the time the order was given what quantity would be wanted—it was ordered upon an expectation of what would be required for the different works—upon its being sent, it was cus<lb/>omary that a delivery order should be sent with it.</p>

I find an entry of "120 one-inch planed boards, 1812;" it is put down here as "linear," but it is carried out in the money column as "square"—I have likewise had my attention called to this item on the 8th, of 100 one-inch planed white beards, 1873—I should say that the delivery notes are for linear measurement—the account would be taken as of linear measurement—it was the clerk's duty to measure it when it came in—I was there from morning to night—I lived on the premises—there is a public house in the neighbourhood called the City Arms—Neary lived in the neighbourhood of the Old Kent-road—I think I have seen him at the City Arms, I cannot say as to any particular time—I have not seen him with any one in particular—I used to frequent the house, and Mr. Fossey, and several other persons belonging to the neighbourhood—I think I have seen Neary there of an evening in company with Fossey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the employment of Messrs. Pickford. In 1853 and 1854, I was in the employment of Mr. Walker at the factor—it was my duty to receive goods when they arrived, and to enter them in the receiving book, in the absence of Holt—during Sept., 1853, I was not absent at all—I used to come at 6 o'clock in the morning, and left at night when the men went, when the business was done—I only entered when Holt was absent—I have looked through the receiving books—I do not find any entries of mine during Sept.—I have been present during Sept. when timber has come, frequently—I am not able to say what the breadth of the flooring boards was, I do not know the largest width.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the West India Docks. In 1853, I was a clerk in the employment of Fossey—it was part of my duty to arrange the sending out of timber that was sent to Mr. Walker's—Mr. Fossey has told me on several occasions, "Don't be particular to a few feet, as Mr. Walker will not pay the cartage"—it was my duty to measure or count what was going out—if there was 300 or 400 feet of boards on the carriage, I came in and told Mr. Fossey the number, and he has said, "Oh, put down 500," and so on—that was often done—it was about one-fourth generally—the width of the flooring boards sent to Mr. Walker's was six, seven, and nine inches—it was never beyond that width—I wrote most of the delivery notes when I was in the way—none of those produced are in my writing—I used to count the number of boards as they were loaded to go to Mr. Walker's—the number of boards was accurate in the delivery notes, the excess was in the measurement—I was speaking of boards when I said that Fossey desired one-fourth to be added, not flooring boards, some rough boards, and some flooring boards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Confine your attention to flooring boards: was any such direction as that ever given you with respect to flooring boards by Mr. Fossey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was so often the case that I can scarcely say about the flooring, because it was generally the case as to all boards—the entire measurement on the whole would be a quarter more than the reality; I mean as to flooring</p>

               <p>boards as well—I did not measure each board, some, perhaps, were 13 feet long, some 15, and some 10—I told Mr. Fossey how many there were of a sort, and he would say, "Average them at 16 feet"—I made out my measurement at linear measure, so many feet running—I never saw any flooring boards at Mr. Fossey's more that nine inches wide.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Walker, and a connection of his.

I am eighteen years of age—my father lives at No. 3, Vernon-square, Bagnigge Wells-road—I was errand boy to Mr. Meyer, of Bow-lane—about two months and a half ago I was passing the prisoner's stall in the City-road, and saw a funny stick there, which I thought I should like, and asked the price—I had not known the prisoner before that—I said, "I cannot afford it to-day"—I had an umbrella under my arm, it was my master's, but it was the first one I took—the prisoner asked me to sell it—I said, "No," but afterwards he said that he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I took it—he asked me if I had got another one—I said no, but I could get another—he said that he wanted another very particularly, and I took him another the next night—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and said that I was to be sure and take him another one, because he had got a customer for it—I do not know whether it was silk or alpaca, the first was a silk one—they were both new, and the first had a partridge cane and a griffin handle—when I took him the third, he said that he could not pay me, as he bad only taken a shilling all day—I do not exactly know whether that was a silk one, I took him both alpaca and silk, just what he said he wanted—he gave me a shilling, and asked me if I would have a drop of ram, which I did—I did not take him another for some time after that, and he said then that he could not pay me all, as I had stopped away so long, because if he paid me all, I should not bring him any more—I said, "I must have the money, because how do you suppose I can bring you umbrellas if you do not pay me the money? I want the money to cover them"—that was an excuse I made to get the money—he said that he had a particular custo<lb/>mer for another, at an ironmonger's shop over the other side of the road, and I was to take him one the next night—I did so, and he asked me if I would help him to clear away his stall; I did so, and he took me to a public house opposite his court, and asked me if I would have anything to drink—he said outside, "We do not want that man to hear everything we have to say," and we went over to his house—a man came down his court to buy an um<lb/>brella—he asked 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; the man would not give it, but gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was one which I had taken him, a silk one—they were all new—he asked me that night to bring him two similar ones next day, very parti<lb/>cularly, because one of them was for a lady—I took them, and left them at his house at my dinner time, and the woman Mary said that she would take them down to his stall—I took him two new alpaca ones the same night, from my master's premises.</p>

From information I received, I searched the stock on the 16th Oct, and found that this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been pledged on 14th Oct.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the duplicate—I famly believe the prisoner is the person who pledged it—it was Jtetweea 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning; I cannot say to half an hour, as the dock in the shop varies—it might have been as late as half past 10 o'clock, bat I think not so early as half past 8—I gave a description of the person, and on Sunday night was taken by a policeman to a public house, and saw the</p>

               <p>her to lead me out of the square, to show me the shortest way into Oxford-street—I gave her no encouragement, but she kept by my side—she led me down Greek-street, and a man crossed over, and whispered something to her—Welch is the man; and then he said something to me, which I did not understand—I told Walton I did not want to go with her, and proceeded onwards; and almost immediately afterwards Welch jumped on my back, and tried to strangle me—I threw myself down, and tried to grapple with him—he knelt on me till Walton escaped, and then released me, and went after her—as soon as I recovered myself I missed my watch, and pursued them till I came in contact with a plain clothes policeman, who said that my watch was all safe, and the prisoners in custody—I was as capable of going borne as 1 am now—I had been dining with my friends—I was able to walk steadily home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the trade warden in Pentonville prison—there is a ward there in which trades are taught to the convicts. On 9th Oct the prisoner was in confinement in the prison under sentence—on that day he was in the trade ward—he was learning the trade of a shoemaker—he was provided with a set of tools such as are used by shoemakers, a knife, a rasp, a seat, a file, a hammer, pincers, nippers, and rubber—on 9th Oct. I observed the prisoner do something which was contrary to the rules of the prison—he was turning, in order to speak to other prisoners while at exercise in the rope yard—he nodded his head to speak to other prisoners—the rules of the prison with regard to speaking to other prisoners were per<lb/>fectly well known to him—they were read to him on the first day of his admission, and they are read once a month during the time they are in the prison—he can read them himself, he is a first class prisoner and able to do so—they have a copy of the rules hanging inside the cell doors—I did not speak to the prisoner about this at the time, but I gave orders to another warder who was there to send the prisoner to his cell—next morning I reported what I had seen to the governor, that was my duty—the prisoner was taken before the governor at a quarter past 9 o'clock in 'the morning; was present—the governor said it was bad conduct, and he should punish him for so doing, and he ordered me to open the door to send him to his cell again—no punishment was ordered at that time—he works at his trade in his cell—the prisoners have bells in their cells, and as they ring them a number projects from the wall, so that you can see which prisoner wants yon—about 20 minutes past 12 o'clock I heard the prisoner's bell ring—I went to his cell and opened the door, but did not go in—he said he wanted a sole for the shoe which he was then making, as the sole he had got was not large enough—I told him I would go and get a sole for him, as I had not one with me at that time—I went away, and returned in about two minutes—I went into his cell and picked the shoe up off his seat, and the sole as well—he liad thrown the sole on the floor for me to pick it up, when was there before, but I would not stoop to pick it up for him—I then took the shoe to go and get a sole for it, and as I was leaving the cell with my face outwards, the prisoner came behind me and struck me in the left shoulder—I turned round and said, "26, you have struck me; I shall report you in the morning for this occurrence"—he then sprang on me, caught me round the upper part of the muscles of the arm and wrestled with me to try to throw me down—I had the use of my arm, and the shoe in my hand with the last in it, and I struck him over the head three or four times till he released me from his hold—he then took a pair of claws, which are tools used for closing, brought them across his shoulder, and said, "You b——, I will knock your brains out for you"—I then retreated baok<lb/>wards</p>

               <p>wards out of the cell and shut the door after me—I called out for the assistance of warder Laffan—he came on the third time of my calling, but previous to his coming, I felt a severe pain in my shoulder every time I breathed—I told him that 26 had struck me, he said, "Good God! there is a knife sticking in your shoulder now"—and he pulled the knife from my shoulder—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I gave this knife to the prisoner it was nearly as wide at the point as it is at the end, it was only a piece of a knife without a handle, used for scraping the bottom of the shoes—he has sharpened it and placed a handle to it—the handle belongs to a seat file which I have here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the knife has been sharpened at both sides and at the point and filed down at the back—I gave it to him on the 4th—there had been no angry words between the prisoner and me before this, no further than my reporting him for being idle and neglecting his work—I never told him of it, it was not my duty to do so—he knew I should report him, by sending him in from the yard on the previous day.</p>

I saw Bevan—I found him bleeding from a wound in the back—I examined it—it was a punctured wound, about half an inch in width, with a direction downwards and outwards, just above the blade bone, and from the symptoms shown by the warder afterwards, I ascertained that the knife had penetrated the chest and wounded the lungs—the wound was of a dangerous character; it was just above the blade bone, on the left side, between the blade bone and the spine, about two inches and a half from the central line of the back—it had reached the Iung—the bkde is about three inches long—I did not expect that two inches oould have reached the lung, hut it had done so, for he spat blood as he went home, which blood would only have occurred from the lung having been wounded—it must have been done with considerable force.</p>

The prisoner and his wife, the deceased Elizabeth Gaylor, lived in that house—she was a young wo<lb/>man, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age—the prisoner is a carpenter—they had two children, the youngest was about twelve months old—on the Tuesday before she died, the deceased complained to me that she had got a headache—on the Wednesday morning she was taken very sick indeed—I heard her from my room, and I went to her and asked her if anything was the matter, if she felt ill—she said yes, she was very sick and relaxed, besides; what she brought up was yellow, and I said, "Bless me, how bilious you are"—she made me no answer—she was still very sick, and vomited very much—I took her in a cup of coffee, and she brought that up—she asked me for it—I took her in a second one—she was still sick—she then asked me to make her a cup of tea—I did so—she remained quiet a little, and then she was sick again—I should think that was about 4 o'clock—she got up between 4 and 5 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon and said she would make herself a cup of tea, which she did, and she asked me to reach down a piece of bacon in the cupboard, which I did—she did not eat any while I was there—I saw her again on the Wednesday night, I put the baby to bed, it slept with me, I brought it up by hand—on Thursday morning,</p>

I shall die; will you give me a cup of coffee?"—I went in to light my fire, but before I lit it I heard her moan, I went in again, and I saw there was a change—I sent for the doctor, he came in less than five minutes, but when he came she was dead.</p>

I am a bachelor of medicine, living in Finsbury-square, and am lecturer at the London Hospital I received from Mr. Yinall a jar and a bottle, sealed, and two cups—I found in each of the cups a quantity of white powder, which on analysis I found to be sulphate of potass, and the quantity in the two cups amounted to seventy-four grains—the jar contained the stomach and intestines of an adult—I examined them—I found the stomach and upper part of the small intestines very much congested with blood, as if an irritant had been acting upon them—the interior of, the stomach displayed precisely the same appearance—the stomach contained about a small table spoonful of thick matter, which upon analysis yielded this sulphate of potass (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the intestines also contained a quantity of thick mucus, which is generally poured out under the influence of an irritant on the intestines, and upon analysing it it furnished this sul<lb/>phate of potass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a piece of carpet was given to me—I examined the matter which had been vomited upon that, and found sulphate of potass in it, which I have here—I found this pocket at my laboratory—I opened it, and found in it this paper, containing 181 grains of sulphate of potass—the quantity in the tea cup and paper amounted to about half an ounce—sup<lb/>posing the paper to have originally contained two ounces, an ounce and a half would be gone from it—having heard the account given of the symptoms of the deceased, and having seen the stomach very much irritated, ana having found sulphate of potass there, my opinion is that death arose from sulphate of potass—an ounce and a half would be sufficient to kill a person—sulphate of potass is named in works on toxicology as a thing which in large doses produces poisonous action.</p>

I am the wife of John Wright, a shoemaker, of No.2, Haverstock-street, Camden-town—he is the master of the young man who is said to be the father of the child—the child died at my house, at half past 4 o'clock in the morning of 11th Sept.—it was with me from the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the prisoner came out of the workhouse, she came to our house, and was with the child's father, and I saw the baby every day, and nursed it, and when it cried and the prisoner was out I suckled it—she suckled it at various times during that week—she did not pay proper attention to it—she was very neglectful of it, and I have seen her shake it and beat it, and she did not keep it clean unless she was told to do so—she smacked it with her hand, and shook it—I have remonstrated with her about it, and asked her if she thought so young an infant could know what she shook and smacked it for—on the Monday, the prisoner's mother came out of the infirmary, and she abused the young man, James Evans, and insisted upon the pri<lb/>soner going away with her and leaving him, and she did so, with the chili—Evans lives with his father, but he works with my husband when he is slack—he is no relation of mine, but he calls himself a cousin, because my husband's father married his aunt—during the weeks she was at our house, she would stop out a long while when she went out of an errand, and the child would cry, and I have sometimes suckled it—she had plenty of mill—I continued to see the child occasionally, sometimes two or three times a week, up to July, in her arms—she has brought it to my room and had it there with Evans—I did not notice that there was anything the matter with it, it seemed pretty well—I have taken it and fed it—I did not see any difference in it up to the end of July—she once brought the child to my room, and threw it on the table before Evans, and told him he was to take his child and keep it, for she could not, if he did not allow her pay for it—she did not put it down as an affectionate mother would—her mother abused him very shamefully, indeed—Evans would have married her if it had not been for the mother; he spoke to the missionary, and forgave her all she had done wrong—the child was left with me on that occasion, and he fed it, and took it to his mother to bring it up, that was early in the evening, and about 10 or 11 o'clock that night the prisoner and her mother came and kicked up a bother, and insisted on having the child again—on account of that, I forbade her coming to my place, and I did not see it any more till she brought it on 8th Sept., three days before it died; she then said she had been to the doctor's with it, and she had brought it for the father to see it before it died, for the doctor said it was dying for want of proper nourishment, and he had ordered it port wine and beef tea—I asked her to bring it up stairs—she at first refused, but afterwards came up with it, and I made it some sago, with a little port wine in it, and fed it—I then asked her what she intended to do with it—she said she did not know—she left it with me that night—it appeared exhausted and sinking from want—the child had no notion at all of sucking when it came to me then—I could not say whether the prisoner had a proper supply of milk then, I did not see her breasts—she said she had an order to take it into the infirmary—I said that was the best thing she could do with it—she said she did not see why she should bury her days in the infirmary for the sake of the child—Evans said she should either leave it with him or take it to the infirm<lb/>ary—I said I would go with him to see about her not dragging it about the streets any longer, and then she cried, and said she would leave it</p>

               <p>the mob rushed on him, and struck him with their clenched fists—there were from fifteen to twenty surrounding him; all against him, and hooting and howling shamefully—had it been dark, instead of daylight, I firmly believe they would have killed him—he was retreating from them all the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of Mr. James Wyld's business, at the branch, at Charing-cross. On the night of 22nd Aug., I was on the premises, and left at 10 minutes or a quarter past 8 o'clock; I left the premises securely locked—I returned about 10 minutes past 9 o'cfock the following morning—I found the porter there—I missed a great many globes, and atlases, and maps; two pairs of compasses, two magnifying glasses, some books, and two coats, and three copper plates—I can identify this property produced—I recollect some articles by peculiar marks—here are several spots on the cover of this book, which were made soon after the book was bound—I can swear to this as being the property of Mr. Wyld—this is one of three maps that were stolen—this is one large map of the world—this is one of the magnifying glasses that Were stolen that night—this coat I do not know—this other coat was mine—I had given it to the porter some time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live at No. 32, Thornton-street I know Harradine—I met him with the last witness on Monday morning, 15th Sept—I am positive it was on that day, because I had to go to receive rents, and I put it down in the book—I saw him that morning in Thornton-street; I stopped him, and went on with him—I could not tell what coat he had on; I did not take notice—I know he had a coat on—I stopped and talked to him; he was going towards Bermondsey-street—I did not stand and see him out of the street—I never knew him to keep a horse and cart, or a donkey and cart—I never knew him to have a black and white dog.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser. I reside at Bermondsey—I know Harradine—I recollect when Frost came in; it was on Monday, 15th Sept—on that morning I saw Harradine in his shop in Bermondsey-street; that is about six miles and a half from St. John's Wood—Dockhead is three quarters of a mile from Bermondsey-street—I purchased two glasses of him that morning, and I paid him about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I have no recollection of how he was dressed—I think he wan in his shirt sleeves—he is generally in his long over coat—I never knew him have a horse and cart.</p>

               <p>through the books without a title! in the transferror—this took place in my room at the Crystal Palace—upon that complaint being made, the prisoner said that it did appear to be irregular, but that he had the necessary trans<lb/>fers in his possession that would make it right—I asked him if he had them there—he said no, they were at his private house, which was at Kilburn—he offered to produce the transfers to me, if I would accompany him to his private house, and I went with him—when we arrived there, he left the room into which we were shown, two or three times, apparently from obser<lb/>vations he made, with a view of getting papers together, and the last time he left the room he did not return—I never saw him again until I saw him in custody at the police court at Lambeth, about a fortnight or three weeks ago—after my visit to Kilburn, I made search in the office that was occu<lb/>pied by the prisoner at the Crystal Palace—I made a partial search the next day, and continued the search for some days—I cannot remember that I found this particular document—I know the prisoner's writing very well—the signature of the attesting witness to the name of Johnson is in the prisoner's handwriting—I have the register of shares in Court (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the A shares—I have looked through this book myself—Henry Johnson is not registered on the A list of shareholders—this transfer applies to the A shares—I beg to correct my answer; Henry Johnson is registered, but not in respect of these shares; he is described as of "Birmingham, contractor"—he is not registered in respect of shares 145,052 to 145,101—the shares not called A and B shares are the original shares of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—then there was a second issue of 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. A shares, a third issue of 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The document being read purported to be a transfer from Henry Johnson to Joseph Low of fifty shares in the Crystal Palace Company.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY JOHNSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that nothing was said to you about taking shares in the Crystal Palace; just be careful in your recol<lb/>lection, and tell me whether something of this sort did not pass; do you remember the prisoner saying that he did not wish his own name to be placed on the Stock Exchange, and might he use yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never said that to me; nothing to that effect—I never said, "You may do what you like, I don't care"—he did not say that he objected to his name being used on the Stock Exchange, and might he use mine—nothing of the sort ever passed between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am not asking whether it was proposed to you to be a participator in the forgery or fraud, but whether he might take shares in your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never said that to me, nor anything to that effect—I clearly under<lb/>stand what you mean—he never said anything to me about objecting to his name appearing on the Stock Exchange—I am quite positive of it—I do not remember his having a conversation with me about the Stock Exchange at all—I am sure that no such conversation took place.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">submitted, that the document in question was an incomplete instrument, and therefore not a transfer, as alleged by the indictment.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that such proof was unnecessary; in the case qf the forgery of a transfer of the stock in the Bank of England, the purchaser may not accept till long afterwards, yet that would be undoubtedly a forgery of a transfer.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">observed, that in the ease of Bank Stock the transfer passed by the signature of the trantferror, but in a chartered company the transferee did not obtain any interest in the company until he had executed the deed, and obtained the registration of fa instrument.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stated, that there were counts calling it a deed, and he submitted, that this being a deed under seal, was a perfect deed of Johnson's at the time he executed it</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">urged, that although it might be a deed as between the parties, yet it was in reality a deed of transfer; and in order to make it a deed of transfer, its execution, both by fa seller and purchaser, must be regularly proved.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that fa objection was answered; it was clearly a deed, and he should also hold it to be a transfer.</hi>)</p>

On a Monday night, in Oct., about the 6th, we had a silver watch, with a white face, at our house, for a raffle, which was to take place on the next Monday—it was placed in the bar—it hung over the parlour door, that the customers might see it—the prisoner was standing at the bar, drinking with some others—they went out, and then the prisoner and another man came in again, and the other man put his hands on the bar—the prisoner went to the watch and took it, and they both walked away together—there was no noise nor disturbance then—that was the first time—thoy were out about ten minutes, and then the prisoner and the other man came in alone—there waw not a number of per<lb/>sens</p>

               <p>there the second time, but there was the first—the second time he took the watch—the first time there was a fight—there was a row with some of their friends—after the row or disturbance, I saw the watch safe—the prisoner went out and came in with the other man, whose name is Michael Barrett—I believe he is not the prisoner's brother—I think he is his cousin—I did not see anything that happened outside, but when they took the watch I went to the door to see if they would come back with it, and they did not—I told a policeman—when the prisoner took the watch I went under the parlour door, because he used a bad expression to me—the watch hung over my head—Michael Barrett was drunk, and the pri<lb/>soner had hold of him—I was frightened that they would not bring it back, and my master was out—they did not come back, and I told the policeman of it about an hour afterwards—I shut up the house when all the people were out, and I went with the policeman to Barrett's house—I forget the name of the street—we found him at home, in bed—that was about half past 8 o'clock.</p>

On 14th Oct., about 8 o'clock, I was at the corner of Upper Charles-street, leading into Goswell-road—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and "Murder!" and "There he goes!"—I saw the prisoner coming from Powell-street west, running fast, and crying, "Stop thief!"—he had something like a bag in his hand, and as he got further into the road, he threw it away-followed him, and never lost sight of him till I caught him by his right hand collar—I came up to him at the same time as another man did—I saw the constable arrive from President-street—I saw the boy come up just after the constable had got hold of the prisoner's collar—the boy was crying for his master's bag and property—he laid hold of the prisoner directly he came up—he was very much frightened—this is such a bag as I saw the prisoner throw away.</p>

Q.</hi> What distance were yen from him when he threw it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I am to you—I did not see anything of it after he threw it away, till a gentleman brought it up just after the boy arrived—when the constable came up, I said to him, "You lay hold of him; you will soon hear what it is about"—I am quite sure I saw the prisoner throw away a bag very much resembling this—I could not swear it was this bag—it was something in the shape of a bag—I can swear it was not a mere motion of his arm—both his hands went together—I saw a bag go out of his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in William-street, Peter-street, and am a watch engraver. On the night of 14th Got, I was standing three or four yards up Powell-street west—when I had been there a minute and a halt or two minutes, I heard a child halloo, "Stop thief!"—I thought it was some boys at play in the square—presently the prisoner came running along on the opposite side to me—I crossed the way, and followed him—as he passed me I saw he had something in his left hand—I could not tell exactly what it was, but when I saw this bag I could tell it was most likely to be that—it was something dark—the prisoner hallooed, "Stop thief!" himself; but no one had passed there before the prisoner for a minute and a half before—I followed close behind him, and saw something fall in Gosfwell-road—I kept up close with the prisoner; and saw him caught by two or three persons</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Oxford-street, Chelsea, and was porter to Mr. Stephens, of No. 28, Parliament-street. On 27th June the prisoner called at my house—my wife went to the door—I went up and found him stating his name to be Mr. Brown—I knew him—he came to give me information of the death of a gentleman who had lived with me, stating that he had died on his outward voyage, and that he was appointed to his place, and had landed yesterday at Liverpool, and if he could come to me he would have his things forwarded to my house—I could not give him an answer then—(Mr. Cook was the name of the gentleman; he was surgeon on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Assaye</hi>, and the prisoner stated that he was appointed in his stead to the <hi rend="italic">Assaye</hi>)—I told him to call at the office, and I would give him an answer in the course of the day—between 12 and I o'clock he came to Parliament-street, and after some little conversation I arranged that he should come to lodge and board as Dr. Cook had—he said that he had to go to Park-street to the Emigration Office to settle his affaire, and would return in half an hour to write a letter to Liverpool to have his luggage sent to my house—(the <hi rend="italic">Aseaye</hi> is an emigrant ship going to Calcutta)—prior to leaving he asked me if I would give him a glass of water—I went down stairs to get some water, and when I returned he met me at the door with the glass in his hand which I had left on the table; be drank a little, out the glass on the table, And left about 1 o'clock to go to Park-street—(after that I saw no more of him till I "saw him at Marylebone police court)—between 3 and 4 o'clock I had occasion to get out my purse, which had con<lb/>tained seven sovereigns and a half from the pocket of ft coat in the room in which the prisoner was, and missed fitora it three sovereigns—it was safe just before 10 o'clock—I cannot say how many people there are in the home, hut nobody has access to those rooms except me and persons who come on business—my coat was on the office table—I went to the office soon after 9 o'clock, and put one of the sovereigns in my purse just before 10 o'clock,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270130"/>
               <p>and I counted my money then to see that it was correct, as my wife had put it in—I had not left the room at all from the time I counted it till the prisoner came, and then only to fetch the glass of water; he was the only person in the room then, and the only person in the room that day, except myself, I am positive of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long have you known me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a little know<lb/>ledge of you about twelve months before, when you came to see Dr. Cook an acquaintance of your supposed grandfather—you called three or four times afterwards—you knew the address of my office—I showed you a case of instruments which the doctor had left, as he was indebted to me, and said that I wanted to sell it—I did not tell you to sell it for me—I did not know that you belonged to the Emigration Office, nor that you had just come out of jail, or I should not have had anything to do with you—you said that you had just returned from India—you showed me two papers, one signed by Mr. Cain, of the Emigration Office, and the other giving yourself a good character for the care of the <hi rend="italic">Coolies</hi>, who had been on their voyage to the West Indies; that you had seven deaths only, and had got very great praise for the care you had taken of them—I did not have occasion to show you that the money was in my pocket—when I missed the money I did not call at the Emigration Office after you—I have since known Mr. Lancaster then—I do not know the date that I went there—I did not see you in the passage there; I wish I had but I have only one eye—I did not call then to inquire for you, but to enquire whether the tale was true about Dr, Cook's death, and heard that you had been there borrowing money—I gave information to the police on the Monday after the Friday of my loss—when you called a gentleman was speaking to me, who had called to inquire for his letters—he did not go into the room at all—he was at the top of the stairs—he was not on my premises.</p>

               <p>---- (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 109). On 24th and 25th June the prisoner was in Holloway prison, he came out on 26th June—I do not know that of my own knowledge—there is no one from the prison here—I saw him at the Mansion House on 4th April, and from there he went to Holloway prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> When I called on this man, he offered me a case of instruments, and if I had had any felonious intention I should have accepted them; I had no knowledge of the money in his pocket; I left because he did not give me a decisive reply; he never came to inquire after me, and gave no information of his loss to the police; it is a place of public business, and anybody can enter; he has acknowledged that there was another gentleman there; I did not say that I had been to India, I said that I had received a letter from my father, stating that Dr. Cook had died, and I showed it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. In the years 1853 and 1854, I was carrying on the business of a contractor for iron houses for Australia, and general contracting business. I had premises at Millwall, where the business was chiefly eon<lb/>ducted, and a counting-house in Arthur-street, City—I stopped payment in September, 1854—I paid fifteen shillings in the pound, and a great many in full—I dealt very largely with the defendant Fossey, to the amount of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the articles that form the subject of this investigation ought to have been sent to my premises at Millwall—the amount of the invoice for February was about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about the avenge amount of ay dealings; some months it was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that lasted from the beginning of 1853 till about September, 1854—during the whole of those transactions Neary was one of my clerks at the office in Arthur-street—when goods were brought from Fossey's to Millwall it was the duty of my clerks there to count the number of boards the wagon contained, to compare them with the delivery notes brought with them, and enter them in the delivery books at the factory—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two delivery books that refer to the period we are now inquiring about, from October, 1853, to May, 1854—they were used on alternate days—one was sent to the office in Arthur-street every morning with the delivery orders—it was Neary's duty to copy the contents of these books into the bought book at the office—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bought book for that period—Neary made up the ledger "from the bought book, and by the ledger I tested the accuracy of any account that might come in—this is the account sent in to me by Fossey for goods said to have been delivered in February, 1854—it amounts to 830<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I find in the invoice an entry on 1st Feb., "50 20-feet 1 1/4 inch fir boards, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that item is not entered in the receiving book at the factory—I have watched among the delivery orders, and have found no delivery order cor<lb/>responding with that item—this entry in the bought book of 1st Feb. is in Neary's writing—it contains that item, interlined between other entries—there</p>

               <p>are other items in the invoice on 1st Feb. which appear in the bought book—I find an item on 3rd Feb. in the invoice "90 inch white planed flooring boards, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is no entry of that in the receiving book, nor any delivery order referring to it—it is entered in the bought book in Neary's writing, in an interlineation—on the 6th here is "155 white boards, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." charged in the invoice—that does not appear in the receiving book—it is entered in the bought book in Neary's writing, in an interlineation—I have carefully looked at these items of 10th Feb., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 11th, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 15th, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 18th, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and 27th, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in all those instances there is no entry in the receiving book, nor any delivery order, but there are entries of all of them in the bought book by Neary, and every one of them are interlined—I find here an entry on 1st Feb. of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for boards—that is reckoned on the assumption that the measurement is <hi rend="italic">super</hi> and not linear—in the account it is written "square" over the "25"—if it was linear measure that item should have been 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there is an excess of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the receiving book it is entered 220 inch white flooring boards, 2540 "ft" put after the finish of the "0"—that means linear feet—in the delivery order it is "220 inch white floor boards, 2540 feet," the word "feet" written in full—I think that is Fossey's writing—that means linear, or running feet—on 2nd Feb. there is in the invoice, "100 inch planed white flooring boards"—that is charged, "12 squares 48 feet, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the receiving book it is entered "1248 feet," and the same in the delivery order, in Fossey's writing.</p>

In the beginning of 1853, and in 1854, I was clerk to Fossey—a young man, named Steel, was also a clerk—it was my business to be at the office—he had only one office, that was the place from which the timber that he supplied was delivered—I am acquainted with the mode in which the timber was delivered out to the customers—a delivery order was sent with the different deliveries, and there was a delivery order book kept—it has counterfoils remaining in it of the orders—it was my duty, at times, to make out the delivery orders—six of these delivery orders in Feb., are in my writing—they do not all apply to flooring boards, some apply to yellow boards, deals—here are some more for Feb.; here are eleven altogether—neither the length nor the width appears on the delivery order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the Victoria Docks. On 1st Oct., about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was at the Red Lion beer shop, West Ham, and saw the prisoner and another person—we had two or three pints of beer together, and some words took place about some women who had been quarrelling there in the morning—his wife came and asked him to go home; he refused, and pulled off his jacket, pulled out a knife, and ran to the bar, and struck me with his fist—I struck him again, and then I staggered outside the door, and fell on my back, and when I was down I found him on the top of me with an open knife—he stabbed me on the left breast, and three times on the arm, and drew the knife across my face—I bled a great deal—I have only done six days work since—his wife took the knife from him—I had had no quarrel with him; I never spoke above half a dozen words to him in my life before that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am booking cleric at the North Wool wich Railway, belong<lb/>ing to the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On Tuesday afternoon, 2nd Sept., a great number of passengers came down—I was engaged in the booking office between 5 and 6 o'clock, and Btitterworth came into the inner office, which is private—I told him that he had overstepped the mark, and had no business there, and he went out—I was alone—I kept my money there in a drawer—there is a telegraph in that office—I was writing at a table—Smith came in after Butterworth had left—I told him to go out and he went out—he asked me whether I had been one fighting over the water—I told him "No"—my money drawer was open, and had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in it—I shut the drawer, and then he came in again, and</p>

               <p>followed a gas fitter, employed by the Company, who came in for his tools, and went out—Smith then lounged round the Fenchurch-street case, where the money is kept, and I watched him out, looked the money drawer, left the key in, and shut the door of the inner office—I was working the tele<lb/>graph some time with my back to the door—I heard the rattling of money, turned round, and caught hold of Smith's arm—he was standing just in the middle of the inner office, by the table—the drawer was not above a yard and a half from him—I saw a great quantity of silver in his hand, and said, "You have got my money"—he walked back to the drawer, and told me to look in it—I looked in it, and the money was all gone—he shuffled it back, and said, "There is your money"—Fountain then came, pushed me against the counter, and said, "He has not got your money"—while that was going on, I saw Butterworth rapping at the window farthest from the door, calling out for a ticket for Shoreditch—that was the Fenchurch-street window, and not the proper window for Shoreditch—Fountain and Smith then went out together, and Fountain called out, "You cannot go until you have locked your places"—I returned, and locked my places, and the money was gone—it was to follow Smith that I went out—the prisoners were then all three together, and Smith turned to the right, and the other two to the left—I met Mr. Chapman, and he and another gentleman found the prisoners, and I was afterwards taken to see them in custody, and saw Butterworth and Fountain—about a fortnight afterwards I saw Smith in custody at Shoreditch, and pointed him out.</p>

I was sitting there between 3 and 4 o'clock and saw the three prisoners talking to one another—Butterworth was sit<lb/>ting down, and the other two standing against him—I passed them two or three times—after that I saw Smith run down the Fenchnrch-street platform, and then heard a loud scream, "You have robbed my till"—the other two were then gone, and I afterwards saw them in custody—I saw Smith nine or ten days afterwards—they are the men.</p>

I am a lime merchant On 2nd Sept, I was at North Woolwich railway station, in the outer office; my attention was attracted by Butterworth rapping at the Fenchurch box, and calling, "Sboreditch, Shoreditch"—while he was doing this, I heard the boy say, "You have got my money"—I caught'a glimpse of a man inside the office, who had bold of his arm, but not sufficient to identify him—I went on the platform and gave an alarm, and when I returned they were in the office.</p>

On 20th Sept., about 11 o'clock, the prisoners came to my gate together—Thomas said he was recommended to me about some deals he had for sale—I told him that I was not in want of any, and asked him if they were lying on board a ship—he replied, "No; they are landed"—I asked him if they were his own—he said, "Yes"—I asked him why he did not try to part with them in Deptford, without coming all the way to New-cross—he said that he had been to Mr. Jones's, at Deptford, who said that he had laid out all his money that week, or else he would have purchased them—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and I told him ultimately that I would take them—they were spruce deals, and were worth 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about 3 o'clock in the afternoon Thomas came, and said, "I have brought the deals"—they placed them inside the gates—I told them to call at 8 o'clock for the money, and they went away with the carman—some short time afterwards a police inspector and constable came, and I gave up the deals to them, without paying for them—I made an arrangement with the police to stop over the way—the prisoners came about half past 7 o'clock, and I sent for the police—the inspector asked them where they got the deals—Thomas, I believe, said that he found them floating, or lying under the bows of the cholera ship at Deptford—he took them in charge.</p>

               <p>Neale owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for money lent, and lodging besides—I said, "Don't do one thing that is, wrong, I want nothing but what is right and, fair"—I called in a policeman to ascertain that it was right; he did not know much about it—having filled up the warrant, Toner made the distress—he demanded 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for making the levy, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the man that he put in—he wanted me, to pay it down then—I said, "No, not until the business is settled; I never did in the country"—he said, "The law is different now"—I refused to pay him until it was completed, but, my wife did—Toner told me next day that she had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the man—I do not know when she paid the rest, and I gave my man 10. to give him, as he said he was abort of money—I saw him take, it—this was on 18th July—the man remained in possession five days—my wife paid him—at the end of the five days, Toner came, accompanied by Graham and Mr. Campion, the appraiser, a police<lb/>man to swear the appraiser, and two other men—Toner came and said to me that the appraisers were come to appraise the goods, and I must pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before they had right to work—I put down four, half crowns on the table, the halfpenny they said they would give me—Toner said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was for the appraiser, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the appraiser's clerk, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, the stamp—Graham took the money up from the table, he was the appraiser's clerk—I said, "It is a great deal of money for, me to pay, this is 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that I have paid"—he said, "You can buy the goods, if you like, at the con<lb/>demned price"—Toner and Graham both said so—I said, "Please to make two lots of the goods, as Mr. Neale owes me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," which I wished Toner to take out off the warrant, and I thought I might be able to get that—"Hold your tongue," said Graham, "we have made it all right,"and he waved his hand, ordering me not to speak, and I walked away, thinking it was all right—Toner said it was all right, and told me not to interfere—Toner walked to the back garden, and called out, "Mr. Neale," three times to come and claim the goods, and three times at the front door—Mr. Neale did not answer, and he then said, "We must give the landlord the privilege of buying these goods at the condemned price"—he said that publicly at the table—he then called out twice, "Francis Marker, or any person in the, behalf of Francis Marker, to, take these goods at the condemned price"—(3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the price named)—the second time he called that out, I answered, "Yes,"—I said it loud, so as they could hear me—I walked close to the table, and said, "Yes," close to them—I said, "Yes, I take them at the condemned price"—I then turned to go through my parlour to the back part of the house, and my man followed me—Toner came into the parlour, and said to my man, "You must pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for these goods, as there is another man will give a sovereign more for them;" that waste part between themselves—I called Toner, and said, "You please to settle the warrant, give me a regular receipt; you want a sovereign more, I understand; I don't mind paying you; I don't see that there is any occa<lb/>sion for it, I will run up stairs for the money, and settle it"—he said, "I am going out to have a glass of ale, and I will be in and settle the warrant for you in two or three minutes"—I did not promise to give him the other sovereign—I waited for him until night, he did not return—that same night Mr. Jones and three or four men came to take, the goods—I saw Graham there shortly afterwards packing up the goods—I prevented it—I went to the police station and spoke to the inspector—a policeman came—I said to Graham, "Who has sold these goods?"—he said "Toner"—I said "Where is Toner?"—he said, "He is over at the gardens having a bit of a pipe; it is all right; let the goods stop till he comes back with the money"</p>

I will leave the goods, I won't take them; I don't wish to do anything that is wrong," and shortly after they all went away—between 11 and 12 o'clock that night, Mr. Jones brought Toner to the shop—he was drunk—I said to him, "You have sold these goods twice over, after I have bought them and paid you your experises, and I will have you taken up for embezzlement"—he said, I have not sold the goods;" and he turned round to my man and said, "You can take the goods to-morrow morning' at 10 o'clock"—the next night I put the goods down in the cellar, as I wanted to let the shop; a party was wait ing for it—Graham and Jones came for them next day—Graham' insisted on taking them—the man in possession told him he should not, until he had paid the rent, and they "did not get them—afterwards Jones, Toner, and another man came and said they came on account of Neale's goods—I said, "I shan't have anything to say to you"—Toner told me that Neale had taken out a Conty Court summons for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods that he had condemned and sold to me—I did receive a County Court summons, and had to srrffer the loss, in conse<lb/>quence of Toner's making a false distress—they decided against me at the County Court, and I had to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expenses, and lost all the rent—it has almost ruined me—I am only a working man—I was obliged to give up the goods; it was decided against me on the ground that the half week had been put in—Toner said, "I have got the money (meaning Jones's money), and I mean to stick to it;" and he took the money otit in his hand—he said, "I did not sell the goods"—I said, "You took the money"—he said, I did not"—I said, "Who did?"—he said, "My clerk"—I said, "Who is your clerk?"—he said, Graham"—Graham was not present then—he then asked me to stand a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—I refused, and he said, "Very well, I have got plenty of money, and I mean to spend it"—on 9th Aug. Toner came again, with Graham—they came into my parlour door—my daughter was up in the parlour—I and my wife were down in the kitchen having our dinner—I went up on my daughter calling me—Toner said, "I have come about Neale's goods"—I said, "I have nothing to sayto you; I am just having my dinner"—I locked the parlour door, and went down stairs again (this was after I had been to the County Court)—I left them in the stop—before I got to the bottom of the stairs I heard the parlour door burst open—my wife ran up directly, and I heard a great noise—I did not go up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Marker. I saw the pri<lb/>soner at our place several times—I was by the side of them on 9th Aug when they came to appraise the goods—when the distress was first put in I paid Toner some money, that was about an hour after the distress was put in—I heard the conversation between him and my husband previously—he asked my husband for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half a crown, and he refused—after my husband was gone out, Toner said to me, "You know this is a poor fellow (meaning Bevel), and he wants money, and it is not in my power to pay it him; I have got a great many men about, and I must go and visit them all"—I said I could not get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but I could let the poor fellow have half a crown before he went home—he said, "So do, and let me have it," and I gave him half a crown, he kept 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it, and gave the rest to the man—next day I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that was for himself—he said he wanted a few shilling—in the evening I paid the man his half crown—next day Toner came and said he wanted a shilling of my husband—he said, "No, I have made a promise that I would not pay any, but if you are badly off and in want of a shil<lb/>ling," he gave our man one to give him—Toner had another half crown that same day from me to give to the man, I did not see him give it to him, he told me he did—I paid the man three half crowns myself, and Toner three half crowns and 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present when the appraisement was mads—I saw Graham there, and saw my husband pay the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would not say that Graham took it up, because I did not observe it, but it was taken up by one of them at the table that was doing the business—between 9 and 10 o'clock Graham came with Mr. Jones and two workmen with a donkey cart, they took the goods down from the window, and were packing them all up—Jones took out a receipt and said he had paid for it—I said, "Why, the other day my husband bought it"—Jones said, "Oh! I have bought it since that"—Graham said we must let them go, it was all right—I saw Graham and Toner when they came on the last occasion, and Feltham too—when I heard the door broken open, I went up and saw Toner standing in the parlour, and Graham in the parlour doorway—I said, "What are you doing? what right have you here?"—Toner said, "I want Mr. Neale's things"—I said, "If you please walk out from here, you have no business here"—I put my hand to push him out, he would not go, and he knocked me with his wrist—I put them out of the parlour—Graham did not come inside the parlour—I</p>

               <p>I was going down stairs again, when I heard some one call "Mistress"—I went back, and when I came into the shop Graham was lifting up the people's curtains that they had parted off the shop with, and gone in under where they kept their beds, right on the trap door that leads into the cellar—he tried to pull away the beds to go down, and then he took a chair in his hand, and said to Mr. Jones and the men, "Come here, and take all these things and draw them out in the street, Mr. Neale has not given np posses<lb/>sion of it yet"—I pulled the chair away from him and said, "Let go my lodgers' things, if you please," and I pushed him to push him out of the shop door, and he pushed me about very much—there was a large stick standing by—I saw him looking at it, and I caught hold of it, and he took it in his hand and shook me about, and made me very faint indeed.</p>

I am a labourer, at Plumstead I was put in possession of these goods by Toner—I was present when the goods were condemned—at first Mr. Campion said he should not condemn the goods, nor have any<lb/>thing to do with it unless the money was paid; then Toner called to Marker to pay the money, and Marker came and paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down on the table; then Graham and Toner appraised the things, and Toner went into Marker's little parlour, and called, "Thomas Neale, Thomas Neale 1 is any one here on behalf of Thomas Neale?"—no one answered, and he came to the front door and called him again, and no one answered; then he said, "Well, as no one answers on behalf of Thomas Neale, I suppose we must give the preference to Mr. Marker; is there any one here that will take these goods at the condemned price on behalf of Mr. Marker?"—he said it the second time, and Mr. Marker said, "I will; my young man will take them, for I am busy;" and he left the room—he went close up to the table, and said that; I could hear him perfectly, Toner could not help hearing him, he was closer to him than I was, and Graham too; they both sat at the table, and I stood at the back of them; then Toner got up and walked into the little parlour along with Marker's man; what he said to him I do not know—before that I had not heard any one say that he would give a sovereign over the condemned price—when Toner came back he sat down in a chair, and laid, "Is there any one else here that will take these things at the con<lb/>demned price?"—Mr. Jones said, "I will"—Toner said, "Are you prepared to pay the money?"—he said he would pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and he pulled out two wvereigns—Toner said, "That will not do; I must have the whole"—Jones said, "If you will go with me to North Woolwich, you can have the whole;" and Graham, Toner, and Jones all left, leaving me in charge of the dungs—between 8 and 9 o'clock Jones and Graham came to take away the things—I refused to let them go until Toner was present—I was to receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—I have never received it all up to the present—I hold my warrant now (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), it is in Toner's handwriting—I have received six days' pay—he had 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the first half crown, and he borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of my wife, which he has never repaid.</p>

On Saturday, 20th Sept, about half past 9 o'clock, in consequence of what my little girl said, I went across the road to the prisoner's house—I went into the front parlour; there were three or four persons there—I said, "There is a fire here, let us have a light"—they had no candle, but they had a fire—by that time constable 74 came in—I said, "Get me a candle, and we will see where this fire is"—I got a candle and went up stairs into the front room—there was nothing at all in that room, with the exception of a few rags lying on the further side of the room, towards the front of the house—I said to the constable, "Here is no fire here"—I went across the room, and opened a cupboard door—I found two bricks had been removed from the bottom part of the cupboard, and I was the flames raging behind the wall that parts the bedroom from the loft—the removal of those bricks would enable a person to put rags, or anything, into the loft—I found some rags there—I had to cut the partition down and throw some pails of water through to stay the fire, and then I went into the loft where the fire was—I found something like half a bushel of rags and paper, and a butter firkin all burning together; that part which was towards the passage was not burned, but all round towards the hole was burned—part of the joists of the kitchen ceiling were burned—the flame was raging about two or three feet high when I first saw it; the joists were burning—a surveyor who has seen the house has given me orders to put in two new joists, on account of those being so burnt—if the fire had not been put out then, in my opinion it would have spread in less than ten minutes, and the whole row of houses would have been burnt down—amongst the rags there was some whitey brown paper, and some pieces of blue cotton shirting—I believe they cor<lb/>responded with some of the rags found in the room—I know the situation of this loft; the only mode of reaching it from the prisoner's premises was by the hole that was cut through the brick wall of the cupboard—I saw the prisoner after the fire had been put out; I met her about twenty yards from the house—she said, "Mr. Moore, they tell me my house is on fire"—I said, "No, don't frighten yourself, it is not on fire, it is put out;" and she turned on her heel, and said, "Well, I will go and let them see if anybody is there;" and she went to the door—whether she attempted to knock at the door, or whether she forced it open, I cannot say, but she was falling to the ground, and policeman, No. 74, caught hold of her arm, and picked her up—I think she had been drinking a little.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Greenwich, and am agent to the Globe Insurance Company. On the night of 20th Sept., in consequence of a communication made to me, I went to examine these premises—Mr. Moore showed me the cupboard—I took the candle, looked into it, and well examined the wall—I found that the bricks had evidently been removed very recently—we then went on to the stairs, and through the hole he had made into the loft—I took from there a portion of the remaining fragments of rags—a good portion of the paper and rags had been burnt, about one third of it—I produce what I found—there is a piece of striped shirting amongst it—it is a very common pattern at Greenwich—I afterwards went into the passage that divides the two houses—I there found some bricks lying down in the passage—any person putting their hand through the hole in the cupboard could throw the bricks below, or they might have fallen from the blow which thrust them out.</p>

I know the prisoner—I saw her on the Saturday, the day of the fire, several times—between 3 and 4 o'clock I picked up a pewter pot in front of her house, and took it over to a beer shop opposite Mr. Moore's—she said that the b——old b——had been after the rent, and she would see her in flames before she would pay it, for anybody that paid rent was fools; for six months and a fortnight she could keep her house, and then she would set fire to the b——building, and if the old b——came by, she would take and throw her b——carcase into the flames—she was perfectly comfortable when she said this—I mean she was not intoxicated—I do not think she had been drinking—about a month or six weeks before that she said the old b—had been after the rent, and she would not pay any, she would see her at—first—she had better put the money on the clothes—her husband had taken a house, and she had refused the key, she was not going to be such a b——fool as to take another house until she had done her work—we had not been drinking together on the day in question—we were on friendly terms, so far as neighbours, only good morning and good night, never holding any conversation, only when she thrust her conversation in like that.</p>

I know the prisoner perfectly well—he has been in and out of the house during the time I have been there, about nine months—on the morning of 27th Sept. I went to the place where the prisoner slept about half past 5 o'clock—he was in bed—I told him to get up—he said he should not get up then—I visited him again about half an hour afterwards—I again found him in bed, and told him to get up—he said he would see me b—first—I visited him a third time, about 8 o'clock, I think—he still persisted that he would not get up, and made use of bad language—I told him I should call the attention of the master to it, which I did—Mr. Jones, the assistant master, and myself then went to him, and we pulled the clothes off him—with that he got on to the ground with his feet—he was sitting, and he rose up and struck Mr. Jones on the chest with his foot—he made use of bad language and swearing—I do not recollect what—he ordered Mr. Jones out of the room—Mr. Jones refused to go, and he said, "You b——, if you don't go, I have got something here will make you"—with that he went to a bed in the further end of the room, and drew from under the bed this bar of iron, and he came back, and gave a slashing cut with it towards Mr. Jones's head—it was a violent blow, and I saw the blood flow immediately afterwards—Mr. Jones did not strike him from first to last, but after he struck, Mr. Jones closed in with him, and I took the bar from him—this is a protection bar of the window guard—I had seen it in its proper place about 7 o'clock the evening before—it was attached to the window—it had been fastened with screws, and it had been unscrewed—this is only half the bar—the other half was under the bed—when I saw it the evening before, it was one long bar attached to the window—I cannot say that I had ever heard the prisoner use any threats towards Mr. Jones—he was a man that used very violent language—he was placed in that ward by order of the guardians, the night before, for his misconduct—it is not a worse ward than the others, only they do more labour in it—it is a ward for casual paupers—the whole of the inmates of the workhouse got up at half past 5 o'clock at that time—Mr. Jones did not strike the prisoner from first to last—till he had been struck by the bar, he did not lay hand on him—I did not touch him till I took the iron out of his hand—neither Mr. Jones nor I had any bludgeon or staff, or anything in our hands—neither of us threatened to strike him.</p>

I was not aware of it; I suppose I must get you the money"—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "I don't think I am bound to tell you"—I told him he had better, or it would be a very bad job for us both, and cause a great deal of trouble—he said, "I will tell you then; I found two of them in a brass-bound <hi rend="italic">ports monnaie</hi>, in the Borough, and I gave the other to my landlord"—I said, "Did you?"—I then said I would go to the Bank in the morning, and if it was a forgery I would come down to his house—he said, "Very well"—I went to his home the next day, about half-past 2 o'clock—I had then been to the Bank, and found the note was forged—when I got to the house the door was shut—I did not see the prisoner—I saw the lodger—I believe the prisoner has a wife; I did not see her—I went to the Peckham police station, and gave information to sergeant Bond—on Thursday, 16th Oct, I went with ser<lb/>geant Bond to No. 9, York-terrace, Peckham, and found the prisoner there with two children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station clerk at the London Bridge terminus. I should say the prisoner has been in the employ of the company from ten to twelve years—he has been head ticket collector for four or five years past—of late the up trains stop at Forest Hill, and the tickets are taken there—the prisoner had the superintendence of that station—it was his duty, at the close of the day, to fill up a form, and half was for<lb/>warded to the London station—that ought to contain all the money received—this counterfoil of 18th Aug. did not come to me—this duplicate came to me as the duplicate of the excess book of 18th Aug.—the duplicates have come to me from Forest Hill by casual persons, in an envelope, generally—the prisoner did not bring them at all himself, they came by the train—by the paper that came on 18th Aug., the amount represented as received is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the counterfoil of that date, under the head of Margate, here appears 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the account of them has not been rendered to me—in the counterfoil of 22nd Aug., the amount is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and what was sent up to me was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it reached me in the same way in course of business.</p>

I received 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was still a small balance left in his hands—I know that he received the money in small sums from the ticket collectors—the excess forms are always sent up in an envelope—I find them in the letter box, or they are brought in by some of the guards—I have known him some years—I always thought him an honest man.</p>

On 22nd Oct, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, I went out for a pint of half and half—as I passed her window she muttered something, I cannot say what—as I came back she struck me on the temple, and said, "Take that, you old cow, for going up against the people at No. 3"—(I had had to bind them over to keep the peace at No. 3, as they were always insulting me)—I was cut, and the blood flowed very much.</p>
