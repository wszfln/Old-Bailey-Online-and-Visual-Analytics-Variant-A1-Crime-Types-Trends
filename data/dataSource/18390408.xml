               <p>morning—Mr. White gave me the prisoner's name and address, and about three-quarters past six o'clock I went there—it was in Chatham-gardens, City-road—I found the prisoner in bed, and several children in the room—his brother, who is two years older than him, was also in bed—I told the prisoner my business—he denied all knowledge of the robbery—I took up his clothes, which were by the bed side, on the same side as he was, and found in various parts of them the property mentioned in the indictment—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I told him he must get up and go with me—he put on the clothes from which I had taken the property, and went with me—his brother got up at the same time, and put on another suit lying on his side of the bed—this chisel Mr. White found on his counter.</p>

               <p>Woodcock's Field—I went there at eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 17th, and there were but twelve—a fat wether sheep was gone—I found the skin and entrails in the adjoining field—I observed foot-marks in that field of more than one man—it is a meadow—the field the sheep had been pas<lb/>turing in was a turnip-field—I observed foot-marks in that field also, of one or two persons, corresponding with those in the field where the sheep was slaughtered—one of them was very remarkable—I sent for the con<lb/>stable, and we followed the track of the footsteps for about a mile, towards West Hyde, in Rickmansworth parish—the nearest foot-mark to the pri<lb/>soner's house was about half a mile—it led to many other houses besides his—on the following morning (Monday) I went to the prisoner's house, about half-past eleven o'clock, and while the constables were searching it the prisoner came home—he said, "Halloo, what is the matter now?"—the constable said, "We are looking for mutton"—he said, "I wish there was some here"—the other constable said, "Let me look at your shoes"—he held up one—the constable said, "Let me look at the other"—he then held up the other—the constable said, "They are the shoes"—I noticed the tips had been taken off the heels—it appeared to have been done not more than an hour or two, I could see by the appearance of them—the shoes were taken from him, and he was taken into custody—I observed, in the gap between the two fields, impressions of a person wearing corduroy breeches having knelt—there was the appearance of two persons having been there—in getting up the bank they had made a slip, and knelt down on their left knee—there was the mark of cord, and at the bottom a flat impression, as if the breeches had been mended with cloth—I saw the pri<lb/>soner's trowsers afterwards, they were corduroy, and were mended with a piece of cloth—in my judgment those trowsers made that impression—it was a very strong impression—the bank was dirty, and his trowsers were soiled with dirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Harefield. On Sunday morning, the 17th of March, I was sent for, and went to Woodcock's-field—I found foot-marks in the sheep-fold of one man, very remarkable indeed—I noticed the mark of a toe of a shoe and the knee of trowsers, where he had slipped on the gap between the two fields—there were marks of two persons having been there—in the adjoining field we found the skin and entrails of the sheep—I accompanied Willis in the direction the foot-marks led, and went to West Hyde—I traced those marks nearly down to the prisoner's house—there were one hundred or two hundred impressions of foot-marks, very strong in some places—I found some about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner's house—I went to his house on the Monday, and found about three pounds weight of mutton, cooked, and a great deal of broth, but none raw—he came in, and said, "Halloo, what are you at there?"—I said, "Searching for stolen mutton"—I asked him to let me look at his shoes, which he did—I said, "That is one of the shoes, let me see the other"—he held it up—I said I could swear that was the shoe that made the track—they struck me directly as being the shoes, and seeing the tips were fresh pulled off, I asked him why he had pulled them off—he said they had been off about a week—I told him to pull the shoes off, and I put them into my pocket—I examined the foot-marks with the shoes, and they exactly corresponded—before that, in consequence of information, I went to Ford's, a shoe-maker's, near the prisoner's house—he produced two tips to me, in two parts—I put them together, and they formed a pair of tips—I applied them to the prisoner's shoes, and they were the tips that had come off</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080027"/>
               <p>these shoes—I applied the shoes to the foot-marks, and they exactly cor<lb/>responded—I can safely say the impressions, from the fold to within a quarter of a mile of the prisoner's house, had been made with those shoes—after I took him into custody I saw him throw something away—I ran and picked it up, and found it was this knife—I opened it, and there were marks of blood on it, and a sort of fat—the prisoner is a labourer—I asked him where he got the meat, he could not tell me.</p>

I have not teen him take any thing off, but after hearing you had taken him into custody I had the curiosity to look, and I picked up these tips"—he fitted them to the shoes, and they apparently fitted.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ—on the 14th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was out—my apprentice came to me—I returned with him, and found the prisoner and my daughter in the shop—I asked him for the silver—he denied having it—my daughter said, "Don't tell a story, I saw you put it in your pocket"—I sent for a policeman—the prisoner attempted to go into another stop—I prevented him—he took off his boots, and shook them—he then took off his coat, and threw it into an adjoining shop—he then took off three waistcoats, and threw them at me, and said, "There is your silver"—it was not there—he then took off his trowsers, and then his belt—the policeman arrived, and searched him, but found nothing on him—the silver was found on the floor, under his coat—it was impossible for it to have fallen on the floor there.</p>

               <p>and were a great nuisance all the time—she told me Hughes was her hus<lb/>band, but I did not believe it till Theleur said he gave her away—she told me so after she said she was separated from her husband and could not marry again—I asked her to explain that, and she said, "I am married to both"—she said so repeatedly while she was in our house—she told me so about three weeks before Theleur told me he had given her away—we did not believe her—she continued to go by the name of Stirling—she occa<lb/>sionally went by both names—both Mrs. Hughes and Mr. Theleur told me they were married at Marylebone church—I never heard Hughes say so.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A long letter from the prisoner to Mr. Stephen was here read, entreating his forgiveness, and promising never to trouble him if he would cause her to be liberated. There was nothing in it admitting a second marriage.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Laidley, of Windmill-street. The prisoner was in my service for three weeks—she came to me at the bar on Good Friday morning, and said she was going to leave—I said she had better do so if she could not conduct herself in a proper manner—I went up stairs soon after, and in passing her bed-room door I saw a bag of mine on her table—I brought it down, and she came and asked me for it—I said it was mine—she said I had given it to her—she was very abusive, and my husband called a policeman—I went up with him, and found a variety of things of mine in her box—this is my bag—some of these arti<lb/>cles were in it, and some in her box—they are all mine—since she has left I have found things concealed almost every day.</p>

I told I would not advise him, he must use his own discretion, and he said no more about it—I took Brown into custody the same day, at his house in Laystall-street—he keeps a marine store shop there—I found the pair of trowsers, which have been produced, in a box in the first floor front room—I asked him where he got them; he said he bought the duplicate of a man he did not know, and took them out of pledge at a shop at the top of Eyre-street-hill—there is a pawnbroker's there; this was on Sunday, the 17th, as the robbery was on the 14th—I produce a waistcoat which I received from a person named Parr on the same night, before I went to apprehend Brown—I watched Parr into Brown's house, with Baxter—they came out together—I saw Baxter go into Gray's Inn-lane, where I took him, and Parr afterwards gave me the waistcoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I have come from the House of Correction, where the Magistrate committed me, as a witness, for want of sureties. I was a pauper in the work-house some years back, but not at the time in ques<lb/>tion—on the 14th of March I went there with Lill and Baxter, at half-past eleven o'clock at night (we had passed the house several times in the course of the day)—we hoisted Lill over the fence—he broke in, and came and let Baxter and I in at the wicket-gate—he had this small chisel with him—we took down the wire fence of the store-room window, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the window up, and Lill entered the room—we took away seventeen pairs of trowsers, five jackets, five waistcoats, four pairs of trowsers, two pairs of stockings, and about two dozen laces, 28lbs. weight of sugar, done up in a brown paper bag, tied round with string, 3 or 4lbs. weight of soap, and some cheese—I put on a suit of the clothes under my own—Lill put some over his shoulder, and Baxter some over his—we all three then went to fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Holborn, leaving the rest of the things in the yard of the workhouse—Witty is the man that drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we brought him down to Ray-street, opposite the workhouse—I told him to drive to Aylesbury-street and back again, and by that time the things were ready to put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I do not think he saw where we got them from—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stood just round the corner, out of sight of the gate—I put the things in—we got inside, and Lill rode on the box—we drove to Laystall-street, one or two</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Edmonton, and am a licensed victualler. I came to town on the 2nd of January, and went to the London Docks to inquire for the ship <hi rend="italic">Cancer</hi>, from Sydney—I met with a very respectable man as I thought, who asked what ship I was looking for—just as we were coming out of the Docks the prisoner joined us—the other man and him did not appear to be acquainted—the prisoner said, "These are very fine docks, gentlemen"—I said, "Yes, but I never was here before"—the other man said, he had never been there before—they then said, "Let us go and have a drop of gin-and-water," and we went into a public-house—we each of us paid for our own glass—the prisoner sat at another table, not where I was—after a while the prisoner said he had just come out of Bethlehem—I asked what for—he said he had been clerk to old Jemmy Wood, of Gloucester, and he had left him a great deal of money, that he did not know what to do with it, and he gave a bullock to be roasted entire to the people, and the corporation had him taken up—I asked him who got him out of Bethlehem—he said, "Alderman Wood, of London"—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080089"/>
               <p>asked where was the certificate of his discharge—he said he had left it at home—he then put his hand into his side pocket, and pulled out a great roll of notes which looked like Bank of England notes—he said he had plenty of sovereigns likewise—he said he had got so much money left, he did not know what to do with it, and he would give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other man, to give away in charity—I said, "It is very strange, you must get a friend to give your money; can't you do it your<lb/>self?"—he said he had been to the Bank, and sold out 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by Mr. Jack<lb/>son, the stock-broker—I did not stop with him more than half an hour—we then all three came out, and crossed Tower-hill—the other man went one way and the prisoner another—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to Bishopsgate—I had asked the other gentleman what he was—he said he was a general shop-keeper at Ipswich—I asked what inn he put up at, and he said, "The Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street"—I said, "Do you make that your board?" he said "Yes"—I said I should be in town the next morning, to go to Mr. Calvert's, as I had some business to do there—I came to town the next morning, by the omnibus—when I got out at the Four Swans, this re<lb/>spectable shop-keeper met me, and appeared very glad to see me—we walked up Bishopsgate-street together, and the prisoner joined us—we all three walked along till we got to Abchurch-lane—I said I was going to Calvert's, and the respectable man said he was going to his shop-keeper's, near London-bridge—we all went into the White Hart tavern—we called for two sixpenny-worths of gin-and-water, and that was all we had—I left there, and went to Calvert's, and drew out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in four £50 notes—I re<lb/>turned to the White Hart, and sat down—the prisoner said he could not think of giving away his money, without I could show my respectability equal to the other—(the respectable man had said that he could show he had got money)—I said I could show that I had got some—I then pulled out my money, and the other man pulled out his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the prisoner then took a chair, and came and sat opposite to us—I laid down my four £50 notes, and the prisoner laid down his, and the other man laid down his—the other man then said to me, "I will take care of your money, and put in your fob for you"—he leaned against me, took up my money, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it along to the prisoner—I do not know which took it—I never saw it any more—the other man kept me down, and said he would put my money into my fob, and he kept me down sideways till he put it in as I thought—the prisoner then said he would go and fetch a stamp—I asked the other man what he wanted a stamp for—he said he did not know, and that he would go and get a sheet of paper, which would do just as well, and off he went—I then looked at my pocket, and found I had only a dirty hand-bill and a bit of paper—I went to the bar, and told the lady that I had been robbed of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ran out, and had it not been for the number of turnings, I am sure I must have caught the other man—he did not go across Abchurch-yard, or I certainly must have seen him—he could have got but a very few yards, I am sure, before it struck me that I was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>—I went down to Bristol last month, and saw the prisoner there in prison—I looked at him very hard, and I said to myself, "That is certainly the same man, but he is not in the same dress"—I was not with him on the second day above five minutes before I went to Calvert's, and not more than a quarter of an hour in all—I had a good opportunity of seeing him—the waiter came in while we were all three drinking in the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not pointed out to you distinctly by the officer, and did you not say, "That is not the man, nor nothing like the man?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir—I said, according to his dress when he got out of the van, that he did not appear like the man—I did not say, he was not the man nor any thing like the man, to my knowledge—this was some time in February—it rained very hard when he got out and I did not stop—I was told that two men were coming and I went to look at them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to believe all these tough stories? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I was taken by surprise about old Jemmy Wood—I did not make an appoint<lb/>ment to meet either of them the next day, but I came to the Four Swans, as I always do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Bristol you said to yourself, you thought that was the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went to the Court, and when the prisoner and another man were brought in, the prisoner turned as yellow as saffron, and he tuned quite black—he hung his head down and fetched two sighs—when the jailer came up to the Court he called me on one side and said, "Do you know what the prisoner has been saying to me?"—"How should I know?" says I—the prisoner was in the same room, but I cannot tell whether he heard it—the jailer said the prisoner had said that I was the old man that was robbed in the City.</p>

I have so much money left me by Wood that I do not know what to do with it, and I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was then some conversation about taking more grog, and one of them proffered a journey to see the Great Western—the farmer then descended the stairs, and I called him on one side—the prisoner then descended the stairs, to follow the farmer, and I instantly took him into custody, and pushed him into the bar—I did not wait for any reply from him, but put him into custody of a man of mine—I then ascended the stairs, and brought the other down—I pushed him into the bar also—I afterwards found by the side of the chair, between the pri<lb/>soner and his companion, 2515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fictitious bills—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>ducing them</hi>)—there are three different sorts of them—the prisoner was searched in my presence, and this knife was found on him, it is to cut ap<lb/>parel to as not to cut the body or the thigh in doing it—he had nothing else bats few shillings, which I returned him—I charged him with this robbery of Mr. Moreton—he denied it, and was very abusive and daring to an ex<lb/>treme—I took him to the lock-up-house, and the following day I took him before the Magistrate—he was remanded—the prosecutor came down to Bristol, he saw the prisoner in Bridewell, and knew him instantly on his coining out of the cell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Goode; he keeps a victualling-house in the Mile-end-road. The prisoner was introduced to our home in March, and he came the next day, the 28th, and asked for the person who introduced him—he sat down in the bar—he looked about and we suspected him—I left the bar for a short time—he paid for what he had had, and left—we then missed the hydrometer and thermometer in the case complete, and locked.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb/>tion, on the morning of the 13th of March, I went and examined the pro<lb/>secutor's house—I found four rooms down stairs in great disorder—some tiles and bricks were removed from the back wash-house, and a hole made in the ceiling, but they had not succeeded in getting in there—some brick-work was also cut away from about the back kitchen door—they had then forced the shutter open, and got in—I found a large club stick standing by</p>

                  </hi>. I was acquainted with the deceased, Mr. Joseph Alsop; we were fellow-pupils in the house of the Rev. Mr. Stunner, curate of Hayes—Mr. Dalison was also a pupil there. On Saturday morning, the 9th of March, Mr. Dalison was about leaving the establishment—he left about ten o'clock in the morning—I had not taken leave of him, as I did not expect the coach to go away—he intended to go to the Adam and Eve to order the coach to come, and I was going to see him off—I and Mr. Alsop had been with him in the hall that morning before he left—I do not recollect that the prisoner came down stairs while we were in the hall—I had seen him at breakfast that morning—Mr. Dalison was in the room at breakfast too—within two or three minutes after Dalison bad left, I was in the dining-room with Mr. Alsop and Mr. Sturmer—that is the room in which we usually studied—I was kneeling on the floor to get a book from the lower shelf of a book-case, when the prisoner entered the room, and said, "What do you think that blackguard who has gone away has done? he has broken the glass of my watch"—he addressed that observation to Mr. Sturmer—Mr. Sturmer immediately said, "I wonder you have not knocked him down before"—the prisoner</p>

               <p>answered that he should have done so, if he had not been afraid of soiling his hands—Alsop then said, "You are a liar"—I heard nothing more—I then looked round—Medhurst was then by the fire-place, and Alsop at the corner of the table, near me, near the book-case—the prisoner was in his dress<lb/>ing-gown, and had his stick in his hand, raised up when I looked round, and he immediately struck the deceased on the head—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a stick</hi>)—it was a stick very like this—I did not notice whether he had his witch in his hand—the blow was aimed at Alsop's head, but he raised his arm to ward off the blows, and they fell on his arms—he gave two or three blows—I saw that—there was then a scuffle between them, which lasted about half a minute—in the course of which Alsop wrested the stick from Medhurst—I believe Alsop struck him with the stick when he got it, and then they separated to about eight feet apart—Alsop then advanced about half-way towards Medhurst, about four feet, apparently going to strike him again with the stick—it was upraised—Medhurst drew a knife from his left-hand trowsers' pocket, with his left-hand, took it into his right-behind sprang the blade made a step forward, and stabbed Alsop—he struck him about here—(<hi rend="italic">in the abdomen</hi>)—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one, and opening it</hi>)—I heard the spring go when he opened it.</p>

               <p>the body, about an Inch below the navel—the inner angle of the wound came about even with the navel, to the centre of the body—the wound was from an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters long—it was a cut wound with a clean cut edge—had I known such an instrument as this had been used, I should have been more careful in my search, but it was said he had used a knife, and, supposing it to have been a common knife, I con<lb/>sidered it had gone so far and no further, and I did not think it right to irritate the wound by probing it—I did not probe it to ascertain whether it had gone further, seeing as I thought, the bottom of the wound, and the peritoneum uncut, my opinion was that I saw the extent of the wound, and it being a transverse incision, it was necessary to draw the parts toge<lb/>ther—I thought it but a common incised wound—it gaped very much, as wide as the opening would allow the two lips to gape—I did not at that time consider it a dangerous wound—in cleansing the wound I did it up—I commanicated to the family and Mr. Medhurst the favourable view I took cf the wound—the prisoner was up stairs when I did up the wound—we three were alone, Mr. Medhurst, the deceased, and myself—I ex<lb/>pressed my hope that no further injury had taken place, thin what I saw—if they had shown me the instrument, of course I should have examined farther, and should decidedly have probed the wound to ascertain the extant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon did you observe any appearance in the countenance of the patient, or in any other way, which indicated that the wound was more serious than you at first thought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Sunday, twenty-four hours after the accident; but I saw the patient twice in the interval—the countenance was more anxious on the Sunday, compressed within itself, and the eye more fixed—that indicated a severe shock to the system—there had been no symptoms of vomiting up to Sunday morning—when we went on Sun<lb/>day evening, between nine and ten o'clock, vomiting had taken place once, and, on examining the contents, some cabbage was among it—I thought it wat indigestion—it was an unfavourable sign—Mr. Patten was called in on Sunday morning—I attended the deceased till he died—the last time I saw him with Mr. Patten was on Wednesday morning, in consultation—the last time I saw him alive was on Thursday morning—there was no hope of his surriving from the Wednesday morning—the case then appeared to me to be perfectly hopeless—I examined the body after death, by direction of the Co<lb/>roner, on the Saturday morning, as he died on the Thursday—on examining the body, I was enabled to trace the direction of the wound, and the mischief which had been done—I found that the peritoneum had been very extensively wounded on the right side, and the instrument had crossed over between the integuments anterior and posterior—that internal wound of the perito<lb/>neum was nearly opposite the external wound, but not directly horizontal; it was rather oblique, descending, so that the point of the instrument de<lb/>scended—the internal wound of the peritoneum was behind a different part of the outer skin, two inches and a half from it; so that looking at the wound externally, I could not see the wound of the peritoneum—if I had put my finger in I could not have reached it—when the instrument had penetrated through the peritoneum into the cavity of the abdomen, it would come in contact with a lining which floats in front of the bowels, called the omentum—that was extensively injured in the direction of the wound—I could not see whether any of the bowels themselves had been injured—I could not see any—the omentum, covering the bowels, pro<lb/>all</p>

               <p>them—I found very little extravasated blood in the cavity of the abdomen, perhaps four or five ounces—the omentum had been decidedly lacerated—if I had known the extent of the wound when I was first called in, I should certainly not have given the opinion I did of it—having seen the extent of the wound by the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I should decidedly say the wound was mortal, or highly dangerous—the wound, in my judgment, was the primary cause of death; it produced inflammation of the bowels, then mortification, of which he died—I did every thing which in my judgment was requisite to produce the most favourable re<lb/>sult—I am not aware of any thing which could be done that was not done to prevent the consequences—nothing that I am aware of could hare pre<lb/>vented the wound from producing death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do you mean to say, in any case, you would have probed this wound, with a probe or your finger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He got without symptoms or ap<lb/>pearances authorised me to do so, especially on the peritoneum—when ap<lb/>pearances do not give further authority for troubling or irritating the patient, I should say it was certainly advisable not to probe such a wound—no advan<lb/>tage could have arisen from probing it—if I had found it even as it was, nothing more could be done—I got a common sewing-needle from the servant—I sent down—when I expressed a wish for a needle, I do not know whether Mr. Medhurst or Mr. Sturmer brought it to me—I applied that needle, and left it in the wound—after I had closed the wound, I considered, in my own mind, that that was the most appropriate and most simple and pro<lb/>per way of securing the lips of the wound—I only used one needle, to keep the wound perfectly together—I put plaster bandages to keep the needle steady, not with a view to press, but to keep the wound in its situation—I should say they were not by any means tight—he after-wards complained of the tightness of the bandages, at four o'clock, when I saw him—he felt a sense of tightness, which he considered was from the bandages—I undid the external towel, which was round the body, and which could not produce pressure, and left it—I gave him directions to lay with his back bent, but as he found ease on the right side, he was more sure to keep his knees up—I thought it not right at first to make much inquiry, as they were all in a fright; but on my second visit, at row o'clock, I inquired after his general health—he told me he was subject to</p>

               <p>fits, and told me of a severe injury of the temple from a blow, and stated that he had suffered from a constipation of the bowels for nearly a week, I think, except one day, for a week or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that state of his bowels and body render any injury he re<lb/>cared more dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I looked at it as more serious—I told him that required very serious consideration—I prescribed some aperient medicine, two pills, and a draught, which acted on him—I think he said he would not take the second—by the persuasion of myself and Mr. Med<lb/>hurst, he said he would, but he did not—Mr. Medhurst observed that he would see that he took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Uxbridge. I was called in on Sunday morning to attend the deceased—I went to him at ten o'clock—I was informed of the nature of the injury he was suffering under, and that it was inflicted with a knife—I did not see the instrument for tome days afterwards—I found the wound with a twisted suture, which it a needle through the wound, and silk twisted round—from the discharge from the wound, it was evident there had been an adhesion from the first intention, as it is called, or the operation of nature—there was a good deal of swelling and tenderness around—the tenderness was at the edge and wound—I removed the suture—the wound did not gape—some more dis<lb/>charge issued from it, but the wound itself opened to a very slight extent—I had not then the least opportunity of ascertaining the extent of the injury, nor at any time during my attendance—I could not see the in<lb/>terior of the wound at all—I particularly noticed the countenance of the patient—I was struck with it immediately on entering the room, and the temperature of the skin was much colder than natural—there was an ex<lb/>pression of great anxiety in the countenance, and a sinking of the features generally, particularly the eyes—the pulse was exceedingly feeble and irre<lb/>gular—those symptoms, in my judgment, indicated that a severe shock had been received by the system and I thought the wound highly danger<lb/>ous—I continued to attend him constantly till his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any hope of his recovery from the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I had hope until Wednesday morning—I considered him decidedly in a dan<lb/>gerous state from the time I first saw him—I examined the body after death, by direction of the Coroner—I did not see it when it was first opened—there had been a previous examination, and the parts had been very much disturbed—I had a very imperfect opportunity of forming a judg<lb/>ment of the extent of the internal injury—it appeared to me that the course the wound had taken was from left to right, obliquely—there was a very large lacerated opening of the peritoneum, which I attributed to the exami<lb/>nation which had taken place—it was not corresponding to the external injury—the part immediately facing the open wound was not lacerated—it was not exposed—the omen turn had been completely torn through—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080112"/>
               <p>was evidently not entirely inflicted by an injury—it had been torn through by the hand—the muscles were divided in an oblique direction part on the left side, and part on the right—I do not imagine that the loss of muscular power on that occasion would give the patient a sense of tight<lb/>ness—I was present at the death, which took place shortly after twelve o'clock on Thursday—I attribute his death to the wound, undoubtedly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Hounslow, and am a member of the College of Surgeons. I was called in to this case—I arrived at Hayes between one and two o'clock on the Wednesday morn<lb/>ing, and saw the patient immediately—on seeing him, I found symptoms of that character which induced me to consider it a perfectly hopeless case, and I communicated my impression to the family—the countenance alone was sufficient to show that there was something most dreadful going on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If, on receiving a blow of this sort, the person staggered back, and went on his knees, would that alone indicate any thing to your mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend on the violence of the blow—I conceive a very se<lb/>vere blow with the fist in the stomach would bring a man on his knees—I saw the body after death, but not at a time to form any judgment as to the extent to which the knife had gone into the abdomen—the parts were in so disturbed a state, I could judge nothing—I observed the omentum was divided in two divisions—half on the upper part of the stomach, and half on the lower part, evidently having been divided in the examination—there was very extensive inflammation throughout the greater part of the small intestines—I think, through the whole of the small ones, and the whole of the omentum was in a sloughing state—I should say the symptoms produced would kill a dozen men—I presume the death to</p>

               <p>have arisen from the injury inflicted, and the consequences of it inflam<lb/>mation and mortification.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming the peritoneum to have been wounded, what should you say of the character of such a wound as to danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are Very extensive wounds of the peritoneum that recover—there are very exten<lb/>sive surgical operations on the peritoneum—there-are operations in which I have cut into the peritoneum, and not prepared the patient for it—we have generally no time for preparation—I consider all wounds that have any thing to do with the cavity of the belly very dangerous, and you cannot introduce a knife into that cavity without wounding the peritoneum—I cannot form any judgment, from what I saw, whether the peritoneum had been wounded—I saw the body some hours after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation had been made—I do not know exactly the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In wounds of this sort the result depends a good deal on the treat<lb/>ment they receive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a great measure of course, the result depends on the extent of the injury—we flatter ourselves treatment is of use, or we should very soon not be called upon—I should not have applied a suture in this case, or tight bandages—I am not aware that the bandages were tight—I should not use them—I think them highly improper—I should not have used a needle at all—I should have used adhesive plaster—I should have thought the wound itself was sufficient, there not being opening sufficient to allow the bowel to protrude, I should not have thought of adding another operation to the unfortunate one that had been made before—I have seen various instances lately of wounds in the belly by sharp in<lb/>struments, where I myselfhavehadthe treatment, and where the patients have recovered—I have no doubt in some of those cases the peritoneum was penetrated, but happily my patients recovered, and I did not make any examination—I should think the gentleman who would probe such a wound had been educated five hundred years ago—I had some conversation with the deceased shortly before he died—the second visit I paid him was I be<lb/>lieve as late as eight or nine o'clock on Wednesday evening—I found him so very much altered from the time I left him, I felt convinced he had but a few hours to live—I said to him from the character of the symptoms, I felt it my duty to communicate to him that I had no hopes of his recovery, and perhaps it might be a consolation to him previous to that distressing event, to communicate something to me respecting the <hi rend="italic">fracas</hi> which had taken place—I asked him if he had done any thing to induce the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I believe that was the word I made use of—he said, "Yes, I called him a liar and a blackguard, (I am convinced he used the word blackguard) upon which he struck me"—I asked if he thought there was any thing preme<lb/>ditated on the part of Medhurst—he said, "Decidedly not"—he stated previously to my putting these questions, seeming to wish to avoid being disturbed by questions put to him, that he had forgiven Medhurst, and</p>

I am one of the principal surgeons of Gay's Hospital—I have beard the evidence given in this case—I see no objections to the use of the suture in the manner described by Mr. Chad wick—in a wound of this sort in the abdomen, it would be the duty of a surgeon to close the wound as far as he is able, and if not able to do it by plaster, it would be his duty to use a suture of some kind, either of silk or metal—some surgeons prefer a silk suture, and some a metallic one—I am more in the habit of using a metallic one as being less irritating—I should think the use of the suture as described in no way contributed to the fatal result—it failed to produce its effect, but I think it could do no harm—nei<lb/>ther the use or removal of it could do any harm in my opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

About five o'clock in the morning of the 26th of February, I was in the neighbourhood of the Minories—I met the pri<lb/>soner Sinclair at a coffee-stand in the street—she said, "Will yon have any coffee?"—I felt, and said I had no money—she said, "I will treat you with some coffee"—I said, "I don't want any young girl to treat me; I have money, but no change"—I then walked up Whitechapel with her, and came to the Elephant and Castle—she said, "They know me, I will Dot go in"—I went in, and said, "I will thank you to change me a £5 note"—the lady said, "No"—I came out, and Sinclair was waiting at the door—we then went on to the Coach and Horses—she said, "I will not go in here"—she stopped, and I went in—they would not give me change there—I came out, and then we went to look for another house—we came back to the Elephant and Castle—Sinclair said, "Yon can't get change there"—she met a policeman, and asked him to drink—he went with us to the door, but did not go in—I went into the Elephant and Castle, un<lb/>buttoned my coat, and took out of my breast-pocket two £10 and one £5 notes—Sinclair was there, and called for a glass of brandy and water—I presented the £5 <hi rend="italic">note to</hi> the landlady—she could not give me change—I then put the two £10 notes into my breast-pocket again, and the £5 note into my breeches pocket—Sinclair then said she would treat me, and she took from her glove a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and three shillings, and paid for the brandy and water—after I had put my two £10 notes into my breast pocket, I thought she was a little funny—she catched at my breast two or three times, pretending to tickle me—I said, "You will get your hand into my pocket presently," but I did not think she meant to do it—she then said, "I have got plenty of money, God bless you, I don't want your money"—I then buttoned up <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coat—in a minute or two she said, "I want to go to the door; I will soon be in again"—she went out, and did not return—I felt in my pocket, and my two £10 notes were gone—I gave an alarm to the police—I had received the two £10 notes the night before from Mr. Burge, a contractor on the Eastern Counties Rail<lb/>way—I did not mark them myself, but I know they are the notes I had from him—I had no others.</p>

On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor complained of being robbed—he described a woman to me, and I looked after Sinclair—I had known her four or five years—I went to the prisoners' lodgings—I found a bed, fire-irons, a hearth-rug, a carpet, a set of brasses, a small key-hole saw, a centre-bit, three keys, and better than three pounds of pewter, a new bonnet in a box,</p>

About twenty minutes past nine o'clock that evening, the two prisoners and another boy came to my master's shop, and asked me to show them some pictures—while I was doing so, I heard a bundle of paper fall on the floor—Walker then dropped a halfpenny—he took it up and went outside, and then came in and bought two pictures—after they had left, I came round the shop and missed a bundle of paper.</p>

               <p>to the Heathcock with a gentleman, and had been there several days before I went to the prisoners'—on the Monday I said I would leave, and asked where my boots were—the male prisoner laughed at me, and said he had pawned them on the Saturday night for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I could not leave without boots—I took a sovereign out of ray stays and gave it him to gel my boots—the woman then said she had a dress in for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., would I give it her—I said I would—they brought my boots, and a gown, but not mine—I had no gown of my own, and was obliged to put hers on to go out—there was something had to drink before I went out—it appeared to be gin—I did not drink much of it—I drank because I was frightened at them, and finding the place I was in—they did not force me to drink it—I had no shift nor drawers—they were taken off me, and my shawl was gone—I had no change out of the sovereign—the boots were 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the gown was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and they brought us something to drink, but I had no change out of the sovereign—they said they bad 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put on her gown and went out, and they followed me—I went to the house of Mr. Locke, a gentleman I have known for many years—I received some money there—I did not tell him what bad happened—when I came out I called a coach—the prisoners follow<lb/>ed me and got in—I gave the driver no orders—I thought I should have left the prisoners, but the male prisoner ordered the driver to go to the Strand, and we went to the same house in the Strand again—we had something to drink, and I partook of a small quantity of it—I then went out with the female prisoner and purchased a pocket handkerchief in the Strand—I said I felt very ill—she said if I returned back to the Heathcock for a short time, she would go home with me—I said I felt very ill, I did not care where I went—we went back, but were not there long—I was very ill and very stupified—we bad a coach, but I knew not where I was to go—I recollect no more till I found myself in Clerkenwell workhouse—I believe I was taken to the station-house first—Mr. Locke gave me two sovereigns—the prisoners knew that.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080128"/>
               <p>was then in company with a young man she called her <hi rend="italic">Teddy.</hi> They were drinking gin-and-water. We got into conversation together; they told me they had come from Cambridge on the Thursday; he said he was a steeple-chase rider she got tispsy some quarrelling took place between them. I advised them not to quarrel; he said she got so drunk, it was impossible for any man to live with her; that she would drink four or five quarterns of gin before she would get out of bed in the morning. I saw her again the next evening at the same place she was by herself. She told me her <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> had left her; that she had no place to put her head, for the landlord had threatened to turn her out, because she had no money to pay her lodging; that she was a married woman, the wife of Mr. Locke, 18, Upper Bedford-place, Russell-square: that she had been seduced from her husband by this steeple-chase rider; that he took her to Cambridge, and for the last seven months she had supported him by prostituting herself at Cambridge; but now she wished to get reconciled to her husband, for he was Dot aware of what had passed for the last seven months, because he thought she was at her brother's. I told her ours was very humble, but any place would be better than stopping in the streets: she might come, if she had no objection, to make shift for one night, if the landlord turned her out. She com<lb/>menced drinking with a man she called <hi rend="italic">Buckfriday,</hi> but whose proper name is Bissett. She got very noisy, and the landlord turned her out, giving her a shilling, as he said, to get her a lodging; she waited for my wife and self, and, when. we came out, asked if she could go with us; it was then too late for her to get a lodging; and that being the case, we took her, out of pure motives of charity, home with us. The next morning she awoke me early to fetch her some gin. I brought her half a pint; the drank it off at one draught she pretended that she was miscarrying; we asked her if she would have a doctor; but she said no, that she had often been in that way before, and did not require one; if she had some gin she should soon be better. At her request, her gown and shawl were pledged to get her gin; and during the time she was at our house, which was from the 5th till the 11th, she never got out of bed, nor drank less than a quart of gin per day. She took her meals with us, but never paid any share towards them. During the time she was at our house, she made no secret, but wrote several notes; amongst the rest, was one to Mr. Locke; the purport of it I do not know, but he sent her six shillings. She complained very much at his not sending her more, and requested my wife to go again on the following morning, to ask the housekeeper of Mr. Locke to come and see her. This lady states that the prosecutrix made no complaint of ill usage, although my wife offered to leave the room; therefore she had every op<lb/>portunity of telling this lady, had she experienced any ill usage; she likewise told this lady her clothes were in pledge, but she did not tell her we had clandestinely pledged them this lady left her a sovereign. Does it stand to reason, that, had it been our intention to have robbed her, we should have introduced a female to her, to whom she might have told all her affairs? This sovereign was spent in gin. I and my wife advised her not to drink so much, but she said she had lived upon it for the last four months, and she must have it. On the 10th, Sunday, she said she had two boxes at the coach-office, containing very handsome clothes, and she should like to go to her husband's on the morrow, if she had clothes to go in; at this time she had in pledge her stays boots, flannel petticoat,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080129"/>
               <p>gown, and shawl. My wife said, 'I am going to tea at my sister's, in Surrey-street, Strand, and I think I could borrow a sovereign, and that would get your things out of pledge, if you think you could pay, so that I could give it her to-morrow again;' she said it would be no use her hav<lb/>ing her gown and shawl, for she had represented to Mr. Locke that her mother was dead, and she must go in mourning, for she had received money for the purpose of purchasing mourning, and had spent it with her <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> in Cambridge. We told her we had a black satin pelisse in pledge for five shillings, and a black velvet cape we could lend her. She said that would be just the thing. My wife did not get the sovereign that day; but on Monday, the 11th, she started after breakfast, and returned in the afternoon with the money. I went for her things out of pledge while she got op; when I returned she asked my wife what she should do for a shift, *******—she said she should burn it, and go with<lb/>out one for luck, for she had plenty in her boxes. My wife said, Do not do that; I will wash it.' She said, 'Well, if you do not mind washing them, here are the trowsers too/ which she drew from under the bed. We then started, and on the road she spent all the change of the sovereign which I had given her, for brandy. We waited outside while she went in to Mr. Locke's; she shortly returned, and called a coach; we got in with her, and she ordered the coachman to drive to the Haymarket, and she would have a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi> I with great difficulty persuaded her to go to my sister and return the sovereign, and the coach drove to Surrey-street. She said she had two sovereigns; one she changed in Surrey-street, at a public-house where she had some brandy, to pay the coach fare, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one she left with my sister's landlady, my sister not being at home; she then went to the Heathcock and redeemed a veil she had left there for three shillings, and spent fourteen shillings in spirits; she pretended to be in fits, and was put into a coach; we rode with her, in company with a man named Curtis, that I have since learnt was a friend of hers. She made use of shocking language in the coach, both to me and my wife, that at last I said she should not come to my place again. I paid the coach fare, because she had no money, and left her. I heard nothing more of her till Wednesday, the 13th, when I saw the description of her in the 'Times' paper. I went directly to the workhouse. I gave them every information in my power respecting her. I told Mr. Millo respecting the shift, drawers, duplicates, and keys. They asked me to bring the keys. I did so at their request. Mr. Millo asked me what was her name. I told him she called herself Mrs. Locke, but I thought she had not given them her right name, for the dirty linen she had left behind was marked 'E. A. C'"</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Smith, a cutler, in King William-street, London-bridge. On the 9th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, (I think after the gas was lighted,) the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a tooth-pick—he was not dressed as he is now—I showed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080138"/>
               <p>him a tray full—he chose one, and gave me a sovereign—I gave him half-sovereign and eight shillings change—he had said nothing about the price—he examined the change, and said, "Do you charge me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? I never paid more than 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price; we never sold them for less—he said, "I will not have it—give me my sovereign"—I did so, and he put down on the glass what I supposed to be the change I had given him, and left the shop in haste—I looked at the change directly, and found a gilt sixpence had been substituted for the half-sovereign—I am certain I had given him a half-sovereign, I had looked at it—I went to the door to look after him, but could not see him—I put the coin at the back of the till, in a compartment which had no money in it—it remained there till about the 30th of March, when I took it out, marked it, and put it into my pocket—I am certain it remained there till I took it out—I had not marked it before—I know it to be the same—I took so much notice of it, and the place where I put it was never opened only on certain occasions—there was no other money in that part of the till—the till is under my control—there is no key to it—Mr. and Miss Smith had access to it, no-body else—I had received one counterfeit half-sovereign once before, but on the 9th of February I had none in my possession but this—it has been in my pocket, in a piece of paper, ever since the 30th of March, and I can swear it is the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not mark it till the 30th of March? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume that was the day—it was nearly two months after I received it—this is very unlike a good half-sovereign—the impression on the head side is like, but the gilding and appearance is not—there is no other person who has access to the shop but Mr. and Miss Smith and myself, only to-day, as we are compelled to attend here—the till was always settled every even<lb/>ing, but this coin was never taken out—I saw it every day—an eighteen-penny tooth-pick is very uncommon in our shop—I saw the prisoner at the Compter about a month after the 9th of February, that might be a week previous to my marking the coin.</p>

               <p>mouth, put his hand to the back of his neck, and swallowed twice—I sent for my master, who came with a policeman—the prisoner directly snatched at the gilt sixpence, which was still lying on the glass case, but did not get it—we prevented him, and I gave it to my master—the policeman seized him by the throat, and tried to prevent him swallowing—I went to the station-house with him, and on my return received the sixpence from my master—I took it to the station-house, and gave it to the inspector.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time had passed between your discovering your throat was cut, taking the night cap from your eyes, and going to the window and making an alarm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost instantly, directly I came from the door—it was nothing like ten minutes—it was the inside of my fingers that was cut——my husband was taken into custody in the house—I cannot say how long after it happened, for I was carried up stairs—he never entered the house while I was there—he did not express any wish to come and see me, he merely wanted his boots—I would not have him admitted, because I was afraid of him—I was put into the same bed again—the bed-clothes were quite close up to my person at the time this was done—it was a white counter-pane—I saw the knife while I was down stairs—it was brought down by the younger brother, who went up to fetch a blanket, as he could not find a shawl to wrap me in—I heard inquiries made in the course of the week for the knife which I had had sharpened, and a knife was missing—I cannot say whether it was missing almost directly after William had sharpened it for me—it was mentioned the same week, and it might be soon after—w had gone to bed on Tuesday night without having had any words or any quarrel—he had not been drinking much in the course of that day—he had</p>

               <p>had a little—he had the money from me, but he was quite sober—he swore at me several times in the night, and called me several names—he was awake when I went up—he did not complain of my disturbing him, or appear angry—he gave no reason for swearing at me in the night—I remember Mrs. Leversege coming into the room while I was down stairs—she came into the bed-room afterwards—I do not remember her saying to me, "It is very odd if your husband did this while you were in bed, that there should be no blood on the quilt or bed clothes"—I rather think there was blood on the sheet—I do not remember her saying any thing of the sort—I cannot say she did not—I know there was blood on the sheet, for in<lb/>stantly I felt my throat cut I threw the clothes down, and got out of bed—I was not there when the knife was found—I could not tell whether I felt the knife or not in the bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You got out of bed immediately the cut was inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately, as soon as possible—I had gone to bed with both my stockings on, as my feet were very cold, but in the night; the stocking on my right foot came off—I had the other one on when I got out of bed, and that stocking had blood on it—I had asked his brother to sharpen a knife, as I expected my husband and I were going off to Australia—(I had said I would not go, but he said he would use me well, and I intended to go)—I had a collar to rip off a shirt for him—my scissors were up stairs, and I said, "William, I won't trouble you to go up stairs, be kind enough to sharpen me a knife"—I got a knife with a narrow point and round handle—I said, "Sharpen that at the point only about half an inch round, or it will cut where I do not want it"—he did it, and I used it for that purpose, and other purposes as well—I am not sure whether I put it into the drawer or on the table after using it—I had taken it from the drawer from other knives—I selected it, as it had a narrow point, and suited my purpose best—I never took it up stairs to my bed-room for any purpose whatever—I swear that is not the knife, for the handle was round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you procure that knife with any view or intent to inflict any injury on yourself or any body else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it never entered my thoughts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am ten years old—I live with my father. On this Wednesday morning, about seven o'clock, as I was in bed, I heard a cry of "Mother," as I thought, two or three times—I could not make out who it was—I got out of bed, and ran down stairs stark naked, looked out at the front door, which was open, and saw my sister-in-law, Elizabeth, at her bed-room window with her neck bleeding—she told me to run for the doctor—I sent my brother Edward, and told her Edward was going—I went up stairs, put on some of my</p>

               <p>clothes—I brought some down, and put them on down stairs—I went into the lower room, and fastened the door to keep the wind out—Elizabeth came and knocked at the door, and I let her in—other persons came into the room—I was told to go up stairs to fetch her shawl—I went and looked about the bed, but could not find it—I looked into the bed, and found this knife in the bed, with the blanket covered over it—there was blood upon it—I took it down stairs, and showed it to my mother—I took it and put it into the pantry by her directions—Alder, the policeman, came, and told me to fetch it, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Southgate. I was called on Wednesday morning, the 6th of March, to go to the house where the pro<lb/>secutrix was—I found her in the lower room, sitting by the fire—she was severely wounded in the lower part of the throat—I examined the wound—it was about four inches and a half in length, and full an inch in depth, or rather better—it is quite healed now—as far as I could judge, I should say the blade of the knife had gone downwards—had it gone up<lb/>wards, I think it must have been fatal—I think this knife would have produced such a wound—no very large arteries or vessels were separated—the wound was deepest in the centre—the blade of the knife appeared to have been turned more downwards than upwards, and it was lower down in the neck than I have ever seen a wound in the throat—it was down-wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080145"/>
               <p>because there was a flap below—occasionally at the first cutting of a wound like that much blood will flow, but sometimes it will not flow instanter—I found her very bloody when I got there—I ordered her to be put to bed, and dressed the wound—I found two of her fingers were cut—one, the third finger, very slightly—the other, the second, was much deeper, but not to any great extent—they were in a slanting direction—I should say they had both been cut with the same stroke—the wound in the throat was a serious one at the time—she kept her bed for a fortnight or better, and was laid up from three weeks to a month—I sewed it up—she got up occasionally in the day time, but did not leave her room—the wound was very near the carotid artery, and the jugular vein—if either of those arteries had been severed, death would have ensued most likely before she could have got assistance—my attention was not directed to her fingers by herself in the first instance, but when I was washing her hand, she complained of her fingers, not before—she gave me an account of what had happened to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner present then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the large vessels were not injured—the wound would not be likely to produce death, having missed the large vessels—from the nature of the wound, the blade must have been drawn nearly straight across, from left to right—the blade went downwards—it appeared to have entered on the left, and come out on the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose two wounds, one drawn from right to left, and the other from left to right, what would be the difference in the appearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why the deepest part would have gone where it first entered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it not be possible for such a wound to be made by drawing it the other way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible, but I do not think it probable—it is a matter of opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But did you not say this wound was deepest in the centre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you reconcile the wound being deeper in the centre, with saying, the deepest part was where it began? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say it is generally the deepest where it commences—this wound was much deeper in the middle than at either end—the knife was apparently drawn from left to right—I have seen cases of suicide from cutting the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not almost invariably found that the wound has been in<lb/>flicted from left to right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally—in short, I may say, in all cases—it would be much more convenient than the other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you in such instances see the wound inflicted from upwards to downwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, and I have never seen a wound inflicted so low by a suicide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not that depend on how the instrument was held? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course it must, but suicides would hold the knife, so as to make the wound go upwards—in this case the skin was cut completely through, and the muscular substance below—the windpipe was not cut, nor any large vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the depth was not from front to back, but more downwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, more downwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior surgeon at Guy's Hospital. I have examined the prosecutrix's throat—I first saw it some day last week, when the wound was quite healed—I had no means of judging whether it was a slanting or a horizontal wound—I have seen a great many cases where persons have committed suicide by cutting the throat—I have seen one this morning—in such cases the cutting is more usually effected upwards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080146"/>
               <p>and I have never seen one so low down as this that I remember—certainly not by a suicide—this wound was undoubtedly very near the arteries, the severance of which would, in all probability, have proved fatal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you never seen a case of suicide in which the instrument took a downward direction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot possibly say never, but it is usually upwards—I do not ever recollect a case of its being downwards—it is more awkward for a person to inflict a wound down-wards with either hand—that would depend a great deal on the determins<lb/>tion with which the party went to work—if he held the instrument firmly, it would take an upward direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a woman, with not a very strong nerve, might not the wound take another direction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it would make no dif<lb/>ference—the edge of the knife is more commonly held upwards—the deeper parts are cut more upwards than the superficial parts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Compton-place, in the parish of St. Pancras—it is my dwelling-house. Reid lodged with me—on the 2nd of April, about twelve or one o'clock, my wife awoke me—I got up, got a light, and saw my bed-room door open—I went to my box, where I kept my money, finding it locked, and the key hanging in its usual place, I concluded I had not been robbed—I had from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In that box that night, all in silver—there was, to the best of my recollection, as much as stated in the indictment, but I counted more than that—about eleven o'clock in the morning I had occasion to go to that box to make a payment, and found the money was gone—Reid had not been in the house all the morning—she ought to have been there in the morning—I thought proper to go to Mylett's room, on the 3rd of April, knowing she was her companion, and there I found them both, with several others—I accused Reid of stealing my money—she denied it for a good while—we began to examine the room, and about that time I perceived Mylett endeavouring to conceal something as she sat on the chair, and looking narrowly I saw a bag and heard money clinking—I said to the policeman, "I think there is silver in that bag"—he immediately took hold of it, and found upwards of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In silver—there were some half-crowns—a quantity of new goods were found in a large chest, which Mylett pointed out, saying the things were in that chest—I only found a small quantity of money, and asked Reid what she had done with the remainder of the money—she said they had been to Somers-town, and bought some shoes, and to Lamb's Conduit-street, and bought some things—both her and Mylett said so, and Mylett pointed to the box, and said the things were there—I should have said that imme<lb/>diately after we found the money Reid fell on her knees, wept very much, and implored my pardon, saying she would make it up to me.</p>

I was on duty in New Gravel-lane on the night of the 29tb of March—I know these premises, and the archway or passage—as I was going along near the boarded entry I heard a bit of a scuffle—I heard a conversation between two persons—I heard some one say, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">Joey</hi>" three times, and at the bottom of the boarded entry I saw the prisoner Davis standing with his back against the wall, on the other side of the boarded entry to where the long room is—I knew Davis well—I went down the entry—Davis did not say any thing, but hemmed twice, and then walked away—I permitted him to go up the entry, which would lead him to New Gravel-lane—I then walked up the entry and saw a piece of lead lying flat against the wall where Davis had been standing—I put my foot on it—I then looked up at a shoot which comes down between the roofs of the two houses—I saw it was bent, and saw the prisoner Mahoney on the top of the building, as if he were about to jump down, but he saw me, turned round and made his escape on the other side, over the roofs of the houses into the other court</p>

               <p>—I sprung my rattle, and ran out of the entry towards New Gravel-lane expecting to see my brother officer—I then thought Mahoney would re<lb/>turn, and went up the entry again, but he was not there—both the pri<lb/>soners escaped—I went on the Wednesday following with Pavit to the premises with the lead—I found some lead had been taken from the bot<lb/>tom of the sky-light on the roof of the long room—I applied the lead which I had picked up in the entry to the place, and it fitted exactly—there were fifteen nail-holes on the lead I picked up—I found some nails in the sky-light, with which the holes in the lead exactly corresponded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Charles James Mat<lb/>thews—I have a house at Notting Hill, Kensington—I had it last year, before I went to America—the prisoner was in my-service from the feb<lb/>ruary previous—she was a person in whom I placed very great confidence—when I left, it was arranged that my house should be let furnished, if a tenant could be found—Mr. Hay, the auctioneer, was employed to let it—I left the house in charge of the prisoner—the linen was not to be let with the house—it was locked up in one of the attics, except a portion, which was for the prisoner's use—I took the key of the attic with me—I return<lb/>ed in December, and went to my house—I missed some trivial things be<lb/>longing to the kitchen—and one drawer, in which some goods were, had been opened—in a few days, I missed some more things—I made inquiry about them, and frequently in the presence of the prisoner—she gave me no in<lb/>formation about them whatever—among other things, I missed six pairs of sheets, five table-cloths, a shawl, a kettle, a lamp, a cake-mould, a basket, a, bag, a pair of sheets, a curtain, a towel, an inkstand, and six yards of shawl-bordering—they were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of my ser<lb/>vants left me after I returned, and before the prisoner was taken—suspi<lb/>cion at last fell on the prisoner, and Mr. Matthews sent for Shackle—(<hi rend="italic">ex<lb/>amining some articles</hi>)—this is my table-cloth—my table-cloths are marked? but the mark has been taken out of this, and the place has been darned over—here are some remains of the red mark in it how—here is a fac-simile of it—here is a pair of sheets of mine—my mark is on one of them—this bag, curtain, towel, kettle, and this shawl are mine—also this lamp and ink<lb/>stand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street On Wednesday, the 6th of March, I went to the prosecutor's house at Notting Hill. I saw the prisoner, and told her Mr. Matthews had been robbed of a great number of things, and told her what they were, having a list of them—I asked if she knew any thing about them—she said, no, she did not—I asked if she had any objection to my searching her boxes—she said, no, she had not—(I then requested Mr. and Mrs. Matthews to accompany me with her up stairs, and they did)—I saw the tea-chest opened, and the character was in it—Mrs. Matthews said, "This is the character I gave you—it can be of no use to you now"—the prisoner said, "No," and it was thrown on the kitchen fire immediately—she told me where her children were, and I went with her to No. 5, Church-lane, to the first floor, searched two rooms, and found the articles produced—I showed Mrs. Matthews the marks on them—I said, "Are these your things?"—she said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "They are not yours"—I found these sheets there, made</p>

               <p>into a bed—a quantity of wool was sewn in between them—I showed them to Mrs. Matthews, article by article, and she identified them—the prisoner said, "They are not yours,"—I then told her that as Mrs. Matthews would swear to the things, I must take her to Bow-street—after she was re<lb/>manded I saw her in the cell—she then said she had taken the things a week before in mistake—that she and her children had been stopping in Mrs. Matthews's house, and she had taken them away in a hurry, in mistake, and she was sorry for it—when I had read the list over to her at Mrs. Matthews's, she said she knew nothing of them—that list included the table-cloth, the sheets, the towels, and a great number of other things, and she said she knew nothing about any of them.</p>

I was in Cavendish-square, on the 4th of April, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running before the mob—I took him—he was trying to take off the coat that he had on—I asked what was the matter—he said he had done nothing—I said, "Let us go back to those people who are crying out"—I went back, and one of them had a great coat on his shoulder—he said, "This is the coat the man stole; he took it from the carriage, as it was going along Cavendish-square, and he threw it into the square"—I took the prisoner—he said, "You are mistaken, I am not the man"—when I apprehended him there was a person said, "Policeman, you have got the wrong man"—whether he was an accomplice or not I cannot say.</p>

I was going along Cavendish-square—I crossed, and saw the prisoner running by the side of a carriage, which was going along at a pretty good rate; the prisoner kept pace with it about a minute—I saw him take the coat out of the carriage—he either opened the door, or else put his arm over the little window, I am not sure which—the coachman was with the carriage, but no footman—I hallooed out "Stop thief," and he threw the coat over the railings into the square, and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick-maker, residing at North Hyde, in Middlesex—on the 8th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, I was at a public-house at Hanwell—the two prisoners were there and another per<lb/>son with them—I went in to have a pint of beer—I had taken a £10 note from home and changed it—I had seven sovereigns with me and some silver—Hacket forced herself into my company—she came and sat along-side of me, and put her hand into my breeches—she said she would have it, whether or nay—I said, "Keep off, I don't want any thing of the kind"—we had a drop of beer together—I cannot say that I was exactly sober—I was rather <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—I know she pulled me and mauled me about a good deal—after that, I put my hand into my pocket, and missed six sovereigns besides some silver—no other person could have taken it—she and the two men were gone then.</p>

I took the coat and tied it up in my bundle—he was looking at me all the time—it is not likely I should take any thing else—I had not stepped beyond the threshold of the door—he took me and told a young man to fetch a policeman—I said, "For what?"—he said. "If you don't know what is your own, I will tell you"—I said, "I have nothing but what I paid for"—I did not say, "I will pay you"—he se<lb/>lected this from a quantity of pieces, and I said, "If you are so inclined, why not take the first piece that comes to hand?"—that note was put into my hand one day in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Stewart, of Cheap-side. On the 12th of April I had a coat thrown across the block in the shop—I saw the prisoner, about eight o'clock in the evening, walk into the shop, take it off the block, and walk out immediately—he ran and I ran, and called "Stop thief"—I never lost sight of him—he was stopped in Honey-lane-market—he dropped the coat—it was taken up and given to me—this is it—I am sure the prisoner is the person who took it.</p>

               <p>eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Aldersgate-street—I went to the Castle and Falcon tap-room—there was some alter<lb/>cation there—there were thirteen or fourteen individuals in the room, and a woman among them—John Childs, the deceased, was there, and the pri<lb/>soner, who is the landlord of the house—they were wishing him to stand half a gallon of beer—he said he would not, and he would not draw any more beer—he then took some pots off the table, went to the bar, closed the door, and put the light out in the bar—he then came into the tap-room, laid hold of the table which I was leaning against, and threw the pots off on to the floor—he was the worse for liquor—he was gathering the pots off the ground, and had some of them in his hand when I came out of the tap-room—as I came out I saw the deceased with his arm up towards the gaslight, and as I passed out at the door I saw the light go out—I have no doubt he turned the gas off—as I passed out of the passage the deceased passed me, running and laughing, and the prisoner followed him with a quart pot in his right hand, and three pint pots in his left hand—they passed me up the yard, and I saw the prisoner strike the deceased first with the quart pot on the back—he then made a hit at him with his left hand with the three pots, which missed him—the deceased turned round to look behind him, and the prisoner with his right hand struck him on the left ear with the quart pot that he held in that hand—the deceased then cried out "Don't murder me," and was in the act of stooping to pick up his hat, which had fallen off, when the prisoner made another blow at him with the right hand, and seeing a scuffle between them I ran up—he picked up his hat—the prisoner was aiming another blow at him with his right hand when I jumped in between them and re<lb/>ceived the blow on my right shoulder—he made another blow with his left hand which I caught on my breast—I got hold of him by the arm, and he struggled several times more to get at him, which I prevented—I had not heard the deceased say any thing to Philpot before these blows, not after he came out of the house—what was said inside I did not notice—I turned round to look at the deceased, to see how he was hurt—the prisoner then caught up the deceased's bundle, and made towards the house—the deceased called out, "Don't rob me as well as murder me"—I followed him into the house with the deceased, and told him the deceased gave him into custody, and as such he must think himself—he then had a conversation with the de<lb/>ceased—he seemed very repentant to him for what had occurred, and wished him not to press any charge against him, as he had nobody to take care of his house, except he called his wife up—the deceased said he would not, and they had some brandy together—the deceased was bleeding at the ear—I took him over to the hospital to have his ear dressed, and left him in the street afterwards—he said he was going home—they did not keep him in the hospital—they sewed the ear up with one stitch—I interfered as soon as I could—they were some distance from me at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, and live in Little Britain. I was on duty at the Castle and Falcon, between eleven and twelve o'clock on this night—I went into the tap-room, and they were all drinking toge<lb/>ther in good humour, when I came out—I went in again to call the policeman out, and said the sergeant was going by—the prisoner was then talking along with them—the deceased was laughing and joking with them also—I turned, and came out, and Childs, the deceased, came out laughing directly after-wards—the prisoner followed him with two or three pots in his hand—the de<lb/>ceased came running down the yard, and the prisoner after him twenty-five or thirty yards—he then overtook him, and struck him in the left side of the ear with a quart pot—he then up with his hand to strike him again, and the policeman rushed in between them, but did not reach him to hit him—the policeman asked him something, and he up with both hands to strike the de<lb/>ceased again, but he hit the policeman instead of him, with one hand on the breast, and the other on the top of the shoulder—they stood there talking a little while, and then went in to have something to drink, all of them, but what passed then, I do not know—I saw the deceased at the same public-house next evening, with his head tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought to St. Bartholomew's hospital on Wednesday, the 6th of March—he had a wound on the left ear, which divided the ear, and a slight bruise behind the ear—they might have been done by a pot—he was not drunk, he had been drinking—I dressed the ear, and did what I thought necessary—I pro<lb/>posed his stopping in the hospital, but he wished to go home—he seemed a respectable young man—I desired him to come again, but did not see him again alive—I assisted Mr. Lewis in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—he died from erysipelas on the head—that might have been occasioned by the blow on the head—he had no signs of erysipelas about him when he came to me.</p>

               <p>was nothing like the quantity he specified—I said, "There cannot be that quantity of yards"—Williams said, "I will forfeit my life if there is not that number"—it was laid in rather better than half-yard lengths—I said I did not consider there was above 90 or a 100 yards—Williams said I was mistaken, they were all marked at the end, and he pointed out to me the mark on the flannel—138 was marked on it in red chalk—I said it was very strange that I could not make that number—he said he would forfeit his ex<lb/>istence if there was not that number of yards, which was there marked—he said, "You have taken in flannel of me before, and you never disputed my word before"—he then produced a duplicate from Mr. Jones, a pawnbroker, of a piece of flannel, pawned for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Your neighbours do not doubt my word, and why should you?"—I said, "Well, as you say there is that number of yards I will lend you 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to end the dispute, I had better measure it"—he said, no, he could not allow that, as he served shops, the flannel was done up on a machine, and if it was undone, neither he nor I could do it up in the same way again—I said then "You had better take what I offer you"—he said that would not do, he must have more money, he said the flannel was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I said then I would lend him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, no, I must make it 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said, "Well, I will make it the other half-sovereign"—I lent him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and made out the ticket in the usual way, and gave him the money—I did not put the quantity on the ticket—they then left the shop together—this is the flannel—it has been unpacked, and measured since, and it is 88 yards—I had taken in pieces of flannel of him before, and he has taken them out five or six times.</p>

Williams said, "It is a 138 yards piece, but they always run 140 yards"—I said, "How am I to know there is 140 yards?"—he said, "A piece never runs less than 140 yards"—I said, "What, are you the manufac<lb/>turer?"—he said he was, and had been so for years—I said, "I don't like to take it unless I measure it"—he said, "You must not measure it, you will disturb it"—I said, "You are a manufacturer, are you not? you can do it up if I can't"—he said, "No, it is done with a machine"—I said, "Well, you have machines"—he said, "No, there are none in this town"—I said, "Well, if you will not allow me to undo it, I don't like to take it; I know nothing of you; have you a card?"—he said, "No; but here is the ticket of a pawnbroker, who I have been doing business with a number of years"—he showed it me—I said, "Why don't you take it there again?"—he said, "I don't like to take so much to one place"—I said "This has not been out above a day or two"—he then said, "The car<lb/>riage conies to so much"—I then began to count the folds, and he stopped me—I said, "We can ascertain a little by that, I think;" and by count<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>the folds I made it about 89 yards—he said, "You can't tell any thing by that; I will vouch there is 140 yards, or else I will forfeit my life"—I said I should not like to lend any thing like that upon it—he slid, "What will you lend?"—I said, "Bring me two pieces, and I will lend you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "I can't bring two pieces now, what will you lead on this?"—I said, "I will take it in for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard"—he pretended to be astonished at that, saying the value was so much more—he at last left it on what I supposed was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—he represented it 140 yards, and I lent him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, supposing it was that—I believed it to be 140 yards, oft his representation, he appearing to be a respectable man—Mr. Summers measured it the following day, and thinking he might be mis<lb/>taken, I measured it myself, four or five days afterwards, and made it the same as he did, 90 yards—here is the counterpart of the duplicate, on which I afterwards put the quantity it measured—this is the duplicate I gave the prisoner—I gave Williams 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting the ticket-money—when I gave it him he asked me if would take another piece in in the morning—I said I would ask Mr. Summers, and if he liked to call in the morning, I would give him an answer—I did not see either of the prisoners again till the Monday following, when Baynton brought another piece—I said, "You represented what you brought before as 140 yards, and there is only 90; you know you defrauded me"—he said, "I know there was 140 yards"—I said, "You know there was only 90"—he said, "Then you won't have the other piece?"—I said, "Have the other piece! no, you had better go and mind what you are doing for the future;" and he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Johnson, of Bishops<lb/>gate-street, a pawnbroker. On Saturday, the 5th of January, Baynton asked me if I would take in some flannel—I told him I would, provided it was all right, and I had the owner present when I took it in—he said he would bring it on the Monday, and on Monday both the prisoners came, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with a piece of flannel done up in folds, which I produce—I asked what they wanted upon it, and Williams said, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what quantity of yards it contained—he said, "137," and at the same time he referred me to the mark at the end of the flannel in red chalk, 137—he said that was the mark of the number of yards it contained—I said, "How am I to know that?"—he said, "I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080206"/>
               <p>the manufacturer of the article, and I will forfeit my existence if it is not all right and correct"—I said if that was the case I would advance him money upon it, but I should not like to lend him so much as that—he said he had been obliged to advance money that morning to make up a bill, and showed me a duplicate of a piece he had pledged that morning at Mr. Cotton's for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it stated, "Piece of flannel, 137 yards as marked, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he solicited me to lend him the same on this piece—I told him I could not, I would lend him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it—I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they both left the shop—both the prisoners were present during the conversation—some informa<lb/>tion afterwards reached me, and on the following Friday, the 11th, Baynton came, and asked if I would take in another piece of flannel—I asked him if it was the same description and quality as the other—he said, "Yes," and he would bring it on the following day—I had a policeman there the next day, and Baynton came about twelve o'clock with a piece of flannel—I asked him the quantity of yards it contained, and if it was the same description as the other—he said, yes, it was of the same description, and much about the same length, 139 yards, and I found a mark of 139 on the end—I said if there was the quantity of yards I would advance him the same money as I had done on the piece on Monday—I took a dupli<lb/>cate out of the drawer, and pretended to write it out for him—the officer then came into the shop, and I said, "I shall not take this piece in with<lb/>out measuring it"—Baynton said, "You must not do that, you will spoil the appearance of the flannel," and he referred me to the mark on it—I said I felt confident that was not the case, that I had been defrauded in one instance by himself and the elder party who was with him, and he was now attempting it again—he said the property did not belong to him, but to his father, who was waiting outside—while this was going on Williams came in, and asked Baynton what be was doing there so long, or why he was wait<lb/>ing—Baynton replied that he was given into custody—Williams asked who by, and if there was any money given for the piece—I said, no, and as I suspected this piece was the same as the last, I should give the officer charge of him also—I gave charge of them both—these are the pieces of flannel—the first piece taken on the 7th of January has been measured, and contains 79 yards—both ends of this are marked—on the outer end is 137, and on the inner end 78—on the one brought on the 11th is 139—this has been measured, and contains 86 yards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Cotton, a pawnbroker, in Shoreditch. In the beginning of January Williams came to my master's shop—he asked if I would take in some pieces of flannel to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would not take in more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was a manufacturer of it, and it was a bad time of year to dispose of it—on the 7th of January he called with two pieces of flannel, and Baynton was then with him—it must have been between twelve and one o'clock—the two pieces were put on the counter, and Williams represented that there were 37 yards in each piece, referring me to a mark at the end of them in red chalk—I thought, from the previous conversation I had had, that that was the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and I was going to make a ticket for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with very little</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080207"/>
               <p>conversation on the subject—Williams then said he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each piece, and that I had misunderstood him—I said I could not think of lend<lb/>ing 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each piece, that I did not consider they were of that value to me and I would not take in more than one piece—he said, "137 yards of fine flannel surely you will lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on?"—I said I could not—I reckoned it up, and offered him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he agreed to take it—I was going to make out the ticket, and I said, "It is rather awkward, how am I to call this a piece of flannel?" and he showed me a ticket of Mr. Fleming's, on which was "137 yards of fine flannel, as marked," and I made mine out the same—he referred me to the mark of 137 on the flannel—I made out the ticket on the faith of what he represented, and they went away—on the same day I received a communication from Mr. Cotton, and just after that Baynton came to the shop again—I was in the parlour—I asked him into the parlour—I said I was very much afraid I could not make the number of yards, I had tried it, and could not make more than 100—he said he was certain there was, and referred me to the mark—he said it was measured in the manufacturing districts—I asked if he would allow me to measure it—he said no, it could not be done up in London in the same form, and it would spoil the sale—I said it placed me in a very awkward situation—he said he would go and speak to his father.</p>

I have one shop in Shoreditch, and one in Hackney-road—on the 7th of January I was in my shop in Hackney-road—about the middle of the day the two prisoners came in and brought a piece of flannel, but I did not take it in—it was in flat folds—I forget the sum they asked for it, but it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked what quantity there was, and they said the quantity was marked on it, 137, pointing to a red chalk mark on the outer end—my young man was attending to the prisoners, and I asked him if he had measured it—he said, "No"—I said I could not tell what there was without—they said they would not have it measured on any account, as it would put it out of con<lb/>dition, and those marks on the flannel were made in the country by author<lb/>ised registered men—they showed me a ticket which my young man had given them, and that of Mr. Fleming's.</p>

Is it your belief, to the best of your memory, that yon sent back this bill of exchange with the cheques by French? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak any other way than to the best of my recollection—not having seen the docu<lb/>ment for three years, I will not speak to it more positively—I believe that bill had no indorsement beside Clifford's—that bill was in the same state as this, except that it had not Gibbs's indorsement, which it now has—to the best of my recollection, this is the bill certainly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I was at Greenwich fair on the 2nd of April, in front of Richardson's show, standing behind Clamp—the two prisoners came up in company together, pushed me away, and pushed in between me and Clamp—I saw Jones wink at Pew, and Jones put his hand to Clamp's pocket to feel it—I watched them a few moments, and seeing they intended to pick the pocket, I turned my head to look for an officer—I went and spoke to Dyke, and went to my place again behind the prosecutor—I saw Pew try to pick the pocket, but he did not do so then Jones was standing close to his side—I stood a few moments longer, and then saw Pew draw the handkerchief out of Clamp's pocket, make a rush on one side, and <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it up his coat—the officers then collared them, and 1 informed Clamp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> Are you positive you saw us come up there together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the crowd was quite thin when you came up—I saw you attempt the pocket—I was standing close behind you, and could see your arms and hands, and I made a stoop down to look.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 20.) On Monday morning, about twenty minutes before one o'clock, I was on duty in Mill-ane—I heard a wrangling from a house up a turning in the lane where the prosecutor and his wile lodged—I saw the prosecutor take a light from the policeman</p>

               <p>at the gate—that was directly after I heard the wrangling—he then went in-doors—I remained at the end of the alley—Hearn came out again and asked for a light, as he said Nancy had put it out—I went back with him, and heard the prisoner say, "You b I should like to cut your b throat"—the door was shut—I said "Open the door; are you not ashamed of making use of such language on Sunday night?" Hearn was outside with me—she let him in—I begged of Hearn not to quarrel, and to have no more words—I shut the window-shutter to, being outside, and Hearn fastened it within—about ten minutes afterwards I was in the Fountain yard, about five hundred yards off, and in conse<lb/>quence of what Marshall told me, I went with him to apprehend the prisoner—I found her in Mr. Mackey's yard, about one hundred and fifty yards from the house—Marshall found her at the furthest corner of the yard—there was a quantity of fellies and pieces of timber, to conceal her, and a cart likewise—she had hid herself—she could not be seen without going up to the timber, and looking among it—I afterwards found the knife on a shelf in the cupboard—I think it was the top-shelf—di<lb/>rectly I produced it I said, "Is this the knife?"—she said "Yes"—I did not hear distinctly what she said when Marshall took her, not so at to state any particular word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Deptford. Sergeant Croxon brought Hearn to my house, between one and two o'clock on Monday morning—I examined him—he was bleeding very profusely—he had a wound on his left cheek, about five inches and a half in length, in a half circle, going from the ear to the mouth—one part of it at the middle was to the bone—it was not generally deep—I applied pressure to stop the hemorrhage—being early in the morning I was very much fatigued, having been up the whole night before, and with great difficulty I stopped it—about seven o'clock the same morning the prosecutor called me up again, and I was then obliged to make use of ligatures, as it was bleeding afresh—he was faint—I was obliged to give him a stimulant while I was dressing it—it was certainly a dangerous wound, and if it had been a little lower, I think it would have been fatal—it appeared to be inflicted by a sharp in<lb/>strument—the knife produced was likely to have done it—I consider it dangerous, if it had not been attended to immediately—he is convalescent, and there is not any fear now.</p>

On the night of the 8th of March, I went to the prisoner's house in Stoney-lane—I saw there was a light in the room—the shutters were closed—I knocked at the door—the prisoner said, "Who is there?"—I said, "A friend, open the door"—I knocked again, and said, "Is Mrs. M'Dermot at home?"—the pri<lb/>soner said, "No, she is not"—I wrenched the shutters open, and was in the act of lifting the window, when the prisoner said, "Put the window down, I will open the door," which she did—I then went in and found this box on the mantel-piece, with the duplicates of some of the property in it—I apprehended her.</p>
