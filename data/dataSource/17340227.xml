            , and I went all together. And as we were passing by the backside of the first House, from Tower-hill, going into Rag-fair, we look'd in at a Window, where there was a Candle, and saw Whitesides trying on a pair of the Gloves; upon which we went to the Fore-door, and found Marshall shutting up the Stall (it was an Apple-stall;) we search'd him, and took one pair of Gloves out of his Pocket, and then we went in; but having made some Disturbance in seizing Marshall, I suppose Whitesides took the Alarm and hid the Gloves; for at our first going into the Back-room we could find nothing but the Paper they had been wrapp'd in, and one pair lying loose on the Dresser: However, upon farther search we found the rest under a Cherry-Sieve. Whitesides ran up Stairs, and Marshall got into the Cellar; but we got a Constable and secur'd them both.</p>

As I stood at my Door, a Girl was singing Ballads, and Whitesides came and saunter'd about her for some time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270003"/> and all on a sudden he was gone. I was hardly three Minutes after, when Robert Alcock came out, and said, he had lost a Parcel of Gloves. I told him what a loose Chap I had seen, and that if we went immediately to Rag-fair, it was a Chance if we did not find him a selling the Gloves in some of the Gin-ships. So we and 2 more went, and at a Back-window, I saw Whitesides standing by a Candle, and trying a Pair on. We took Marshall at the Door, and found a pair of Gloves in his Pocket, and going backwards, Whitesides ran up, and Marshall down Stairs. One pair of Gloves lay on the Dresser, and the rest we found under a Cherry-sieve, which a Girl was sitting on. Marshall bid Whitesides go and fetch the Man they bought the Gloves of, and Whitesides would fain have gone, but we would not trust him.</p>
               <p>Whitesides. I was try'd here last Sessions, and resolving to get clear of ill Company I enter'd my self on board a Ship; but going to take Leave of my Brother, I met Marshall, who ask'd me to buy a pair of Gloves, and so I stepp'd into the House to try them on.</p>
               <p>Marshall. That's very true, for Whitesides is an innocent Man. I found the Gloves in a Dust-hole by the Postern on Tower-hill, and meeting one Mrs Pattison, she desir'd me to call at the Corner-house going to Rag-fair, and help the Girl (

               <p>Prosecutor. He pretended to be deaf then.</p>

               <p>Whitesides. He could hear sometimes when they baul'd to him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must make him hear now.</p>
               <p>Whitesides, bauling, the Court will make you hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Indeed I am quite deaf.</p>
               <p>Court. If he remains obslinate he must be press'd.</p>
               <p>Whitesides, bauling. The Court says, you must be press'd to Death if you won't hear!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ha!</p>
               <p>Court. Read the Law - Batlet the Executioner first tye his Thumbs.</p>
               <p>[Then the Executioner ty'd his Thumbs together with Whipcord, and with the Assistance of an Officer drew the Knot very hard.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My dear Lord, I am deaf as the Ground.</p>
               <p>Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My sweet, sugar, precious Lord, I am deaf indeed, and have been so these ten Years.</p>
               <p>Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Court. Hold him there a little - Now loosen the Cord, and give him a little Time to consider of it; but let him know what he must expect if he continues obstinate, for the Court will not be trifled with.</p>

The Prisoner and another came into my Master's-Shop, between 8 and 9 in the Morning, and cheapen'd some Stockings; I shew'd them 2 or 3 pair; they bid me Money, but I could not take it, and so they both went out again.

               <p>About 7 at Night the Prisoner and Wood (who pretended to be a Captain) came to the Prosecutor's Shop for 2 Ounces of Nutmegs. Mrs. Shaw had then 5 or 6 other Customers in her Shop, and tho' she offer'd to serve the Prisoner and the Captain, they very civilly refused, and waited till those who came first were served and gone. Then She took out a Drawer of Nutmegs, they tumbled them over, telling her they would have the largest they could pick out. Captain, says the Prisoner, these are very fine ones, you had as good take a quarter of a Pound, and that will serve us all the Voyage. She put some in the Scale; the Prisoner turned them over there too, and the Captain again got his Hand among those in the Drawer. She saw the Captain put his Hand twice to his Pocket, which giving her a Suspicion, she watched him more narrowly, and the third Time, perceiving that he took some Nutmegs in his Hand, pray, says She, buy; but don't Steal. What do ye mean? says the Prisoner, you mistake the Captain, he's no such Person. Upon that, she catch'd hold of the Captain's Coat, and felt the Nutmegs, and while she held him, and was taking them out, Mr. Osborn her Neighbour came over: She told him how they had served her, but the Captain giving a Spring got loose and ran away. The Prisoner said, he was surprized the Captain should do such a Thing, and offer'd to pay for what was missing. She told him, she believ'd he had done the same, by his being so busy with his hand in the Scale. Mr. Osborn offer'd to search him, but the Prisoner swore he should not, and endeavour'd to get out; but Mr. Osborn stopt him at the Door, and in struggling the Prisoner fell in the Street. Mr. Barclay coming to Mr. Osborn's Assistance, they brought the Prisoner into the Shop again, when the Prisoner making a Motion with his Hand to his Pocket, 27 Nutmegs, 17 d. and a Handkerchief fell on the Ground. The Prisoner own'd the Handkerchief; but said he knew nothing of the Money or the Nutmegs. He was carried before Sir

Then he turned to me, and said Damn you, your Money, or you are a dead Woman. I gave him half a Crown; he took it, and said, this is not all; Damn you, give me the rest, and with that he took from me 3 s. more, and a Key, and then ran away over a Field. I kept my Eye upon him all the while, till he dropt in a Ditch. Some Men coming along, we told them we had been robb'd, and they pursu'd the Prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams. My Cousin Gregory and I came from Hampstead together, and I being foremost was crossing a Bridge, when the Prisoner stept out, and as soon as I got over the Bridge, he damn'd my Blood, and demanded my Money. I told him I was a poor Woman, and had but three Farthings. He pray'd the Lord to damn the three Farthings and so went to my Cousin, who was then upon the Bridge, and damn'd her, and demanded her Money. I bid him have a care what he did, for we had Company behind, and so I called John! and Dick! The Prisoner pray'd God to Damn John and Dick, and swore he would have my Cousin's Money, or she was a dead Woman. And while he was robbing her, he dropt his Stick in the Water. I stoop'd and took it up, and was going to give him a Knock; but seeing 2 Men at a distance, I call'd to them, and dropt the Stick : The Prisoner took it up, and ran down the Turnpike Path. You Dog, says I, I'll have you still. The Men coming up, pursu'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270006"/> him, and we follow'd them, and so they took him in the Ditch.</p>

Both her Thighs were broke, the left was Fractur'd near the Middle, and the right near her Knee, which was much contused, and there was a Wound on her Ancle; and I have reason to believe that these were the Cause of her Death.</p>
               <p>Another Surgeon gave the same Account of the Wounds and Fractures; but added, that he could not say they were, tho' they might be, the Cause of her Death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I heard her cry out in the Yard, and ask'd her how she came there? She said she had been for a penn'orth of Muscles, and had got the Cramp in her Knee; I bid her be quiet, and so she was. And then I went to Bed, and lay 'till six in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis very strange, that a Woman in such a miserable Condition, wounded, and bruised, and both her Thighs broke, should talk of buying Muscles, and complain of nothing but the Cramp.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I suppose she was drunk.</p>
               <p>Court. It's intolerable, that such poor Wretches should be suffer'd to drink till they have lost their Senses. The Houses that allow of such scandalous Practices ought to be suppress'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was but a Servant to one who put me in the House, and I have not been in it above five Weeks. John Brown, whom I sent for, was a Porter belonging to the Shop; and when he and Barns came, they told me, if I did not move the Body, there would be 5 l. to the Coroner, 5 l. to bury her, and a Fine of 30 l. laid upon the House.</p>

               <p>Hugh Hughs. The Prisoner and I both liv'd in the House of Mr. Westfield, a Sugar-baker. The Prisoner had been there 7 Weeks, he lay in the same Room, but not in the same Bed, with me. On Friday, the 15th of this Month, he got up by 5 in the Morning, and went away. Soon after he was gone I found my Wig box empty; my Trunk was broke open and I miss'd 2 Shirts and a Bag, in which there was a Gold-ring, 10 Guineas, and 7 s. - He was taken the same Night with one of my Shirts upon his Back, and but one Guinea, and 6 d. left in his Pocket.</p>

               <p>Thomas Carpenter. I was robb'd about May or June last, I don't remember the Time exactly, for I am very antient ( near 100 Years old) I had about 40 Guineas in a Bag, in my Coat-pocket, and when I went to Bed I laid my Coat in the Chair and the Maid came and fetch'd the Candle away. I knew of no Body being in the House but my self, the Maid, and the Prisoner. In the Morning when I arose, I miss'd all my Money. I suspected the Prisoner had taken it, because he ran away.</p>

I went to the Place, and found a Child dead; it appear 'd to be upwards of two Years old. I found a black Circle about the Neck, and a Mark like the Print of a Thumb, under the right Ear. Some Gentlemen told me, they had seen three Women coming from the Place where the Child lay; and I afterwards found, that one of these three were the Prisoner, who was the Mother of the Child. I ask'd her, how she could be so barbarous as to murder her own Infant? She said she had only stripp'd it about 7 at Night, and laid it naked in the Ditch; and this was all that I could get out of her for a pretty while; but at last, in a violent Agony of Grief, she said, Then, Sir, I will tell you how I did it; but there was a Vagabond Creature, one Sukey, that persuaded me to it; and was equally concern'd with me. On Sunday Night we took the Child into the Fields, and stripp'd it, and ty'd a Linen Handkerchief hard about its Neck to keep it from crying, and then laid it in a Ditch. And after that, we went together, and sold the Coat and Stay for a Shilling, and the Petticoat and Stockings for a Groat. We parted the Money, and join'd for a Quartern of Gin. The Prisoner made the like Confession before Justice Chamberlain, insisting upon it, that the other Creature Sukey was equally guilty.</p>

When she came to work, over Night, we ask'd her if she had carry'd her Child back to the Work house (for the Child was kept in the Parish Work-house, and she had got Leave to take it out for 2 or 3 Hours) she told me, she had not, but her Mother had. She worked 'till One in the Morning, and then had a Dram, and would have had another, but I would not let her. Thn she desir'd a Penny to buy a Roll and Cheese. I gave her a Penny; but instead of fetching a Roll and Cheese, she brought in a Roll and a h'p'orth of Gin - Then she said, she had done something that deserved Newgate. I told her I hoped she had not wrong' my Mistress, but if she had, her best way would be to make a plain Confession, and then I believe my Mistress, would be the more favourable to her. She said it was no such thing as that; but she had left her Child all Night in the Field. What? says I, in such a dismal cold Night! How can you be so cruel ? She said she had not done it, but one Sukey persuaded her to it. So I bid Elizabeth Scot take a piece of Bread and Butter, and go with me and the Prisoner to fetch the Child, for the Prisoner had not told me the Child was dead, and I thought it would be a hungry as well as Cold. But when we came to the Place, we found the Child stript and lying dead in a Ditch, with a Linnen-rag tied hard about its poor Neck.</p>

Now, you Son of a Bitch, says he, If I was in your Hands, as you are in mine, you'd murder me - No; says I, my dear, I would not hurt a hair of your Head. He took me several times by the Throat, and I believe would have kill'd me, if Abbot had not prevented him. Then he order'd Abbot to bind me Hand and Foot, and so they left me, between 12 and 1 in the Morning. But my Shoes being off I got loose and call'd upon the Beadle, and so went home, for I was but about half a Mile from my own House when they robb'd me.</p>

               <p>- Pawnbroker. On the 7th Instant the Prisoner pledg'd this Watch with me for a Guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the Watch to lie with me, and because I would neither humour him that way, nor return the Watch, he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270014"/> would swear a Robbery! against me - Pray ask him if I took it without his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Wright. No, but it was withoot my Consant.</p>

            . On Saturday Morning, my Wife told me, as she came by Mr. Hackshaw's empty House, which is but 3 Doors from mine, she saw the Bar of the Cellar-door loose. Then, says I, some Rogues have been stealing the Leaden-sink in the Kitchen. That would be worse, says she, than when they stole the Pipes a Year ago. As I had the Key of the House, I went to examine how it was; I found the Lead of the Sink was taken out, and laid upon the Floor ready to be carried away. O, thinks I, the Gentlemen will come to fetch it at Night, and I can't do less than to give them a Welcome. So I spoke to

             to bring his Gun and to sit up with me that Night, which he did. I went out about 12 but found nothing stirring. I went again in less than an Hour and heard a ticking in the Cellar, and by and by a light was struck. I goes home to my Wife - Her Name is Nanny, says I, now my Chaps are in the House, but call the Watch - I warrant you the Rogues have got Pistols, if they have, says I, we'll send the Dog in first and he won't value their Pistols, for he don't know a Pistol from a Broom-stick. Then Bob shall go with his Gun, and Fire upon them, and I'll hide myself behind the Door, till the Danger is over. But all this wou'd not make her easy. And so being willing to obey my Wife's orders, I ran to the Watch as fast as if I was running for an Estate, and brought them with me: But when we came to the Door they were so full of their good breeding, that they stood disputing who should enter first: I was vext at it, for I thought their Noise would alarm the Rogues within, and so it proved, for presently I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270015"/> a Window slap to. Now, thinks I, they have made their Escape Backwards, and I have watch'd all Night for nothing. So I push'd in foremost, and ran into the Kitchen; I saw no Body at first, but looking into the Closet, there stood the Prisoner, squeez'd in a Corner bolt upright, with a Plaisterer's Lathing-hammer in his Hand. I Knock'd him down, and catch'd him by the Collar as he fell. His Head run with Blood, and I was sorry to see it; but I thought it was better so, than he should serve me worse with his Hammer. I took the Hammer from him - Here it is - And this Knife, but it is not worth a Fill of a Farthing. When I had pull'd him out and secur'd him, the Watch came in to my Assistance. <rs id="t17340227-44-verdict198" type="verdictDescription">

Then he threw the Stick upon the Ground, and dragg'd the Deceas'd by the Shoulders into the Entry, and knock'd her Head as hard as ever he could against the Post of the Partition, about three times</p>

There was a large Fracture in the Skull, which began over the Right-ear, ron to the Orbit of the Eye, and thence to the upper Jaw-bone, and in two or three Places of it, small Pieces of the Skull were beat in. The Skull being remov'd, I found 8 Ounces of extravasated Blood, part between the first Skin and the Skull, another part between the first Skin and the Second, and the rest in the two lateral Ventricles of the Brain. The Skull being broke in, was the Occasion of her Death.</p>

Says I, That's my Stick Then I'll give you another for it, says he, but I took it for the old Woman's Keffel - We call'd it her Keffel because she was a Welsh-woman. Then he got her Stick and burnt that too; and while it was burning, Alcroft came in for a Candle. Says I, Let's go, for we can't be at quiet here. No don't, says the Prisoner, and I'll turn her out. So he took her out into the Entry, and left her there, and fasten'd the Door.

               <p>John Phipp. I came from Baldock in Hertfordshire, and being at my Inn, in St. John-street, I was told that the Prisoner wanted to speak with me, and that he was a vast rich Man, and kept a matter of three hundred Horses. I spoke to him, and he appointed to meet me next Morning, about nine a Clock, at the Leg-Tavern in Fleet-street: But he did no great matters there, for he had a Mind to go somewhere else. So coming along Fleetstreet, he called to a Man, You, you, I want to speak with ye: I must have a hundred Pound of you on Monday Morning. Sir, said the Man, you shall have it. So we came to the <placeName id="t17340227-54-crimeloc239">Crown Tavern in Smithfield</placeName>

There was three other Men with him, though I don't know whether they went in with him, or came to him soon after. But before he went in, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270019"/> sent a Man with a Letter to his House in Fleet-Lane. And these three Men pretended to be the Prisoner's Servants. And one of them said to him; Sir, I must have six score Pounds to pay your Workmen. And said the Prisoner, I han't so much about me, but here's a bill of fourscore Pounds. Then another of the Men laid down nine or ten Guineas. But the first Man said that would not do. And upon that the Prisoner desired me to lend him some Money to make it up, and he said I should have it again by six a Clock that Night. So I lent him ten Guineas; but his head Man said that was not enough. I had seven Guineas and ten Shilings more in my hand; and the Prisoner sitting next to me he claw'd the Money from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you are come to the Point. Tell us in what Manner he took it ? You say he claw'd the Money from you. Explain what you mean by that.</p>
               <p>Phipp. I held the Money in my Hand, thus, and he pulled it out.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw him take it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he take it by violence, whether you would or no, or did you consent to it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. I can't say there was Violence neither; nor I can't say that I rightly consented : But he took it out of my hand, that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you complain to any Body that he had robb'd you ?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No, I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you think you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Phipp. I can't say rightly that I did; for I thought he would have paid me again; because I had heard he was such a vast rich Man.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did he stay after he had got your Money?</p>
               <p>Phipp. They all slipt away presently, in three or four Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did you about this when you came to your Inn?</p>
               <p>Phipp. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you any Note for the Money, or for any part of it?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you go again to the same Tavern, that Night.</p>
               <p>Phipp. Indeed I can't tell if I were to die.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you drunk?</p>
               <p>Phipp. No, I was not drunk. - When the Prisoner was at the Leg, he sent a Porter for his Comrades.</p>

            . I am Porter at the Leg-Tavern. A Man who was drinking there with the Prosecutor sent me with a Note to a Brandy-Shop in Fleet-Lane; and the Woman at the Brandy-Shop sent me to an Inn in St. John Street. The Landlady there said the Gentleman was not there, but if he came, she would send him to the Leg. In my way back, I called again at the Brandy-shop, where I heard that the Person had been there, and was gone to our House. I went directly home, and presently a Man came in and went to the Room where the Prosecutor was. There was then four in Company; I think the Prisoner was one of them, and they all went away together.</p>
               <p>Phipp. You would know him better, if he pulled off his Gown and his Wig, and put on the dress he was in at your House.</p>

            , were at work in the House where the Woman lives. About three an elderly Gentleman came up and went into her Room. Presently the Door was shut and a Cloth hung over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270021"/> the Key-hole. But some of us looking thro' a Crevice in the Partition, observed some odd Passages between the old Man and her. He staid near an Hour, and when he went away, she came into our Room and went to plane a Board. I told her that was a Forfeit, and so I followed her into her Room, and asked her for a Dram: But I went back immediately, and she soon followed me. An Alehouse-Keeper's Man came up for some Shavings, she rioted him out of the House; and as he was going down Stairs, she said she must go back and shut her Door, for fear she should be robbed. So she went, and I went down to work in the Room below. She came down soon after, staid a little while, and went up again. In a few Minutes I heard a noise above, and ran up, she was then charging Hugh Meer and my Master's Apprentice with taking the Watch; and she said it was in her Room when she went to shut her Door, which was near an Hour after I was in her Room. And they were bantering her about the old Man. Then she said she was sure we had it among us; and at last she charged me with it.</p>

            . While she was in our Room her little Dog bark'd, and up came an old Gentleman, who look'd to be about sixty. Says she, My Dog knows my Customers. So she and the old Man went in and shut the Door. I thought some Game was going forward, and so I looked at the Key-Hole, but something was hung before it within Side. Then we found out a Crevice, and through that we could see 'em plainly. She was sitting in a Chair, and he stood before her. He thrust his Hand down her Bosom, and then up her Coats; she took out what she could find, and play'd with it, while the old Boy bill'd her, as if he would have eaten her up. After he was gone, she came into our Room, and we began to run the rig upon her, about what we had seen, and I called her - and - , which made her so angry, that she swore I and Gandy had stole the Watch. But when the Prisoner came up she charged it upon him. It was the first time that ever I had heard any of him. As to his being in her Room, she came to plane a Board, and he told her she must pay her Footing, and so he followed her and asked her for a Dram. I saw him in the middle of her Room, but he was not near the Chimney where the Watch hung, and he did not stay two Minutes.</p>
