            . I am a constable of Bassishaw ward. On Wednesday morning, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I was passing by the gate of the prosecutors' premises; (there is a yard leading to their premises) - I saw the prisoner and another coming along the yard- they were inside the yard, coming from the warehouse; the other had the cloth on his shoulder - I collared him, and the prisoner instantly rushed between us, and disengaged the man from my hold; they dragged me outside the gate - the cloth then dropped from the other man's shoulder between us, and prevented my getting hold of the other one, and he ran away; the prisoner being behind him, I tried to catch hold of him - he ran across the road; I called Stop thief! and a gentleman stopped him - I never lost sight of him; I took up the cloth, and took him to the Mansion-house - Mr. Williams attended there, and identified the same cloth; I informed the prosecutors' porter of it as soon as I had secured him - I have had the cloth ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. This is our cloth - I know it by the manufacturer's mark on it, and our mark also; the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house - the warehouse door was open.</p>

            . I am book-keeper in a broker's counting-house. I was coming into the City a little after nine o'clock, and saw two men come out of the prosecutors' gateway, one of whom had the bundle of cloth - the constable seized him; a scuffle ensued, and the man who had the cloth ran off - the prisoner went across the way, and ran round a waggon, endeavouring to escape; I met him, and secured him, without losing sight of him - I am certain of him.</p>

On the 22nd of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, Mr. Shackle brought the prisoner into my shop, and said, in his presence, that he had detected him in stealing goods out of my window; I immediately examined my window, which I had seen several times in the course of the day - these gloves were about the centre of the window, near the glass - I looked at the window, and discovered the gloves disturbed, they had fallen against the window; they were still in the window - they had fallen from where they had been, and laid slanting against the window, as if somebody had pulled them; the window was broken with a small pointed pebble, which was found on his person - the hole was sufficient to admit any person's hand; the glass had fallen inside - I had seen the gloves before this happened; they were not above 2 or 3 inches from the window before, but when this was discovered they were close against the window, and resting on it; there were about four dozen pairs of gloves in two packets - only the top packet was removed; that was about two dozen, and worth about 3l. - that is all that was removed; there is no area to keep a person from the window - my shop is part of my dwelling-house.</p>

            . On the 22nd of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me break the window with a stone? A. No, I did not know he had the stone; I saw him with his left hand, with the assistance of the other boy, break the window; they were ten minutes about it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of December I was coming up the Strand, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, and took the prisoner in charge in the shop - I found a pebble in his possession, with which I suppose he cut the glass; he had 2l. 10s. 6d., which he said he had received for a plumber and glazier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down the Strand, and stopped at this shop to look at something which I thought would suit me; this gentleman collared me, and said I had broken the window - he took me into the shop; he said I broke it with a pebble stone, which is impossible.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOSEPH SHACKLE. Q. Did you see the boy break the window? A. I saw both of them at the window, and both assisted in doing it; I was ten minutes observing the transaction - the shop is between two passages - the prisoner went one way for some time, and stood looking towards the street till he saw his way clear; the other went into the other passage, and they returned to the window which they had broken, and I saw both their hands touch the gloves.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Circumstanced as I am this day before you on a charge of serious and important character, I trust you will pardon the liberty I take by intruding upon your valuable time and patience, while I attempt, if possible, to explain away the unfavourable impression that may in the course of the evidence have obtruded itself upon your notice: and do trust that by showing and explaining my previous transactions in business that I shall be enabled to convince you that nothing could have been more opposite to my feelings and former pursuits in life, than to have imposed upon any person an instrument fraught with so much danger and serious consequences. From the year 1811 until 1818 I was engaged in the business of a most respectable ironmonger in Greenwich, and, I believe, to the satisfaction of all who then knew me. From 1818 until 1822, I was at Sheffield as factor, and where also every transaction was conducted in a tradesman-like way. From 1822 until 1824 I was engaged as a corn-factor and agriculturist in Lincolnshire, and can give ample proof that every circumstance was conducted with due zeal and attention, and at the same time advantageous manner as I could possibly wish. I shortly afterwards was induced to embark my capital in the cabinet and ivory-turning business, and continued therein until March, 1830, when I became acquainted with a person named Charles Anderson, and from this time, I am sorry to say, I have to date all my present calamities, and to him I may attribute this charge; and as the only party who ought to be responsible for the consequences. In the course of business, the person, Anderson, to whom I have alluded, became acquainted with me and represented himself as a capitalist and made several overtures to me as regarded my business: which, after I had explained, he remarked that it was his intention to freight a vessel and trade to France with various descriptions of merchandize. and he said that many articles in my line of business would do remarkable well as principal and leading commodities, and that he could, by barter, render me very essential service. The offer seemed to savour of probability: and I, trusting too much upon his representation, engaged immediately without making the necessary and precantious inquiry. I therefore unfortunately became his dupe, and supplied him with various articles of cabinet and ivory turnery, and goods to the amount of 150l., and in payment thereof he, (from voyages made to France in April, May, and June,) gave me in return French fans and other fancy articles of French manufacture, and also bills of exchange amounting to a considerable sum, out of which I paid him the balance, in cash and took the responsibility of the bills upon myself, never doubting his integrity. Some of these bills were paid and duly honoured - I gave the bill in question, and which forms this prosecution, to Messrs. West and Strange upon the same faith as the others had been put into circulation, and in payment for the same received of them for this bill, in cash 22l., in goods about 10l., and the balance was held by the prosecutors in payment of my account with them - the bill was paid in due course from the prosecutors to their bankers, and was returned to them as a forged bill; they, of course, adopted the necessary steps, and unfortunately I have not been enabled to find Anderson, who, I understand, is now in America. This I have stated before and again repeat, and do therefore, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, humbly submit that I am a truly injured and unfortunate man, and trust that when you have considered my respectable family, friends and connexions, my previous habits and transactions in trade, and also that I am a married man with three very young children, that you will be pleased to come to a verdict in my favour, and restore me back again to my family and friends. My Lord, I shall merely trouble you with a few friends as to character, and now leave my case in your hands.</p>

I cannot swear with certainty to Butcher's person - I have a strong impression that he is the person, from the circumstances connected with the matter, (not from his appearance to-day,) and from his countenance I think him to be the same man who called one morning at our banking-house; I do not know when it was, but as near as I can recollect it was about six weeks since - he handed me over a bill for 200l.; I cannot say whether it was a promissory note or bill of exchange, it was done in such a hurry; I think it was a note, but cannot speak positively - he had also two India-bonds; he handed the note to me and said, "I have brought this from Mr. Pocock;" I immediately looked at it, and perceived that it wanted Mr. Pocock's endorsement; I said, "You must take it back to your master, and tell him it requires his signature at the back;" he then handed me the two India-bonds, and said, "I want the money for these;" I said, "You must leave these for us to see the interest on them, and take the note back to get your master's endorsement;" he said, "Oh, I must take them all back;" he was then leaving the counter - I called after him, and said, "You understand what I have said," and I think he said Yes - he took them away with him immediately; I do not know the numbers of the bonds.</p>

I cannot swear to the prisoner - a person called on me with some India-bonds, between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 12th of November; he wore a livery, but I cannot recollect what sort - he had the appearance of a gentleman's servant - I think it was brown, with some blue about it; I asked what he wanted - he handed me two India-bonds, and said, "I want the money for these;" I looked at them, and said "There is six months' interest on them, I can give you that;" he said, "No, I want the money - master has sent me to receive them, and take up a bill;" I said; "You must be under some mistake - this is not the place for the money;" I recommended him to go back to his master - he said he had not time, he must take up the bill: he pulled out his pocket-book, and put a paper into my hand, which had the appearance of a bill or something - it had a stamp on it; I asked who his master was; he said Mr. Pocock, of Trevor-terrace, Kensington - he said he could not go back to his master; I said, "I will send you to a gentleman at the Stock Exchange, who will negociate these bonds for you;" I sent him to Mr.

            , a stock-broker. On the 12th of November I remember the prisoner Butcher bringing two India-bonds; he said he wanted the money for them - I looked at them, and saw the interest was not made up; he had a slip of paper, with our direction on it - I wrote on it that the interest must be made up, and told him to take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060007"/>that paper to the India-house; he left our office, returned in about an hour with the bonds, and said he wanted the money - I asked his master's name, and he said Pocock; I then asked his Christian name - he said W. F.

            . I have been in the army, and am chief of the Police at Clonmell. On the 25th of November the three prisoners came to the Mail-coach hotel, at Clonmell, at which I reside; they were each armed with a fowling-piece, which induced me to have them apprehended; I found on Butcher this pocket-book, a gold chain, a diamond ring, a gold breast pin, a brooch, a silver watch, and 44l. 1s. in money: on Cook, who first gave his name as Hunt, and afterwards as Cook, I found a broken brooch, a silver watch, a gunpowder-born and shot-pouch, and 40l.; on Hunt I found a gunpowder-born, a shotpouch, and 45l. 7s.; I traced the gold watch to a watchmaker's shop in Clonmell - the shopkeeper brought it to me, and, in the presence of the prisoners, stated it to have been delivered to him to be cleaned, by Hunt, who admitted that he had given it to him, and Butcher afterwards said it was his property - I produce it: the prisoners at first told me they were three brothers, and that their names were Hunt - they all three stated that to be the case; they were examined separately, in the presence of the Mayor, and what they said was taken in writing, but when they were not before the Mayor, Butcher admitted to me that he had given a wrong name, and that he had taken money from his master in England; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him - he said he had robbed his master and divided the property with his companions, (they were not present) and that he had come over to Ireland to get out of the way - the others said nothing, except in the Mayor's presence.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. In consequence of directions I went to Ireland, and received the prisoners in charge on the 11th of December, at Clonmell gaol - I had received some ear-rings, a gold watch, a brooch, and a broken brooch, a ring, and some other things from the Mayor the day before; I told them, on the 11th what I had received, and that I had seen some silver watches - I neither threatened nor promised them any thing; Butcher said the gold watch and the silver ones they had tossed up for which should have which, and it fell to the lot of Cooke to have the gold one - they were all present when he said this; they said they had some money left - that every one had had his share regularly out, and the constable had taken it away from them; Butcher said "It was my mistress' gold watch, and her rings and brooches, and I did not mean to part with them till we had sold every thing - I meant to keep them till the last;" he said he had sold two bonds to somebody in London - he did not know his name, but it was somewhere near the Bank, and that the money was got by those bonds - that he sold them for 203l. 1s. 11d., and that the other two prisoners stopped over the way while he went and sold the bonds; they were altogether when he made this statement, and I am sure the other two heard him say they were waiting over the way while he went to sell them - they said they were there, and waited till he had got the money, and then they all three went down to Deptford together; Hunt said this first, and then Butcher said when they got the money they all went to Deptford together, and Cook confirmed that account - I distinctly heard that; Butcher said the money was shared out, and they went to Deptford - the other two said they had the share of the money: they said so one after the other, and that they went to Deptford, from there to Gravesend, then to Chatham, and back to Gravesend again - there they all bought clothes alike, and then they went on board the Shannon steam-boat, which took them to Falmouth, and from there to Dublin, (in another conveyance, I believe, but they did not say that;) Butcher said they bought three guns at Dublin, and gave 5l. each for them, and from Dublin they went to Clonmell - this was said in the presence of the others; they did not deny any part of the statement.</p>

               <p>Cook. We never went ashore at Falmouth - we were not present when he said how we shared the money. Witness. They were handcuffed altogether at the time.</p>

               <p>MRS. POCOCK. I know the ear-rings and this watch are mine; this pearl brooch, gold chain, two brooches, and a broken brooch are mine - it was not broken when taken - all these things were in the basket in the drawer; I am rather uncertain whether the cornelian brooch was in the basket - the house is our dwelling-house; we live there.</p>

On the night of the 21st of December, the prisoner, who slept on the premises during the winter, came in before ten o'clock, as usual; he sat down in the kitchen some time, talking about the fires in the country, and in about a quarter of an hour went up to bed - he came down in about ten minutes after, and asked if there was any body sleeping in the room opposite to his, as he saw a light through the key-hole; we told him there was nobody, but wished him to go into the garden, to see if there was a light from the window; he went, returned, and said there was no light, but he heard somebody rush across the garden - that alarmed us very much: we wished him to call in Hill; when Hill came they went up stairs together - they returned together, and said the door was locked (and the key taken away;) they fetched one of the night Police - they could not force the door open, and got a carpenter, who forced it with a crow-bar; I went up into the prisoner's room, and found my box, which was locked, and the key in my pocket, but the hinges, which are leather, were cut, and the box opened; it always stood in the prisoner's room - I had not seen it since the Wednesday before - this was Tuesday: the prisoner has slept in the house the two last witness - I saw a bag brought into the house; it contained my mistress' property, and some of mine: the house was all closed before five o'clock that evening - every window was closed, and the door double locked; only me and mistress were in the house; neither of us had been out all day - it was a damp evening; I do not know whether it rained - I went out next morning; the earth was damp, but I do not recollect rain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. The prisoner remained in the house all that night? A. He did; he was up stairs for ten or fifteen minutes before he came down - I only know that because he was in the house before ten o'clock, and he fetched Hill before half-past ten; I had been in his room about half-past nine that night, but I had not been into the opposite room since Sunday - I locked the door on the Monday morning as the wind blew, and left the key in the door; it is a very strong door, it is the attic.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. You went into his room at half-past nine o'clock? A. Yes, to turn his bed down; I went out again, and saw nothing more than usual - I locked the door on the landing side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would the door lock on both sides? A. Yes; I slept in mistress' room on the first floor; the two rooms are on the second floor - nobody slept in the other room on the first floor; the prisoner works out in the day time, and sleeps at the house in the winter, for protection.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December, a few minutes before eleven o'clock, the prisoner and William Hill knocked at my door, and told me there was somebody in Mrs. Waldron's house, and asked me to come and break the door open; I went up stairs - one of the night-constables was up stairs, on the landing-place, with a poker in his hand; the Policeman assisted me in opening the door of the attic - I found the bottom sash up; I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of the sash being up - he said No; we looked round the room, and saw a socket chisel, a small screw-driver, and a small bit of candle - I saw them found by the prisoner and Hill, and there was a razor in a chair behind the door, on the right-hand; I saw a cord hanging out of the window, and a pair of cart or chaise reins attached to the end of it - we searched the other rooms up stairs, but found nothing; we then went on the roof - the prisoner and Hill went on the roof, through the trap-door in the ceiling, which slides back; the prisoner then unbolted the door in the roof leading on to the gutter - we searched the roof, saw nobody there, and came down; the prisoner and I went round the house into the garden - I saw something laying there, and the prisoner said it was a sack; I said, "Yes, it is, and something in it;" I took it into the kitchen, and the property in it was claimed by the servant and her mistress - the trap-door was bolted inside the roof; it is above the ceiling and leads to the gutter - the one in the ceiling was slipped half way back; nobody could have got out on the roof, and then bolted the door - the reins were tied to the window with a kind of single slip noose at each end; I cannot say whether they were drawn tight - the reins hung eleven feet from the ground; there was a pear tree between them and the ground - the ground under the window appeared fresh; I did not observe any foot-marks - I found in the room a chisel, a screw-driver, and a piece of candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the window any fastening? A. None - it is about five feet high, and would stand open about half that height; the pear tree would not hinder a man from getting down if the reins were sufficient to carry him down.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. Could a man have got up to the window from outside, without a rope? A. No - he could not have got down from the pear tree without my observing the branches being disturbed; there is another window between the pear tree and that window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the candle? A. Griffiths, the officer, took it away - I did not observe whether it had been lighted.</p>

            . I am constable of Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December I received information that Mrs. Waldron's house had been robbed; I immediately went there - it was about ten minutes before twelve o'clock; I went into the kitchen, and saw the bag containing a number of articles, a pair of reins, a chisel, a piece of candle, a screw-driver, and a razor - I examined the house; the lower part was all secure; I went up to the attic - I observed the door forced open; the window was half open - I looked out of window, saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060009"/>distance, and consider that no man could make his escape out that way; I went into the next room, saw two large boxes open, and a small trunk which had leather hinges - they appeared to have been cut with some sharp instrument; one of the hinges was visible outside the trunk, as a piece of paper was torn off - I went down into the kitchen, and questioned the prisoner in what manner the party could have made their entrance; he said, "Why jem, I will show you;" I then went out to the back part of the house with him - he said they must first get on the roof of the wash-house, from there to the roof of the kitchen, and then to the roof of the house, and must have come in at the trap-door; I searched the premises to see if there was a ladder, but found none - I examined the trap-door; I went into the kitchen again with him, and asked him to go up stairs and tie the rope in the way he had found it - he went up for that purpose, but I did not go with him; I and Flack took a lantern into the garden, went under the window, and the rope was thrown out; when he hung it out, I could reach up and touch the end of the reins, which were fastened to the rope by tying a noose of the rope to the buckle part of the reins, and there is a noose in the reins - it was not drawn tight; if a man had lowered himself down by them he certainly must have drawn them tight - it was rather a damp night; there was not the least sign of foot-marks on the ground- I have had the reins in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you first see the rope? A. In the kitchen - I do not know what alteration might have taken place in it; I was in and out of the house all night - I left the prisoner in the house, with Mrs. Waldron and the servant; there was nothing to prevent his running away - I have known him five years, and never heard any thing against him; I searched him about eight o'clock in the morning - I did not intimate that I suspected him before that; I certainly said I did not believe any body could get in the way described - there is a society at Tottenham, which offers a reward on apprehension of felons; it is not paid before trial - the amount is according to what they please to give, there is no fixed reward now; the prisoner was not apprehended for the sake of the reward; as I apprehended him I expect to have the reward - I never knew a reward given on an acquittal.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodging? A. Yes, twice - I found nothing of the prosecutrix's there; I examined the harness in his cart-shed- it appeared to be perfect, except a collar and a pair of reins; I then went to him in the watch-house, and asked if his harness was complete - he said No, there was no reins, for he had lent them to a man named Boreham; I sent for Boreham, and afterwards told the prisoner Boreham said he had never borrowed them of him - he repeated that he had lent them to Boreham.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Can you swear the reins belonged to a particular harness? A. No - the collar has not been found.</p>

            . I am a night constable of Tottenham. On the 21st of December Hill called me out of bed - I went with him to Mrs. Waldron's; I saw the prisoner, Mrs. Waldron, and her servant, standing in the kitchen - I asked the prisoner what was the matter; he said there was somebody fastened in the room up stairs -I went up to the door of the second floor room with him; I found it fastened - I tried to break it open with my feet, but could not, and shortly after Flight came with an iron bar, and broke it open: we both went in together - Flight said to the prisoner, "There is that window glass, do you know any thing about it?" he said he did not - the prisoner passed me on the left hand, went to a table near the window, and said, "There has been some one here, for here are their tools;" I went to look at them, and saw a rusty socket chisel, a small screw-driver, and a piece of candle - I did not examine the candle; the prisoner went a little further to the window, which was up, and said,"Here is a rope where they must have made their escape out of window;" the rope was fastened to the foot of the bedstead, which stood up against the wall, the bottom of it within four or five inches of the window - the bedstead did not appear to have been moved - the prisoner went round the room with me, and said, "Here is a razor;" we searched the room every where we could conceive a person could be concealed, but found nobody- I and Flight pulled the rope up - the reins were fastened to the end of it by the buckle; I left the room with the prisoner, and went to the sliding trap door, and along the roof to another small door, which leads to the parapet - it was bolted inside; the prisoner pulled the bolt back, the door then gave a swing as if the bottom hinge was broken - there was no means of unbolting it outside; the prisoner then took the light from me, and went all over the loft - we then went down into the kitchen; I told the prisoner and Flight they had better go and search the outer places, as they knew them better than me; Flight returned with a bag, and said to me, "You said they had got nothing out, but look here;" I opened the bag, the servant looked in, and found her stockings and a silk dress of her mistress' in it - she then shook the contents out: I did not go into the garden.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what weather it was? A. I believe rather foggy and damp - I do not think the ground was frozen there, it being so close to the wall; I have known the prisoner twenty years, and never heard any thing against him - I left the house between eleven and twelve o'clock, left Flight there, and sent Griffiths there.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December I lost no property but what was found in the bag - this property is mine; I had seen it on the Wednesday before the robbery, which was on Tuesday - it was kept in a wooden box in the prisoner's room; I have employed him one day in the week for the last seven years, to garden for me - this is the second winter he has slept in my house, for protection; I was much alarmed on the night of the 21st, at seeing him come down into the kitchen, half undressed, as my servant has stated; the clock struck ten a few minutes after he came in, and he went up stairs about ten minutes after that; in ten or fifteen minutes he came down, opened the kitchen door, and asked if there was any body in the room opposite to his - we said No; he said there was a light in the room - I did not go up: I was so alarmed I fastened myself into the kitchen - the value of my things is 2l. 14s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did the men who afterwards came to the house remain? A. I cannot say, I was so alarmed; I sat up all night - they all went away except the prisoner at last; the prisoner, I, and the servant were alone in the house, the morning part, and he remained there - my servant had been baking that day, and I had been making tarts; I was sometimes in the parlour, and sometimes in the kitchen - I was in the kitchen till five o'clock; I think it was not quite dark then: my doors were shut at five - nobody could have entered at the lower part of the house, I am certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner been in your house since the morning? A. Not to my knowledge - he was not at work there that day; there is another garden at the back of mine - a person could get over into that and get away: I have never found the key of the room - I saw it in the door on Sunday; the sack was found near the house - I had not been in the garden all day; the prisoner sat up in the kitchen with us all night - I do not know when he was told he was suspected; I was very ill in the morning, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>SARAH STRACEY. I lost the articles which are here that night; also a 5l. note and six sovereigns, which have not been found - the money was in a small box in the same box as these things were taken from; I saw the money there on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you speak to the exact amount of money? A. I am certain there was a 5l. note and six sovereigns; there might have been more sovereigns - my box was not quite emptied - the things were turned upside down: the window is twenty-six feet from the ground; we could not hear a noise up stairs - mistress was in the kitchen when the prisoner alarmed us; we had no clock, but the church clock struck ten - the small box was left, and the money taken out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had gone into the room about half-past nine o'clock that night? A. Yes, to turn the prisoner's bed down; I saw nothing amiss then - I went into his room after the money was found; the box then stood in its place, and was locked, but finding these things, which I knew had been in it, I examined, and found the lid cut, and the property gone; my mistress' things were in a wooden box, which the key was always left in - if the box had been cut, and the property taken before half-past nine o'clock, I should not have observed it; the room remained the same, except that a large leather box was open, which I did not observe at half-past nine, but it might have been so then - it is very improbable that I should not see it; I had not been into the garden all day; the front door had not been opened all day, except by the prisoner when he went out in the morning; a person to have gone up stairs must have come through the kitchen where I was to go out at the back; I had been all day in the kitchen, baking - the prisoner remained in the kitchen with us all night: he had gone up and dressed himself after the witnesses had been - he left our house in the morning with the constable, between nine and eleven o'clock; I think he remained in the kitchen with us till half-past seven o'clock in the morning, when mistress went to bed, and he still remained about the house - the constable came between eight and nine; the leather trunk contained curtains - nothing was taken out of that.</p>

On the 13th of December I went home between twelve and one o'clock; I did not latch the outer door, but remember latching the inner door - I undressed, put my clothes on a box by my bed-side, and at half-past three was awoke by the Police and a watchman, who asked if I had lost any thing; I got up, and missed the clothes I had worn during the day - the gloves were in my great coat pocket with two razors, and my watch; the Policeman and watchman went down stairs, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I went into Shoreditch, stopped there about an hour, then returned to my rooms, staid there from half-past five to quarter-past six o'clock - I was then standing at the door, heard a whispering at the foot of the stairs, and saw the forms of two men there; it was gloomy there - I could not distinguish their features; I distinctly heard one of them say."They are gone;" I immediately called my brother, then ran down stairs, and followed close at their heels, down the passage, and never lost sight of one of them - that was Davies, he had a great coat on - I watched at the corner of the passage, keeping him in view, till my brother came down; I told him to go a-head, and follow the prisoners - I walked on the other side of the way after him; my brother went up, and stopped them; I immediately crossed over, and gave them into custody - I had never lost sight of Davies; Strickson told the watchman, if he dared to lay hold of him he would knock him down, and he gave him a severe blow on the head; two Policemen came up, laid hold of him, and took him to the station - I had lost sight of Strickson for a moment, while he turned the corner - I swear they are the two men who were whispering at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it day light? A. No, it was a dark gloomy morning; they were taken about a hundred yards from the house - they both turned the corner of the passage, but when Davies turned I was close to him, and did not lose sight of him - my brother was in my room; I called pretty loudly - I had been at the Red Lion, in Hunter-street, the night before, and had some purl; I was there till ten o'clock, but not drinking all the while - my score was 4d. or 5d.; I had broken the glass of my watch, and put it into my great coat pocket - there was no lock to the door; I could see the prisoners at about eight yards distance - a sovereign and a half and a few halfpence were found on Strickson; I did not see either of them smoking a segar - I have two rooms over some stables; there are ten rooms on the same gallery, and doors to each - it was not my great coat which Davies had on.</p>

            . I was awoke on the morning in question by the watchman and Policeman coming up stairs - I sleep with my brother; the watchman showed him a suit of clothes, and asked if he had lost any thing; I knew them to be his - he got up, and put on his working dress - the watchman left the things in the room as he had found them; the great coat has not been found; it was about half-past three o'clock - I got up before he left; my brother went down stairs - I came up again in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; he kept going in and out, and at half-past five o'clock I was sitting in the room, and heard myself called - I ran down; he said two men, whom he suspected, had run down the court - I followed with him, but never saw the prisoners till they were in Kingsland-road; my brother pointed to them - they were two hundred or three hundred yards off; I directly went after them, stopped them, and accused them of robbing my brother - they said they were innocent; my brother came up, called the watchman over, and gave them in charge - the Policeman came up in two or three minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you and your brother inside your own door when he told you the men had just gone off? A. I was, but my brother was on the gallery; you can just see into the street from the gallery, and it is as much as you can; you cannot see a yard beyond it - he was standing at the bottom of the gallery stairs when I got down; he could see into the street from there if people were passing - I saw nobody; nobody could have passed without my seeing them - my brother stood at my side - nobody did pass; I consider he must have lost sight of the men in turning the corner - they were stopped a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards off; the court is twelve yards long - I never saw them till he pointed them out to me, about fifty yards from the court; he said, "There goes the two men I suspect have robbed me;" I might have seen them before, but did not notice them - I passed two or three persons in the street; when I first got to the bottom of the stairs, he said, "Joe, here are two men just run up the court, who I suspect;" he could not have seen them then - they had turned the corner; no housebreaking implements were found on them.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 13th of December, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I observed the two prisoners and two girls of the town, who constantly walk there, talking together: and about a quarter-past three I met Davies with the two women - Strickson was on the opposite side of the way, with a man who had a wooden leg; Davies was on the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060012"/>side as me, which is the opposite side to the passage, and lower down - they were all going towards Shoreditch church; I turned back soon after, and went that way myself - I saw the two prisoners talking together right opposite this passage; it was rather more than half-past three o'clock; the females and the man with the wooden leg had left them - I went up a court on the opposite side to the prosecutor's, came round into Shoreditch again, and missed Strickson; Davies was waiting there, and I thought was watching me - I went and stood opposite the court about eight minutes, then saw Strickson come out at the end of the court, and shut the iron gate after him; he put his hand into his pocket, walked away, and Davies after him; Strickson had a great coat on, which he had not ten minutes before - I could not discover any thing in his hand- a private watchman came up soon after they went away- he stood at the entrance of the court when the prisoners came out; I told him what I had seen, and he lent me his light - we went down to the foot of the stairs; he found a suit of black clothes laying on a stool on the landing-place- I went and found the prosecutor's door open; I was not present when the prisoners were taken - I saw them at the watch-house, and identified them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave the watchman behind when you had found the property? A. Yes - I did not search the prosecutor's rooms, but ran in pursuit of those I had seen come out of the court; it was about twenty minutes to four o'clock - Strickson, at the watch-house, had a blue coat on, which he generally wore; I knew them by being there every night - our commissioners generally give a reward for apprehensions; it is not on conviction: when a man apprehends a party he sends a note to the commissioners, and if they think it a case worthy of reward they give one - I have been twelve months in the Police.</p>

Yes - I left Ivy-lane at near twelve o'clock; I left home between ten and eleven - I was not tipsy; I had left the public-house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I met her - I had not been toying with any girls on the road; I did not take out my watch in the room - I went into the house between twelve and one o'clock; a woman fetched the gin after I took my trousers off - that woman had been in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not the woman who awoke you, the woman who had been in the room with you? A. She certainly was not - I should think not; I am sober now- I had 2s., which I put into my stocking that she should not take them.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Bride's. On the 31st of December, about a quarter-past three o'clock, I was called to No. 2, Harp-court, Black Horse-court - a woman belonging to the house desired me to go into the parlour, for there was a man there ill-using a woman; I found it was Griffin - he was dressed; he had been drinking, but had not sufficiently recovered - he charged a woman there with robbing him of his watch; I did not know I was authorized to take a person out of a house -I directly went to the watch-house, which is not twenty yards off; Watts, the night officer, went with me - the prosecutor was still contending with the woman about his watch; while the officer was searching the room, I heard a scuffle and saw the prisoner attempting to run out of the front parlour door - I followed, and took her, without losing sight of her, against Mr. Farrow's house, No. 80, Farringdon-street, about fifty yards from the house; when I laid hold of her she was picking up her clogs - she returned with me quietly; the prosecutor immediately said, "That is the woman that came in with me to go to bed with me;" he did not charge her with taking the watch - I took both the women into custody, then returned, looked about, and on the identical spot where the prisoner was stooping to pick up her clogs, I found the watch without the outer case, and in the morning at day-light, I saw the watch-case down Mr. Farrow's area; the prosecutor claimed it - the house he was in is a common house for the reception of prostitutes; the prisoner frequents it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there other houses of the same description in the court? A. Yes - it is not a thoroughfare; the place where the prisoner stopped was immediately under a gas-light - it was about a quarter-past three o'clock; the impression on my mind was that the prosecutor had been worse than he was then.</p>

I was at home about five o'clock in the evening, and left the door on the latch, I am quite positive - I went into the cellar leaving nobody in the warehouse; master was in the counting-house, and in about five minutes the officer came - I ran up stairs directly, and the instant he spoke I missed the three reams of paper, which I had seen safe before; there had been sixty-two in the stuck when I went into the cellar - only myself was employed in the warehouse; I went in pursuit - the officer brought Wright into the warehouse, and left him in my charge; he had got nothing then - the officer requested me not to let him go, saying in his presence that he had seen him with the paper first; Wright made no reply - Jones was brought back in about ten minutes with these three reams of paper, which I had seen on the stack before I went into the cellar.</p>

             STATHAM. I am a street-keeper. On Tuesday, about five o'clock, I saw Wright with three reams of paper loose - he was getting on the pavement directly opposite Mr. Roberts' house; I directly crossed over, and asked Mr. Roberts if he had sent any out - he followed me; I had seen two or three more persons near Wright, but do not know whether they were in his company - I followed Wright, and saw him going up Queen-street without any paper; I overtook him in Cheapside - I am certain he is the person I first saw with the paper; when I took him he said, "The young man went this way;" I said, "You are the young man;" he said, "Do you think so?" I said, "Yes, come back with me;" I took him back to the porter, while I went and found Jones in custody at a house with the paper.</p>
               <p>Jones. Q. When you saw Wright come out of the premises, did you see me near? A. There were three or four with him, but I cannot say whether Jones was or was not one.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Wright's Defence. When he crossed over to the warehouse I was on the opposite side, and seeing him go very hasty I stopped to see what was amiss; he came out directly with two gentlemen - the officer ran up Queen-street; I ran with him to see what was amiss, and at the top of Queen-street he said to me, "Did you see which way the young man went?" I said No; he looked at me, and said, "I think you are the young man who had the paper;" I said, "If so, I am willing to go where you think proper."</p>

I was walking down Queen-street; a young man, apparently in a great hurry with three reams of paper on his arm, stopped at the corner of a street, placed them on a window cill, and one of them slipped from between - I ran to put them on his shoulder; he asked me to carry them to Aldersgate-street with him as he was in baste; I said I had no objection, having nothing to do - he told me to follow him, and by St. Thomas Apostle the gentleman came up; the man had just turned the corner as the gentleman came up to me.</p>

            . I am a constable of Portsoken ward. On the 16th of December I saw the two prisoners in company together, in Basinghall-street, going towards Fore-street - I watched them; Mr. Pullen and a lady were coming from Fore-street, towards them - they crossed the road, and turned back after them; I followed them up Old Jewry, across Cheapside, into <placeName id="t18310106-14-crimeloc84">Bow-lane</placeName>

               <p>Pearce. Q. Did you not state at Guildhall that you did not see the handkerchief taken from the pocket, but another gentleman saw it? A. No, I said I saw it taken; the Alderman asked for the gentleman who called out.</p>
               <p>Curter. He said another gentleman saw it taken, but he did not. Witness. I never said so.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ about two months: I dismissed him, and after that I received a letter from some one, which I made the subject of inquiry; here is that letter - the Grand Jury threw out the bill, and two or three days after that bill was ignored. I received from the postman this other letter, on which this prosecution is found; I had seen the prisoner write while he was in my service, and I believe this to he his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go before the Grand Jury with the former letter, by legal advice? A. I put the whole affair into the hands of a solicitor, but he was committed before I had consulted the solicitor, and I was bound over to prosecute; I presume this indictment was drawn up by my solicitor's advice - I received other letters while the prisoner was in gaol on the first charge; I am not sure whether he is married: he was first taken before Mr. Hoskins, and he wished him to be remanded till Mr. Rawlinson could attend; then I wished him to he remanded to bring forward other evidence, and the third time he was brought up before Mr. Hoskins alone- I think I received three letters while the prisoner was in custody; he left prison on Thursday night, the 16th of December, and on the following morning I received this letter- he was taken again the same night; I think I received two letters while he was in gaol, before I went before the Grand Jury; I did not make either of those letters the subject of any charge before the Grand Jury - (letter read.)</p>
               <p>SIR, - If you do not immediately raise the wages of the persons in your employ, your premises must share the same fate as others have. SWING.</p>
               <p>To Messrs. Braithwaite and Nicholls.</p>
               <p>MR. BRAITHWAITE. These other letters are what I received while the prisoner was in custody on the first charge, and these others I have received since he was in charge this last time; I told the prisoner's wife and a gentleman named Day that I had received them - I saw his wife on the morning after he was first committed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said you believe the letter produced on this charge to be the prisoner's hand-writing? A. Yes - he was my drayman, took out beer, and booked the names of the persons he delivered it to in my books; he was employed about a fortnight or three weeks with the dray, and made entries in the book every day; I have seen him repeatedly - my clerk books the beer, but I was there; my clerk is not here - he could not swear positively to having seen him write, and he thought comparison of writing was not sufficient.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you saw him write? A. It must be two years, as he has left us that time - I think I have seen him write within two years and a quarter, but it is impossible to speak to a quarter of a year; I think I can safely say I had seen him write a dozen times - it was the booking-clerks' business to notice his writing more particularly.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is the clerk in your service now? A. No, he has left me about six months.(Letter read, see indictment.)</p>

It was not dark, and there was no candle in them - the stairs lead to the kitchen and to the cellar; none of the customers had any right down the stairs, unless they were going to the privy - there were two halfpence picked up without a light at the bottom of the stairs; there was no one in the kitchen - he did not mention about the 1d. till I had him on the ground, and had hold of his handkerchief.</p>

            . I am the son of Matthew Wilson. This copper was taken out of the back kitchen of the house we live in, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 28th of December - it had been fixed in the brick work; I had been in the shop at work, and had occasion to go into the kitchen - I met the prisoner on the stairs; I asked who was there - he said, "Me;" he was a stranger, and I took hold of him - he said he had been to take a person who was intoxicated, down into the kitchen; I did not believe him, and I tapped at the kitchen window - the prisoner immediately ran off, and I pursued him to Berwick-street; he ran down Tyler's-court - I called Stop thief! I pursued him to Oxford-street, and there took him; he bit my hand and tried to kick me - a young man came to my assistance, and I got him to Wardour-street, and there gave him to the Policeman; the copper was taken from the brickwork, put at the kitchen door, and six articles had been removed off it - I had been standing about a minute with the door in my hand, as I heard a footstep; he heard that I suppose and put it down - I had taken my hat off the copper ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you left the door open? A. There is a private door - I cannot tell whether that was open or not, and then there is a door at the top of the kitchen stairs; we have no servants - the prisoner was sober enough to know what he was doing; he pretended to be tipsy afterwards, but not when I seized him.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 27th of December, the prisoner came to me and had a pair of boots- he had no money, but he said he would leave these cocks for an hour; the Policeman came afterwards, and had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Crout let me have fourteen cocks, which I took away, and I said I had four not finished at the factory - Mr. Barlow's was then shut up, and I kept them till Monday, when I went and got the books and left these cocks, meaning to get them back and take them; I had some castings which would require three days to finish - these cocks would be of no use without the castings, and I should have got them and taken them with them.</p>

            . I am a private in the 9th Lancers. On the 12th of December, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the barracks drunk- he called for a light, which was brought; I saw him take a handkerchief out of his breast - he said he would see what money he had; I saw him with about 2s. 4d. - he concealed it somewhere in the bed, and threw the handkerchief on the bed; he went to bed, and about four o'clock a serjeant and file of guards came in and awoke him - they took him to the guard-house; the handkerchief was left in the room - the corporal has it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see what money I had with me? A. I did - only 1s. 3d. was found in the morning; he answered to his name at the barracks at nine o'clock, and went out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure that is the handkerchief he threw on the bed? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ANDREWS. There is a seam across the handkerchief, where it had been torn; this is the handkerchief in which I wrapped my bag and money.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. For some weeks; I paid some money which I had borrowed - I put this money into the bag, the bag into my cap, and the handkerchief on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not I crossing the road? A. You were running across with the parcel.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing Whitechapel - a lad ran towards me and threw the parcel down at my feet, but I know nothing of it.</p>

I never lost sight of the prisoner till he turned the corner - he went to the bottom of the court, and was coming back when the witness passed him - he was about two moments out of my sight; he must have thrown them over the wall after he turned the corner - that was out of my sight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you the officer of the theatre? A. I have been there seven years- I was not a yard from the prisoner when he took the handkerchief; I followed him to see what he was going to do - as soon as he took it, I tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder; the prisoner instantly went away - there were two ladies with the gentleman; he tried them first- the boxes were very full; they were obliged to stand with the doors open - the prisoner stood by the side of the gentleman with a bit of biscuit up to his mouth; I suppose he was pretending to eat it - he was the only person behind the prosecutor; the prosecutor said his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060029"/>handkerchief was yellow, and marked I W E - he never said it had no mark.</p>

            . On the 27th of December I was at Sadler's Wells theatre, and saw the prisoner standing behind me - the officer came and asked if I missed any thing; I put my hand against my pocket. and said not, but in a moment I put my hand inside and found my handkerchief was gone - I immediately called down the stairs after the officer, and saw him take it out of the prisoner's hat; I told him it was marked I W E before it was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there a good many people about you at the theatre? A. Yes, but nobody was behind me but the prisoner - I never said there was no mark on the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in one of the side boxes nearly all the time - I went out for refreshment; a young man accosted me at the public-house, and asked me to buy a handkerchief; I gave him 2s. for it, and believe the officer saw me buy it - I put it into my hat; the other two I had brought, one for my pocket and the other to put round my neck when I came out; I did not know the handkerchief was stolen - when the gentleman got to the station he said he believed there was no mark on it.</p>

On the 22nd of December, by direction, I watched at the synagogue; I had seen the prisoner there very often before; there are seats appropriated to subscribers, and there are lockers, in which they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060030"/>keep their books of service - they have locks and keys to them; the prisoner was not a subscriber - I saw him there between three and four o'clock, at the evening service, while the service was going on; I observed him particularly, as he was moving about from one part to the other during service - I had before that missed property from the synagogue; I moved away from one place, and stood at the bar, where I could observe him and be screened from his observation - having observed him shifting about I went up and asked what he had been about; he answered, Nothing - I said, "You have been doing something;" he said he had not - I felt in his bosom, and thought I felt a book; I opened his waistcoat, and found this prayer-book in his bosom - I could not have seen it without opening his waistcoat: I caught hold of him, and brought him out - he began to squall out: it was during the service - I took him out, kept him till the service was over, and while I was holding him, he said, "I hope you will forgive me;" I told him I could not forgive him, for the property did not belong to me - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him: I asked if he could show me the seat he took the book from - he said he could; he went with me, and showed me a seat belonging to Samuel Joseph - the locker was open; I am certain he asked forgiveness; I knew him attending there as a Jew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This book is one volume of several? A. It is one of two volumes; I cannot say whether 5s. is a high price for it - the synagogue is open to all Jews - we never refuse a respectable person a seat if they are not subscribers; I cannot say how often the prisoner has been there - I have seen him several times; I am not always there - we do not usually carry these prayer-books in the bosom, but on our arms; it is not usual to put them under our coats - the prisoner is a foreigner, and has been six years in this country; I am sure he did not say he had taken the book by mistake for his own.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it after he asked forgiveness that he pointed out where he took it from? A. Yes - strangers are admitted to the seats by permission of the subscribers.</p>

H. and T. Wood, of Red Lion-court, Watling-street;" that is a very short distance from our warehouse (order read as in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say before Alderman Waithman, that you were not sure the prisoner was the person who presented it? A. I did not: what I said was read over, and I signed it - I am sure I did not say so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect what you said? A. I said, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the prisoner was the person who gave me the order; it being rather dark at the time, by his general appearance, I conceive him to be the man - I took notice of his voice, which is one reason why I speak to him; he has a peculiar accent.</p>
               <p>MR. ARCHDALE. Q. What did you do in consequence of that letter? A. I selected the goods, except one piece, tied up part of them, and took them over to H. and G. Woods, Red Lion-court, and left them with Sutherland; this is the parcel, (looking at it) - it is directed "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not offer to give you every information, and point out the person who sent him? A. He said he should be happy to do so hereafter; Furby, who has pleaded guilty to-night, was in the prosecutor's employ - I did not mention Furby's name to him.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of December, in consequence of what I had heard, I fetched a Police-officer, and found in my house a man who belonged to Mr. Gregory, and a carpet - I had had some dispute about the carpet, and I desired the two men who were there with it, to put the carpet out; I saw a Policeman there at the time - the prisoner, who was one of the men, put the carpet out; I then had occasion to leave home, and upon further consideration I agreed to pay Mr. Gregory for the carpet; I returned home the second time, and then found the carpet at my door, but I did not see the prisoner there - when he took out the carpet at first, he received 1s., by my orders; I did not give it him myself - the carpet was afterwards lost - it was worth more than 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner very unwilling to put it out? A. Not at all, he volunteered to take it out; he had no business there - he said, "If you will pay me I will put it out;" he took it out about three yards, I should think; he said, "If you will allow me I will take it out;" I had asked the Policemen to take it up, and they both declined - I did not make the least row about it; I have heard that my wife asked the prisoner for his address, and that he gave it - I have reason to believe, from inquiry, that it was a true address,</p>

About twelve o'clock; when I saw the prisoner at my house, I asked him what brought him there - he said, "I came with the Policeman - he knows me very well;" I think it very important to state the place the carpet was left in; I live in the very interior of the Cloisters, and the place the carpet was put in is very remote - there are no less than four turnings, through dark passages, to get at it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went to the Little Cloisters on the 28th of December, about eleven o'clock - the prisoner went with me; I had known him by sight - when I got to the prosecutor's house, I found the man there who had brought the carpet; he was insisting upon leaving it - Mr. Connell came soon afterwards - he ordered me to turn the man and the carpet out of the house; I said I would turn the man who brought it out if he required it - I ordered the man to go out, and he did; the prisoner said he would put the carpet out if Mr. Connell would pay him for it - he had come up to me as I was going along, and said it was a fine day; he had a letter in his hand, and I thought he was going to Mr. Connell, or to some gentleman in the Cloisters, with it - he walked on with me; it was just after I had met with him - I was called by a little boy; I did not then know what I was wanted for; I saw the prisoner again about an hour afterwards, which I think was about twelve o'clock - I met him in Tothill-street; he said to me "I think this job will come to a law-suit - I think we shall have to be on the trial;" I told him I did not know any thing about it - he said, "What a joke it would be if any one were to go and steal that carpet;" I told him I thought it would be a rum place for any body to go and find a carpet - he said there were plenty in Westminster would not mind doing that, he knew.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner had been with you? A. Yes - I found the man with the carpet, Mrs. Connell and the servant; Mr. Connell came in about ten minutes - I knew the prisoner before, and often spoke to him when I passed him; I went away and left the prisoner there, and Mr. Connell went away - the prisoner and I were there about ten minutes; he had a letter in his hand, and I expected he was going to carry it there; I did not ask him to go with me - the prisoner had three examinations - I do not know of any other person being taken on this charge.</p>

            . I am ten years of age - I sometimes go to church; I live at No. 22, Princes-street, Westminster. On the 28th of December I saw the prisoner in Dean's-yard, in the Little Cloisters, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I went to Mr. Connell's house to take some bread, and rang the bell; the prisoner and another man were about ten yards from the door, and when I rang the bell they walked away; I saw a carpet at that time -I turned to go to Mr. Preston's, in Little Dean's-yard, and I saw the prisoner and the other man again - the other man bad the carpet then; I had looked at the carpet I saw near Mr. Connell's door, and that which I saw the man (who was with the prisoner) carrying, appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near Mr. Connell's door was the carpet? A. About three yards from it; the place is a little light - it is not a place right open; there are houses in the Cloisters: I did not speak to the prisoner - he had knee breeches on, but I did not notice the colour of them; he had a velveteen faced waistcoat and sleeves - I did not notice the colour of them; it is common among the working classes in Westminster to wear waistcoats with sleeves - I cannot tell whether he had a black handkerchief or a cravat on; I did not notice the dress of the other man - it was getting rather darkish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you saw the prisoner twice?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060033"/>A. Yes - he was dressed in the same manner on both occasions; I had seen him about before - I am quite clear he is the man.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I received information, and went to the Cock public-house - I saw the prisoner there, and took him; I told him what he was charged with - he owned to being there at eleven o'clock, but denied being there afterwards; he told me he had written his address and given it to Mr. Connell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not in consequence of the direction he left in the house that you found his lodging? A. Yes - I did not find any thing there: I found on him three shillings, one halfpenny, and a duplicate of a handkerchief pawned in June - I took him on the same day, about twenty minutes before five o'clock; I had known him for twenty years - he has been in better circumstances, and had several hackney coaches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

            . I keep the Cock public-house, in Tothill-street. I have known the prisoner about three years - I remember the day he was taken, when the officer came and called him out; he had been at my house about one o'clock - he then left, and was away about two hours; he was in my house again about three o'clock, and remained there the whole of the time, for at least an hour - he comes to my house to drink a pint of porter, or to get jobs from me or some of my neighbours: after he came to my house at three o'clock I had occasion to go to my bed-room, and was there about ten minutes - I left him in the tap-room when I went away, and found him there when I came back; I consider he was nothing short of an hour in my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What reason have you for saying he came at three o'clock? A. From the time I took my dinner I think it was about three - I have a clock, and am often in the habit of looking at it; I had no particular reason for marking the hour: I do not know where the Cloisters are, but the Abbey is at the end of my street, I should think not short of two hundred yards from my house - I am not aware that he left my tap-room, from the time I came down from my bed-room till serjeant Paine took him out of my house, which I think was half-past four o'clock; I was in my bar, and occasionally went into the tap-room - I have no reason to think he went out, but I cannot swear he did not; there were other persons in the tap-room - I think I could walk to the Abbey in about eight minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he in your house at four o'clock? A. I should consider he was in my house at least an hour before I went up stairs, and he was taken about half-past four.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM DAY. Q. How were the men walking? A. Pretty fast, Sir - I did not see them long in Little Dean's-yard; only about a minute - that was about four o'clock, almost directly after I had seen them in the Cloisters; I think it was about four - I went home directly.</p>

            . I am a news-vender, and live in Burr-street, Commercial-road. The prisoner came to me three weeks or a month before he was apprehended, and asked if I was in the habit of taking in publications: I said Yes - he said, "Of whom?" I said, "Of no one in particular;" he then asked if I would take them of Mr. Plummer - I said I did not mind: he asked what orders I would give him - I said I took in the Mirror, the Casket, and five other books; he brought them to me on the Saturday following: I paid him 1 1/2d. for the Mirror, and 1/2d. a piece for the other books - I had also two of the Weekly Dispatch newspapers of him, for which I paid him 7 1/2d, which is the trade price - the selling price is 8 1/2d. I gave information of it when a girl came to me about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember what day it was? A. The girl came the day before he was taken; it was the 28th of November I bought the newspapers - I recollect the occurrence exactly; I had seen the prisoner by going to the newspaper offices in the morning.</p>

I did not miss any of these rails till they were produced; I knew them again, having put them up, to keep people from going down into the coal-cellar - I took the prisoner with them about a hundred yards from the place, before the officer came up; I suspected they were what I had put up, but was satisfied of it when I fitted them to the place - they had been taken the same night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you fixed them yourself? A. Yes - some others had been taken from the spot, and I put down two of these; I had seen them that morning - if any had then been gone I should have missed them; they run the whole length of the street, and the next morning I found the greater part of them were loose - a great many boys play about there.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM UNETT. I live in Hayes-place, Paddington, and am assistant to my brother, John Unett, of Edgware-road - he deals in earthenware, and sells Robins' patent Royal filter. The prisoner came to the shop apparently in a hurry, on the 27th of December, and wanted me to purchase a filter; I asked him the price; he said 6s. - I pointed to some we had for sale, and asked if they were of that sort - he said Yes; I asked where he got it - he said his father had bought it in a lot at a sale in Oxford-street; I desired him to call there next day - he went out and returned in five minutes, and said that 5s. would be the lowest price he would take; I had before asked him if 6s. was the lowest, and he said he thought his father would not take less - he came again twice on the Tuesday, and my brother told him to bring it at eleven o'clock on the Wednesday morning, and he would look at it - he came on the Wednesday, about two o'clock, and asked if he should bring the filter; I said Yes, and he brought it in a sack in a quarter of an hour - Mr. Stephens, who was waiting at a neighbour's opposite, came in and asked him how he got it; he again said his father had bought it at a sale in Oxford-street, and it was part of a lot - I think he mentioned china and glass; it is worth 25s.</p>

I was called, and found on the prisoner a gilt sixpence wrapped up in a bit of thin paper; I had before asked if she had any more, and she said not - I found several little bits of paper on her, similar to the one this half-sovereign is wrapped in; I took her to the Compter, and thinking she might have some more I got the matron to search her, and these four 5l. notes were found within her stays.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they good notes? A. Yes, and one good sovereign was found on her; I should think these papers are too thin for curl papers - these are good sixpences, gils.</p>

               <p>Brezack. Q. You say you heard the crack? A. Yes, I did, and I ran to the bottom of the warehouse and called the porter - when I came back, you were laying the glass down, and reaching to the "Forget me Not;" you ran off when you heard the door unlock, and got about twelve yards - when the porter took you, you said you would not be collared.</p>

I have three blankets and a pillow; I am not confident who pawned them, but I have seen Jones in our shop at different times - these are the duplicates given for the articles; the three blankets are in the name of Brown, and the pillow in the name of Richardson - they were pawned at different times.</p>
               <p>ELIZA TURNER. These articles are mine - the prisoners lived together, and had one bed.</p>
               <p>Stevens' Defence. Whatever fault I have committed, was through distress - I did not know the consequence of the law; I expected to receive some money on the 8th of this month, and it was my intention to send it to Mrs. Turner, and to go and beg her pardon: this is my sister-in-law - I have had her to support from a child: I was in distress.</p>

On Saturday night, the 12th of December, Williams was with me in the Edgware-road, between twelve and one o'clock; he had come for me from Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; I had left work at six o'clock, and received my wages about eight; I met Williams about a quarter-past twelve- I first saw the prisoner at the Caledonian Arms, Princes-street; I went in there after twelve o'clock, and found him there, with two more, one of whom is named Randall; I paid for a glass of gin and water - a woman had followed us in, and my friend handed her the glass: I took out my money to pay for the gin - I pulled out a sovereign instead of a shilling; I returned that to my pocket, and gave a shilling - Randall came, looked, and saw my money; I had received 30s., a sovereign, and the rest in silver; I and Williams left the house together; the woman followed us out - I got about two hundred yards, and saw the prisoner, Randall, and another following me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with the prisoner that night? A. They came and forced themselves into our company; I told them to keep to themselves - they came up to me in the street in a kind of jostle; they did not strike me, but knocked me down on my hands and knees; when I got up the prisoner put his left hand into my right-hand trousers pocket, and turned the contents out on the pavement - I caught hold of his hand as he turned it out, and never let go of him; he drew my watch with his other hand, and got it out of my fob: I kept hold of him, and caught hold of the watch - the Policeman and Williams came up and took him; I got 2s. 3d. off the ground - the 3d. was not mine; I saw a man pick the money up, and go away - Randall took up the money, and ran away; I lost the sovereign altogether - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060042"/>was not drunk; I had a little, but knew right from wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to tell the Jury, on your oath, that you were sober? A. No, I was not sober, nor was I drunk; I knew right from wrong- I live at No. 19, Princes-street, right opposite the Caledonian Arms, and my wife lives there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been conversing with the woman before you went into the Caledonian Arms? A. She had followed us all the way; I did not take her there - I said, "I live here, and you had better go home;" she said, "Mr. Cross lives here, I know the place well," and followed us in - I did not give her drink; Williams handed her the glass; I was not turned out of the house - the landlord said,"These gentlemen will go as soon as ever they have drank their glass of gin and water;" he did not desire us to leave, to my recollection, but I will not swear that - I did not go straight home; the woman asked us to see her home - I asked where she lived; she said, "In this street;" I said, "I think not;" she said Yes - I said, "It is a fine morning, and we will go a little way and see;" I do not know whether she was a prostitute - Randall was by at the time my money was taken; I have seen him since - I saw him on Sunday night, but not since - I have had no money from him; it was not in my power to take him - the prisoner's friends sent for me to the public-house - his wife's mother came; I told the officer the prisoner had pulled my watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass by your own door with the woman? A. No; my door is on the opposite side - it was after one o'clock when I left the public-house; Williams stopped at the end of Princes-street, and said he would go home - he left me with the woman; I went fifteen or sixteen yards further with her - I had left her when I was attacked; she was stopping six or seven yards off - we did not walk arm-in-arm; she came, put her hand on my shoulder, and caught hold of my arm two or three times, but never had hold of it - the prisoner and his friends began talking with the woman in the public-house - she went away after the Policeman came up; she had not been walking on the side that my money was - she was always on the other side.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She did not go away before it happened? A. No - she was in Swinburn's company before we went into the public-house, and remained till after this happened, to the best of my belief; I had been with the prosecutor about an hour before we went to the Caledonian Arms - he was drunk; he met the woman in the Edgware-road; they conversed together, the same as two or three might meet together on the road - he did not invite her into the house, nor offer to treat her; she did not ask him for drink - she had part of what we had; I suppose she was a street-walker - I heard him recommend her to go home; he did not cross over to go home - I was not watching to see what he would do with the woman; I do not believe they were arm-in-arm together - she was sometimes on one side of him, and sometimes on the other - the trees are in the road; it is a dark place - I came up after the alarm; the woman was behind him, but not close to him - she was as far from him as I am from you; he was not very drunk - the officer did not refuse to take the charge; what I said to the officer was before he came up- if the gas was put out at the public-house, it was after we came out; the landlord did not turn us out, he told us to go out.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was near the spot - Williams came up between two and three o'clock in the morning, and said he expected a friend of his would be robbed at North-bank; we went to the spot, and found the prisoner, prosecutor, Randall, and a woman; just before I got to the spot, I saw Randall raise himself from the ground, and run away - the woman stood a short distance from the prosecutor; when I arrived the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him and drawing his watch - the prisoner replied, "You may search me, I have nothing;" I found only 3d. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the woman afterwards run away? A. No, she walked away - the prosecutor was not very drunk.</p>

            . I live at Twickenham. I was sent to Mrs. Steers in September last; she lodged at Mrs. Feaney's - one day there was high words between me and mistress about a pennyworth of wood; it is three months ago or more - I do not know the month; it was about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - a brick was chucked in at the window three times; I did not see by whom the first was thrown - the prisoner threw the second, and he was on the tiles; the brick was chucked on the landing-place, and I believe little bits of the mortar came into the room where I and mistress were - after that Mrs. Feaney closed the landing window; mistress was sitting.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060043"/>by the fire-side - she had the rheumatism in her knee, and was eighty-one years old; only a little mortar came into the room - I did not perceive that she was alarmed; I was very much frightened when the first was thrown in, but mistress did not seem frightened - I afterwards sat down to work by the window; in about a quarter of an hour somebody came up with a sheet over his head; he came to the room door with a kind of stick in his hand, but I did not see it; he had something under the sheet pointing towards mistress and me - he did not stay there many minutes; he never entered the room, only stood outside the door, which was open - he went away without saying or doing any thing; it went away - some time after that the prisoner brought a chopper across his shoulder, and said he had found it behind the water-butt - he supposed it was to break the door open to cut her head off; he did not say he was going to do it - he did not go near her with it; he went out in a few minutes without saying any thing more - he came up again in a quarter of an hour, and said somebody had taken his hat away; he had not got the chopper then - mistress then said, "Gillett, you should not lose that if I had money to buy you another;" mistress sent me out for a quartern of gin among five of us - I cannot say whether I left him in the room, for I was so frightened at the person in the sheet; the old lady joked afterwards about it, and did not seem frightened - the prisoner asked her what was the matter; she told him somebody had come to frighten her - when somebody came on the landing-place in the sheet, she said to me,"Martha, what is that?"</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between her and the prisoner about a person coming up with a pistol? A. Not in my hearing; I was so frightened I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened on the 11th of December, when before the Coroner? A. Yes; she had died that morning, which was three months after this happened; somebody held something up like a sword-stick under the sheet, and it made a snapping noise; mistress said it was a pistol - I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe after this was over about the sheet, the prisoner sat down and took some gin with your mistress? A. Yes; we were all on good terms; she never brought up about the sheet afterwards - she was joking, and in as good humour as ever she was; she had been confined to her room twelve months; no medical man attended her before she died - her spirits were as usual, after this happened; she moved from the fire-place to the window with a stick -I attended her till she died, and did not observe her in more pain after this, than before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. From whom did you receive the prisoner into your service? A. Both my brothers gave him an excellent character; he was nearly four months with me - he rather hesitated at producing the money, before I told him I had missed 2s. the day before - I have another shop, and left this in his care; I do not sleep there, and do not know what money is taken till my wife brings it home to me - I have paid him about 3l. for wages.</p>
               <p>Q. If he wanted 2s. 6d. for a half-crown, he could get it from the till? A. Yes; I had marked 17s., and sent it the next day by Woodgate, but that all came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Woodgate told by the Magistrate, that his conduct at the office was disgraceful and he should not take his oath? A. Yes, he was; I do not know that he was turned out of the office; my brother Daniel became responsible for the prisoner's appearance here - he was in custody two nights, I think - he is not quite sixteen years old - I only employed Woodgate to lay out money on two occasions; if he went oftener it was without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had some doubt whether the 2s. 6d. was a mistake, and tried again? A. Yes; he had the care of the till; he would not do wrong by taking change out of the till.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 28th of December, at six o'clock in the evening, I took 1l. 6s. 6d. out of the till; there were five half-crowns, and the rest in shillings - I brought it home, and put it on the table, in the presence of my husband and Woodgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The course of business was for you to go at night to take the contents of the till? A. Yes; the prisoner managed the business there; he was taken up the next night - 13s. of the marked money came home; Woodgate had gone to the shop about three o'clock; if he had given change from the till, or taken change from it for himself, he would not be doing wrong<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060044"/>- he had the very best of characters; there was some little dispute at the office, about Woodgate's deposition -I believe the Magistrate said he was not to be believed.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. There were five half crowns among the money, how many of them were marked? A. Two; there were several shillings not marked - there was not one sixpence in the till.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. On the 28th of December I received from Gunston, two half-crowns, ten shillings, and a sixpence, marked; I went to the shop, No. 43, Brick-lane, and purchased goods of the prisoner, which came to 15s. 3 1/2d,; I paid him all the same money which I had received from Gunston; it was about three o'clock: I was present on the evening of the next day, and said to the prisoner, "If you are an innocent lad, show what you have got about you;" he pulled out 12s., and said,"I am a foolish fellow;" I cannot tell what he meant - I recognized two shillings as the money I had paid him, and the sixpence was found afterwards in the till; Gunston thought the boy might have paid it away at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether he meant that he had changed from the till, or robbed it, you cannot tell? A. No; I do not remember asking him how he came to touch the money in the till - I will not swear I did not; I do not recollect telling the Magistrate he had confessed it, but I will swear nothing about it - he did not refuse to take my oath - he left the case to be indicted at the Session; I did not go to the shop more than once; I took a man, named Davis, to the shop - he laid out 8s.; that was all found in the till - I know nothing about the 17s. - I heard it was sent, and the 17s. were shown to me next day; I saw ten shillings given to Davis - he brought two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Gunston has swore he only tried this twice; once with 15s. 6d., and then 17s.; you saw him give 8s. to Davis? A. No; the money came out of my hands - I got it from Gunston.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the sum you gave Davis? A. I think it was 10s.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now, was there not a sum of 5s.? A. Yes; that came back right - I gave that to a boy in the neighbourhood; I got it from Gunston.</p>

               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Do you know that the 8s. and 5s. went to the prisoner? A. Yes; I saw the <rs id="t18310106-89-deflabel511" type="occupation">boy</rs>

This person came to our shop, No. 22, Goswell-street, last Monday; Mr. Gibson is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060047"/>my master - I was busy at the time - he looked up and down the door, at last came in, and asked Mr. Gibson if Tooley lived there - he said he did not know a person of that name; he said, "How do you do, Mr. Gibson?" they talked, and he said it was concerning pickpockets; Gibson said he did not know such a name, and I said I did not know such a name - I was busy; he said, "There is higher up;" he came the same name?" I said, "There is higher up;" he came back again - I spoke to him at the door, and said, "It is of no use your looking about, perhaps you want Toole?" he said, "Well, it is something like that;" I said, "Well, perhaps I can inform you something about it;" I told him the circumstance, and said, "A young fellow, named Day, knows all about it; and presently, I dare say, he will be here;" Groves' mother was with the witness - Day came up; I said, "What is it?" he said, "I am a friend of his, and wish to see a little about it;" Day came up, we began to talk together, and he said, "Now, I don't see how the case stands in different points of law, and I know a good deal about law; I don't know how this can be managed" - I stood listening while he said this to Day, he not knowing that I was the other person - he said, "Let me see, I had a case once before at Clerkenwell and the Old Bailey in this manner, and could not you, as a single young man, shift your lodging a little while?" Day said,"I don't know, they will find me out wherever I go;" he said, "I don't know how you can manage it exactly; who is the other person?" Day said he did not know - he said,"Could not you find him?" he said, "I will tell you, if we were to take and keep this witness out of the way, one would not do, you might get over it that way, and say you went to take refreshment for a short time, and swear you were there at the same time;" he said he was at Clerkenwell once, and was not there, and shifted his lodgings and evaded it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him you did not know about the matter? A. I told him I did not know it myself, but Day could tell him about it - I said so, because I saw he was busy, and he pointed out the different ways to avoid it- he said he knew the several points, and we could do it; that he knew a good deal about finding true bills and so on.</p>
               <p>PEDDER DAY. I was coming by the shop, and saw this man and a woman talking to Toole - Toole came after me and said, "Here is a man and woman come after about those two boys;" this gentleman said, "Your name is Day;" I said Yes - he said, "I am come concerning these boys; I want to see into it abit - I want to know about it;" I said,"Are you the father, or a relation?" he said, "No, I only want to see into it;" I was going from my work to tea, and had to return in half an hour - I said I could not stop; he said, "It is a very curious matter; I have been down to Newgate, I have seen the governor's books, and there is no prosecutor, no gentleman to appear" - I said, "I do not know that there is;" I did not see the gentleman at Bow-street - he wanted to know who was the other witness- I said "I cannot give you information now, I must go to tea;" he kept me talking - he said, "Respecting the bill of indictment, when do you go to get it out?" I said,"I am summoned on Thursday, the 6th of January;" he said, "They have begun at Hicks-hall, I thought you had to go there?" I said, "No, I have to attend on Thursday;" he said, "Can I see the other young man?" I said,"No, I cannot tell you now;" he said, "May be I shall see him on Thursday - what time are you to meet him?" I said, "About three o'clock in the afternoon;" he said."I will be there, and you can show him to me - I will talk to him about it, and if one witness gets out of the way, there will he nothing done in it," for he had done so once at Hicks'-hall; I said, "I can do no such thing, I am bound in 40l. to appear;" he said, "You are a single young man, cannot you shift your lodging for two or three days?" I said, "If it is two or three years, they will come after me for my recognizances;" he said, "I was summoned once to Hicks'-hall, and got out of the way, and when called, I did not answer - I shifted my lodgings, and did not hear any more after it."</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOOLE. He asked the witness what time he was to be there on Thursday - he said "There o'clock;" he said, "Now, do you think you shall know me again - you see me now?" Day said, "Yes, I shall know you again;" he said, "Well, you look for me, point the man out to me, and there is no prosecutor, if a witness is out of the way it can be settled, and I think if you say the same before the Grand Jury as you have told me this evening, I don't see what can be done - they will certainly be transported - it is as clear as that lamp, that is neither oil nor sperm - it is gas;" he took a brush out of my hand, and said, "It is like taking that, and giving it to you."</p>

               <p>Q. I will not take your recollection - on your oath, did you or not suggest to one or both of them, that one or other of them should get out of the way? A. I have no possible recollection of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You know one way or other, I ask did you or not? A. If I said I did I should speak against the conviction of my mind, and if I said I did not, I believe I should be speaking the truth.</p>

On the 15th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw him take the carcase of a sheep and a side of veal, out of the shop, on his shoulder; I was standing at the door - he passed me with them: I did not speak to him - it struck me he had stolen the sheep, as I thought it had not been sold; I followed him - he went up the market, and put it on the cart of a Mr. Staples, who was known to me; I said, "What are you going to do with that sheep?" he seemed confused, and said a man had given him 3d. to take it to Gravel-lane, Ratcliff-highway; Staples lives in Cable-street, which is in that direction - he did not further describe where he was to take it to; he said if I would allow him to go he would find the man - I said, "Well, I'll go with you;" he said he could only find him if he went alone - I gave him into custody; the side of veal belonged to Staples.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live at No. 66, Rosemary-lane. On one Sunday morning, I think six or seven weeks before the 29th of December, I was standing at my shop door, and saw Vinson with another man, but I could not swear the other was Andrews, though to the best of my belief, he is the man; they came into my shop and purchased two suits of clothes, a jacket, a linen shirt, and a pair of stockings, which came to about 7l. - Vinson went over his fob pocket, and pulled out a note, and gave it to the shopman Solomon Solomon, who is here - he gave it to me; I asked Vinson to put his name and place of abode on it - I saw him write upon it, but I can neither read nor write - I had not change about me; I went out and got change of Mr. Ruffell, he gave me change; when I had given change they went away; I afterwards saw Vinson in custody at the Police-office - I observed his trousers which he then had on, and I knew them by a mark that I had put on the fob, as I always do in trousers; I knew them to be the same I had sold - I have a strong belief that Andrews was the other man, but I would not swear it; he had a jacket on when he came in with the other prisoner - I heard him talk then, and heard him speak at the Police-office; I believed him to be the same man, and I believe so still - he appeared about the same height.</p>
               <p>Vinson. There are two letters of his name on the things. Witness - It is not proper writing, it is a mark that I have learned to make, to know my things again when they are given out to be repaird.</p>

I was at Bath on the 29th of October, and sent a brown paper parcel, containing three sovereigns, 20s. in silver, a shirt, flannel waiscoat, handkerchiefs, and some other things, from the York House coach-office, Bath; I have the entry in the book - it was directed to my wife, at my house in Finch-street, London - it was to arrive at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What sort of paper was it in? A. The usual brown paper; I remember the direction - it was fair and legible; it was, "Mrs. Levy, No.8, Finch-street, Old Montague-street, Brick-lane, London;" the ink might have run - it was on brown paper; I am almost certain I wrote, "Carriage paid"- I generally pay the carriage of parcels and letters too; I think I never stated I was sure the ink had not run, but to the best of my knowledge it had not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What parcel was it? A. In brown paper; the direction was not clear - the ink had run upon the paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it distinct enough for you to tell the porter where to go? A. No, my Lord, it was not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Samuel say there was a parcel for her? A. He said there was a parcel for Mrs. Levy; he did not say for her - the direction was in a bad state; the ink had run - there was No. 8, upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what part had the ink run? A. We could not make out whether it was Finch-street, or Princes-street - Mrs. Levy was distinct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure it was not Lazarus Levy? A. Yes; she said, "All my parcels are carriage paid;" I said it was so, but there was 8d. to pay for the porterage - she offered to take me to her house and pay me, but she borrowed the money of Samuel; I did not summon her before the Magistrate - I do not know how she came there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the state in which the direction was? A. No, I did not see the direction - whether the parcel I afterwards saw in her hand was the same I cannot say - it was a brown paper parcel; I believe she is a bonnet-maker - I know her sister; I have known her ever since her father died - I know nothing against her.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. The prisoner was given into my charge about the 13th of December - she denied taking the parcel; I am sure of that - she said she had not taken the parcel, that her sister had settled with the bail, and the person who had given her in charge, had better mind what she was about - I asked if she had seen the bail; she said No, and asked if I would go with her to her sister - I said No, but I supposed the person who gave her in charge would - she said she did, and they brought the prisoner down to the watch-house, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Was that about the bail? A. Yes, she was out on bail - I was not there at the time she gave bail; I was there when she was committed - the Magistrate offered to bail her, if she had bail.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and live in Lower Rutland-street, Bedford-square, Commercial-road. The prisoner has a brother and a sister in the country - they were at Bath in October; when my sister was married she found her husband was severe, and she and I made an agreement that she would assist the prisoner, but I was never to suffer any of her husband's family to know it, as he would have used her ill if he had known it - I know parcels were sent to the prisoner, and I have seen them - she is single, a cripple, and an orphan.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is your brother and sister now? A. I do not know - the last time I heard from my sister she gave me a hint that she had sent the prisoner something, and I know they had some thoughts of going to Scotland; she did not know when I should hear from her again - I know they were at Bath in October, as I received a letter from my sister at my own house; I wish I had preserved that letter - it was dated from an inn; they had no settled place of residence - I had but that one letter from Bath; I cannot tell when I had a letter before, or where from - they are always travelling with pencils and pens; my sister said in that letter."I hope my dear sister Leah will do well;" that was the hint agreed upon between us when she meant to send her any thing - she used to send her caps and millinery, which they sell cheaper in the country than they do in London; they have been married better than twelve months - they have no children.</p>

               <p>LAZARUS LEVV re-examined. There was a letter in the parcel addressed to my wife, signed by me; and some sweetmeats for the children; I put the number distinctly on the parcel, and the day of the month also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it so clear a direction that no one could mistake it? A. It appeared so to me; I carried it under my arm - whether I rubbed it or not I cannot say,</p>

            . My father Stephen keeps a broker's shop. On the Wednesday morning in question, I had put out the fire-irons on the door-post - my wife came into the yard, and said two sets of fire-irons had been stolen from the door; I went out, but did not see any one till I got to Chapel-street, about three hundred yards from my father's - I there saw Lazarus, Townsend, and Higley; they were running when I first saw them - I did not see any thing with them; I took hold of Lazarus and Townsend, and told them to stop - Bocken came up, and I ran after Higley and took him; when I got home I missed the fire-irons - I saw one set of them at the Spitalfields station-house afterwards; I had seen John Warner three days before, lurking about the place, and I think I had seen him that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you saw three persons? A. Yes; Higley was taken about two hundred yards from there - I had not lost sight of him- I think Bocken was two yards after me; I had known Higley previous - I did not think he was the man, and I let him go; he said, "Let me go, or else I will make you;" I supposed he was going to show fight, and I did not think he was the person who did it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You gave in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060052"/>formation as fast as you could? A. Yes; I saw Mr. Hendry run out instantly, and pursued the persons; they were just in view before me - there were only two; I am quite sure there were not three; they were in Chapman-street, and they ran round Ann-street - there was nobody else in the street; Hendry ran after the two men, and I saw them running plainly before him, with the fire-irons in their hands - I am sure they had each of them a pair in their hands; it was broad day-light as it is now - any one could see the fire-irons in their hands; Hendry could not be off seeing them - Lazarus was in the shop afterwards, but I did not see him brought in.</p>

The prisoner has come to the house for four or five years, with shavings, and on the 17th of December, she came between two and three o'clock; she usually takes her sack down, empties it, and comes up through the passage where we keep the flour; the sack looked bulky when she came up, and I asked what was in it - she said Nothing; I insisted upon looking - she refused for some time; I took it from her by force, and found in it a child's frock 
made up into a bag, and about 19 lbs. of flour in it.</p>


               <p>EDWARD PALMER. I was at home - the flour was mine, to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I am errand-boy to Messrs. Brogden and Garland: it is my duty to take the workmen's cans every night at eight o'clock, and place them in the iron chest. On the 30th of December I collected them - the prisoner and Goodfellow worked in the lower shop; when I took Goodfellow's can I observed the prisoner's can was not locked, and I did not take that - I took up the cans and a drawer of leaden patterns; when I got up stairs, near the place where I was to deposit the cans, I saw the prisoner - he said to me, "Let me take some of the cans, or else you will let them fall;" I do not know how many I had, but I had carried them up stairs safely - I could have carried them to the safe; the prisoner was not in the habit of assisting me - Goodfellow's can was one of those which the prisoner took from me, to put on the drawer-bench, near the safety-chest; he took them from under my arm - I had no objection; I put the drawer into the counting-house, and then went down - I afterwards saw the prisoner at his bench, where I had seen his can unlocked - his can was not there, and I asked him if it was gone up; I had not met any one going up as I came down - I took up the other cans, but I did not lock the safe; Mr. Hamson gave me the key that night - I opened the safe the next morning with that key; I took out fourteen of the workmen's cans, and one large one containing silver - I delivered the fourteen cans to the workmen; I knew by the numbers who they belonged to - Goodfellow's can, which was No. 15, and the prisoner's, which was No. 22, were not, in the chest that morning; I asked the prisoner if he had got his can, and he said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' employ? A. Four or five months: about twenty men where in the prosecutors' employ - I cannot tell how many remained that night; I left at half-past eight o'clock - when I took Goodfellow's can I did not look into Green's can; Green was not there - I do not know how many cans I had; my arms were full - they were placed near the safety-chest; I do not know who put them in - I went out almost directly to a public-house in Bridgwater-gardens; it took me about five minutes to go there and back, but it was before I went that the prisoner said his box had been taken up stairs - I had gone to Mr. Hamson's counting-house, put the drawer in, then came down, and saw the prisoner in the lower shop; I asked him if his can was gone up, and he said Yes - I did not count the cans before they were put into the safe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you leave the cans? A. On a board outside the counting-house - I had gone round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060056"/>and had ultimately taken all the cans but Green's; the prisoner had gone below when I went into the counting-house to put the leaden drawer there, and when I went down found him below in the lower shop, in which he was in the habit of working - I do not know what he was doing; he was at his board.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutors - I worked at the same bench with the prisoner. On the 30th of December I locked up my can at half-past five o'clock in the evening - the usual time to leave is eight o'clock, but I left at half-past five o'clock; and if a man leaves earlier it is an invariable rule to leave his box locked up - I left about 18 dwts. of gold in my can; I do not know what would be the value of it - I also left some filings in it, and when it was discovered, the filings were in it; I went to the shop the next day, about ten o'clock, and my can, which was No. 15, was not before my place as usual - I saw Mr. Presant find it in the dust-hole, near the privy; Presant had gone there before me, but I saw them taken from the dust-hole - on the discovery of one, the other was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you worked there? A. Upwards of six years - I have worked over-hours, but not on that night; I had been working on some split rings, and finished them - I had some wire and flatted gold in my can- the padlocks on the cans are all different; my can has three small cans in it - we are not in the habit of showing each other our cans when we lock them; our masters rely upon us for what we put into them - I had finished what I was about, and had no work to go on with; I had not applied for more work for that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is not the gold weighed to you, and are you not called to account for every grain of it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Brogden and Co. - I was searching for the cans, which were supposed to be lost; I directed my eyes towards the dust-bin, and there I saw a tin-can - I did not stop a moment, but returned to Mr. Garland in the back counting-house, and wished him to go with me to see it - we went, but I did not touch the cans; the whole of the gentlemen, who were assembled, then went with us to the dust-bin, and I pulled out the cans, one by one, with a small iron rod, till the whole of them, with their locks and their contents as they are here, were taken out; I then gave them to Mr. Brogden.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Were these little cases out of the cans? A. Yes, some of them were; there were all the fittings of these two cans.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see these cans opened in the presence of Mr. Brogden and the other person? A. Yes- I do not know what gold was deficient - I do not give it out; there was only limmel or filings in Goodfellow's can, they are worth 2l. or 3l.; in Green's can there was about two ounces of gold, wrought and unwrought, worth about 6l. - it is two rings and some flatted pieces of wire; I am what is called a cheque-clerk - I have the prisoner's gold book here, in his own hand-writing; on that Thursday night, the total weight of the gold he had was 7 oz. 17 dwt. 17 gr., some wrought and some unwrought, I should think, but I do not know; I found 2 ozs. remaining in the can - the value of the gold missing from his can would be about 14l., and the value of what was missing from Goodfellow's would be about 2l. 15s.; the whole value of what was missing would be about 16l. 15s., which would go in a very small compass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the rings and flatted pieces in a state in which they would be delivered to the workmen? A. Yes - they are what is called metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found some pieces of flatted gold in Green's can, which had not been taken away? A. Yes - that is in a form in which it is delivered to the workmen; I do not know whether Green had delivered any work that day - the book does not show any.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is that book kept wholly in the prisoner's hand-writing? A. No, the prisoner's, Mr. Hamson's, and mine; if the prisoner had delivered any work he would make the entry himself, and he has not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. BROGDEN. Q. Was any gold sent to the hall to be stamped that day? A. No gold is ever sent there unless it is in so clear and distinct a form as to bear a name - unless it does, and is so described, it is not received; that must be after the workman has delivered it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would it not have been the duty of the prisoner if he had manufactured any article, to have entered it as so manufactured? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It would in no case be the duty of any of your workmen to send goods to the hall? A. No - the article must have our mark upon it, which we keep in our counting-house; we sometimes allow a clerk to stamp it, but the mark never goes from our presence.</p>

On Thursday night, the 30th of December, I locked the safe at half-past eight o'clock - the key is kept in my counting-house till I lock the desk, and then it is sent to my employer's counting-house; I take the key of my counting-house home with me - I went the next morning, about nine o'clock; I opened my counting-house with the key which I had taken home with me - I found all as I had left it; I then opened the chest, and found, only fourteen boxes - I did not particularly count them, but when two were missed - I put the rest into the chest, and there were but fourteen - there are places for them, and we could not put one more or less without knowing it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you put them in the night before? A. Most likely not, but when the clock strikes eight, I send the boy down to get them - there is another boy, but I did not see him that evening; I do not know who put them in - I saw the prisoner on the Thursday evening; he came to me for some gold, and said he should be excluded from a club from which his wife would receive 30l., if he could not pay 10s. 6d. - I lent him the money; I think it was a quarter or twenty minutes before eight that he first came - I said I had not the sort of gold he wanted, and he came a second time and said an inferior sort would do; I gave him that - I think that was at the time the boy was bringing the cans up; he came to his work as usual the following day - he wanted the gold for a very valuable locket which was wanted in a hurry, and he worked over-hours to do it; I was the proper person for him to apply to; and the boy passed him with the cans.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the cans, or count them that night? A. No; I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRESANT re-examined. Q. What led you to the dust-hole? A. Mr. Garland told me to look; I was looking cursorily about, and the dust-hole came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060057"/>view I returned, got Mr. Garland, we returned, and I got the whole of the gentlemen, and that third time I got the iron.</p>

            . I am an errand-boy to the prosecutors. On Thursday night, the 30th of December, I put some of the cans of the upper shop into the chest, but none of the lower shop - I put in five or six I should think; I saw all the cans that were in it that night before it was locked up; I did not count them but I know there were two rows, six in a row, and two over, which would make fourteen - I noticed that particularly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual to count them? A. No; sometimes some of the gentlemen have their cans out and work over-time.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN BROGDEN re-examined. On the following morning I called together the different persons in our employ; whilst they were there Presant made his communication: I was either present when the cans were found, or they were brought to me - I was on the spot - these are the cans; they are now in the state in which they were found; I had previously taken down the names of those who had worked over-hours in the lower shop - I have the list here - (reads) "Green, Moore, Smith, and Stewart;" and those in the upper shop, were "Chamberlain, Palin, Hawkins, Salmon, Sambrook, Presant, a brother of the witness, and Baylis" - I then asked them whether any of them had been down the night before to the privy, but I had previously asked them what time they left, and they all left within ten minutes of each other, about ten o'clock- there was much confusion previous to the finding of the boxes and when they were found, the four men in the lower shop, and Green amongst the rest, said the question is limited now, it is among us, nearly all speaking together, or all acceeding to it - I could not say who spoke first, but that Green was one, is quite clear - they said "It is now in a narrow compass, it is one of us four;" I then said I would take their answer separately, as to who had been down to the privy, and told them to be very circumspect in their answer - I suppose I asked Green first, as his name is down first on the paper, and his answer was, "I did not" - I then asked a second man, and I remember his answer was, "I did not leave my stool;" another said, "I did not leave the shop during the two hours" - there was then only one to be asked, and with surprise I heard him declare, he had not left the shop; I had scarcely said, "This is very mysterious, the boxes could not go by themselves," when Stewart, one of the four, said "With great grief, I state this fact Mr. Green, you did go down" - he said it two or three times, upon which the prisoner with rather violent gestures, lifted up his hands, and said, "Oh! oh! how can you say so Mr. Stewart, I never did go down at all during last night" - Mr. Smith, another of the four, then said, "Oh, yes Mr. Green, you did go down, I also saw you go down" - the prisoner then hesitated, and said, rather sullenly, as it struck me, "Well, I did go down;" I then looked to Moore, another of the our, and he said,"I do not know whether he did or not, as my back was towards him, I could not see" - I then said, "It is clear to my apprehension, that you are the thief," and I sent for the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had they all been present at the finding of the cans? A. I imagine they had, but perhaps not; I am quite clear Green said, when I first asked him, he had not been down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were four men in the lower shop? A. Yes, and seven in the upper; the dust-hole is at the extremity of the yard, from the bottom of the stairs; they all go down those stairs to go out, and pass through the dwelling-house, as the back gate was locked - they did not approach the dust-hole to go out; I think Green stated that he left with Moore.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the same staircase lead to the counting-house and the shop above? A. Yes - so that any person working in the lower shop must see a person go down from the upper shop, or up to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The counting-house is on a level with the upper shop? A. Yes; a person could go from there into the counting-house, without being seen by persons in the lower shop.</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor. I worked over-time that night, in the lower shop - Moore, Smith, and Green worked with me; the prisoner asked me to stop half an hour later that night, as he was going to stop, and wanted my advice about some work he had to do - I stopped, and went away about ten o'clock; I certainly saw the prisoner go down between nine and ten o'clock, two or three times; I am quite certain he went down twice - I certainly did not go down - I was present on the Friday, and heard the prisoner deny going down, but he afterwards acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go out of the workshop that night? A. I went up stairs about nine o'clock - I did not know of the cans being placed up there; I did not sit next to Green - I swear he went down twice, and am almost certain he went three times; had he gone but once I should not have noticed it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. In order for the men who were up stairs to get out that night, would it be necessary for them to come down the stairs into the lower shop? A. Yes, they must all use those stairs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the privy? A. About three yards from the foot of the stairs, and the dust-hole is, I think, about five yards from that - Green did not return up to his work while I was there; I came down, went through the dwelling-house, and went home - I did not go near the dust-hole.</p>

               <p>MR. BROGDEN re-examined. Q. How does the counting-house stand in the upper shop? A. There is a part partitioned off, which is called the counting-house - the iron chest stands in that; the place on which the cans were deposited is in the work-shop, close by the door of the counting-house - any person dealing with them must have been in view of the persons in the upper shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know a pugilist called Jack, the Painter? A. No; I have been called by that name, but am no pugilist - I never heard myself called by that name but once; that was by Joshua Hudson; I have been called so by a party belonging to this man, but I never answered to it - it is not my name; I was at the Tennis-court last, four or five years ago, or it might be three years - I will not swear I was not there six months ago; I saw Deaf Burke fight a battle once as I was coming through Hackney, about six months ago - I never fought a pitched battle with him; he knocked me down and I fought him - I do not know whether he is a fighting man; I never saw him before in my life - it was eight or nine years ago that I fought with him; we were both boys - it was at the Red House, at Battersea, that I fought him; there were about four people present when it began - it lasted an hour and a half; I do not know how many were there before it was over; it was not a pitched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060059"/>battle - no agreement had been made about it; I have not seen him since he fought at Hackney, and that is the last fight I saw - I have seen three or four fights at the Red House, at Battersea, as I lived there once; those are all the fights I have seen - I never heard of Mike, the Baker, and never challenged him to fight for a sovereign - I never challenged any body; I have fought at school - I was about eleven years old then; I have not fought since, except when Burke knocked me down - I am not a prizefighter, and never challenged the prisoner to fight for 100l. - I have not said that as soon as this was over I would fight him for 100l.; it is not likely, for he is a prize-fighter- I have played at hustle-cap, (producing his hat) - that is not played at with the lining out, that I know of; this blood in my hat was caused by putting a bird into it when I was out shooting with a gentleman - I believe my wife tore the lining out in a passion; I sometimes play with the lining out, and sometimes with it in - it is always played at with a lining at Abrahams', in Duke's-place, where I was robbed of my money; I never played at any other house -I was robbed of 185l. there; I brought an action for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you play at hustle-cap for large sums? A. Why, they betted me 60l. I never played there but three times - it is called Howard's coffee-house - I was robbed the two first times, and the third I was defrauded of my money - I had been playing at the George three successive days; I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at work at hustle-cap? A. I was not playing at hustle-cap at this house - I was tossing halfpence up in the air; the money I was robbed of was given me for a particular purpose - I was never charged with housebreaking; I know Goff and Hall - I was never in their custody; I was never charged with breaking into the the house of Thomas Powell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in that man's (Goff's) custody? A I do not know, if I say Yes, whether I tell the truth - I was not charged with housebreaking; I was never in custody for a burglary at the house of Thomas Powell - I never was in the custody of Hall or Goff; if I say I was, I tell a story; and if I say No, I tell a story.</p>

            . I am chief Magistrate of Bow-street. In November last, applications were made to me at the office, respecting the agricultural labourers, the destruction of machinery, and other illegal practices, such as extorting more wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any report as to their being in a state of insurrection? A. I cannot say the word "Insurrection" was used, but I deem the destruction of property insurrection; there were reports of the destruction of property by burning, and it was supposed to be by agricultural labourers - these reports were generally believed.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. Had any thing come before you officially respecting the agricultural labourers? A. None of them had been brought before me, because they were in other districts, Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire; but applications had been made to me to send men down there -I have no evidence of the agricultural labourers being in a state of insurrection.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a Magistrate of Middlesex and Hampshire; I was in Hampshire from the 11th to the 23rd of November; and during the last seven days of that time, nearly the whole of the agricultural labourers in my immediate neighbourhood were in a state of insurrection - they were pulling down houses and manufactories, and destroying thrashing-machines principally; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060060"/>were burnings, but none that I myself witnessed - there were fires seen from my neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. You saw no burnings? A. None; I saw a large mob myself - I saw them enter a blacksmith's shop and seize pledge hammers; I myself took a sledge hammer from the leader of the mob - they afterwards proceeded and destroyed machinery near my own house; the mob almost entirely consisted of agricultural labourers.</p>

               <p>Q. Between the 11th and 23rd of November, did you see any copies of the paper entitled the Prompter? A. Certainly not; I never heard of it till to-day - there were daily meetings of Magistrates, and communications were made to Government, but not by me - to my knowledge, in consequence of a meeting at Alsford, Mr.

             went up to town for the purpose of seeing the Secretary of State, and he met the Magistrates afterwards with the determination of the Government; that was about the 20th - the nature of his communication was, that there had been very serious outrages committed on his father's property - he went up on the subject; I was not present when he made the communication to the Secretary of State - I never heard of this publication in Hampshire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What number did the mob you saw consist of? A. That was not a very large mob, perhaps sixty or seventy persons - they rushed into the shop, and armed themselves with all the materials they could lay hold of; I was lame, and not able to go to where the large mobs were - the largest I saw consisted of, (I should think,) one hundred persons.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. That was the largest mob you saw? A. I do not think I personally saw a larger - they were dispersed with the assistance of the marines; no great destruction of machinery had then taken place - it is not a very populous neighbourhood; there were a great number of different mobs, taking different directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any means used to disperse the mob before they began to break the machines? A. Special constable were sworn in; some machines were broken the last Saturday I was there, which was the 20th; I can speak positively as to the 22nd, because they were close to my own house then - I took depositions, as a Magistrate, of their previous acts, on the Thursday and Friday, the 17th and 18th; I did not send a report of that to town - I was not in the Country in an official capacity.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no knowledge of these facts being publicly stated in London till the 25th? A. I know Mr. Baring came up on Friday night, the 19th.</p>
               <p>S - TWYFORD, ESQ. I am a Police Magistrate, and also a Magistrate of Sussex. I went down into Sussex on the 21st of November, in consequence of a letter from my brother, and from another quarter; I found the gentlemen in the neighbourhood in a state of great excitement, in consequence of mobs of labourers in different places, and I was met by a Magistrate of the County before I reached home, who invited me to his house, to consult on the state of the country - he told me he himself had been mobbed - that a mob collected to terrify him; no property had been destroyed about there - the only thrashing-machine in the part where I was Magistrate, had been openly destroyed in the town by the farmers, in consequence of threatening letters - there were reports that various parts of Sussex were in a state of excitement, called insurrection, and which it resembled; the labourers were assembled in great numbers: at that time the Duke of Richmond had met a large mob, and dispersed it, and two days after his thrashing-machines had been destroyed, in one day; it was understood they were destroyed by farming labourers; I met myself two mobs; and while I was at breakfast next morning we were all called out to attend to a mob of fifty or sixty agricultural labourers, among whom, Sir C. Taylor was surprised to see his own labourers - I heard of several fires while I was in Sussex; I was there three weeks - they were wilful fires; the parties have been tried since - it was reported that they were done by farmer's labourers.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. Of course you were in Sussex, on the 22nd of November, in the character of a Magistrate? A. Not in the character of a Sussex Magistrate - I went down to protect my own property; I did not sit officially - the mob assaulted me; I got rid of one mob, by refusing to sign a paper which they tendered to me - that mob consisted of about fifty; the paper was a request to raise wages to 12s. a week, for married and unmarried, and a gallon of flour for every child above two; those who were employed by the parish were not to be kept out of work so long as they had been, but to be employed immediately - I do not know the price of food in the neighbourhood; I do not reside there - that mob were not armed; the paper they presented professed to be a humble petition - no violence was used by them; I cannot state the average rate of wages in that neighbourhood - the labourers in my employ are wood-cutters, they are paid by the work; I do not think the mob of fifty used improper language - this is the first day I ever heard of "the Prompter;" I have no complaint of the effects of that paper - I was three weeks either at Medhurst or Petworth, swearing in special constables, in conjunction with my brother Magistrates; I saw one mob of about one hundred and forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any illegal act committed by that mob? A. I state the fact, it is illegal if circumstances are allowed to belong to it - about one hundred and forty labouring parishoners, who came a distance of six miles, and brought the farmers of the parish, as they told me, prisoners. I was then on my way to Petworth, and they told me they had brought the farmers prisoners, to ascertain from Mr. Pointz's steward, what reduction of rent he meant to make; Mr. Pointz is a gentleman of large landed property - the steward was in the midst of this mob; I cannot say on what date this was - I would not swear it was before the 25th of November.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you the Chairman of the Quarter Session at Medhurst, at the time they were swearing in special constables? A. There was no Session then. I am the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions - I have just now returned from them, and have tried all the prisoners engaged in the riots below Chichester - there have been fifteen convicted for riots; eleven men were tried on one indictment, that was for acts arising out of the 17th to the 18th of November, assembling in large quantities and breaking machines in the night time - I tried several cases of riot.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060061"/>His Majesty's proclamation of the 23rd of November, 1830, relative to illegal demands for increase of wages, the destruction of property, &amp;c., in various parts of the Kingdom, offering a reward of 50l. on the conviction of persons guilty of the said offences, and 500l. upon the conviction of incendiaries, &amp;c., was here put in and read: also the following paragraphs from the Prompter, charged as libels.</p>
               <p>No. 1."- a Constitutional Monarchy is a most ridiculous state of government, more than mimicking absolute monarchy, and perpetsating all ancient follies and abuses. Every thing conspires against a king to tell him that he is something more than man; and all that sort of flattery is calculated to unman him, and to make him less than man. We want no mummeries and nonsense, wherewith to please savages and fools, in the present day."</p>
               <p>No. 2." To the Insurgent Agricultural Labourers, - You are much to be admired for everything you are known to have done during the last month; for, as yet, there is no evidence before the public that you are incendiaries, or even political rebels. Much as every thoughtful man must lament the waste of property, much as the country must suffer by the burnings of farm produce now going on, were you proved to be the incendiaries, we should defend you by saying, that you have more just and moral cause for it than any king or faction, that ever made war, had for making war. In war, all destructions of property are counted lawful, upon the ground of that which is called the law of nations; yours is a state of warfare, and your ground of quarrel is the want of the necessaries of life in the midst of an abundance. You see boards of food, and you are starving; you see a government rioting in every sort of luxury and wasteful expenditure; and you, ever ready to labour, cannot find one of the comforts of life - neither your silence nor your patience has obtained for you the least respectful attention from that government. The more tame you have grown, the more you have been oppressed and despised, the more you have been trampled on; and it is only now, that you begin to display your physical as well as your moral strength, that your cruel tyrants treat with you and offer terms of pacification; your demands have been, so far, moderate and just; and any attempt to stifle them, by the threatened severity of the New Administration, will be so wicked as to justify your resistance even to death, and to life for life.</p>
               <p>No. 3."Mr. Carlile justified the conduct of the agricultural labourers of the disturbed Counties, and alluding to Earl Grey's threatened severity, he trusted, that, if an effort were made to put down the just discontent of those starving labourers by any other means than that of redressing their grievances, they might be able to rise in their congregated strength, and put down the Earl."</p>
               <p>The defendant, in his Defence, admitted the publication - and at very considerable length endeavoared to justify the at - and contended that the matter was not libelous.</p>

The prisoner was in the habit of bringing beer and fetching pots from our kitchen, and did so up to the Monday before the 6th of January - I missed two silver spoons from the housekeeper's cupboard, about a fortnight before that - they belonged to my master, and were worth 12s. - the prisoner had been in the kitchen in the course of the afternoon when they were missed; I had seen them safe on the 18th of December, and missed them on the 19th - he had been in the kitchen on each of these days - here are two pieces of silver, which I believe are part of the spoons; they were the same as the housekeeper's; we had six of them, and there are only four now - I have brought one of them; these pieces seem to correspond with it - they all six corresponded with each other, and the four which remain are of the same pattern with these pieces.</p>

            . I am a working-jeweller, and live in Davies-street, Berkley-square. On the 20th of December the prisoner came to our shop, and offered two spoons for sale, one broken in two pieces, and the other doubled up - I asked how he had got them; he said they were his own, and his mother had left them to him - he said he had broken them up for his own pleasure, and that he lived at the Bricklayer's Arms, Grosvenor-mews- I went there instantly; I was stating the circumstance to his mistress, and he came in and repeated the same story, that his mother had left them to him, and that he had two dozen more in his box; I felt satisfied, and said that when he came round I would give him the money for them - he came, and I said they came to 6s. 1d.; they were not so valuable as if they had not been broken - he refused to take the money, but took a pin which I had for 8s. 6d.; these two pieces are part of the one which was broken - the other I worked up; this is the spoon the witness has brought, and I have no doubt those I bought formed a part of the same set - there were the initials H. M. W. on them, and it was that excited my suspicion.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are there any marks on these pieces? A. No - I used up the pieces which had the marks, and had they applied a day later I should have used these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said the pin I had was 8s. 6d., and it was but 7s.6d.? A. Yes, it was 8s. 6d., and you gave me 2s. 6d. - I gave you 1d. and said I would allow you 6s. 1d., which was more than I should if you had taken the money; I swear the pin was marked 8s. 6d. - I produced the ticket of it before the Magistrate.</p>

I am in the habit of taking ale and beer to that gentleman's house, and one evening I saw something opposite the door, shining - it proved to be a gold brooch; I took it home - I said I supposed it belonged to some of the servants; I took it to the house, and one of the servants said it was his - he gave me 5s., and said he would give me a good Christmas-box; I went there on boxing-day, and before I had said a word he said, "I suppose you are come for your Christmas-box?" I said, "No, I don't think it right to ask for one;" he then said he would not give me one - I thought it odd; I went one morning, and saw a great number of spoons, six or seven dozens, and the footman's clothes there; I took the two worst spoons I could find, broke them up, and sold them to this gentleman - he allowed me 5s. 1d., but instead of taking the money I gave him 2s. 6d, which made 7s. 7d., for the brooch, and was the full value of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you advertise to dispose of the house and furniture? A. About three weeks previous to this agreement; the prisoner had applied to Mr. Hughes, a professional gentleman, to whom he was to refer - Mr. Hughes had not authority to treat for the premises; he sent him to me, and I saw him about the second day after the advertisement - he came to live in the house on the 29th of November; his servant took possession on the 27th - he was not in possession, nor did he or his servants sleep in the house till the 27th; I did not receive his bills of exchange till the 27th, and the agreement was executed the same day, except his signature, which he put on the 29th or 30th; it was drawn up before I had his bills of exchange - my solicitor has the bills, I dare say; I had them on the 29th - they were not in circulation then; I did not live in the house after I gave him possession - I was at my country house; I never slept in the house after the 27th - I left my servant there; I had been out of town some months before, but my servant slept there - I think my servant left on the 29th; I am not able to say whether the prisoner had signed the agreement before my servant had left - I think he left on Monday, the 29th, or it might be on Tuesday, the 30th - he left in the evening; I certainly had not left the house altogether, and gone into the country, before the 27th - I had been in the house several days after the 27th, but not to take a meal there - it was previous to my taking the bills that it occurred to my mind to take something else.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your lady here? A. Yes - she and I were going backwards and forwards from our country-house; I did not go after my cook went till I found out this - I had some furniture in the house, and a storeroom - that was not broken open; part of the furniture was taken away by the cook - I never gave the prisoner authority to sell any of the furniture.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of December, I went with the prosecutor to a house in Blackfriars-road, and found these articles of furniture.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY LAWLESS. Q. When was the arrangement made? A. It was made in the presence of Mr. Woodard, the prisoner, and myself, on Saturday, the 27th of November - it was arranged in our presence, that I should go into the City, draw that paper, and return at a certain hour in the afternoon, and the prisoner should execute it, but I could not get there in time; I found the prisoner had in the interim given the two bills, and agreed to call at my office, in Tokenhouse-yard, and sign the paper - he had not seen the paper, but he knew the contents verbally; we had talked about the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. But your agreement refers to an arrangement for the assignment of a lease, and letting him into possession, when did any difficulty start, and it was suggested to make a tenant of him? A. That was the difficulty throughout, and the agreement was proposed - I had seen the prisoner on the Thursday, but it was not agreed that he should take the things till the Saturday; there certainly was a final verbal agreement on the Saturday, but he certainly was not unconditionally accepted as a tenant, without this paper - that was the very thing we were providing against; there were a variety of agreements and stipulations to be reduced to writing by me, which I did, and the prisoner signed it on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you introduce into that writing any stipulation that had not previously been mentioned? A. There was one stipulation as to the penalty, but I had read all the rest carefully over to the prisoner; the penalty for liquidating damages, I did not call his attention to, till the Tuesday - there might be some parts which might not be understood, but the whole was read over, and I did not consider there was any thing travelling out of the road of the agreement; it was arranged that I should draw up the agreement, making him the tenant of a ready-furnished house of Mr. Woodard's, and on the Tuesday the prisoner adopted that agreement, by signing it, with the clause about liquidated damages being added - I particularly called his attention to that, as it had not been named on the Saturday; I think he signed it between eleven and twelve o'clock - I explained to him, that, under this agreement, he would be the tenant of Mr. Woodard, and it was drawn to keep the tanancy aloof from the legal possession; I explained that to him on the Saturday, and on the Tuesday also - I stated that inasmuch as he was not prepared to pay the money down, he could not expect to be put into possession of the property on such a nugatory security, or to that effect; I will not swear those were the words I used.</p>

            . I am a law-stationer, and have been brought up to that business all my life. I now work for Mr. Ashurst - I am here accidentally, waiting for another trial; I have counted the words in this agreement - it contains, with the names and attestations, one thousand and eighty words, and eighteen words over - there are seventy-two words in a folio; one thousand and eighty words are fifteen folios - without the names and attestations, it contains only two words over; there are figures, which I have counted as words at length, which is the usual course of business - I have counted some thousands of deeds in my life.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many words do you swear there are independent of the attestations and names? A. One thousand and eighty-two - the attestations and names consist of sixteen words; the signature appears as one word, but it is two words - I counted this No. 65, which some gentleman has put, but that is not part of it; I mistook it - the stamp is for 1l.</p>
               <p>The court ruled that the agreement, not being duly stamped, was not admissible in evidence.</p>

I lost these articles - I knew the prisoners, and on the night of the 5th of January I went to their shop; I saw them both, and asked if they had bought a cut-glass salt of a boy of mine, who had stolen it from me- they denied it, but Miller showed me a pewter inkstand, a white jar, and a blue dish, which she said she had bought of Edward Davis; she had given 2d. for the inkstand, 1d. for the jar, and I think she said 3d. for the dish - I should think the inkstand was worth 1s., the jar 3d. or 4d., and the dish 6d.; the clogs and other articles were produced by the officer at the office.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 6th of January I went to the prisoner's shop; I saw Miller at the door, and said I wanted a word with her - she came in, and I asked if they had not bought some things of a boy; she said she had, the boy's mother had been there, and she had shown her this dish, this jar, and this inkstand and glass - I asked if she had bought any more things of the boy; she said No, she was sure she had not - I took out a paper which I had received from a brother officer, and said I should search her house; she then produced the clogs, the spoon, and a plate - I then asked her about a petticoat, and she called to stone, who was in the back parlour, to go and fetch it from down stairs; I followed her, and met her coming up with it, but I previously asked Miller why she had denied to the boy's mother having these other things; she said the mother never asked her about them - I then asked why she denied it to me; she said she had not bought the other things, but a friend had, and then she called to Stone- I went down, and saw a little back kitchen; I asked whose it was - Stone said it was hers; there were chairs and tin goods there - I asked whose they were; she said hers, that she had been in the public line, and these were the goods she brought away from the public-house - I asked her if she knew any thing of a saucepan, which I could not find; she said No: I told her to be careful, as Miller had said she had bought some things - she then said Miller was in the shop when the things were purchased, but she was not certain who paid the money; I came up stairs again, and told Miller she must go with me - that Stone said she was in the shop when the money was paid; I do not know what answer she made - Miller stated at the of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060065"/>fice that Stone was her partner, and an officer was sent for her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw no attempt at absconding? A. No; I saw Edward Davis at the office - I did not hear the expression he made use of; I believe that was when he was in custody before for robbing his mother, but she would not prosecute him; I have heard the prisoners bore a good character - they live about three hundred yards from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does Mrs. Davis keep a shop? A. No.</p>
               <p>Miller's Defence. I did not pay him for the inkstand, but I was present, and there was a poor woman came with some pamphlets, which I did not wish to purchase, but, seeing her distressed, I went to a stationer's over the way, and while I was there the boy stole one of the pamphlets.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to EDWARD DAVIS. Q. Was any pamphlet found in your pocket? A. No; I took one up, and was looking at it - I offered to pay the woman for it; it was not found in my pocket - I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled it out again; I was going to pay for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the woman see you put it into your pocket? A. Yes - I did not sell the prisoners any thing after that.</p>
               <p>Miller. I took the book from his pocket, and then I hindered him from stealing a pair of shoes; I said to my friend, "Don't suffer that boy to come to the shop again;" his mother came in the evening, and produced a list - I showed her what she asked for - I was washing the whole of the previous day, and was not present when any thing was bought but the inkstand.</p>
               <p>Stone's Defence. We were both present when the jar and inkstand were sold; there was another boy with him - the other said he was not to take 2d., but he said he would.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I followed the prisoner into Westbourn-street Pimlico - he went into a baker's yard and concealed himself in the privy; I stood in the passage, saw him come out, and run across the yard to the wash-house - I followed him into the washhouse, and he had no coat or jacket on - he had a red jacket on when I first saw him, the same as he has on now; it appeared to me to be the same - I found it in the washhouse; I have not said I found it in the privy - I found in it a snuff-box, a tobacco-box, this tin case, a pair of tips, and some nails to go in them, a two feet rule, and a soldering-iron - I said to him, "You must go with me, I am informed you have stolen a plane." he said he had not brought it from the house; I then put up the two feet rule and the soldering iron, and asked if he had any knowledge of them; he said No; I found the rule under the jacket - I then asked him where he lived, he said he could not distinctly tell, but it was in Little Ebury-street- that he had not been near there for many days; I took him to the watch-house, and then went to his lodgings -I found his wife there, and the people of the house said he lodged there; I found a good many articles there, among them was this square and this turn-screw.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have no question to ask, it is all right; here is

            . I am a medical man, and am employed in this prison; I have seen the prisoner daily since he has been in custody, and have taken particular pains to ascertain the state of his mind, and he has related his adventures to me so connectedly and so consistently that I entertained some doubts as to his insanity, but within these last two or three days my conversations with him have been longer, and I have some doubts of his being of sound mind; from the appearance of his head, from an injury he received in battle, I am led to conclude that his brain has been affected - the external mark of violence leads me to conclude his brain has been injured; it is such an injury, as liquor frequently operates upon, to deprive persons of their senses - he says he has a plate in his head; I have not detected it to my own satisfaction, but there is a depression on the scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Sir, as a person of science, do you, on your oath, believe him to be deranged or not? A. I believe him to be of deranged mind, my Lord.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live with Mr. Maslin, in the Westminster-road. I have twenty silk handkerchiefs, pawned by the prisoner, on the 13th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening - he came in a violent hurry, went into the box, produced nineteen handkerchiefs and his coat, and wanted 3l. - I could not lend it; he then pulled out a separate one, and I said,"With that, I can make it 3l." - he said," Very well," but wished to have a separate duplicate for that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you known him before? A. Yes; as pawning things for many years - I knew his name, but he had removed; he came the next morning, and redeemed the coat, by paying 15s. - he gave the address Agnes-place; we went there, but could not find him - I knew where his sister lived; I went there and they said it was No. 14, Agnes-place - I could not find him there; it was an uninhabited house - my employer has known his family fifteen or twenty years; I have been there seven or eight years, and known him by coming to the shop.</p>

               <p>JOHN BENTLEY. These are part of my handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many are there which you swear to? A. Eight; I have seen some more in the possession of a pawnbroker - I believe they are all British; some of them have my private mark on them; here is one with it on.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a mark in use in the shops in London? A. Certainly it is, though not in common - this I can positively swear is my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear it was a common mark? A. I considered you alluded to the letter of the mark, but this I positively swear is my own mark.</p>

            . I am a commission-agent and merchant. I was at Mr. Wardle's coffee-shop, next to the Surrey theatre, on the evening of Monday, the 13th of December - I saw the prisoner there; I have known him from a boy - in the course of the evening I saw a tall, stout man come in with a bundle of handkerchiefs for sale; he offered them to me, but I did not buy them - he then offered them to the prisoner; he then offered a price for the whole of them, and, I believe, purchased them - when they had agreed, they went out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coffee-house was this? A. It is called Johnson's, but a man named Wardle keeps it - the prisoner is a general dealer, and an accoutrement-maker, and latterly he has transacted business for himself; when I knew his working place it was in the Borough-road - I do not know whether he is a master or a journeyman; he has lived at No. 31, Bond-street, Borough-road, within twelve months - he has been a general dealer since I have known him; I cannot say whether I ever knew him to buy silk handkerchiefs before - the parcel was opened, but I cannot say whether these are any of the handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I remember the prisoner being at the watch-house - I allowed him to stay there at night out of charity; the witness went to breakfast - when he returned the prisoner was gone, and the coat was missed; I spoke to the prisoner about it - he said he gave it to a man to a man to sell, but he did not know him; I did not leave that morning.</p>

On the 31st of December, I went with my master's waggon - Eltridge drove it; it had a load of hay, and two trusses of hay for the horses -Edgware is on the road to London, and when we got to the George I saw Eltridge get up into the waggon, and throw one truss of hay down, Lee took it, and carried it into his loft; I did not say any thing then, but I told of it the next night, which was Saturday, and the prisoners were taken on the Monday; that truss was one of those I had seen put on the waggon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. How long have you been in Mr. Moate's service? A. Since Michaelmas Eltridge was there; I assisted in loading the waggon - I had not left the waggon; I do not know what was done with the hay afterwards - we were in the habit of calling at that inn, and giving the horses corn, but never any hay there; I have never had any quarrel with Eltridge -I did not hear him say any thing to Lee; there were two examinations before the Magistrate - I said both times that it was a truss of hay; I saw the hay loaded, and these two trusses were for the horses.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You found your own hay for the horses? A. Yes; it was not the practice to give out hay- Lee took it up, and said nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is your master's house from there? A. About twenty miles - we had four horses; I went up with the load; it was sold in London - all the hay was my master's; there was a load and three quarters on the waggon, and the two trusses for the horses; we stop at the George, in going down - I do not know what had become of that hay - the horses never had it, they had the other truss; they had corn at the George.</p>

             is my carter. I sent off the load, and the two trusses of hay for the horses; they stop at the George, but do not have hay there; it is not usual to throw a truss down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever prohibited them from giving hay? A. It is the general rule not to give hay at the inns, but chaff and corn; I do not know that I ever laid down that rule to Eltridge in particular - I had not told Lee he was not to buy any hay of me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is it your practice to sell single trusses on the road? A. No.</p>
               <p>Eltridge. It was not a truss.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. It was a truss of clover hay.</p>
               <p>Eltridge. I threw it down for my horses to eat.</p>

               <p>Seelie's Defence. I left home to go to Kensington, and the Policeman ran after me; a parcel of boys ran by, and one of them dashed down the stockings at my feet.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Tuesday morning, the 14th of December, I was at the Three Hats public-house, Islington, and as I went out Knott came in with a stone bottle, and called for a pint of old Tom - when I got by Liverpool-road I saw Johnson standing there, with new clothes and a whittle on - I questioned him as to who and what he was, and where he was going; he said his name was Litchfield - that he was a parchment-maker, and was going to Birmingham, to look after work; I asked who he worked for last; he said Benjamin Long, of Newington-butts - I said," Are you not waiting for somebody?" he said, "Why?" I said, "Because a lad has gone in for some gin, dressed as you are, and I think you are companions;" Knott came and joined him - I took them to our station; Johnson said he had 14s., but I found he had 20s., and a metal watch in his pocket - a pair of gloves, a knife, and a silk handkerchief; I asked him who the handkerchief belonged to - he said his father, and the watch to his mother, and that he took them out of a box; I searched Knott, and found a cotton handkerchief and a silk shawl I wrapped in it, in his coat pocket - he said it belonged to Johnson, and he was taking care of it for him - that they were going to sell it to help them on the road; he had a pair of worsted gloves on, the same as Johnson.</p>

               <p>MRS. LITCHFIELD. This is my watch, and was left in the front room - some of the handkerchiefs are ours; I went to Hatton-garden, and they told me I must prosecute, but my son behaved well before this; it is through his very bad master - he is my only child; I would take him home again.</p>

On the 16th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour at tea, with the glass door open, and saw a person in a white fur poodle cap, look into the shop two or three times, and in three or four minutes he came into the shop, went up to the window, took a cloak, and ran away into the road - I ran out, followed him, and saw him go towards Hanover-square, dressed precisely the same; he got between a coach, and cart in the middle of Oxford-street, and there I lost sight of him - I called stop thief! and when I got to Hanover-square gates, two or three persons standing there, directed me down Oxford-street; I could see a long way down the street, as there was a number of lights, but I could see nobody before me - a Policeman came up to me at the corner of Bond-street; he went to Hanover-square, and I down Bond-street, and Brook-street, and at the corner by the Earl of Crawford's, met the prisoner with the cloak under his arm - I collared him; he struggled hard to get away - I called for assistance; a lady and gentleman came up, and with assistance, I took him back to the shop- he was dressed in a white fur cap, and an apron tucked up round him, exactly the same as the man; I do not swear to his person - the road was particularly dirty, and he said he found the cloak in the road; it was quite clean - I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you swear he said he found it in the road? A. Yes; not on a railing - our parlour door directly faces the shop door, and is about fifteen feet from it; it was quite dark - he was taken in five or six minutes after he left the shop; I described his person to the people at the square gate - I spoke to the Policeman without stopping; I had slippers on, and left them in the road - I could not observe his face; I saw him two or three times - he was dressed as a working man; nobody told me they saw the cloak taken from the rails - the Magistrate thought it unnecessary for the Policeman to be here.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you any fence to your shop window? A. He came three feet into the shop to take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing in Regent-street, and saw the cloak laying inside some railings on the right hand side of the way; I saw somebody on the other side of the way - I picked up the cloak to see what it was; a plasterer on the other side of the way saw me pick it up, and told the prosecutor he need not hold me, for he saw me pick it up - the prosecutor said, "That is nothing to me."</p>

             - I said, "Sol, where have you sent them to?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have sent them to the Jews' synagogue," and if Simmons was not come home, he was taken up for the robbery; he said, "You must go to Worship-street, to inquire there - if you don't find him there, go to Guildhall, and if you hear nothing there, go to the Mansion-house;" a young woman, they call Laura, cohabited with Sol in that room - I went to those three places, and heard nothing of them; I returned home, and in the evening I saw Simmons and Wilkinson, about nine o'clock, at the Crown, at the Obelisk; Simmons asked me if I would take any thing to drink - I said No, and asked where he had been: he made no answer - he pulled out half a sovereign, wanted change for it, and said he had plenty of money; he had nineteen sovereigns and 7 1/2d. - that included the half-sovereign - he said he had got it by property he had stolen from the synagogue; he said this inside the Crown; I had never before seen him in possession of above half a crown, during the time that I lived with him - Sol and Samuel Davis came into the Crown about a quarter of an hour after; I did not sit down and drink there - Samuel Davis said, "Where is Edmund and John?" I said, "In there," pointing to the tap-room- Samuel said, "If they behave wrong to me I will do the same to them;" they then went into the tap-room -Wilkinson and Simmons had left before they got in; Samuel and Sol went straight down to Hicks', the Lion - I went with them; they called Simmons out, talked together, and drank together, but I did not hear their conversation; next day Simmons had two new long coats on, a new belcher silk handkerchief and a new pair of shoes; on the Sunday following inquiry was made of me about another robbery, and Simmons was taken up that Sunday night - I then disclosed to Hammond, the Police-officer, what I knew about it; I was examined four times before the Lord Mayor - it was mentioned at the examination on the Thursday, that a phosphorus-box had been found in the synagogue; I was sent out of the justice-room before I had seen that box - it was shown to me when I came in again, but it was not one that I had ever seen before; another phosphorus-box was afterwards shown to me - I knew that; (looking at a phosphorus-box produced by Ansell) I do not know this - it is not the one that was shown to me the second time.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at it again, and tell me do you know that box? A. Yes, this is the phosphorus-box that Simmons was to take with him - he was only to take a box and a bunch of keys; Ann Hilyard, who drank tea with us on the 20th of December, cohabited with Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. I may be twenty-two or twenty-three in March; I am not a prostitute now - I have been so, but I now get my living by my own work; I began to do so about three years ago - it is not more than a month ago that I lived with Simmons, but I was getting my living by going out to work, except for the four days I was with him; I had known him before that - I had a grand-mother, who lived in Grey-street, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road, once; I have three brothers - I do not know where one of them is; I do not know that he has been transported - I have heard so, but do not know it for truth; it is twelve or fourteen years since I saw him - I have heard of him, but do not know where he is; a gentleman called, who had seen him, but I do not know where - I have worked for Mrs. Rushmeer, and have lived with a lady at Kenning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060072"/>ton; I was never at Brixton nor at the Borough Clink -I was never before a Justice but once, and that was when my father took me up for running from home; I then lived where we do now, in Catherine-wharf, Vine-street, near Waterloo-bridge - it was six years ago; I never was taken up on any other occasion, never tried, and never in Brixton House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave your work to live with Simmons? A. Simmons persuaded me to come from home - when I heard they proposed to rob the synagogue I thought it was shocking - I told

             of it next morning, but nobody else; I said nothing to any of the officers when I went to inquire at the different offices - I swear that I heard of no reward being offered before I gave the information.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long after this (the 20th of December) did Simmons refuse to live any longer with you? A. He did not refuse at all - I told him I had better go home; he did not turn me off, nor did I say I would get him transported for it - I left him on the Wednesday, went home on Thursday, and lived with my mother, in Vine-street; I have no father - Mrs Marks is the landlady of the house where I lived with Simmons - I saw her and Ann Hilyard here yesterday; Hilyard slept with me on the night the synagogue was robbed - I state this on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Hilyard and Mrs. Marks are here; I caution you, are you sure of it? A. Yes: Simmons and I slept together up to Monday, and I expected him home on the Monday night - Hilyard lodged with one Franklin, who she left on the Monday, and asked me if she might sleep with me; I said she might - it was nine o'clock in the evening that I had the conversation with Simmons at the bar of the Crown public-house - I do not know how many persons were there, for I was not in the tap-room; I think there were not above three or four persons at the bar - Simmons said to me, just by the side of the bar, "I have plenty of money, and have done the robbery at the Jews' synagogue; I have nineteen sovereigns, &amp;c." and he produced the half-sovereign - I saw the rest in his hand; he pulled it out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised to hear a man, who had robbed the synagogue, tell you about it at the bar of d public-house? A. He was by himself, talking to me at the side; the bar is a good length - I thought it incautious- I did not tell him to put the money back again; I did not get a farthing of it - he offered me 1s., but I would not have it; I had wanted to go home, and leave him on the Sunday, but I could not without going to my sister first, as my brother would not let me come home when I liked; I could not go without somebody with me, after leaving them in that way - I was too dirty to go through the streets on Sunday - I sent to my uncle, who works at the Surrey theatre, before the Thursday, and asked him to lend me 1s., and got my things washed - I did not think it proper to live with the prisoner at all; I was not forced to live with him - I went to live with him willingly, but could not go home when I liked, after running away in the manner I had - I did not think proper to live with him after I knew what he was going to do; he had told me he had learned carpentering and shoemaking, but I did not see him do any work - I never saw him with more than half a crown; I did not like to take the shilling from him, and borrowed it of my uncle -I had gone to my uncle's, and borrowed it on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had the whole of Monday to wash your clothes, and go home? A. No, I had not, for he was at home with Wilkinson on the Monday from ten to four o'clock, and again at half-past six - he went out at ten; I did not go home that night; I do not know why; I heard of a reward on the Monday, when Samuel Davis was taken- Joseph, the brother of Sol, told me of it - Hammond, the officer, was with us then; it was about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, a week after the transaction - I never heard of the reward from Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you disclose this? A. When they came to me about another robbery, I said it was not the first robbery he had committed, he had robbed the Jews' syngogue - I had no animosity against him; I told him Marks and Hilyard slept in the house, and that Sol Davis slept there: he is related to Marks;

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to live with him, and cohabited with him some time? A. I went to live with him on the Friday, and left on the Wednesday, when I found he was a thief; I determined instantly to leave him- my evidence is not affected in the slightest degree by the hope of reward - I never had a criminal charge against me- I worked for one mistress three years; I now work for a friend of hers, and have worked for her twelve months.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you know that to be the box which was in Simmons' possession? A. By the lable on it - I cannot read; I do not know whether there was a lable on the box which was first shown to me - I know this, because the top was almost out when he had it from me; there was no dispute between me and the prisoner about not having any of the property given me; I never had a dispute with him about money.</p>

I had gone on an errand for Mr. Levy, my master, who lives in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch - I am a tailoress; I was in Duke-street - I went to Mrs. Bell's for half a yard of calico; she lives nearly opposite the synagogue door - I was not at work - I was in the street returning home from Mrs. Bell's; I did not tell the Justice that I saw him through a window, where I was at work, for a moment; I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. No such statement is in her deposition.</p>
               <p>Witness. I remember Davis' attorney being before the Magistrate - he asked me some questions, but I did not tell him that I saw him through the window when I was at work; I could see the synagogue from the shop where I bought the calico - I saw him as I was returning from Bell's; I did not observe any body while in the shop - it was on a Monday evening; I do not know the day of the month - my master came up stairs the next morning, and said the synagogue had been broken open - I immediately turned; he asked why my countenance changed, and I told him this; I was on the opposite side to the synagogue - they were standing in one place; Samuel Davis' face was towards me - the others had their backs to me; I could see Samuel Davis' face quite plain sideways - he stood a little front and a little side-ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have stood with the synagogue behind him? A. He did; I saw him quite plain point to the door - I saw his face quite plain; he stood side-ways -I cannot say whether he pointed with the left hand or the right - (the witness here, with her hand, described the manner, in which the prisoner had pointed to the door.)</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any doubt that he is one of the three men? A. He is; I had seen him frequently, but never spoke to him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and formerly belonged to Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner Simmons last Sunday fortnight, and Samuel Davis the next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I took Simmons on another charge - Seddon was with me at Queen-square, respecting the charge I had apprehended Simmons on, and in consequence of what she told me I apprehended Samuel on this charge - her communication was made to me voluntarily; I attended the examination at the Mansion-house, the first time the phosphorus box was produced - Seddon remained in the room; Mr. Ansell had produced a phosphorus-box - she did not see that before she left the room, to the best of my knowledge - I have a phosphorus-box, that was produced last Thursday - it was produced by the prisoner Simmons; he looked round the office, and wished all the witnesses to withdraw - Seddon and all of them withdrew before he produced the box; he said he wished Seddon to be questioned, if she would not identify the box, as she had one on a former occasion - I cannot say whether this was written down; Seddon came in, and it was shown to her, and then given into my charge - there was no label on it, nor was the head broken in.</p>

               <p>Q. This was last Thursday? A. Yes; a box had been shown to her on the Monday before, before the Lord Mayor - they were not both produced together; I first saw her last Monday fortnight, at Queen-square - I had not sent for her; I beg pardon, I now recollect, on the Sunday night that I apprehended Simmons, Seddon was in company with Mr. Basford, in Richmond-street, Lambeth - he is the prosecutor on another charge; I saw her at Basford's house, about nine o'clock - I had forgotten that before- I first conversed with her on the subject of this robbery, on the Monday morning, at Queen-square; she never told me any thing regarding this robbery on the Sunday night- she never mentioned a word about the synagogue till the Monday morning; no reward has been offered for Basford's robbery - I did not appoint for her to come to Queen-square; she had given Mr. Basford the information; before we went into the office she told me this was not the first robbery he had been concerned in - that he was concerned in a burglary in the Jew's synagogue, in the City; I had not heard of that robbery before she told me the parties who were concerned - this was quite voluntarily, and after the examination she went with me to a variety of public-houses, for Sol Davis, but did not find him; I cannot tell whether Seddon was anxious that he should be taken - she conducted herself properly in giving information; I never heard of her till I found her at Basford's.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She named the persons concerned in the robbery? A. Yes; she named Simmons, Samuel and Sol Davis, and Wilkinson; I have made exertions to find the other two, but have not been able.</p>

               <p>Simmons' Defence. All I have to say is, that it is prejudice on the woman's part towards me - I never lived with her; when I first returned from sea, I was in the London-road, late at night, and she accosted me, took me to a house in Ann's-place, Blackfriars-road, and I gave her half a crown - in the morning, when I got up, I went to Mr. May's, and called for some gin, and finding I had not silver, I charged her with robbing me - I have seen her since, but never dwelt with her; she has likewise foresworn herself, which can be proved by the books of Horsemonger-lane, the Borough Clink, and Brixton, and she was taken up for a Mint robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. He told you he did lodge there? A. No, I saw him at his father's - I have not said that he said he lodged there - you have misunderstood me; when I saw him at his father's he did say he lodged there - I cannot tell you the name of the street where the father lived; I forget what part of the town it was in, whether it was East or West - my memory is rather bad.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Consider under what a solemn sanction you are now speaking - do you mean to say your memory is so totally void of retention, that you cannot tell whether it is three years? A. I do not know that it is so long; I think it may be a year ago.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it might not be three months ago? A. I went to see his father; I only went once in my life - I went because his wife lay ill, and I knew her - his father is living now, but I do not know where; I saw him in the street about a week ago - it was more than a mile from my house that I went to see him; I do not know the name of the street, nor what part of the town it was in.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You forget about Spitalfields when you were asked about Hyde Park-corner? A. Yes, it was near Spitalfields - I cannot tell the name of the street: the father was at home and Sol - it was day-light; I went with my mother - I am married, and my husband lives with me - I have known Samuel Davis about twelve months; I do not know whether he is related to Sol - I do not mean to swear that; he is a nephew; I have heard say he is a nephew to Sol, not his brother.</p>

I know the witness Hilyard, and have seen her frequently for the last two or three years, and spoken to her - I knew her well, quite as well as I do my own sister; last Thursday night, I saw her at a house which is my own property, No. 36, Herbert's-buildings, where I went for the purpose of trying to get a little rent - while I was asking my tenant's wife for rent which was due, Hilyard came through the kitchen, and went into the yard; she remained there a few minutes, then came back, and sat at the table - she began to cry and stamp her hand on the table, and said, "Oh! my poor chap;" Mrs. Mapp said, "I should recommend you to speak to Mr. Winston;" she said, "I don't know how ever we shall get my chap through it;" I said, "What is the matter?" she said."Oh, they have been into the b - y Jews' chapel;" I said, "What have they got?" she(Hilyard) said."They have got some wedge;" I asked what that was - she said silver, and said she did not know what she was to do, they wanted money; I told them if they would let me see it, I had no money about me, but I could get some - she then burst out crying again, stamped her hand on the table, and said, "Oh, my poor chap. I would not split for one hundred guineas;" she said, the wedge was nigh at hand - I understood her to mean she would not confess upon her paramour, or her young man; she then went into the front parlour, and I saw no more of her - I gave information to the solicitor for the prosecution; the house was searched last night by the officer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give information to the solicitor? A. Yesterday; a person in the market had been talking on the business, and I said I thought I could give information - I wanted to get it from her, to purchase it; I thought if I advanced money on it, and placed it in the hand of the inspector of the Police, it might bring the thing to justice - I am not acquainted with Seddon; I have seen her pass my house at night, but do not know how she gets her living.</p>

             re-examined. I live at No. 34, Herbert's-buildings - I never saw the witness, Winston, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. He has stated such circumstances that you cannot but recollect? A. It is all false - I swear I never had any conversation with any body about wedge - I never said, "Oh, my poor chap;" I never used those words in any place - Mrs. Mapp is the landlady; I never had any conversation there on Thursday night with any man - just as I went in doors there was a man coming out, but I never had any conversation with him whatever - I never heard any thing about silver; I never had any silver in that house, or near it, nor knew of any being there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you mention to Mr. Winston the name of your chap? A. I never mentioned any thing of the kind, which he has been saying.</p>

               <p>Mr. WINSTON. She did not mention his name - I have seen her with men, but not with any particular one.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN ELMES. I am turnkey of the County gaol of Surrey. I have a certificate of the former conviction of Simmons - I was present when he was tried, and heard the sentence pronounced upon him; I am positive of his person. (Certificate read.)</p>
               <p>Simmons. I acknowledge that is correct.</p>

On the 1st of January, about twelve o'clock, I came up; I saw Reuben walking away from the prosecutor - the prosecutor said he had been robbed, or words to that effect, and pointed to Reuben; I took him into custody directly- he made no resistance; we took both the prisoners to the station-house; the prosecutor then said he had not been robbed, he had lost no money - he had been drinking, but was far from being intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If Reuben had been inclined to escape, might he not? A. Impossible; I was about five yards from him - he did not attempt to escape, or to resist; I must have been present at the examination, but I saw no alteration made, nor heard of any - I attended three days at the office; I do not know what the expences come to - nothing, very likely; I was never here before- I took Reuben at the instigation of the prosecutor; he was on the other side, and when he pointed to him I crossed towards him.</p>

             is my partner. On the 27th of December we discovered this horse-cloth, but it was lost some time in November, I believe, out of the stable - Atkins has been in our employ for about a year and a half, as ostler; I have lost cloths before, and Atkins was always the first man to come and say, "Master, I have lost such a cloth" - that it was very mysterious, but he was sure there was no body about the premises but our own people - there were two others employed there besides him; the morning this cloth was lost, he came and said "I have lost the horse-cloth, master, that was Mr. Lindsey's;" on the 27th of December, my lad was coming by the coach rank, and saw the cloth on one of the coach horses - I went and examined it; the stand is opposite my house - both the prisoners were there -Atkins was feeding the horses and Mills was standing by; I presume he was the driver of the coach - my cloth was cut in two, and one piece was on each of the horses; I said to Mills, "Where did you get this cloth?" Atkins was close by, and must have heard it - I said, "This cloth is mine;" Mills said he bought it on the rank - I told him I should not leave sight of him till he was in custody, as I was determined to know who he got it from - a Policeman came up, and I gave him into custody; I have lost cloths, bridles, and other things.</p>

               <p>Atkins. The property was my own. Witness. No; it was mine - I never gave it him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The cloth was on the horses? A. Yes, any one might see it; I do not think Mills knew it was stolen - I believe he is quite a different man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURBRIDGE. This is the cloth; I know it by the quality, the binding, and a place which had been mended.</p>
               <p>SOPHIA BROWN. This is the cloth; here is a place which I mended in it.</p>
               <p>Atkins' Defence. I bought it seven months ago in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p> - BANNISTER. I am horse-keeper to Edward Mills, a hackney-coach master; I saw Atkins come and offer this cloth openly for sale, opposite Shoreditch church - there was another person would have had it, if Mills had not - he asked me the value of it, and I said, I thought he gave quite enough for it.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Hedges, a pawnbroker. I was in the habit of giving gold or notes to the prisoner, for silver, for his master - on the 11th of October he did not come at all, nor about that time; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He used to send me frequently with 30l. or 40l., to get gold or notes, and that time it hap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060079"/>pened to be but 10l. - I saw a mob between Long-acre and Mr. Hedges; I ran with the money in my side pocket, and did not think of it - when I came out of the mob the money was gone; I was afraid to go back, and have been in great distress about the town till I was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. TAPLIN. He had been often sent with larger sums of money - when we found he did not return, I went to Bow-street, and was advised to go to his native place, in Berkshire; I went there, but could not trace him - he had been twelve days in Tothill-fields when I found him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the money in a bag? A. Yes, tied up, as was customary; I believe we took the prisoner without a character - we expected 10l. for this silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it not have been of considerable weight? A. Yes, it was in a sample bag - I believe he usually put it into his breeches pocket; I should think it would be such a bulk that it would be missed immediately - we have a great many servants, with coaches and cabriolets, in different parts of the town, and we offered them a reward if they could find the prisoner, but they could not - I have often cautioned him, and he said he never took his hand out of the pocket the silver was in.</p>

             I am a Police-constable. I fell in with the prisoner, in Hackney-road, on the 4th of January - he was intoxicated, and had lost his coat and waistcoat; I took him to the station-house - he said, in going along, that he was in great trouble of mind; he kept pointing to his heart, and then indicated he had robbed his master six weeks ago of a coat and shirt - I at last found who his master was, and went to Mr. Boyd's; the prisoner became quite sensible soon after I took him up, and said he had sold the things in Field-lane.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had applied for some person to come and protect you in this house some time before? A. Yes, and Price and his wife came; they had been there about three months- I gave them apartments rent-free, for the purpose of having a person to live there, as I had been uneasy about my jewellery; Price suggested that it would be prudent to conceal it in a well under the carpet in the drawing-room, and after that it was suggested by me that it should be put into the garden; Price said he would dig a hole for it - the prisoner used to come as a jobbing-carpenter- Price was a surveyor, and he gave him directions when he was at home; the property was buried on Thursday morning, the 21st of October, and was missed the next morning - about eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of October, Price went out, came in, and said he had been shot at; about an hour after that he proposed to fire, and I said "Do" - it was to frighten away what I supposed were bad characters in the neighbourhood; I had seen the prisoner that day at work in the house; I believe his hour for leaving was six o'clock; I saw him again at eight or nine o'clock the next morning, in his usual course of employ - on the Sunday morning he came to make an excuse for not coming to sit up the night before, as Price had desired him; Price was in my house on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday - he always left at seven o'clock in the morning, to go to his office, and returned at four in the afternoon; the prisoner joined in the firing on Friday night, but not on the Thursday night; he was not in my house then, to my knowledge - he fired on Friday night, in consequence of directions from myself and Price; he had been desired to sit up.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you find any dead men in the garden? A. No; I had no suspicion of Price at that time - Price melted some bullets; I believe the prisoner was present on one occasion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You missed your jewels on the 22nd? A. Yes, but the firing continued that night - I did not then know that the prisoner was in the house on the Thursday night; he proposed to sit up the Friday night - Price and I proposed he should, and in the course of that night price and the prisoner both fired.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Royal Oak, at Fulham, about three quarters of a mile from Mrs. Dyott's. I have known the prisoner four years - he came to my house on Sunday, the 24th of October, at near eleven o'clock; I opened the door, which was closed, and he proceeded to the tap-room - I sat down with him; there was no other person there, but my wife, and a lodger and his wife were up stairs; there was no one in the taproom but the prisoner and me - after he had sat down for half an hour, and had a pint or two of beer, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been to work at our old shop;" I said, "What old shop?" he said, "At Mrs. Dyott's, at Walham-green;" I said,"What have you been doing there?" he said, "I have got a goodish job, I have been there to work for these three weeks, or there abouts, and I have made a d - d sight better job than I should if I had worked for Mr. Plaw(his former master) for half a year" - I said, "How so? what, have you sent in a great many materials?" his answer was, "No, I have not; the truth of it is, the house has been robbed, but I want nothing said about it - or not the house, rather the garden;" I said,</p>

               <p>"Robbed what do you mean?" said he, "There has been a goodish bit of property taken away, to the amount of upwards of 300l. or 400l. - I was there the other night, and Price and I went out into the garden, fired a pistol up in the air, and ran in- we told Mrs. Dyott that some one had shot at us; we stopped in doors, and after a time we fired out of the window - this morning I have been up there, and we went into the garden searching after the property; Price told Mrs. Dyott he thought it must be somewhere in the gardon, and we goes to the ivy, which is by the side of the wall, and Price pulls out a box that had got upwards of 60l. worth of property in it; d-d fool, we might as well have had that while we had been about it - I did not know but he had got that;" I said, "Akers, if you go on with this story you must take care, you will get taken up on this suit, as sure as you are a man" - he repeated it over and over again, and told me of it two or three times; a lodger of mine went up stairs, fetched some bread and meat, and said we would have a bit together - I appeared as a witness on the last trial; the prisoner did not say any thing about money; he said, "Fill the pot, here is plenty of blunt;" I told Ledbetter, the officer, of this at the last Session,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. So you keep the Royal Oak public-house, at Fulham? A. Yes - I have not a publican's license, but a license to retail beer; it was a sort of grocer's shop before, and I continue that - I have a board over the door, but no sign yet; I saw the prisoner about ten minutes before eleven o'clock that Sunday morning, and it might be half an hour, or three quarters of an hour afterwards that he told me this - he was as sober as ever I saw him for what I know; he and I have been particularly intimate - we began our beer business on the 11th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060082"/>of October, as soon as we could; I could not think otherwise from what the prisoner said, than that he had been joining in the robbery - I did not take the earliest opportunity of telling what I knew; he was a particular friend of mine, and I would as soon have done my brother an injury as I would him; I should not have spoken of him, provided I had not been subpoened on the last trial - it is best known to Mrs. Dyott who could have found out that I knew any thing about it - it was afterwards that I told Ledbetter; I did not say much about this conversation at the last Session - I was only asked a word or two; I was ordered down before I told the whole - they did ask me if I knew Akers; I said I did, about four years - they asked whether he came to my house on the 24th; I said he did, and told them at what time, and what he said about going out to fire pistols, and whether he said he found any thing in the garden - I told them he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word about this man, whom you say you knew, having told you that he had joined in having committed this felony? A. Yes; that they went out into the garden, fired the pistol in the air, and that he told me he had had a good thing of it; I did not give any information to have him taken - I did not, on the last occasion, give all the account of the conversation which I have to day; Sims and his wife lodged with me on the 24th of October - I turned them out, because his wife robbed me- Sims was at home on that Sunday; when the prisoner came he was up stairs - he came down about twelve or half-past twelve o'clock, and brought some mutton down for Akers and me to join him to eat, because it would be spoiling, as he said; my wife heard what the prisoner said - as for Sims, I do not know whether he was down stairs or not, but I think, if he did not hear it down stairs he did up; he was there most of the time - I do not know who else was in my house, there were so many people after one o'clock; he was upon this conversation the greater part of the time, and there were a great many people, but nobody but him and myself in the first place - I could not swear that either heard the whole of it; it was told to me alone, and part of it was repeated in the presence of my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the story, which consisted of his participation in the robbery, repeated in the presence of the lodger? A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If I understand you right, the story was first told to you alone? A. Yes; I have known him four years, and been in the same employ with him, at Mr. Plaw's seven or eight weeks - I received a subpoena on this trial, and on the last; I know nothing of Mrs. Dyott- the prisoner said Mrs. Dyott and Price were with him on that Sunday; I have not seen my lodger since last Session, except one week he was in my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you give information against the prisoner? A. I gave no information; I was taken to Bow-street the day after - he was taken three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I believe I have friends who will prove what this man has said is false.</p>

            . I am a smith and bell-hanger; I lodged at Mr. Moore's shop at Fulham, about six or eight weeks -I know the prisoner well. On Sunday, the 24th of October, I remember his coming to Moore's house, between ten and eleven o'clock - I was then in the tap-room, which is facing the doorway which leads into the street - there is a little shop in front, and the tap-room within; while the prisoner was there, he, I, and Moore, were drinking together, and Akers said, he had been sent for by Mrs. Dyott that Sunday morning, and that she, him, and Price, went into the garden, to see if they could find any of the stolen property - he said Price told him to shake the ivy-tree, and that he, being clean, told Price to shake it himself, as he would not shake it any more; and that was the whole of the conversation that took place respecting that - I remained in conversation with Moore and the prisoner from the morning till seven o'clock in the evening; I was in the house the whole of the day, and continually with Akers, up and down stairs - he said he had a friend at home and wished to go home, but Moore pressed him to dine with him, as an intimate friend, but whether he did dine with him or not, I cannot say; I was not out of his company above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he went home about seven o'clock; I wished to go home with him, but Moore, as an old shopmate, went home with him himself - he was the worse for liquor; nothing about his having a good job of it, or his having got more in three weeks, than he should at Plaw's in six months, ever passed in my hearing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known much of the prisoner? A. Not till he and I stood godfather to Moore's children, which was two or three Sundays before; I had seen him before, as he had brought work to a shop where I was working, but there was no intimacy between us - I have not known Moore a great while; I left his house because we fell out, as he accused my wife falsely of a robbery; he did not turn me out, he said he expected I would go - I paid him every farthing of the rent every week; I do not owe him any rent - I owe him 5s., but I have not been that way; I cannot say when I left him - it might be seven or eight weeks before Christmas; I called to pay the 5s., and he was not at home; we eat in the tap-room that Sunday morning - I brought some mutton down from my own room, and Moore took part of it; I do not know whether I said it would spoil, there was not much I know; I understood Akers that he had been watching at Mrs. Dyott's on the Friday night, and he had been sent for on that Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had been sent for before that Sunday morning at all? A. I told you all I mean to say- I do not remember any thing of the kind; he said he had been there on the Friday night - he never said a word about firing shots in the garden, nor out of the window; I have stated to you what I have to say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did the prisoner get there that morning? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock - I had the front room over the shop, and my wife was there; I was not away more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I lodged at the prisoner's house on the 21st of October; it is the first house on the right-hand side after you pass the Wheatsheaf, in the turning leading to Parson's-green - he is a carpenter, and has four children; I remember his coming home on the night of Thursday, the 21st of October, about a quarter or twenty minutes after nine o'clock; the reason I recollect it, was, that the beer came at nine o'clock - after that Mrs. Akers and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060083"/>were talking in the passage; we heard a noise, and went to see what it was - the door blew too, and we were shut out - the neighbour next door, but one went round the back way, and let us in; I am married, and have one child - my husband is a carpenter; I know Akers came home after that time - I do not know when: I saw him the next morning; he was not at home the following night.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where he had been, till about half-past nine o'clock, you do not know? A. No, nor where he went in the course of the night.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the 22nd of December I saw the prisoner with a quartern loaf under each arm, and knowing him, I followed him - he looked round, saw me, and began to run; I caught him in Wimpole-street - I took hold of one of the loaves, and it broke; he said he had bought them - he struck and kicked me several times, but with assistance I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, "D-n you, you rogue, I have had you before." Witness. I did not.</p>
