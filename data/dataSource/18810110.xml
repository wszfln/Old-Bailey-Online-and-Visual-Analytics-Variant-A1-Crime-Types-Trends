I am 16 years old, and live at 38, Thomas Street—I am in the employ of Mr. Baker, of 32, Thayer Street, a stationer—on 16th December I was going home, and saw the prisoner in Mandeville Place—he said "Tommy, I will give you twopence if you will go on an errand for me"—I did not know him before—I said "Yes"—he said "Go to Markham's, at the corner of Marylebone Lane and Bentinck Street, and get a bottle of whisky and bring it to my house, 13, Hinde Street, Manchester Square"—he gave me something wrapped in brown paper, and said "That is a sovereign; don't open it in case you drop it out"—he said nothing about the change—I went to Markham's, took it out of the paper, and handed it to the barmaid, laying the paper on the counter—she said that it was bad, and did not give me the whisky—she sent the potman and another man with me to follow the prisoner, but he had gone—I went to 13, Hinde Street, and found he did not live there; that is only a few yards off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was about 9 o'clock on Saturday night; it was a dark night—I said at the police-court that I saw the barmaid take something out of the paper—I did not see the prisoner again till I went to the police-station, and picked him out at once from six or seven more—he was in the middle of the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The others had their hats off—Frederick Palmer was there at the same time and for the same purpose; I went in first—I took the sovereign out of the paper, and not the barmaid.</p>

I said "I will"—he told me to go to Mr. Foulger, in New Quebec Street, the Bricklayers' Arms, and get him a bottle of whisky—he gave me a coin in paper, and told me not to take it out in case I dropped it out—I took it out when I got to the Bricklayers' Arms, laid it on the counter, and asked the barmaid for a bottle of whisky; she looked at it and said that it was bad—Mr. Foulger gave me the whisky, and told me to go on up the street, as the prisoner said he would wait at the corner of Quebec Street, and he would follow me; the potman went out also—I could not see the prisoner; he was about 12 yards off when I left him.</p>

I stood there some time, my friend came back, and said 'They have given me a sovereign instead of a shilling, but I do not think it is good, do you?'

I live at 72, Linfield Row, Bow, and am in the employ of a gentleman, a large owner of house property; I manage his business—an 29th November I was collecting rents for him—about 5 o'clock that afternoon I was in Bell Street, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East, collecting rents, where he has some houses—I put my silver in a bag, which was slung over my shoulders, the gold I put in my pocket—there is a public-house there that has been shut up for some time, and which is rather more obscure than the rest of the street, and all at once I found a man standing by the side of me, putting his hand on my right arm, and tripping me up; he put his foot behind one of my feet, and tripped me up; meanwhile two other men held me behind—I saw them run away—I did not see them at the time they were by me, but I saw them afterwards when I was on the ground—as I fell down I clutched my bag; I allowed them to throw me down instead of defending myself—they never spoke a word—they threw me down, and when I was down I called out "Murder! Police!" and all that; nobody heard me, or chose to hear me, and the three of them unclasped my hands, and took my bag away—they first of all wrenched off my strap, and ran away with my bag—I got up, and ran behind them crying "Murder! Police! Thieves!" and ran up to the top of the street following them—a number of persons were congregated there, and asked me what was the matter—I did not say anything to them, but I rushed through them to the police-station, and made the charge—I could not see the thieves; they had the start of me—they used no further violence than was necessary to throw me down and get the money; they hurt my shoulder a bit, that was from the fall—I was not particularly in bodily fear; I took things as they came; I knew I should lose the money—that was the only fear I had—there was 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in the bag—this is the bag; it was not torn in this way when I was wearing it—the prisoner is the only man I can recognise—I pointed him out 13 days afterwards at the station from among other men—there was another man who I thought was one of the other two, but I did not swear to any one but the prisoner, I thought he was a little older than the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I describe myself as a solicitor's clerk—Mr. Turner is my master—he does not pay me a salary—I pay the rent of the office at 23, Charlotte Street, Bedford Square—I also practise in the name of Mr. Cotton, with his permission, in a great many cases—there is a Turner and Co.—they live at 273, Amhurst Road, Stoke Newington—I said before the Magistrate that I did not know where Mr. Turner lived; I did not know his private address at that time—Cotton and Co. do not pay me any salary; I pay the rent of their office—he is a solicitor on the Bolls, and so is Mr. Turner—Mr. Turner has an office at 91, Queen Street, Cheapside; I presume he pays for that himself, I have no idea—I have not passed in any other name—I have signed my name as Albert on two or three occasions on bills of exchange; my name is Albert: Edwin Albert Hunt; I dropped the Hunt, and adopted the Albert—I did not issue a writ in Baddeley <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Kirby—I know something about it; there was no writ issued, it was a joke entirely, it was a piece of waste paper—I did not make or cause to be made an application for money on this document, that I positively swear—I wrote the document; it was well known to be a joke; it was in the name of Turner and Co.—I know a man named Wright; I did not accuse him of writing these post-cards, I swear that positively; I never said to him that I believed he wrote them; I owe him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before I was a solicitor's clerk I was an accountant; before that I was a butcher—I have signed the name of Cotton and Co. on cheques on several occasions; I had a perfect right to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I handed the writ to Kirby; he is a friend of mine; I have known him two or three years—Mr. Cotton is a solicitor; I was acting as his clerk; I am now acting as managing clerk to Mr. Turner; he pays me a commission—I had a connection as an accountant, and I have an opportunity of introducing certain business, and I give my services as far as they are required and as far as it is right to do so, and where I require the services of Mr. Turner he attends for me.</p>

I said before the Magistrate that I wrote to them to say that if they did not give me money to hush this affair up I would put the matter in the hands of the Criminal Investigation Department—that was what X meant when I talked about this letter—I got no answer to that—I sent my brother with the letters on the Tuesday or Wednesday to take to Scotland Yard—I did not gee any policeman before I saw Inspector Lansdowne, or any attorney or Mr. Horgan—I first saw Lansdowne on Friday morning, 17th December—altogether I was watching three days, Saturday! Monday, and Tuesday, in Tooley Street—when 1 walked through the arch I could see Mr. Hume's office—two policemen spoke to me on 4th December; no, police<lb/>man spoke to me before that—I saw that man (<hi rend="italic">Thomas Smith, Policeman Mr</hi> 2)—he spoke to me on 4th December about ten minutes before, 260 spoke to me, on that same morning—I did not tell him "I am here to look after Mr. Hume, of Hibernia Wharf;" I swear that—I told him that I was in Mr. Hume's employ—I told him afterwards I was looking after an old gentleman, and if he wanted to know anything about me to go to Mr. Hume or Mr. Hipwell, at Hibernia Wharf—my brother usually lives where I am residing, 39, Emsworth Street, Barking Road—he is a plasterer—he is not working at all now; he was at work a week on ten days ago, but not in November or December to my knowledge—he was working just before Christmas and since—I swear positively that the first time I saw Mr. Hipwell there was a conversation between my brother and him—this letter is, I believe, my writing; it is dated November 2, and I believe I wrote it on November 1 or 2—I received this other letter dated November 1, which has the advertisement on it; it is marked "A"—I see the dates thoroughly, and I tell you that the one with the advertisement on it is the one I received in answer to mine—I first made a statement about the direction of Mr. Hipwell to use a knuckle-duster to Mr. Guy, the lawyer, on Friday, 17th December, at his office in, Bishops<lb/>gate Street Within, and it was first to him, with a view to these proceed<lb/>ings, that I said anything about a direction to disfigure the case—Mr. Horgan, the solicitor, and my brother were present, and the detective, but he did not stop to hear all—I do not know whether the datective was present when I mentioned the knuckle-duster or the disfiguring—In<lb/>spector Lansdown was the detective—my object in communicating with the police was public justice—I said at tie Mansion, House "If they paid my expenses I would not have said a word about the matter"—if had got my expenses I would have gone back to Sunderland where I came from, and would not have said anything about it, but I was left penny<lb/>less, and I left work to come up for this—I was examined at the Mansion House before my brother was examined at all; he was not examined that day—I heard somebody say that they wanted corroborative evidence—I cannot swear now whether I said one word on my first examination about any conversation with my brother—I said to jour learned friend beside you "My brother had a conversation with Mr. Hipwell once when I was a few yards off, and I know of no other"—perhaps I did not mention about the conversation at the Monument with my brother; he did have a conversation with him once when I was a few yards off; that was, in</p>

               <p>East cheap; it was a mishap if I said that I knew of no other—I cannot exactly swear that it was true, because he spoke of him twice or three times in our dealings together—it was adjourned for a few days, and then my brother came and gave evidence of several conversations—I had not talked to him in the mean time, but I was puzzled by the gentleman cross-examining me—I do not think I had any conversation with my brother, only general talk—I believe I had a conversation with him be<lb/>tween the adjournment and the time he was brought up, about it being necessary to corroborate my evidence—I have fought in the prize-ring; I have never been employed to maim a man or disfigure him, or to use knuckle-dusters to him—that would strike me as a very unmanly thing—I did not say anything to these people when they asked me to do so, but I told them it was a very hazardous task—my intention was to get as much money as I could—if I had seen Mr. Hume assaulted I should not have interfered to protect him: not in danger of my being locked up—I never intended to do anything at all for the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. When I went to Mr. Guy my state<lb/>ment was taken down, and I signed it, and my brother signed his—there had been no communication between us before that—we had a general talk over the affair going home, and I told him to mind what he had said himself, and to keep as near as he could to what was written down in the lawyer's office, and which he signed—up to that time nothing had been said about corroboration to my knowledge—I did not keep copies of my letters—this is the letter Sir Hardinge Giffard asked for; it was produced by Mr. Hume's Counsel at the Mansion House, and I was asked about it. (<hi rend="italic">Marked H. Read</hi>: "Dec. 6, 1880. Respected Sir,—I received your note this evening, and in reply wish to state that I shall not be able to come till Thursday, as I have met with a slight accident, being thrown out of a trap, and I do not wish to be seen with my head cut.") That was written in answer to the last letter I received—I was getting out of a trap, and fell against a wall—my head had sticking-plaster on it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my letter, and the envelope; the one I sent to get the money—I had never written a letter threatening Hume or Hipwell—the date on the envelope is December 12; it was produced to me by the Counsel at the Mansion House. (<hi rend="italic">Marked G. Read</hi>: "12th Dec, 1880. Mr. Hip<lb/>well. Sir,—I wrote two letters, one to you, and one to Mr. Hume, and received no answer; the fact of the matter is, if you think I am going to be trifled with you think wrong. I think it a very ungentlemanly action to serve me like this. I have told you nothing but the truth. If you do not send me money by return of post to hush this matter up, I will make a public exposure, and place your letter in the hands of the Criminal Inves<lb/>tigation Department, Scotland Yard. Now, Sir, one thing or other, money to hush this affair up by return of post, or the matter in the hands of the Criminal Investigation Department to<lb/>morrow, &amp;c, &amp;c. Direct Constantine Morris, 13, Street, Clerkenwell.") I had nothing to live on at that time, and was living at my mother's—I received money from Hipwell on 4th December, but have had nothing since—it was my brother who went to the police, and I saw Mr. Lansdowne about three days after<lb/>wards—the 7th was the first time I saw Mr. Horgan—I know John Matchell, a boxing booth proprietor—I am sure that I pasted the adver<lb/>tisement on the side of the letter I got; I only got one letter in Sunder<lb/>land from Mr. Hipwell, and I swear that that was the one I pasted the</p>

               <p>advertisement on—the only two letters of mine shown to me at the Mansion House were H and G—I wrote one to Hipwell in Sunderland, and one on Tuesday night, 23rd November—I received no reply next night, and wrote another on Thursday, the 25th, and I wrote several others, but I cannot swear how many—I wrote several in London.</p>

I live at 49, Emsworth Street—I have been in London two years—the last witness is my brother; he came up to London last November, and slept at my mother's house; that is where I live—I was not at work then—on Friday, 26th November, I went with him to Fish Street Hill, Monument—a party walked by the Monument with a piece of white paper in his button hole; my brother spoke to him, and they had a conversation, and spoke to me—Mr. Hipwell said that he did not want a second party in the case, as it might excite suspicion, but as I knew so much about it I might follow him—I followed him to the Shades Hotel, Old Swan Pier—I remained outside, and my brother and Mr. Hipwell went inside, and remained there 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—Mr. Hipwell gave me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. outside the Shades Hotel, and said that I was to follow him and my brother—they went to the Fishmongers' Arms on this side of London Bridge, and had some conversation; I went up, and he said that he wanted the big Irishman with big whiskers to get a good hiding, and he should not mind a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and if there was a scuffle I was to get my brother away if possible, and he said "If he gets what we want, next time it comes on I snail not be hard upon 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I never saw him again till 4th December—I was then at the bottom of Hart Street, facing the Monument again—Mr. Hume was with him, but I had no conversation with Hume—I had never seen him before; they were con<lb/>versing with my brother—it was between 9 and 10 a.m.—Hume went towards Fish Street Hill, and I followed, and joined them—Mr. Hipwell spoke of a knuckle-duster or a life-preserver—I received a second 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Mr. Hipwell told my brother to follow in half an hour—I saw nothing more; those are the only two conversations I have had—my brother gave me the letters on, I believe, December 15, and I went to Scotland Yard, showed them to the Inspector Lansdowne, and left them there—after that I went to Mr. Guy's office, where my brother made a statement, and I saw Mr. Guy writing—I made a statement, and signed something; that was on 17th December—I took six letters altogether, among which was the one with the advertisement on the back.</p>

I got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. twice, but I do not know what for; I was there, and I thought I ought to be in the same swim as my brother; it was given me with the same impression that I should help to assault this gentleman—my brother and I and my mother had a conversation, and we came to the conclusion that it was a very dangerous affair; that was after my brother got molested by the police—we did not come to that conclusion before my brother's money was stopped—we did not intend to interfere with anybody, but when my brother got interfered with I took the letters to Scotland Yard—I did not give information to the police in any shape or form before that—I was at the Mansion House when my brother was first examined before the Lord Mayor—I heard him examined—I was not examined the first day; I was on the second occasion—we had had no conversation about the evidence we were going to give—our statements had been taken down in the solicitor's office—nothing took place about it being necessary</p>

               <p>for me to corroborate my brother I am Positive of that; nothing of the kind was said; I never saw him above three or four times during: the intervening trials, and I never spoke to him about what we should say, because we had it in our heads, and it was down in our statements at the solicitor's office—my brother did not tell me to keep as near as I could to what I said at the solicitor's office, or to what was down on the paper; nothing at all like it.</p>

Mr. Guy is my attorney here—he has acted for me before, getting permission to alter a house or a shop—that is the only business—that was about a month ago; no, it was before that, it was before the Morrises came to me—that was the only business—he did not appear for me in any charge against me of violent assault at Margate—I did not appear for myself—I did not plead guilty to a violent assault or to an assault; I said that I was guilty of using strong language, that is all—Mr. James Kirby Vickers did not complain that I had assaulted him on leaving a bathing machine, and thrown him into the sea; if I had done so he would have been wet—he was three-quarters of an hour in the machine, half an hour of which he was dressing, keeping me waiting in the burning sun, and when he opened the door I said "What do you mean?" and shoved him out—I caught hold of him—I had to pay the costs of the Court, and was bound over to keep the peace in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three months, with a surety—that was the latter end of August, I fancy—he was a stranger to me, a visitor there bathing—it came on in the County Court in September, I think—it was not after my recognisances, I am sure of that—the action against me was for the balance of account—I was beaten and paid a set-off, and the Judge said that there was only oath against oath, but I might try the case again—he no suited me, he said that my set-off was not proved—I met</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drysalter and sauce manufacturer, of Duncan Road, Hackney—up to a fortnight before he was charged the prisoner was in my employ as traveller—he gave me no notice of his intention to leave—his duties were to collect orders and accounts, and remit the same to me every night—he was allowed 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week for expenses and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week for salary—he was not entitled to give his services to any one but myself—on the 9th November I sent him to Luton in Bedfordshire, of which I have a memorandum in ink in his own handwriting on his order-sheet—I produce his letter of the same night. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "November 9th, 1880. Bedford Station. Dear Sir,—Enclosed you will find cheques from Hawkes and Simons, Bedford. I am just off to Northampton. Enclosed you will find orders from Luton and Bedford.—Yours truly, F. F. Copping.") I had a customer of the name of Colley at Birmingham—it would be part of the prisoner's duty to collect the accounts due to me from Colley—on the 28th November I received this letter from the prisoner, dated "Cornwallis Hotel, Manchester. Dear Sir,—Both letters to hand, with cheque enclosed for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say you think it unkind of me not writing to you before, but I have been very poorly. I have had a rash come all over my body and hands, which you will see when Income home on Thursday. Enclosed you will find a few small orders. I can scarcely hold the pen as it is; my hands are all discharging. I will send you cheque for all cash to<lb/>morrow. I am going to Liverpool to<lb/>morrow, as I cannot get a cheque to-day—Brown did not pay his account; Colley did; 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that account is to his name, and Barber 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Longman 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," &amp;c. (Signed) "F. F. Copping." He did not send that money, which it was his duty to do—I have charged him with forging that cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I carry on one portion of my business under the name of "Millar and Co."—there is no "Co."—I have three places of business—I have just started another business at 49, Nicholas Road, Yarmouth—I carry on business in the name of "Richards and Co.," "Millar and Co.," and "Copeing and Co."—the business at Yarmouth is in ketchup—the invoices went out from there—the business was my own idea—the prisoner's mother lived at 49, Nicholas Road, Yarmouth—the recipe for the ketchup was not his mother's property—they never Bold it to mo; it was my own invention, and it was named "Norfolk ketchup," and has upon it "Pure Norfolk Ketchup, Bottled by F. Copeing, 49, Nicholas Bold, Great Yarmouth"—the prisoner's mother's name was Copeing—it does not say the ketchup was made there, but that it was bottled there—the prisoner's salary being very heavy, and he not being able to sell enough goods to cover his expenses and salary, this business was suggested by me to help pay part of his expenses—in our trade it is the custom to put various names on various things; for instance Worcester Sauce, that is made in London; Reading Sauce is also made in London, and Yorkshire Relish—in every trade there is a little secret, and people like the ketchup from Norfolk better than any<lb/>where else, the same as Cambridge sausages—I first got information of the prisoner receiving those sums and not paying them over by writing to several persons because he had neglected the business—I knew he had received those sums before he wrote to me—I believe I have always stated that this requires explanation—I was examined at the police-court,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188101100031"/>
               <p>when my evidence was taken down and read to me, and I signed it—if it says in the deposition "The prisoner wrote and told me had received those three sums of money before I knew he received them "I have no doubt I said it—I was communicating with Mr. Longman and some hundreds of my creditors, and I was under the impression that I had received a letter beforehand respecting the cheque from Longman, at least, and with regard to Colley and Barber I am not quite sure; if I had looked I should have remembered—my memory is defective on the point—if he told me had received the money he did not pay it over—I suppose he sent me about fifty pounds' to sixty pounds' worth of orders on the 26th November—he accounted for all the other money he received in reference to these letters—it was his duty to send the money the same day he received it—the prisoner says he was a partner; I say he was a traveller—the cheques were always made out to myself—I have a customer named Sutton—I have not a cheque drawn in the prisoner's name—I did receive one drawn in his name from Sutton, who is a sauce manufacturer, in reference to ket<lb/>chup—it was not endorsed or paid in—I am not awaiting the result of this trial before I endorse it—the cheque was originally made out "F. Copping"—it is now altered into "Copeing"—Mr. Sutton did that; he made the alteration about two days after the prisoner's wife gave it to me; before the prisoner was charged—I am waiting for another cheque from the same man—I cannot tell whether it is usual for a man of business to carry a cheque about dated since the 27th November for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and keep it without endorsing it—that is the first cheque I have had from Sutton and Company, and it was my first transaction with them—Mr. Sutton is not here—I never said at the police-court that I was awaiting the result of this trial before I endorsed the cheque—Mr. Sheepwash, of New Brompton, is a customer of mine, and Hdwes, of Friar Street, Beading—I have never received cheques from them drawn in their names; I paid the prisoner's salary to his wife every Saturday—I never took receipts from him; I have his letters acknowledging the cheques—the date of the last one is November 29; it is pinned to the depositions—the business at Great Yarmouth does not pay at present—we had only just started it when he went on his first journey—these are the first orders—I did not say in my circular that I had the mushrooms direct from the marsh farmers of the district—the prisoner got that circular up, and I would not allow one of them to be sent out—I objected to it on trade grounds, because it told a palpable falsehood—if I sold "Yorkshire Relish," which was made in London, that would not be open to the same objection; it is not a fraud to take a place in Norfolk, because people in London think they get better ketchup there, and to sell it as Norfolk ketchup though made in London—we do not send it to Norfolk—it is a trade practice; people can think it comes from Norfolk if they choose; that is, no doubt, the reason why I took the place there—I believe some prints of the circular were sent out, but I had it withdrawn directly; it was not published with my sanction—a proof was not submitted to me—I gave the prisoner the money to have invoices and tablets printed, not the circulars—I gave him no directions for them; he had the invoices and tablets printed, and came to me for the money—I never saw the bills; I left it to his discretion; our agreement as to salary was verbal—I am the absolute proprietor—the prisoner collected the orders, sent them up to me, and I executed them; mine are all credit customers—I had carried on the business for 20 years</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188101100032"/>
               <p>before I knew the prisoner; he knew no more of his business than a cat before he came to me—there is no truth in the suggestion that he was my partner, and that the profits were to be divided Between us; I gave him no reason to believe it—I have a customer named Flett, of Liverpool; he wrote to me to say he had paid the prisoner his account, for which he never accounted—I think his letter is with the depositions. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Sir,—I enclose you cheque value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in payment of the two hogs<lb/>heads of ketchup. Please forward remaining three hogsheads at your convenience.") That cheque did not come to hand; that was in October—I have not charged the prisoner with forging that cheque; the prisoner's letter is dated 28th November—I gave him into custody as soon as I could find out where he was; I did not give him a chance of repaying me the money before I gave him into custody; very likely I shall not endorse Mr. Button's cheque at all, for the simple reason that he has agreed to pay me the full amount in my own name—I trade in that name; I had no reason for holding it over—I went to Mr. Sutton to stop the prisoner getting any more money, and told him exactly how it was—he knew the prisoner as F. Copeing; my Christian name is not Frederick; I believe the prisoner's is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Those three accounts in Copeing's name charged in the indictment were not for ketchup, but for sauce and various goods; I could not ask the prisoner for the money, because he had gone off—I had a letter from him a week before, on the 22nd of November, enclosing some orders, and asking for a cheque to be sent to him; it is in the prisoner's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Grand Hotel, Birmingham, Nov. 22nd, 1880. Dear Sir,—Enclosed you will find a few small orders for Coventry, also a cheque from Ambrose and Co. Bell, of Coventry, will send his account on. Barber paid cash 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I am just off to Gloucester. Address me at Cornwallis Hotel, Ducie Bridge, Manchester. I shall be there to<lb/>morrow, when I shall want a cheque for expenses. Signed, Copping.") I sent him a cheque to Manchester according to his instructions, and I never heard anything of him for eight days, when I got the letter dated 28th November—in the meantime I had stopped all the accounts as far as I could; he got those three accounts before I had time to stop them; there<lb/>fore that week he was doing nothing for me at all, virtually he was on the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—when I got that letter I sent him a telegram in the morning to tell him to come home—he came home some weeks after—about half an hour after I sent that telegram I received a communication from Liver<lb/>pool, on which I telegraphed to Liverpool, telling him to come home—I neither saw nor heard any more of him until he was in custody on the 16th December—I had not given information to the police to arrest him—I was waiting for him to come home, knowing he must come home some time or other—I did not know where he was, and I could not go and look over the world alter him.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Mitre public-house, Downham Road, Kingsland—on 21st March, 1879, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>: "As barman, second or single, a steady active young man, age 24, used to a country trade, willing and obliging; highest reference from gentleman just left and former employer. Direct, A. B., 190, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey"—I instructed my wife to write in answer to the address, given, and on the same evening Reynolds called at my house; he brought my wife's letter—I asked him if ho had come for the barman's situation—he said "Yes," and that his name was Reynolds; he said he was the person alluded to in the advertisement, and that he Lad received the letter from my wife—I asked where he had been living; he said at the Grapes, Rotherhithe Wall, and that Mr. Cahill, who kept the Grapes, was his master; he said he had lived there nine months—I asked him if they would give him a character—he said "Yes"—I said, "When can I see Mr. Cahill? I cannot go this evening"—he said, "To<lb/>morrow morning"—I said, "I will endeavour to go there"—I went the next morning to the Grapes; I saw Cahill; I asked him if he had had a man in his employ named Joseph Reynolds; he said he had—I said, "Because he has made an application to me for a barman's situation;" I asked the reason that he was leaving—Cahill said, "I wanted him to do the potman's place as well as the barman's"—I said, "You can hardly expect a man to go back; he wants to go forward, I should think;" I asked him how long he had lived with him—he said, "Nine months," distinctly—I said, "Is he sober, honest, and industrious?"—he said, "Yes, so much so that, as I deal in glass, he takes it out at times in my interest"—I said upon that character I should take him—the Grapes is a very small house—I asked where I could find Reynolds; I think he said it was in the Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, at a shoemaker's shop; I went there; I saw a young woman and left a message—on the following Monday, 24th March, Reynolds commended his duty with me—he con<lb/>tinued in my employment, up to the 1st February, 1880—between those</p>

               <p>days I noticed a considerable falling-off in ray takings I have made a statement taken from my till-book, which I have brought here; it is in my own handwriting—Reynolds was the only person in the bar with the exception of my wife, my son, and myself, but my wife never served; my son William served and myself—I take the corresponding months of '78, '79, and '80; taking 10 months from March, '78, my takings were 4,610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; from March, '79, they were 4,122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and the following 10 months, from March, '80,4,709<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the latter increase, perhaps has arisen through, an alteration I have had made in my place—on 24th April, when the, prisoner was out, I took 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. over and above any of the days that he was in; on 27th May I took 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more; on the 18th August 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more; those are days when he went for a holiday—I always made an entry when he was out—he was in the country on the 10th and 11th of September, and on those days my takings were 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. over and above the other days in that week, and on the 9th October I took 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—unfor<lb/>tunately I had to take my wife to Matlock, and my takings fell con<lb/>siderably; on 29th October my general takings fell down from 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the day I was away—on 11th October I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I was laid up for several days with a sore throat—on the 16th December there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—on Sunday, let February, I called Reynolds into my parlour; I said, "What name did you give me when you came here?"—he said, "Joseph Reynolds"—I said, "How is it that my children find your linen marked 'E. M.'?"—he hesitated to give an answer—I said, "You took the name of George;" he wished to be called George instead of Joseph; I did not get a satisfactory answer with regard to the linen—I said, "Let me see, how long a character did I have with you"—he said, "Nine months I think you had"—I said, "Where did you live before?"—he said, "With Mr. Simpson, of Broad Wharf"—I said, "What was your reason for leaving there?"—he said, "Mr. Simpson died, and the potman and I removed the body and made a jeer, and it came to the lady's knowledge and she discharged me"—I said, "Do you know I have long complained of the falling-off of my trade?"—he said, "Yes, I know you have," or something of that character, I cannot recollect the exact words, it is a long time ago—I said, "Is it true that you had a man in here asking you for money?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "And have you been out a day or two looking after him?"—he hesitated, then said, "Yes, I think I have"—I said, "You made a mistake by doing so"—he warmed up about that time and said, "I do not know what you are getting at"—I said, "I am simply asking you questions"—"Oh," he said, "I shall not stop and sleep here to-night"—I said, "I do not discharge you, you clearly understand you are not discharged"—he left of his own accord; he asked for some brandy as he was going away, and my wife gave him some; I saw no more of him till the next morning; it was between 11 and 12 o'clock at night when he left—the next morning when I saw him he asked for his wages; I refused to pay them—he asked if he might take his box away; I said, "Yes, you can take it"—I have not seen him since; I have not been applied to for his character; I have had no communication with him.</p>

I am a traveller in mineral waters, of 2, Longfellow Road, Mile End Road—I have known Cahill as landlord of the Grapes, and did business with him all the time he was there, delivering mineral water twice a week; Reynolds has taken the goods of me when nobody else was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London and Provincial Bank, Kingsland branch—on 13th November a genuine order in Mr. Merton's writing was brought for a cheque-book for Mr. Merton, which was supplied—shortly afterwards this order scribbled in pencil on an envelope was produced, "Please stop number of cheque-book just sent. I put it on the counter, and it was stolen; please send another of 50 cheques by bearer"—that is not Mr. Merton's writing, but the tale seemed so plausible that we acted upon it, but took the precaution to send the second cheque-book payable to bearer instead of to order, because they are of a different colour; that was about 1 o'clock—I do not know whether it was brought by man, woman, or child—about half an hour afterwards a boy presented the first cheque out of the second-book, filled up for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not like the look of the signature, and had the boy detained while I went to see Mr. Merton—I subsequently made up a packet of coppers for the boy, and instructed him; I followed him to where he was to meet some one at a public-house five minutes' walk off, but the person was gone—this cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the second cheque out of the same book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the boy that I should follow him, and he went to a place where there was no man; I do not think he took me to a wrong place, or that he was an accomplice of the man; he looked a nice honest boy—the time which elapsed would make the man suspect that something was wrong—we have forms for the delivery of cheque-books, but they are not always used—I cannot remember whether the order was brought by the same boy who brought the cheque.</p>

               <p>told me to go over to the London and Provincial Bank across the road, and take this cheque, and meet him at the Lamb; he did not say what for, but he asked whether I could sign my name—I took the cheque, and waited—ultimately a packet was given me—I then went up the street, but the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know a man named Evans—I saw several men at the station and looked at them all; they asked me whether I knew any of them, and I said "No;" if the prisoner was among them he may have stood in a different position.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant N</hi>). The prisoner came to Dalston Station and I said "What about this cheque?"—he said "Well, I am all right, I will tell you all I know about it. A man named Evans called at my house, 3, Half Moon Passage, about 3 o'clock this afternoon; he came up to my bedroom and said Harry, get up and come along with me and get this cheque cashed, and I will pay you what I owe you.' I had lent him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when we were out in the evening. I got up and came downstairs; we both went out together to the Adam and Eve, Aldersgate, and asked the landlord if he would cash it; he would not do so, and we went from there to Kingsland, to a public-house. We went in there and he tried there to get it cashed; the woman said 'No, I don't cash cheques.' We then went up High Street; Evans went to a cornchandler's, he could not get it there, and he said 'Here, Harry, you take it over to the corner and see whether you can get it.' That was Mr. Morton's shop, where the cheque came from. Evans said 'Don't go there, I shall lose my work.' I went to the pawnbroker's, and when I came out I could not find Bill anywhere"—I said "Who is Bill?"—he said "Bill Evans"—I said "Where does he live?"—he said "I don't know"—we made inquiries, but could not find Evans's address, and have not been able to find it since—the pawnbroker's is at the corner, close to Mr. Morton's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not found out anything against the prisoner—I believe there is a person named Evans—the prisoner said that Evans worked fur Mr. Morton's brother, and while he was out on bail he went with me to try to find him—he told me that Mr. Clark introduced Evans to him—Cane, a detective, was called for the prisoner at the police-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was knocked down by one man, and another kicked me in the groin; these two men took me home, and next day I went into the infirmary. I was there ten or twelve days, and was then charged with burglary. If I had committed the crime I should not have gone to Kensington Infirmary, where I was bred and brought up. These are the trousers I wore that night, and there is no dye on them, or they would have been taken to the station. I was not bodily sick. I could not walk from the kick I got on my thigh, but I could bear speaking to, and he ought to have come and charged me. If I had jumped out of his window I could not run away two miles, for I could not stand. My trousers leg got a little wet when I was knocked down.</p>

I am a widow, and carry on business as a jeweller at 138, Great Portland Street—on the night of 24th December, Christmas Eve, I and my family retired to rest about 12.30—I saw every door fastened before retiring—the staircase window was closed and the blind down; I am not certain whether it was fastened—at 2.30 I was awoke by a very loud noise like the crashing of a door; I jumped out of bed, opened my door, and went out on the landing and called out "Who's there?"—I heard footsteps on the stairs, I should think of three or four persons—I was very much alarmed, and called "Police!" and "Murder!"—I went back into my bedroom, lighted my candle, and went downstairs—on going down I saw that the staircase window was open and the blind pulled up—I went down and opened the street door as quickly as possible, and I saw the policeman Ward standing at the door with one of the prisoners, I think Williams, but am not positive—he brought him into the hall—I did not miss anything; I had valuable jewellery in the shop—I had no son or any male assistant living with me at the time—the noise I heard proceeded from the door leading from the parlour to the shop, at the foot of the stairs—there is a cistern outside the staircase window, about five or six feet below it, resting on the wall that separates my house from the next—a person could get from the wall on to the cistern, and could with difficulty reach the window.</p>

I was on duty in Great Portland Street on the morning of Christmas Day about 2.30—I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" and at the same time I saw the two prisoners and another man running towards me—they came out of 140, Great Portland Street, which is next door to 138—I dropped back into a door<lb/>way till they got right opposite me; I then rushed out and caught Williams; the other two escaped—there is a lamp right opposite the street door where I caught them; I noticed the other two men—Under<lb/>wood was one of them; the other is not yet in custody—I had known Underwood before; he had asked me to drink, I believe on the Tuesday night before, but I refused—when I caught hold of Williams I said "Which door did you come out of?" he said "I have done nothing, let me go"—I said "What is that woman calling 'Murder!' and 'Police!' for?" he said "I don't know"—I said "I shall take you back"—I did so, and saw Mrs. White open the door; she said "Oh dear, policeman, do come in"—I took Williams into the passage—he said "Will you allow me to put my top coat on?" he had it on his arm—I said "Yes"—he put his hand into the right-hand pocket and pulled out this lamp—I said "This is a nice plaything to have about you at this time of the morning"—he said "It does not belong to me"—I said "Well, it is a curious thing you should have it in your pocket if it does not belong to you"—it was not alight; my lamp was, and I had turned it on—he set, the lamp down in the right-hand corner by the door, as if he did not wish me to see it—I said "I shall see what you have about you"—he said "You will not search me here; if you search me you will take me to the station"—I insisted on searching him there, and found on him this box of silent matches—I examined the door in the passage, and found marks of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on it—I afterwards saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> which corresponded with those marks—at the station I gave a description of the two men who escaped; I did not know their names—on Sunday night I was called to see some persons in the charge room—Underwood was then placed among eight others, and I picked him out at once.</p>

I am the son of Mrs. Kate Watts, proprie<lb/>tress of the Bow Water-house, Woolwich—on Monday, 6th December, I left the house at 11.15 p.m., when the doors were securely closed and the property safe—about 9.30 next morning I found the back room leading into the store broken open—the door was kept permanently nailed up—I missed about a dozen bottles of brandy and nine handkerchiefs out of a desk; also 500 cigars out of the cupboard where the brandy was—the cupboard was not locked; the goods were taken from the store-Bow Water-house is a dwelling-house, and has a store attached to it, but, there is a door leading into the dwelling-house from the store—the property was taken from the ground-floor—I also missed a silver cup and corkscrew, and receipt stamps—I had bought five shillings' worth the night before, and perhaps a few had been used—they were in the drawer on the right of the desk—Brown was occasionally employed by us about the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The house is to the right as you face the street; to the right of the store and right of the public-house, leaving the store in the middle—a street runs between the public-house and the store there is a doorway which leads into the passage of the private house, the same as a billiard-room would be built in your own house—I sent a man named George Fairhead over to the store at 12 o'clock on the night in question—I know a man named Cooper who has been employed by us—he did not go to the store with Fairhead that evening—there was some suspicion at the time on the part of the detectives that Cooper had been to the store—a search was matde at Cooper's house—I believe Cooper knows Brown—he lives about fifty yards from Brown's house—both houses are about fifty yards from the store.</p>

I am clerk at the District Post-office, Woolwich—on Tuesday, the 7th December, Matheson came to the post-office about 5 p.m.—he asked me to change about five shillings' worth of receipt stamps for him—before, he came in I had received certain infor<lb/>mation, in consequence of which I sent for the police—in order to keep him quiet I passed the stamps back to him to count—he tried to leave the office twice—I said "Where did you get them from?" he said</p>

               <p>"From a fellow who was going to India"—I said "You will have to wait for a few minutes"—he said "I will call again; I have somewhere else to go to;" leaving the stamps with me—he walked towards the door; I had already stationed a messenger there, and I made a signal and he shut the door—he returned to corner of the office and stood there for a few minutes; then he said "Give me the stamps back and I will call again"—I said "I cannot do that; you must wait a few minutes"—he then returned to the place in the corner of the office, where he was pre<lb/>viously standing, and waited there until the constable came.</p>

               <p>of the store had been opened by a skeleton key or a false key—a man on entering would have to get over the gates where the vans are kept, and open the store door—the door that was nailed up is the one that leads up into James Place, a passage running alongside of the shed; you would not open that to get into the shed—the door in the shed was nailed up from within, and I found marks on the door as if this piece of iron had been used (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went that morning with Inspector Clark to Brown's lodgings, which are two doors off the prosecutrix's—I told him I was given to understand that he had some person in the house last night—he said he ad not, and he invited me and the inspector up to examine the room, which we did—we found nothing that morning, and went away—about 5.30 the same evening I was sent for to the police-station, when Matheson was brought in—the stamps were shown to me, and I said "How do you account for these?" he said that Gunner Whitlock, of the Depot Brigade, had left for India that morning, and had given them to him—I said "Where did you sleep last night?"—he said "In the depot barracks"—I made inquiries, in consequence of which I came back and said to the prisoner "From inquiries I have made I find your statement is false as to where you slept last night;" he said "I am very sorry I have told you a lie about the stamps; Gunner Whitlock did not give them to me; I picked them up by Mrs. Watts's urinal"—I said "The stamps are perfectly clean"—he took a handkerchief out of his pocket, and said he picked that up there also—I said "This is also clean"—he made no answer to that—I then told him he would be charged with committing this burglary, enumerating the articles at the time—he said "I did not steal them; I was in Brown's room when he brought the property in, and he gave me the handkerchief and stamps"—on searching Matheson I found on him a pocketbook, and in it this note. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Harry,—Meet me at Dockyard Station at 6 o'clock to-night.—Yours truly, H. T. B. P.S.—Do not come to house.") I do not know whether Brown's initials are T. H. B. or H. T. B.—I called his attention to the note, and asked him where he got it from; he said that Brown had sent it to him by a little red-headed boy—I asked him if he knew the boy's name, and he said "No"—about 10.15 the same night I and Inspector Phillips met Brown in Frances Street, and apprehended him—I showed him this note—I afterwards accompanied Phillips to Brown's house, where the inspector found the property—I found two keys, one of which opened a private door of a house next door to the store—since then I have ascertained Brown had that key from a place at Blackheath, where he was in service.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Mint Street, Borough; Mr. Peakallis the landlord of; that house—I occupy a room behind the shop on the ground floor; I knew the deceased woman Hannah Harrington—she and her husband, the prisoner, lived in one room on the first-floor back; they had lived there about four months—the prisoner is a labourer—the deceased worked at botton-hole making—on Saturday night, the 20th of November, at about 7 o'clock, they were at home—I heard them quarrel<lb/>ing in their own room; I was in my room—I heard the deceased say "Don't beat me, Charley; what have I done?"—the quarrel lasted about a quarter of an hour; during that time I heard scuffling about the room, and a window broken; I couldn't hear the blows—about 10 minutes after<lb/>wards I heard the deceased come downstairs and go out—she returned in about half an hour, and went up to her room; she tried to get in, but could not—the prisoner was in the room—I heard her say it was a shame she should be locked out of her own room—she was crying; she tried the door again, but did not get in—she sat at the top of the stairs against our own door, crying—a little while after that, about 9 o'clock, I heard her scream, and then she fell very heavily down the stairs—she did not strike against anything; she fell in the passage—I went and picked</p>

               <p>her up; she was lying on her left side facing my door, which is on the left-hand side at the bottom of the passage—the stairs have no balustrades—she was in a very bad state; she could not get up herself—she then walked upstairs to her own room door; she tried to get in, but did not—she sat on the stairs for about 10 minutes—the prisoner then opened the door, and told her sharply to come in; they were then fighting again, but I could not hear what was said—I heard them scuffling about the room; I heard nothing more that night—she was not drunk; she walked upstairs herself, and she had got her husband's supper before that; he was very drunk at 10 o'clock next morning the deceased came downstairs for a pail of water; she was groaning very much—she said "For God's sake, Charley, come and fetch this pail, for you know I cannot carry it"—he came down, and carried it up—I did not see or hear anything more of her till the 30th—I did not notice the room door on the Sunday—during all the week the padlock was on the door, and the door was shut; I noticed the padlock on the door every day—I heard the prisoner go out every morning; I did not hear or see any one else go in—I never heard or saw the deceased; I tried the door twice during the week, but got no answer—on the 30th Mrs. White called me in; I went upstairs; the door was then unfastened, and we went into the room—I saw the deceased lying on the bed in a very dirty state, and she was very ill; she could not get out of bed or sit up, and the bed was wet and filthy—she made a statement to me—the prisoner was not present—I took her up some port wine in the evenin about 7 o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner in the room, and the deceased was sitting up in a chair in her shift; she was very dirty—I advised the prisoner to get a doctor for her—I asked him why he aid not send for me or call me; he said he did not know where to get a doctor—I asked him to make her a fire, and get her some tea there was no fire in the room—he did not answer me—I made the bed, and tried to put her into it again; he would not let me—he said she did not want to go to bed, she had been lying in bed all day—I told him to go to the relieving officer, or to the police-station in the Borough, then he would see Mr. Cluny there, and he would give him an order for the doctor—he said he would go, but he did not—I then left the room for the night—next day, the 1st December, about 11 o'clock, I attended to her; the prisoner was then at his work—he had been out since the early morning she was then in bed, and in a bad state—in the evening I went for the landlord, and he sent for a policeman about 7 o'clock the prisoner came home in a very drunken state; I grumbled at him for not getting a doctor—he said he did not know where to get a doctor—the deceased said "you told him the night before where to get one," and she called him a beast and a vagabond—he moved towards the bed, and she screeched, and said "Don't let him come near me "—I then went downstairs-next morning the landlord gave me a letter to the relieving officer, and she was taken to the Infirmary—on the night that I picked her up I did not see any wet or any other mess on the stairs.</p>

               <p>she got into her room again, and I immediately heard them quarrelling again and scuffling—she had had some drink that night, but not enough to make her intoxicated; she had had too much, she was slightly under the influence of drink—there is no balustrade to the stairs on the lower part; there is a square landing outside the prisoner's room, and then the stairs; there are one or two rails on the top; those only go for about two steps down, and then there are no others—I hadn't seen the deceased in the course of the Saturday; she had been to work—I never saw her intoxicated; she would get too much to drink on a Saturday night; this was on a Saturday night—the prisoner frequently took too much—she was groaning very much when she came down for the pail of water; I can't say whether it was empty or full—on the evening of the 30th I tried twice to put her into bed, but he would not let me; he did not forcibly prevent me; he said she did not wish to go to bed, because she had been in bed all day—the prisoner was in the habit of going to his work, and coming home in the evening; he generally came home drunk; he was very drunk on the 30th—I frequently heard them quarrelling in their room, and generally fighting.</p>

I can prove I was at work at the time this happened. She was drinking that day with a man named Connor, at the Horse and Cart, Tooley Street"—I took him to the Newington Infirmary, and the doctor of the infirmary, Dr. Grosse, as the prisoner and I stood close to the deceased's bed, asked the deceased, "Do you know this man?"—she said "Yes, sir, he is my husband"—the doctor said "Is this the man that injured ypu?"—she said "Yes, sir"—he said "Are you quite sure this is the man that injured you?"—she said "Quite sure, sir"—the prisoner then took hold of her hand and said "I did not kick you downstairs, my dear, did I?"—she said "Yes you did; you know you did,"—I was present when Mr. Bridge, the Magistrate, attended for the purpose of taking her statement—the prisoner was present, and had an opportunity of asking her questions, and he did ask her several questions.

I had bought a shawl, and then came home and got some supper, and then he came in and pushed me downstairs; that is the truth. He was tipsy and he began with his bullying. I had had a glass. He had been home about half an hour before he knocked me down; it is a straight stair; I was on the stairs waiting for him. He had gone out with his son-in-law drinking; he had locked me out of the room at the first commencement. I sat on the stairs. I stopped outside till he came</p>

               <p>in again. He left me sitting on the stairs when he locked me out. He was away three-quarters of an hour. I said 'You think more of your son-in-law than you do of me.' He began kicking like a donkey; he gave me several kicks; he had boots on. I was perfectly well and right before he kicked me. He has several times kicked me before. I have been married four years next March. I am sure these injuries were not done by falling downstairs. I came upstairs after he pushed me down, and then the worst began. There were other persons in the house, but nobody came to my assistance. This happened last Saturday fortnight; it was nearly a fortnight before I came here. I screamed out dreadfully.

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of St. Saviour's In<lb/>firmary, and am a M.E.C.S. and L.C.P.—on 2nd December I saw the deceased in the Infirmary—she was in a very bad state; in great pain—she was not able to move; I examined her—there was a very severe inflamed bruise on the right buttock, about eighteen inches by twelve, extending over the whole of the buttock on the right side; there were two very severe bruises over the sacrum, at the bottom of the spine; they were inflamed; the skin was broken; each of them were about as large as the hand—there was a bruise over the left buttock about as big as the palm of the hand, on the outer side of the thigh; a long bruise by the knee-joint, about three inches to one and a half, ap<lb/>parently caused by a kick—there was another bruise just outside the knee-joint, below the other, and several bruises all about both legs and the body; the akin was not broken—there was a cut over the left eyebrow, about an inch and a half long, nearly healed—it would require considerable violence to cause those bruises; they could be done by kicking—I should say they were about a fortnight old—at that time she was able to take nourishment fairly well—but suppuration set in with the more severe bruises—she was not emaciated, but she complained of being very hungry and not having any food—she rapidly got worse, weaker and weaker—a great quantity of pus was discharged from the wounds—the right buttock sloughed largely and very deep, and there was also much sloughing in the bruise over the sacrum—that was caused</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188101100079"/>
               <p>by the violence that had been used—large abscesses formed, and a great deal of matter was discharged—the places were black with a great deal of red bruising around—if proper care and attention had been paid I do not think abscesses would have formed; not to such an extent—I don't mean that there would not be some—she died on 18th December; fourteen hours after I made a post—mortem examination with Mr. Jackson—I have the notes of the examination—Mr. Jackson took them down—she was a perfectly healthy woman—there was nothing to account for death ex<lb/>cept the bruises, and the shock and exhaustion consequent thereon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The sloughing arose from the wounds—a bad atmo<lb/>sphere and dirty surroundings would produce excessive sloughing; it would aggravate it—there were no injuries to account for death apart from the sloughing; the injuries were not such as in themselves would be mortal; not if properly treated; they did not affect any vital part; it was the non—treatment or the bad treatment that probably caused death—pyaemia like that would not be caused by simply living in an unsanitary condition; you would expect it in the joints—I have no doubt if properly treated under good conditions she might have got better; of course I cannot say she would; I think she would have stood a very good chance of getting better.</p>

From her statement to me and from her manner I should say that she had not had sufficient food, that of course would be another condition that would lead to this bad state—she was not in a state of starvation; there was a great deal of fat about the body; there were no signs of drink in the internal organs—the stomach and liver were per<lb/>fectly healthy—she was not a drunkard; she had not a drunkard's liver—habitual drunkards have a peculiar state of the liver and stomach.</p>

If you don't tell me I will lock you up"—he jumped up and rushed towards her, got hold of her the second time, threw her down, and fell on her—I saw him put his left hand into his left trousers pocket, and draw out a knife and put it to her throat-before I had time to get her away he had her throat cut—he went, to make a second attempt; she put up her hand and caught the knife, and in trying to get it away she cut her thumb—while I was pulling him off he said, "If you don't mind I will do the same to you"—I got him off; my sister crawled up, and I had her taken downstairs—she was bleeding from her neck and hand—I met Mrs. Collins on the stairs, who assisted her, and she was sent to the hospital—I met a con<lb/>stable in the court and sent him to the house—when I went back I saw a quantity of blood on the floor, table, and bed, and the prisoner was sitting on the bed—I found the duplicate in a vase on the mantelpiece.</p>

I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 16th December—I saw Annie Kipper when she was brought in; she had a wound on the right side of her throat, from the lower part extending to the side downwards towards the middle line to the chest, and then extending with a scratch across the chest—it was about four inches long, cutting through the skin, and then ran an inch and a half, and a scratch beyond; the upper part was about an inch and a half deep—it had cut slopingly through the skin—she was an in-patient till 28th December—the wound might have been serious, but it was not, and she went on very satisfactorily—it might have been inflicted with a knife of this description—the lower part of her left thumb was cut for about an inch and a half; such a wound might be inflicted by her putting her hand against the knife.</p>

I went to light the fire to make my breakfast; she filled the milk-jug with water and threw it over me, and swore she would open me with it. I said nothing to her. She said "Go out of my place; I have had enough to do with you." I said I would not go home. She began swearing at me, and said "Go to your b—old mother for a lodging." They went out to work. The sister blamed me for threatening both their lives, and saying I would pawn everything in the place. When they came home I was lying down in front of the fire. I bought a half-pound of steak and coals, and made a fire and cooked the steak. The bread was on the table, and she threw it at me. I went to cut some bread. She said "Ain't you gone?" I said "No." She rushed at me again, and clawed me down my face. The marks are on my face. I pushed her away, she rushed at me again, and caught hold of my waistcoat, which is all torn. I felt myself going and put my arm on the table. In the struggle she said "Frank, have mercy upon me." I said "Well, I will; what have I done?" She said "He has cut my throat," and when I saw that I began to cry. The policeman walked into the room and said "Where has this blood come from?" I said "I suppose from my finger.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Morley, of Longfield Street, Redhill—I am a midwife; I went to see the prisoner on 9th December, to attend her; she gave birth to a child at 11.30 that night; it was a fine, full-grown female child—I attended her from the 9th to the 14th December daily, and Mrs. Charwood, her mother-in-law, undertook the charge of the baby from the 14th—no doctor attended the prisoner—she was in excellent health and very good spirits—I have known her and her husband fifteen or sixteen months—after the 14th I saw her next upon Friday, the 17th—I was sent for and went at once to her house in Milk Street; I went up to her room and found her in bed, look<lb/>ing very wild and strange about the eyes—I saw blood on the floor, and asked her how it came there; she said "It is where I cut the baby with the scissors"—she said that she took the scissors from a nail over her sister's portrait, and had put them on the mantelshelf—I saw them there covered with blood—Mrs. Charwood was there in a fainting fit in a chair and Mrs. Constance also—I saw the child dead and lying on a pillow—I saw that it was quite dead—I waited till the sergeant came, and then I removed it to the back room—Mr. Kelsey, the doctor, came with the sergeant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at Red Hill—on Friday, December 17, about the middle of the day, I was called to a house in Milk Street to see Mrs. Norman—I went upstairs into her" room and saw her sitting up in bed very pale and in a very excited state of mind—I had not seen the child then—I spoke to her before I saw the child—I knew that she had killed the child, and I asked her why she had done it—I said "Why did you do this? why did you kill your child?" and after repeating the question several times she said "Because it cried"—I asked her if that was the only reason—she said "Two nights ago I thought I should kill it"—I asked her if something told her she must get out of bed and kill the child—she said "No; I got out of bed be<lb/>cause it cried, and I put the scissors into its brain"—she also said that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188101100086"/>
               <p>her husband had been out late at night, and that she had told him that she should kill the child—while speaking to her I was noticing the con<lb/>dition she was in; she seemed not to be able to collect her ideas, in fact she seemed to have no ideas at all; she did not seem to be all affected by the crime she had done—it did not seem to make the slightest impression upon her—having had that conversation with her I came to the conclu<lb/>sion that she was suffering from puerperal mania—that is frequently attendant upon confinements; it generally comes on from twenty-four hours to a fortnight after the confinement, and very suddenly, without any warning—there are no premonitory symptoms at all—I have attended her since, and saw her on various occasions—I was examined at the police-court, and said "I am of opinion that the prisoner is still suffering from puerperal insanity"—I saw the child immediately after I put those questions to the mother—it was then lying in a corner of the room on a pillow covered up with some sheets; it was burnt; nearly the whole of the skin of the body was charred and blackened, and its head had a wound on the top penetrating the whole depth of the brain; that was the cause of instantaneous death.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's—on 14th December Mrs. Boddy was brought in, stabbed in two places on her chest, and on her right side between the second and third ribs, and on the left side was a similar wound, and a jagged wound on the upper part of the left arm—the first wound went into the chest wall, but how deep I cannot say</p>

                  <lb/>I could trace it three-quarters of an inch, and it was three-quarters of inch long—it was not safe to trace it deeper—the second wound was only quarter of an inch deep, because it struck the collar-bone—the wound on. her arm simply went through the skin and tissue of fat below, but did not separate the tissues—there was a large wound on the front of the fore<lb/>arm transversely across it for three and a quarter inches, and from above down<lb/>ward it was four inches—it injured the nerve and affected the muscles of the forefinger—the upper portion was three inches deep—she was very faint from loss of blood, and very exhausted, and was laid up until 1st January is the hospital—she suffered four or five days from fever, and we were uncertain what course it would take—the wounds were dangerous when I admitted her—the wound on her right arm will, I think, impair the movement of her fingers from the laceration of the muscles—this pen<lb/>knife would produce the wounds.</p>
