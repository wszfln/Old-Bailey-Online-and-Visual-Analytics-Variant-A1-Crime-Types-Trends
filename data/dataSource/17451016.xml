My wife took the Prisoner in out of the London work-house naked, and clothed her, and kept her about a fortnight, and then she robbed me of these things, (she is a relation of mine) which she confessed she took out of my drawer, and told me she had pawned one ring, and the snuff-box to one Greg in Barnaby street, Southwark; and one to another person, and the other two rings she had given to two of the keepers of the London work-house. One of them told me she owed him 7 s. and three half-pence; and I could not get either of them. I was informed that one was sold for 19 shillings. The Prisoner told me she had lost the guinea, and the sleeve buttons out of a handkerchief she had tied the things up in, and that she took a coach, and the coachman went away with the hat.</p>

               <p>Hutchins. I had known the Prisoner's father and mother a great while, for they often brought things, and took them out very honestly; when the Prisoner brought this gown, I did not care to take it from her, but bid her bring her mother. I asked her whether the gown was hers, and she said, yes, and I lent her six shillings upon it. When she was taken up, I asked her how she came by it, and she said she had it of a person in the street. <rs id="t17451016-3-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

I have known her about three years and an half, she is about 26 years of age, and able to work, but does not love it. She says the gentlemen shall maintain her without working.</p>
               <p>White. I am out of my senses sometimes, and I have hanged myself , and the master of the workhouse has cut me down again. Ask him whether he has not.</p>
               <p>Fletcher . No, I never did cut her down. She can sham mad when she pleases. I do not take her to be mad.</p>

He was in another suit of clothes, and said he had had no other coat on that night: then I went to Mrs. Cooke to ask her whether she could know the man again that run away with the guinea; and when she saw him, she said that is the man who took the guinea out of my hand, and I know him to be the man: the Prisoner said, no, madam, I had none of the guinea. - This was about two hours after the thing was done; the Prisoner had half a guinea in his hand, and I endeavoured to get it out, but could not, but his wife took it out of his hand, and gave it to us, and said that was more than we deserved; then she gave us another shilling, and afterwards pulled out 3 s. 6 d. more, and said we should have no more, but at last she had it.</p>

             (Surgeon.) On Thursday the 3 d of October I was sent for about nine o'clock in the evening to go and see Mrs. Graham: a lad came with the Prisoner at the bar to me, and told me that one of their journeymen's wives had fell down upon a knife and almost killed herself. I found a wound on the lower part of the belly, and part of the caul hung out. I asked her how she came by it; she said her husband did it; said I, he says you fell down upon a knife; and she said again that her husband gave it her. I found very bad symptoms, and that she must die, so I enquired more particularly into the affair. I asked her whether they had had any difference; she said they had no difference; and she said she did not know how he came to do it; but she said he was sometimes troubled with fits. And I satisfied the Coroner's Jury that this wound was the occasion of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment , whether this wound was given by any body, or whether it came by accident?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. She said it was given by her husband, but it is possible such a wound may happen by a person's falling down upon a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sensible to the time of her death?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Very sensible, and therefore I was willing to get all the information I could from her, for I was of opinion she would die soon.</p>

He is subject to convulsion fits, and there are sometimes eight or nine men to hold him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say he was in a fit, and stabbed her in a fit?</p>

            . On the third of this month about seven o'clock in the evening I went out , and my servant brought me notice that a gentleman wanted to buy some goods of me; when I came in the Prisoner said, Sir, Do you know me? I said I did not remember him; said he, I have been your customer before, and have sold you some dollars a while ago [but I cannot remember it;] and he said he had since that belonged to the Prince Frederick privateer, Capt. Talbot commander, that his name was Masterson, and he was chief mate of the Prince Frederick privateer. I asked him what goods he wanted; he said he should want some watches, some buckles, some gold rings, gold buttons, &amp;c. and desired to have the strongest I had in my shop. Accordingly while he was in the shop there was one pair of silver buckles looked out, four silver watches in double cases, and two pair of gold buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more laid out?</p>
               <p>Threlkeld. Not while he was in the shop, but the knee-buckles were to be looked out to the shoes, and some plain gold rings; then this note was produced. I asked him what it was for; he said it was for my security. I looked at the note, and thought it to be a pretty good one, I did not question it in the least. The note was signed by Capt. Talbot. [The note was produced.]</p>
               <p>This is the note the Prisoner at the bar gave me, and left with me as a security for the goods he was to have that night: then he said he was going to the Hermitage, and would be back again in an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160009"/> hour's time. I thought after he was gone if this was a false note it would be a great loss; and I went to a house in the neighbourhood where some gentlemen were, and shewed it to them: they advised me not to deliver the goods, but to bring the person there, and they would talk to him. He came some time afterwards, and some of the gentlemen talked to him, and asked him what post he was in; he said he was first mate of the Prince Frederick privateer , that his name was Masterson, and Capt. Talbot was his commander; but as fortune would have it, there happened to be four gentlemen there who knew him; and the landlord said there were some gentlemen in the house who belonged to the ship, and should know him if he belonged to that ship; and one Mr. McNamar, who came over as a passenger, said he was a villain, for he never was on board the ship; then the Prisoner was for going out, and he did go out, and the landlord of the house brought him back again, and I charged an officer with him, and carried him to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop, I asked him whether he would accept of that note as a security for goods; I mentioned no quantity or kind of goods. Mr. Threlkeld produced only one pair of buckles, and asked whether those were large enough. There is his apprentice, I desi re he may be sworn, to know whether there were any watches or rings produced, or any thing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Capt. Talbot?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes; I have seen him write, and have had letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>Miller. It is some years ago; I think it is about five years since I received a letter from him, and about seven years since I saw him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that his hand?</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe not; neither the body of the note, not the name; the name is not spelt right.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he spell his name?</p>
               <p>Miller. Talbot, and in the note it is with double (ll) and double (tt).</p>

               <p>Chariot. The shop was shut, and my master was not at home.

He pulled out a handkerchief, in which there seemed to be a pretty deal of money, pulled out a 36 s. piece, and wanted change, and said he must have the change in half guineas. I had a bag of money, and in order to give him change I went up stairs, and he came up stairs after me. I poured the money into my lap, and the Prisoner put his hand into my lap, and took out a handful of guineas. I seized his hand, and made him drop them, and several fell upon the ground : said I, you villain, do you come to rob me at noon day? I desired my servant to stop him till I could tell the money, and I missed one guinea; and he offered me the guinea again. He was taken on Butler's wharf, and I carried him before Justice Dennett , and he offered the guinea then.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you understand him?</p>
               <p>Stutwell. He spoke broken English: I am certain he did not want change, because he had 3 l. 10 s. in silver, thirteen guineas, and other money: when he came to me he spoke pretty good English, but when he came to Justice Dennett's he could not understand any English at all.</p>

               <p>Aaron. My Lord, I have something else to say before I come to that. I happened accidentally to come this way. I keep a grocer's shop in Shoe-maker Row, and I believe deal in 900 or 1000 l. a year: I deal in oil, sand, and coals . I went to a wharf to get a load of sand, there was a little side box, and who should sit there but this gentlewoman [Mrs. Stutwell.] I asked her what the sand was a load; she said seven shillings; I said I gave no more than six shillings for white, and six shillings and six pence for red: she got up, and said, get down you Jew son of a bitch, and offered to knock me down, so I went to the next wharf. Ask her, if she did not serve me so; and if you will enquire into my character, there are enough here that know me. Now I come to the matter. I have known the Prisoner about four years, and have dealt with him for more or less; and I believe I have as good a shop as most people. He first bought necessaries for himself of me, and when he set up a little shop for himself, he bought goods of me.</p>

            . A few days before this thing was discovered, I went into Mr. Leger's house for half a pound of butter, and the Prisoner was there, and she was very bad. I asked her if no body was there but herself; she said her mistress was in the garden; presently her mistress came out of the garden in a very great flurry, and Mr. Leger himself came in in a very great flurry, and he said, Tarras, my girl, you are very bad, will you go to bed? and he said she should go to bed, and he called Maudlin to make the bed; said he, will you have the bed warmed? she said I don't care if I have: he said, Maudlin, my poor girl, is a very faithful servant, and she is very bad with them, and has strained herself with carrying coals, she wants the bed warmed. He asked what he should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160012"/> give her; and I said half a pint of ale with sugar and spice: and one Mrs. Lewis came in and said, Mrs. Johnson, have you heard of the murder? I said I had not; she said there was a fine boy in the vault: she put her hand down into the vault three times, and brought up nothing but soil, and the fourth time she put her hand down, she said, here's the child, and I could not think but it must be a girl, but there were some circumstances that made me think it was a boy, for the navel string hung between the boy's legs, and she thought it was a boy by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she married?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I don't know that she is.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she married?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Not that ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her having a child?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I don't know any thing of her having any.</p>
               <p>Coroner. Did she say any thing to you about the child?</p>
               <p>Lewis. On Thursday the first of September she went out for some rolls, I met her at Mrs. Johnson's house, and she said she was very ill with a pain in her bones. I went to Mr. Leger's house, and Mrs. Leger said that Tarras was very bad, so bad that she was forced to go up with a mop and a pail to clean the room: then I said to Mrs. Leger, with your leave shall I go up and see her? and she said, yes: I went up, and Tarras lay upon the bed with her clothes on: the room was wet, and I asked her who had been up to wash the room; she said her mistress had been up with a mop and pail, and cleaned it: she was very much out of order: I sat down by her, and asked her what was the matter with her: said I, have not you miscarried? said she, what makes you think so? I was backward and forward all that day, and Mrs. Leger said, how does Tarras do? I said she was very bad indeed, and that she would not be well of the months. On the ninth of this month one Bellache came and asked after Tarras; said I, what makes you ask after her? he said, if you want to know, go to the vault and satisfy yourself. I asked Mrs. Leger to let me go to her vault, and I went to the vault, and looked down, and saw something, which I took to be a child. I went to Tarras, and said, Tarras, this is your child; said she, Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus ! Molly don't say so. I came into the house, and said to Mr. Leger, there is a child in the vault; what in yours, said he? no, in yours, said I; and he went in, and there was no more said about it. I went to Mrs. Johnson's, and said there was a child in the vault, and we both went together.</p>
               <p>Coroner. Had you any talk with her afterwards whether she had a child?</p>
               <p>Lewis. She said she went to the vault, for she thought she had occasion to go there; and afterwards went into the shed, and said, sick, sick, sick; that she went up stairs, and leaned upon the window, and then she was delivered of the child; this was on the second of September.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that the child was found?</p>
               <p>Lewis. On the ninth of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that Grace said she was delivered as she was leaning upon the window?</p>
               <p>Lewis. That was the day it was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was she delivered?</p>
               <p>Lewis. She said it was on Sunday the first of September.</p>
               <p>Leger's Council. Did she say whether the child was dead, or alive, when she was delivered?</p>
               <p>Lewis. She did not say whether it was dead, or alive.</p>
               <p>Usop's Council. Was there any thing found under the bed in a box?</p>
               <p>Lewis . Yes; there was a box of child-bed linen, and Usop said she bought it in Rag Fair against she was brought to bed, unknown to any body.</p>
               <p>Dorcas Randolph. On Monday the second of September, which was Usop's birth-day, I was abroad with her, and she was very bad; and they said the child was born on the first of September, and was found in the vault on the ninth. I said to her, you have had a child, for there is a child found in the vault. I asked her if she had made any preparation for it; she said she had, and that the box was under the bed; said she, Mrs. Randolph, you are best able to stoop, put your hand under the bed, and pull it out, and I did. She said Mr. Leger had threatened her, and bid her lay it upon James, or the Baker; and then she said, must I tell a lie? and he said, ouy .</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Randolph. On the ninth of September Mrs. Leger did own before the Justice, that the child had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160013"/> a bruise on the head: I said, how came the child to have a bruise on the head? she said that was nothing at all, for it was not done out of malice; and she emptied the pot with the after birth, and she pleaded ignorance, because she never had had a child; for people who have been in labour know more than those who have not.</p>
               <p>Council. When this discourse was with Tarras, was there any talk whether the child was born dead or alive ?</p>
               <p>Randolph. She said she was very bad, and her master came up and helped her in the birth, and parted one from the other, and took it in an apron, and carried it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child dead or alive ?</p>
               <p>Randolph. I cannot say any thing to that.</p>

I put my finger upon the body, and felt the ribs, and then I was afraid of what really was , and found that it was a child, but, I did not care to speak to Mr. Leger about it then: and

            , Surgeon. I was sent for about the 13th of last month, and found a child which was very much putrified . I did not care to open the child, but found upon examining the child, that there was a violent pressure upon the skull, which if that had been given when the child was alive, must have been the occasion of its death.</p>
               <p>Coroner. Was the child full grown ?</p>
               <p>Grundy. In my opinion it was.</p>
               <p>Leger's Council. As to the pressure upon the head of the child, was that given before the child was dead. or after ?</p>
               <p>Grund. I cannot pretend to say whether the wound was given before or after .</p>
               <p>Leger's Council argued, that he could not think there was any evidence to affect Mr. Leger and his wife, and could hardly think there was any to affect the principal. That he was informed Mr. Leger has a wife of his own, and therefore very unlikely he should be guilty of the fact. And that in order to make it a murder, it must be first proved that the child was born alive. [Vide Statute 21. James I.]</p>

             called again at the desire of the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after you found the child in the vault ?</p>
               <p>Johnson. When I found the child in the vault, I went into the kitchen, and fell into, and said to Mrs. Leger, this is a terrible case; and she said Tarras was very bad, and that women in her care are never well of the months. I came out to Mr. Bellache, and he clapped his hand upon my belly, and said, God bless your belly, and said, I hope you will not drop it as somebody has done. Another thing I remember, I saw the child on the 10th of September, and it bled out of one of the ears, I think it was the left ear. On the Tuesday Tarras's mother and another woman were there, and they sent for me, and Mr. Leger said, Mrs. Johnson, you must go up and tell Tarras's mother to bribe the midwife, or else Tarras will be hanged.</p>
               <p>Coroner. She has not answered the question yet. I ask you what Tarras said when you went up to her?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I told her there was a fine child found in the vault, and they said it is yours: and after I had got an acknowledgment from her, that she had been with child, I said, who is the father of the child? and she said my master; and she asked where her master was, and she said, call my master up. I went down to him, and he went up to her, and she wept bitterly: they talked together in French, and I could not understand them; and when he was gone, I asked her what her master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174510160014"/> said; and she said, he says I must lay it to James, or the Baker, or else I shall be hanged.</p>

             ( Constable .) Mrs. Gibbon at the Red Lion in Gray's-inn-lane sent for me, and said she believed the Prisoner was the person that robbed Mr. Fazakerly's servant. I said, Young man, you had better make an ingenuous confession , and it will be the better for you. And then the Prisoner pulled out a watch, and said, this is the watch I took from Whitlaw. I asked him how he could serve a man so, who had been to kind to him . He said, he believed the devil was in him, or the devil possessed him; and he gave me a pair of stockings off his legs, and a short off his back , and owned the taking the shoes, but that he got drunk and lost them: he said he found the key of the stable, and took the things out of the Prosecutor's room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gibbon said, the Prisoner had lived twice with them, and always behaved very handsomly: that she had heard of the robbery, and so took the Prisoner up, and he owned he took the things out of the stable. <rs id="t17451016-21-verdict117" type="verdictDescription">

The Prisoner denied it, but the child said she was sure she had it; and then she pulled it out, and threw it down upon the table. I am sure this is the piece the Prisoner threw down.

               <p>Q. Did the boy tumble down?</p>
               <p>Hewbank . When I saw the cart coming along I called out to the boy, and told him, there was a cart coming, the boy endeavoured to get out of the way, but the cart brushed against his shoulder, threw him down, and went over him.</p>


               <p>Q. Was this in the publick cart way?</p>
               <p>Hewbank . There are no posts there, the boy stood up by a cobler's stall; I took the boy up, but he could not stand; he was carried to a surgeon, and blooded.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses going fast?</p>

               <p>Q. Did the carman give you any answer?</p>
               <p>Blackman. No; the wheel run over the boy.</p>

               <p>Deverall . Not at all; the cart took the slaps off my stall, broke the hinges, threw the boy down, and run over him.</p>
