In the early morning of November 11th I was on duty at the Albany Street Police-stationâ€”about 3.20 the prisoner was brought in by the last two witnessesâ€”they told me in his presence that they had seen him running, and thinking that something was wrong, they ran after him, and immediately they ran after him he threw something awayâ€”they showed me this open knife; it was wet on the blade as though with bloodâ€”I asked the prisoner whose knife it wasâ€”he said, "It id mine"â€”I noticed that his clothes were covered with what looked like flourâ€”I asked him what it wasâ€”he said, "I was drunk last night; I leant against a wall and got the whitewash on me"â€”I examined his hands, and on his right hand he had bloodâ€”I asked him how he accounted for the blood, and he again replied, "I was drunk last night, and must have cut myself"â€”I said, Why were you running?"â€”he said, "I was not running; I was hurrying to get to work; I am a butcher, and work at Farringdon Meat Market"â€”I tried two or three times to close the knife, and the prisoner volunteered to show me the way to close itâ€”he took the knife, placed the back of it. against the iron rail of our dock, and pressed it, the spring is very stiff, and so closed itâ€”about five or ten minutes after the prisoner was brought in Sergeant Lubley came in with a message from Inspector Gough, the prisoner was sitting down thenâ€”</p>

Gristâ€”Mr. Ross was bleeding from the back of his head and his handsâ€”I sent Grist for Dr. Maughan and I accompanied Mr. Ross into the houseâ€”the constable returned with the doctorâ€”we then proceeded to search the houseâ€”on the stairs leading from the house to the bakehouse I found this hatchetâ€”there was some hair on the head of it; it did not look like human hairâ€”blood was on the handle where it fits into the headâ€”it was wetâ€”the doctor took the hair off it, and has got it nowâ€”on the floor of the bakehouse I found this roughly-made life-preserverâ€”it is composed of a piece of lead with a piece of round, and attached by a piece of string to a short rope handleâ€”on the rag when I discovered it, I found a wet spot of bloodâ€”we were then trying to find Conrad Berndtâ€”Grist and I went to the oven, which was heatedâ€”I told Grist to open the door with an iron barâ€”inside we found the remains of a man very much charred and burntâ€”the body had been placed about 2ft. 6in. inâ€”the head was towards the doorâ€”the skull was bared and broken on the right sideâ€”I gave directions for the fire to he drawnâ€”Grist did soâ€”about 5 a.m. I went to the bakehouse again, with Dr. Maughan, the fire was still burning very fiercely, we could not get</p>

               <p>near the body thenâ€”we returned again when the oven had cooled, and then in the presence of the doctor, and under his directions, we removed the body from the oven and placed it in a shellâ€”I saw that one of the kneading troughs was damp near the oven-door, as though it had been washed, and on the damp were some faint stains like bloodâ€”on the wall above the trough there were some splashes of blood; they were dry thenâ€”on a shelf I found this brown hard felt hatâ€”on a stone in the ash<lb/>pit, under the oven, was more bloodâ€”I went to Conrad's roomâ€”on the bed I saw a-suit of clothes, and in the breast pocket of the coat I found this receipt for a watchâ€”the box in the room was openâ€”the room was in great disorderâ€”I then found that the prisoner was already in custody, and I was present when he was charged with this murderâ€”in answer to the charge he said, "I know nothing about it. I do not know the shop"â€”a document was found on the prisoner giving his address as ill, Bartholomew Buildingsâ€”I went thereâ€”he occupied two rooms thereâ€”I saw the bedstead in the bedroomâ€”it had originally four brass knobsâ€”it was an iron bedstead, with brass knobsâ€”when I saw it it had only two; I took off one of the remaining ones (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”the lead forming the head of the life-preserver appears exactly like the brass knobs, as if the lead had been moulded in a corresponding knobâ€”I also brought away two pieces of brass, and in the bottom of one of the knobs was a piece of lead.</p>

I am a Bachelor of Medicine, a Member of the College of Surgeons, an L.C.P. and divisional surgeon to the S Division of policeâ€”on the early morning of November 11th I was called to William Streetâ€”in the parlour I saw Mr. Rossâ€”he had a wound on the scalp at the back of the head, exposing the bone, and a swelling in front of the left eye; on the right hand, between the thumb and forefinger, an incised wound, two and a-half inches long; on the right elbow five abrasions; on the left palm an incised wound three inches long; a second wound on the left hand between the thumb and forefinger; a punctured wound on the chest, a skin wound onlyâ€”it was in a dangerous placeâ€”if it had been deep it would have been dangerousâ€”in his shirt and vest I found cuts corresponding with the cut on his chestâ€”they could have been caused by this knifeâ€”I wound into the bakehouse and looked into the ovenâ€”it was heated to about; 600 degrees Fahrenheitâ€”I saw a human body lying about two and a-half feet insideâ€”the hair of the head had been burned</p>

               <p>offâ€”the bones were exposedâ€”the head was retracted and the bones charredâ€”after some delay the oven was cooled, and the remains taken out and placed in a shell, and I examined themâ€”in the bakehouse there it a large trough, and one end joins on to the oven, and on the wall by it I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> some splashes of bloodâ€”there were hairs on the wall, and it looked as if the wall had recently been wiped with something wetâ€”the hairs were very dark and very healthyâ€”the lid of the trough was damp and there were blood stains faintly showing through as if it had been wiped with something wetâ€”on a piece of wood above the trough I found a piece of human brain with recent blood stains on it and weighing 57 grainsâ€”on a large stone under the oven I saw blood which had recently fallen on it and I found a piece of brain weighing 10 grainsâ€”the trough and the wall had been sprinkled with flour over the stainsâ€”on the hatchet there were spots of blood and on the middle part of the head there was something fluffyâ€”the handle had been recently washed, but blood stains were clearly perceptibleâ€”I was also shown a clasp-knife and found blood stains on itâ€”on the piece of material over the lead of the life preserver were two stains which were found to be bloodâ€”that was such an imple<lb/>ment as would have inflicted the blow on Mr. Ross's head the remains were removed to the mortuary, and on November 12th, assisted by Doctor Jackson Clarke, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and we arrived at the conclusion that death was caused by the fracture of the skull, which caused extensive bleeding on the surface of the brain, in consequence of which there was failure of the respiratory centre, or asphyxiaâ€”unconciousness was probably immediate, and then deathâ€”the fracture was caused by some person other than than deceasedâ€”the broad end of the head of the chopper was such an instrument as would produce the injury found on the deceased's headâ€”the deceased was probably lying down, or his head was resting against a firm substanceâ€”the blow was de<lb/>livered on the right side of the headâ€”I think the man must have lived about half an hour after the blowâ€”I do not think he would have re<lb/>covered consciousness; he would not have been conscious when placed in the ovenâ€”on the early morning of the 11th I examined the prisoner at the stationâ€”on his right hand there were recent blood stainsâ€”across the palm there was a recent burn about 2 ins. long and 1/4 in. broad, and across the finger tips, except the middle finger which was gone, there was another recent burnâ€”on the inner side of the palm of the left hand there was a narrow burn 2 1/2 ins. long, and a blister and a scorch, both recentâ€”the left arm from elbow to wrist was smudged with wet bloodâ€”his left coat sleeve and vest sleeve were stained with bloodâ€”I saw some white marks on him, and I took some scrapings off them, and also off a sack in the bakehouse, and the two corresponded exactlyâ€”while I was doing that the prisoner said, "Oh, that is only a little whitewash that I got from a wall lost night."â€”he offered no explanation as to the burn or blisters.</p>
