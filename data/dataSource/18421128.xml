                  </hi>. I keep an outfitter's shop in the Minories. A person named Edward Williams came to me about the 13th or 14th of May, and made a communication to me about a supply of goods to his son-in-law, at No. 185, Ratcliffe-highway—I went there on Whit Monday, found the house shut, and, nobody there—I then lost sight of the matter for some weeks, then Edward Williams called again—I had some conversation with him, and in two or three days he introduced the prisoner to me as his son-in-law—Williams is an elderly man—they presented me with a list of the various articles I was to supply—I began to show them various articles, which the prisoner looked over with his father-in-law—thay selected goods amounting to between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he introduced him, he said, "This is my son-in-law, whom the shop, No. 185, Ratcliffe-highway, is for"—the papers produced are the invoices sent there with the goods—they were sold for cash—I went down on the Saturday morning, and saw the father-in-law there—he said he supposed cash would be acceptable at all times, and paid me four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—this was before the goods were all delivered—the prisoner was present at the time—the shop-door was open, but not the window—they had not begun busi<lb/>ness—I then completed the order—when the goods were delivered I was to have had the cash—I went for it, and saw the prisoner—he said his father-</p>

               <p>in-law was at Ipswich—I went repeatedly, and saw the prisoner on all occa<lb/>sions—he said his father-in-law was in the country, and before he returned I received a further order, which I did not like to complete till I had the rest of the cash—I applied to him—he said, as I did not send them he was obliged to get them elsewhere, and send them into the country, as they were wanted, and intimated I had lost some cash which was to have been paid for them—I went again, and at last saw the prisoner and the father-in-law—I pressed for payment—he said I had acted very shabbily towards him, it was not busi<lb/>ness like to press a respectable man for payment, and if I would call again he would pay me, as he was going to get some bills discounted—I went at the time appointed—be said he had not been able to get the bills done, and pro<lb/>duced this bill for 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my balance was 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he drew it on a respectable man belonging <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Ipswich, Captain Cutting, who was then at sea; he drew the bill for goods he had supplied to the captain—the prisoner was present, and took the bill in his hand, looked at it, and had some conversation with his father-in-law as to the merits pf the bill—I cannot recollect what, but it tended to press on my mind that it was a respectable bill—the prisoner said he thought he could get it discounted for 10 per cent.; he had no doubt So-and-so would do it, if <hi rend="italic">I did not</hi> object <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 10 per cent.—the father-in-law said the acceptor was at sea, but would be home before the bill was due—they both intimated that the carpenter's shop in the back-yard was theirs—the father-in-law said he had taken the business not only of outfitter but as ship<lb/>carpenter for his son-in-law—this was in the prisoner's absence—I afterwards saw the prisoner, questioned him, and he said it was so, that it was his trade, a ship-carpenter, but the doctor had forbid it in consequence of his ill-health—the bill was due on the 24th of September, but not paid—I went to the house on Saturday, the 17tb, and found it shut up—I was let in by the landlord—some of the shelves appeared to have goods on them, but the papers contained hay, straw, and shavings—I had been past the evening before, and then saw some of my goods there—the name of "Williams, outfitter," was over the door—I was not aware that the prisoner's name was not Williams—his name never transpired—there is a Mr. Williams, an outfitter, on the opposite side of Ratcliffe-high way, which I understand is an old-established concern—it is within five or six doors of this house, but on the opposite side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to a house who are shirt and stock-makers, at Manchester. Tn consequence of information I received, I went to No. 185, Ratcliffe-highway, and saw only a shop-boy—I had to call repeatedly before I saw the prisoner—on the 9th of September I called, and inquired for Mr. Williams—the shop-boy said he would fetch him—he went out, and the pri<lb/>soner came in—I inquired was he Mr. Williams—he said, "Yes"—I told him I had called repeatedly, in consequence of a letter sent to me from Manchester—he said he had another shop across the street, to which he had to attend as well as this, which was the cause of his absence so often—I showed him my patterns—he gave me an order amounting to about 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during that time an elderly man came in, gave the prisoner a letter, and said he would see by that letter what was wanted—the prisoner looked frequently at the letter and other papers in a desk, as he ordered the things—the old man went out directly after, and then the prisoner said that his father had a shop at Ipswich in the same line, mod if I served him well he would procure me his custom—I said the first parcel of goods at least would be cash—be said small parcels like these he always paid cash for—I only executed part of the order—this is the invoice of them—I was not paid—I received part of the goods back a day or two, before the prisoner was committed from Lambeth-street, about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short of the amount—I applied for payment when I delivered the goods—he said he had received that day some sad news of a brother of his being drowned between Calais and Dover, and his mind was too much harrassed to look the goods over that day, I should call on Saturday and he would pay me—I went on Saturday, which was the 17th, and the shop was closed—the goods had been delivered on the Tuesday—when I delivered part of the order, I said the rest would come next week, we were too busy to execute the whole at once—that was not the real reason—he requested me then to let him have as much as we could by Friday evening, as it was required for a particular order to be made up for the country, on Friday—I went on Friday afternoon, and told him no more could come till the week following—he appeared rather vexed, saying in future I must not take an order unless I could execute it, and he should be obliged to get them elsewhere.</p>

I marked some money on the 26th of September—this is one of the halfpence I marked, and this penny-piece, and this other—they are what I handed over to Mr. Gurney—I was before the Magistrate when the prisoners made a statement—this is Mr. Henry, the Magistrate's, writing—(<hi rend="italic">read)—"</hi> Lock says, The witness Pipe has sworn falsely in saying that I gave the man money; I have been imprisoned a month innocently; no man can say I was ever seen in the company of Webber; I have known him some time, by coming to Mr. Gurney's; I served him the Monday'night before we were taken."—Webber says, "I have nothing to say, only that all I ever had at Mr. Gurney's I paid for; I was not in Mr. Gur<lb/>ney's at the time of the robbery; I was in Mr. Gurney's five minutes before seven; I was very cold, and had been to Blackwall; all I had in the world was a fourpenny-piece, and I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; when I had got down Essex-street about twenty yards, I went into a corner to make water, I had scarcely done that, and had my hands in my pockets, when Walton seized me, and in snatching my hands out, I must have pulled out the keys and knife; I did not know till after I was in Mr. Gurney's parlour that I had dropped the things; it was five minutes to eight, and not seven, that I was at Mr. Gurney's; I mean it was nearer eight than seven."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lock's Defence,</hi> On the 26th of September last, as I was serving at the bar, a man named Emery, a law writer and cousin of Webber's, was employed by him to come to me to ask me for some money; this was the third time of my seeing this man that Webber represented to be his cousin; he tendered to me a sixpence, and I gave him in exchange 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and six pennyworth of halfpence; Webber was in the habit of coming about twice a-week, as he used to go to some other place, where I do not know, for the last four months. The first time I ever saw Webber it was at my brother's house; I believe that it was only twice I saw him there; one evening as my brother was there, he, Webber, came in; be waited some time after my brother was gone; what my brother had he always paid for. He (Webber) stated to me if I did not give him some money he would inform Mr. Gurney that I was robbing him; he called in several times before I gave him any thing, at last he said, I will do it for you to-morrow,' meaning he would inform Mr. Gurney; I said to him,' You are a lying false man to say what you have;' he said, 'It is all very well for you to say so;'—at last I con<lb/>sented to his wishes, foolishly, not knowing the character of the man as I do now, or I should have informed Mr. Gurney of it. The first time I gave money it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and at other times not so much; he would ever scarcely go away before I gave him some money; he has had on the average about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or</p>

Webber has said to me many times if some persons were in my situation they would have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per day, and he said I was a fool that I did not, as I should be considered quite as much of by the Gurneys as if I did not take a farthing. I can make a declaration before the Almighty, that I have never taken one farthing from Mr. Gamey the whole time I was with him, for my own pocket, neither for any one else but Webber; by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> own confession to me, he has not done any work for the last four years.",</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. I have been in the Middle<lb/>sex Hospital five weeks—on the 28th of Oct. we lodged at 10, Clark's-build<lb/>ings, in Mrs. Guynon's room—my husband came home between eight and nine o'clock that night—I was then in bed in the room—he sat by the fire for a few minutes—then came to my bed-side, and asked me to get out of bed—I asked for what—he said, "Get out of bed"—I think he was rather intoxi<lb/>cated—I refused to get out of bed—he pulled me out, and I fell on the floor—I took a chair which stood by the bed-side, as I got up, and struck him with it—he immediately made a kick at me in* * *, which injured me—I</p>

               <p>some herrings to take home—three persons came up while I was at the stall, not all together, but separately—the prisoner was the last of the three—the first one spoke to me, and went away, and returned again while the prisoner was there—the prisoner talked to the fishmonger, and said he was out of work, and also to the second person, that came across and bought some fish, who he appeared to know very well—he asked the second person to treat him, as he was out of work, and said if he had been out of work he would have treated him—he had not spoken to me then—I was waiting for my fish to be tied up in a paper bag—the prisoner then said to me, he wished he could get some one to treat him, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the stall—I then went away to go home, he fol<lb/>lowed me directly, and asked me to allow him to carry my fish—I thanked him, and said no, I could carry it myself—I had a large bag on my arm, with other things in it which I had purchased—I proceeded straight towards my home—he followed me to Duke-street, which is in a line with Charlotte-street—I told him not to follow me, that if my husband saw him following me he would be very angry; that I wanted nobody to carry my fish, and told him to go away—he then said "Good night," and appeared to leave me—he went from me, and returned back again in an instant, as if he was going to speak to me—he did not speak, but put his hand on my chest, pushed me down on some iron railings, and, when I was down, dragged my shawl off my shoul<lb/>ders—it was pinned very fast—it was not a very violent push, but my right shoulder was cut with the fall—I have not had the use of my band since—he ran away with the shawl up Duke-street, round by the church—I got up, and ran after him as well as I could, and cried out "Stop thief"—I did not over<lb/>take him—when I found I could not overtake him, I went round Portland-place, to see if I could see him any where, but I could not, and then went home—I think I was at the fishmonger's stall from ten minutes to a quarter-of-an-hour altogether—the prisoner was there about ten minutes—I had an opportunity of seeing his face—there was a light at the stall—my husband was not at home when I got home, but when he came home I told him what had happened—I saw the policeman about eight next evening, and gave him a description of the person who robbed me—about nine that night I accom<lb/>panied the policeman to No. 12, Westmoreland-street—I stood across the road whilst the policeman went and knocked at the door—I saw the prisoner, and recognized him—the constable came to me, and I said, "That is the man"—the constable went and took him—I went over to the house, and saw him in the passage—I said, "You have stolen my shawl last night"—he said, "Me stole your shawl?"—I said, "Yes, you did"—that was all that passed—my shawl was worth a guinea—I have no doubt whatever that the prisoner is the man that took it—I attended before the Magistrate next day—at the second examination, Mr. Wooller attended for the prisoner, and called the fishmonger as a witness.</p>

I was married to my husband four years ago next January. I do not recollect that I threw the tea-pot at him, and I do not believe that I did.

On Friday evening, the 25th of Nov., I saw the prisoner with the deceased—I never saw either of them before—they were not quite opposite my door—the prisoner was supporting her on the right side, and a woman on the left—the woman appeared very much intoxicated—when she came opposite to my door she fell in nearly a sitting position, and when she fell I saw the prisoner kick her—I think it was a little above the right knee—he kicked her very violently, but only once—she laid there for a second or so—he lifted her up, and immediately afterwards threw her on the pavement—she fell on the left side—her head went on the pavement, and there was blood on the place where she fell—I did not particularly observe her head—after a few mi<lb/>nutes he raised her and threw her down again, but not so violently—when he kicked her she said, "Oh, you good for nothing wretch"—he picked her up after the last time she was down, and carried her across the road—she ap<lb/>peared quite senseless then—the prisoner appeared sober, but I did not take particular notice of him.</p>

On the 21st of Nov., I was at work for Mr. Bangham, York-street, Westminster, and saw the prisoner with a woman leading a drunken woman along between them—they Came next door to Palmer's, and I taw him let the drunken woman down, apparently by accident—he then raised her, and wanted to persuade her to go home—he let her down again, I thought not by accident, and when she was down kicked her—I remonstrated with him for his cruelty, and told him to put her aside so that a policeman might take care of her—he told me to go to hell, it was no business of mine—I saw him take her up again, and push her from him—she fell rather on her right side—her head went on the flag stones—he pushed' her from him—it appeared more the back part of her head struck the ground than the side—I saw blood from the back of her head apparently, on the stones—it was raining very hard at the time—he afterwards took her up, and carried her away—he had said, "Why don't you get up?—I should say she was too drunk to get up—she appeared very obstinate indeed, in the first instance, in not keeping her legs—I will say I only saw him push her once—I do not say the second time that he pushed her intentionally, but at the time he kicked her he let her fall, not pushing her from him—he dropped her twice, and once pushed her from him—I did not see her fall after her head fell on the flags.</p>

I knew the prisoner and the deceased—she went by the name of Ellen Derrick—they lived in Gardener's-lane, York-street—on the Saturday morning, at half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my room, and asked me to come with him to see this woman—he called her his wife—he said she had got very drunk the day before; that he had carried her home, laid her down on the bed, and she had not awoke since—I went with him to Smith's-rents, York-street, and found her on the bed on her back, snoring very hard indeed—I live about three minutes' walk from them—I wiped her mouth—it appeared nothing but slobber which comes from persons' mouths when tipsy—I told him to go for a doctor—he said, "Where to?"—I said, "Go for Dr. Davis"—he went out immediately—while he was gone a little thick stuff came from her nose and mouth—there appeared blood in it—I threw the window up—I sent another woman for the prisoner, and imme<lb/>diately after, Derrick died—the prisoner returned, said he had been for Dr. Davis, but he was very ill, and could not come—he went back again, and fetched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Prince's-court, Storey's-gate. I received an order from the Coroner to examine the body of Ellen Derrick—I made the examination on Monday afternoon, the 28th—there was a very slight bruise on her right knee—a fall, striking the knee against any bard substance, would produce it—the body was in a healthy state—there was a severe contusion on the left side of the head, at the back—I opened the head—there was no fracture—within the skull was a quantity of extravasated blood on the brain, corresponding with the external contusion—it was caused by a rupture of the vessels pro<lb/>duced by the injury received on the head—the brain itself was in a healthy state—there was effusion of blood on other parts, from the same cause—in my opinion her death was caused by the extravasated blood from the ruptured vessels of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The bruise on the knee had nothing to do with her death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she was rather a heavy woman, and of full habit—being intoxicated, the vessels would be gorged with blood, and be more likely to rup<lb/>ture, and the fall would be greater—I believe the prisoner requested a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, before the Coroner ordered it.</p>

On the 18th of Nov., a young woman came into my shop for two rashers of bacon which I cut—a woman older than the prisoner came in for some cheese, and kept me at the hack of the shop some time, at last she said the cheese did not suit her, and went away—while attending to her, the young woman went out, and left the money for the bacon on the counter—I believe the prisoner is the young woman—I had seen her about my shop for two or three hours that evening—a Stilton cheese was just where she stood, which I missed, and I believe this to be it—here is a tin tack in it which had fastened the ticket on it—I saw two rashers of bacon at the office, which were such as I cut for the young woman.</p>

On Monday, the 27th of November, I found a parcel under the draft of the oven, where the dirt falls, it was wrapped up in a piece of silk—I took it to mistress—the seven sovereigns were wrapped up in a piece of paper very much blotted—the oven had not been used while I was there—I had only been there two days—I pulled the parcel out with my brush.</p>

I put my children to bed about eight o'clock, in the front parlour, the window of which was closed—I then went into the washhouse, and came into the parlour again a few minutes before ten—I then found the window open, and missed the bed-clothes from the children's bed, and the clothes which I had taken off when I undressed them—a person could put their arm in at the window and take them, without getting into the room—the children were still asleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and keep a beer-shop at Ingham, in Lincolnshire. On the morning of the 16th of Nov. I missed a bay mare, three years old, worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from my stable, which is about eighty yards from the house—I also missed a halter—this is it—the stable was not locked—on the 28th I saw my mare again at Aldridge's Repository, St. Martin's-lane—on the 15th of Nov. the two prisoners came to my house, and asked if they could have a bed—they slept there that night, and left on the 16th, about five o'clock in the morning—I know the mare by different marks on it—I know the halter by this knot—I have had it some time—I broke it, and fastened it here—Garrard has been at my house several times during the last twelve months—Gibson has been at my house about twice—I do not know where he came from—he was quite a stranger—they both came together on the 15th, and asked for a bed—they said they wanted to get up at five o'clock—Gar<lb/>rard said he wanted to go to Leicester, or somewhere—I do not recollect exactly.</p>

At half-past six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner—I asked what ship he belonged to—he said, the Euphrates—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said a bottle of grog, he was going to take home to make some warm grog—I asked where he got it—he said from the ship, where it had been served out to him as his allow<lb/>ance, he had saved it up and was going to take it home—he said would I let him go on board and get a pass—I would not—I took him on board—the mate came out of the cuddy, and said, "This is the fellow that has robbed the ship"—the cask appeared wet all round the bung, as if the hollands had been taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Myers last Feb., at their house, in the Kingsland-road—they let apartments—on the 23rd of Feb. I went to open the door to a knock, and the prisoner was there—she asked me whether there were apartments to let—I said, "Yes, the first floor"—I showed her into the front-parlour—the prosecutor and his wife lived there sometimes—I left her in that room—I went up and gave information to Mrs. Myers—I returned to the prisoner, took her up stairs, and left her with Mrs. Myers—I saw the watch and stand were on the mantel-piece—the prisoner came again in the evening, went up stairs, looked at the apartments, and agreed to take them—I heard her say she had a piano<lb/>forte she would send in—she then said she had dropped her glove—Mrs. Myers told her to go back and pick it up—she went back, and then they went down into the parlour—I took in a pen and ink—I left the parlour, leaving her and Mrs. Myers there—she left the house shortly after, and the watch and stand were missed—in consequence of suspicions, I went with Mrs. Myers on the following Thursday to Stoke Newington—I saw the pri<lb/>soner—she said she had not been after any apartments—Mrs. Myers asked if her sister, Mrs. Andrews, was at borne—the prisoner said no—Mrs. Myers said there was an unfortunate likeness between Miss Miller and her sister—the prisoner's name was Miller at the time of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. Miss Wicks was staying with me—I had apartments to let—on Wednesday, the 3rd of Feb. Miss Wicks brought the prisoner up stairs to me—she looked at the apartments—this watch and stand were on the mantel-piece in the bed-room—I can swear to this stand—here is a mark on it—my husband made it—the prisoner came in the evening, and I went into the parlour with her—she said her husband was chief officer in a vessel, and gave her address, "No. 2, York-place, Commer<lb/>cial-road"—she took the apartments, and was to come on the Monday—as she came out of the bed-room along the landing, she said she had dropped her glove, and must go back—I told her to go—she went into the bed-room where the watch was—she joined me again, and we both went down into the parlour—I called for a light and a pen and ink—she wrote her address with one hand, and held her other hand under her shawl, as if there was something in it—she kept pushing something up—she gave her address, "No. 2, York-place, Commercial-road"—I took my bill down for my apartments—I went to inquire next morning, and could find no such person—I went from there to Salmon-lane, Stepney, and there I found a person lived, who answered the description, and whose husband was a chief officer—on the following Monday I went to dust the room, and missed the watch and stand—I went again to Salmon-lane—I there found that the person who lived there had a sister of the name of Miller, living at Stoke Newington—I went there, and saw the prisoner there—she had exactly the same dross, bonnet, and shawl on—I</p>

I went with my husband to where the prisoner lives—I saw this stand there—it is the same watch-stand that was in my bed<lb/>room—I gave her into custody—I found the watch at the pawnbroker's, pledged in her own name.</p>

On the 24th of Nov. the prisoner and two other persona came into the shop—I am sure the prisoner was one—I saw him go to a side-table, take a toilet bottle, and put it in his side-pocket—when the others had done looking at some arti<lb/>cles, I went out and saw the prisoner, and the others were beckoning to him—I followed him with the bottle through two or three streets, into Russell-street again—I then ran, and called "Stop thief," and when within a dozen yards of him he threw the bottle down, or dropped it, and it was smashed all to pieces—this is the top of it—it was the property of Mr. George Webb, my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Cubitt On this day week I was employed in making some stables at the bade of No. 69, Eaton-place—the stables come into Lyall's mews, South, and opposite them are the stables of Colonel Vernon, who is in Ireland, and has got his coachman with him—I have seen all the prisoners at Colonel Vernon's stable—they all lived in the room over his stable—at half-past four o'clock this day week, I left the property safe at the stable where I was at work—when I went on Monday morning, I found it was gone from more than one yard, and the tools were taken from the loft over the stables—no one could get to the loft without a ladder—in consequence of suspicion, I at once went over <hi rend="italic"/> to Colonel Vernon's stable on Monday morning—I knocked three <hi rend="italic">times</hi> distinctly—I heard some one in the stable—they did not answer me, bat ran up stairs—I then saw Bryan Stewart look out at the window—I asked him to allow me to come into the stable to measure the size of the harness-room—he made no answer, but went back, and in a minute or two Milton came to the window—I asked her to let me in by the Colonel's orders to measure the size of the harness, room, as we were fitting a harness-room up at another place—she seemed very confused, and said she could not let me in, she had not the key, that her daughter went out to work in the morning, and took the key with her—I waited a few minutes, and kept watch—I then saw Bryan Stewart open the stable-door, peep out <hi rend="italic"/> several times, and then shut it again—he could see me, and when he saw me he closed the door, and disappeared—I waited some time, made a communication to my em<lb/>ployer, and went before the Justice—I obtained the assistance of Thomp<lb/>son, and accompanied him to the stable where the prisoners lived—be knocked at the door—Milton looked out of <hi rend="italic"/> the window from above Thompson asked her to let him in—she refused—he asked a second time—she still refused, and I think she said he most wait till the family was in town he told her if she did not come down and let him in, he most break the door open, but if she would come down he would read the warrant to her—she then came down, and opened the door—we first <hi rend="italic"/> went into the stable, and found this flush boarding and floor boarding at the further end of the stable—this is heavy—on looking into the manger we found two dosen bolts, and a quantity of nails—there was a box which is used as a corn-bin—it was locked up—we asked Milton if she had got the key—a he said no she had not—we broke it open, and it contained my saw, hammer, two centre-bits, a gimlet, a bradawl, and a chalk-line—I had left them safe on Saturday night—we then went up stairs to the loft, and immediately on getting up there, we found a board which I identified as Mr. Cubitt's—it was just pot up temporarily, and some saucepans on it—we then went to the cock-loft, and there found a cart load of stuff which was my master's—amongst it was this log which has Mr. Cubitt's name branded on it—we found this ladder, which is Mr. Cubitt's—this would help them very materially to get into the loft, and to get the property which I missed—here is a van-load of property here. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined b</hi> y <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Davis ordered some goods to be sent to No. 45, Bedford-place—he gave me his card, and said he had taken the house on a five years' lease; his wife was in York-shire; but in the course of a week he would bring her to select some more goods—in consequence of what he said, I sent some carpets into the house on the 22nd, and on the 28th I sent a glass there by Triphook, in consequence of a message brought to me by Sharman—it was a stock glass, used as a patten—it was only to show the style of it—there was no price or bill of parcels sent—I saw it next on the 5th of Oct., at Mr. King's, in Holborn—I got the duplicate from a woman, who went by the name of Waddilove, at No. 1, Chapel-place, Borough—it was a very small house, one story above and one below, a very different house to that in Bedford-place—I went there on Tuesday, the 5th of Oct.—this is my glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Victor Dumar, an importer and dealer in French shoes, in Regent-street. On the 23rd of Sept. a person named William Clark called, and asked me to show him some French goods—I asked if it was for wholesale or retail, he said wholesale that he was living at Epsom, and had a large shop there—he had dealt in English shoes, but his customers had wanted French goods, and he came in, seeing Mr. Dumar's name on the door—he said he should require 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, as a sample of each sort—he said, "What are Mr. Dumar's terms?"—I said, "Ready money, with two and a half discount, or three months' credit; we must have a refer<lb/>ence, if we give credit"—he said, "I can give you a very good reference, one that I am sure you will be satisfied with"—he then handed me a bill, with "Thomas Hamer, 20, Bread-street-hill" on it—he requested that Mr. Durnar would go on the following morning, before eleven o'clock, for the reference, as Mr. Hamer was then most likely to be in the way—on the next day I went to No. 20, Bread-street-hill—I asked for Mr. Hamer, and the prisoner Morris said, "I am Mr. Hamer"—I saw the name of Thomas Hamer on the side of the door—I said Mr. William Clark, of Epsom, had referred Mr. Dumar to him, as to his capability of paying for goods—he said, "Yes, I know Mr. Clark very well indeed"—he said that he had served him with goods ever since he had opened his shop, and had always found him very punctual in his payments, his bills were always taken np before they were due, at the end of six weeks or two months—he said, "What kind of goods are they?"—I said, "French boots and shoes"—he said, "Of course they are of the first quality; because I know that Clark's customers are all gentlefolks; there are a great many gentlemen's seats about Epsom, which of course you are aware of"—I asked if we could give credit with propriety—he said, "Cer<lb/>tainly, without the slightest danger"—I said, "Has he been established long"—he said, "Somewhere about three years"—there was a counting-house and a warehouse—I did not look further—I thought, from the appearance, he was a very extensive merchant—when I went back, on the same day, Clark called again—he said, "Have you called on Mr. Hamer this morning?" I said, "Yes, I called on him, and Mr. Dunn was perfectly satisfied with the character he has given you"—before he went away he had eighteen pairs</p>

I was returning from my sister-in-law's in William-place, William-street, Pitt-street, Old Kent-road, with my wife, my sister-in-law, and cousin Archibald Penny-cook—I saw a mob at the end of William-street fighting—we had to pass them, and could not do so without touching them—Pennycook was walking a-head of me, and was struck on the hat, I believe by Carrington, but I am not posi<lb/>tive—I came up within a foot of him—Appleton asked me what I wanted—I said I wanted to pass—I received a blow from him on the left side of the chest and fell—I rose again, and he struck me, and at the same time caught my watch-guard, which was hanging from my waistcoat-pocket, and ran away with it, watch and all—as I was pursuing him, I believe Carrington gave me a blow or a shove, and I went up against the wall—I did not fall down, but ran again, and was surrounded by the mob—I called "Police!" and "Stop thief!" as bard as I could—the policeman came—I told him I had been robbed of my watch and guard—I could not see Appleton at that time, but I saw Carrington, who was one of the party that shoved me as I was pur<lb/>suing Appleton, and I gave him in charge.</p>
