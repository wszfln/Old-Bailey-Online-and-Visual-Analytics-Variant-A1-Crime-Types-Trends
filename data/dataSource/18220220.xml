The female servants and myself were at home on the 15th of January, and went to bed about ten o'clock, leaving the house all fast; I sleep on the first floor. After twelve o'clock, I heard a tapping, and then saw the glare of a candle pass my room door, which was not shut to - I rose up in bed and asked who was there, a man said,</p>
               <p>"Never you mind." I got out of bed, and two men met me at the door; one of them had a pistol; they induced me to lay down, and having no arms, I complied - they asked me where the plate was; I said my mistress had got it in town; they then went into my mistress's bed room on the same floor as mine, and broke open some locks; they then went out of that room into the best bed room. I heard them opening the locks there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both the men leave your room - A. No; one of them remained with me, and the other went away; while he was with me, I heard some other person in the house; I heard two persons talking together - one of those who had been in the bed room said to the one who was with me,</p>
               <p>"Blow his brains out," this was after I said there was no plate, there was some in the room I heard them go into - I heard them breaking locks open, and while they were doing so, I heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n him, blow his brains out." The two went down stairs; the man still remained with me - one of them called out from the bottom of the stairs,</p>
               <p>"Riches," and then the man left me. The key of my room was inside the door when I went to bed; I found it afterwards outside - the man returned to me in about five minutes, he opened the door, looked in, and said,</p>
               <p>"Are you all right," I said I was there, he then went away, and my door was then fastened. I got out at the window in about ten minutes, and went to a neighbouring farm-house, and got assistance; I returned to the house and found the front gate open, which I had locked over night. I found the scullery door open, which was fastened the night before, and the glass of the window broken; there was room enough to admit a man through the casement - the scullery leads into the kitchen. I found property laying about, and in the best bed room there was a bundle of wearing apparel packed up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any opportunity of seeing them - A. I only got a glimpse of them; the candle was not brought into my room - I heard three speak in the room, and it was a different voice which called out Riches, it was not the same voice which said,</p>
               <p>"D - n him, shoot him;" I think there were four voices, I am certain there were three; one spoke in an Irish tone. Cochran had lived with my mistress - I cannot say whether either of the voices were like his. I am sure I made the house fast. One man was taller than the others.</p>

I came down stairs, and found a door broken open in the best bed-room, where the plate and other valuable articles were kept; the plate was gone - I went into the cellar where there was a large box containing candles, which was locked and safe when we went to bed; it stood on a wine bin in the cellar - it was broken open, and a good many candles had been used from it. The matches are kept in a cupboard in the kitchen; I found they were burnt all over the lower part of the house, and we found a great deal of candle grease on the carpet by the best bed room door. I left the things in the same state until my mistress saw them.</p>

            . I am a widow. I was in town at the time of the robbery - I heard of it next morning went home immediately, and found things in great disorder, and my clothes laying on the bed room floor. I had left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200004"/>some drawers unlocked, and from those drawers the things were taken - there was a very strong closet in the wall of the best bed room, it appeared like a door going into another room; I locked that closet myself when I went to town, and took the key with me. I left plate, and a variety of property there; I found it forced open and the things taken away - I had left a plate box with four dozen table spoons, two dozen silver forks, a silver vase and cover, a fish knife, two silver ink bottles of Bramah's construction, a gold pencil case, and snuff box, they were all gone. My dressing box was also broken open, and from that a gold curb watch-chain was taken, also the silver bottles, and some ribbons were taken. I had had the ribbons since 1809; I had them when I was shipwrecked off the East Indies, and they were valuable to me on that account - I kept them in my dressing box where I was in the habit of frequently seeing them. I think I saw them the day before I went to town - I know them by one being of a particular pattern, and they are stained with sea water. I had left a watch hanging over the chimney piece in my bed room - that was gone, it had a black ribbon, seal, and a key, attached to it - but when I saw it at Bow-street, it had the same seal, and key, and the curb chain attached to it, the ribbon was gone. Cochran lived seven months in my service, and left on the day of the Coronation. The candles were kept in a coal cellar next to the kitchen; the door was pannelled, so as to represent the wall, and when the kitchen door was open, three parts of it would be covered - I think when the kitchen door was open nobody could suppose a door was there. The candle box was on a bin in the cellar. When I was in the country, I kept my money in a chest of drawers in the dining room - when I went to town, I never left it there; I do not know whether Cochran was acquainted with that, he knew I kept it there when at home. The four dozen spoons were worth 24 l.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 21st of January, about twelve o'clock, I was going down Chandos-street, towards St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne, Cochran, and one Brown - I met Sayers, and we followed them into St. Martin's-lane, and saw Osborne and Cochran go up under the Golden Cross gateway - I laid hold of Osborne, and took him over the way to Mrs. Mountains, into the back parlour; when he got in, he shifted something from his pocket to the floor, he slipped it down inside his trowsers, his hand was in his pocket at the time; I observed him fumbling his hand about, and his watch came out at the bottom of his trowsers on the floor; he stamped his foot on it - I said it will do you no service, I shall take you to justice all the same; he got out of my hold, picked up the watch, and threw it against the fire place - I secured him; upon searching him, I found a gold repeater, a black ribbon, seal, and key, also a belcher silk handkerchief.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. This was five days after the robbery - A. Yes. I knew nothing of the robbery at the time. The gateway is a very public place. The watch glass was broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they talking together - A. I saw Osborne, Cochran, and Brown talking together three or four times that day, which caused my suspicion. Brown was afterwards taken and discharged.</p>

            . I am a constable. I assisted in securing the prisoners - I took Cochran. I first saw all three together at the corner of Bedfordbury; Brown and Cochran were walking arm in arm, and Osborne was before them, speaking to them over his shoulder; I took Cochran, Brown immediately ran down to Charing-cross. I took Cochran into Mrs. Mountain's, and searched him; he gave me the name of Morrison - he attempted to escape from me with a great deal of force, while Osborne was being searched; I forced him into the parlour, he immediately jumped on the table, lifted up the window leading into the yard, rolled out, and fell down into the yard, about fifteen feet - I went down and took him again, he walked into the parlour; I searched him, and found a pocket handkerchief, and two keys on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many men besides were apprehended for this robbery - A.Three others, who were discharged.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I searched Clare's apartments at No. 3, Middlesex-court, Drury-lane, and found a pistol, not loaded, concealed in a cupboard behind a partition, at the head of the bed. I found the ribbon in a deal chest which was not locked; Clare claimed the ribbon at Bow-street - he said it was given him by a young woman, who was gone to America, three years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Clare was not in custody when you found them - A. No; he was attending the examination of the prisoners, at the time I brought it to the office. Clare was then at the bar - the ribbon was not put in his hand, it laid on the table before the Magistrate; I believe he said he had used part of it to tie up his arm when he was bled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Justice ask him,</p>
               <p>"Had you any ribbon in your box" - A. I believe it was to that effect, but it laid on the table before him, about four yards from him; he asked to see the ribbon at the last examination, but it was not there then - at the first examination, he said it was given to him. The pistol is rather fowl inside, and does not appear to have been recently used.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When the ribbon was produced at the first examination, had he not a full opportunity of seeing it - A. He had. Both him and Osborne asked to see it at the second examination, but it was not there.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the prosecutrix. I attended the examination, and heard what Clare said, he was brought to the office, in the middle of the examination of the other prisoners, he was first brought close to the Magistrate's table - Sir R. Birnie produced the ribbon, and asked what account he had to give of those ribbons, which were found in his box, he was within a quarter of a yard of them - he said they were given to him three years ago by a young woman, who was gone to America; Sir R. Birnie then ordered him to be put to the bar with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200005"/>other prisoners - I know this was not taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often did you attend before this - A. Once; I believe Mr. Price attended, I cannot say he attended professionally for them, but at the next examination Osborne said he had an attorney at the two former examinations, but he had not said a word for them, and it was of no use to have him. I attended three examinations, but there had been others. Sir R. Birnie sent for Clare, and directly he came Sir Richard held the ribbons up, and asked how he came by them, and was told there were three pieces - he said there should be four, and they were given him three years ago, by a young woman who was gone to America, and that he had used one to bind his arm after being bled.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many examinations were there - A. Clare was there first on the 7th of February, there had been three examinations before that; I had seen him at one of these examinations, Sir R. Birnie, sent for him, and put a few questions to him, as it was said Osborne lodged with him; but Mr. Birchs's foreman spoke in his favour, and he was suffered to go at large; he was at large several days before he was taken again. I understood Osborne to be some relation of his. Brown and one Woodley were also taken on this charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who told you where the lodging was - A. I heard him tell the Magisstrate he lived there, and that Osborne lodged at the same place. The ribbon was at the bottom of his box. There was nothing but old worn out clothes there.</p>

               <p>COCHRAN'S Defence. One morning when Osborne was in a public-house, I saw him buy the watch of three men, but I did not know the watch then - they would not let me see it. When we came down St. Martin's-lane, I did not observe that Osborne was in custody - I went up the gateway, and saw the officer with him. The reason I escaped out of window was because I was afraid of being taken for a small debt which I owed.</p>
               <p>OSBORNE'S Defence. I was in the public-house this morning, and bought the watch of three young people who called me aside; Cochran came too, and they told me to take him away - I bought the watch for 25 s., and told them they had taken me in and sold me a metal chain for a gold one. I had no conversation with Cochran. I was in St. Martin's-lane, they took me, and as I came out of the gateway, I saw the man I bought it of running up the lane as hard as he could, and the officer collared me then, but not before.</p>
               <p>CLARE'S Defence. I have no knowledge of the ribbons, I have no deal box in my room. I went to the office two or three times before I was taken. Scott asked where I lived and worked; I told him, he took my direction down in his book - he left word with Osborne that I could find him when I choosed, at a public-house; I suppose he wanted me to give him money. The prisoner's attorney advised me to go out of the way till they were committed; I said I should not, but went to work as usual till Thursday, though they had searched my room on Monday. I said there were four pieces of ribbon, but there had been seven; I had used three when I was bled - I had not seen them for four months.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of January, about seven o'clock at night, I was with Haradine in Cockspur-street, nearly a mile from Hopkins's house, which is in John-street - I saw the prisoners carrying this glass; they turned out of Cockspur-street, on the ruins leading to Whitcombe-street, we followed them across the ruins - Baldwin then took the glass by himself; Pay stopped and looked back several times, Haradine took him. I took Baldwin with the glass, and asked where he was going with it, he said to a house in Whitcombe-street, I asked what house; he said he had forgotten - that he did not know the number, or person's name, but that Mr. Doe, No. 14, Great Peter-street, Westminster, sent him to carry it. Hopkins claimed the glass next morning. I went and found a Mr. Doe, at No. 14, New Peter-street.</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Brook and Co., and have been so nearly seven years. On the 23d of January, I saw Rushworth go away about six o'clock; he had no bundle then, I left the warehouse about seven o'clock, and was in Crooked-lane, and saw him there, as I was going to my uncle's in the Borough. He had something in a wrapper then - I went up and took hold of it, in a jocular way, and said,</p>
               <p>"You, Yorkshireman," I pulled it, and he pulled, and I thought he seemed confused. I asked what he was going to do with it, he gave me no answer; I asked him again, and he said</p>
               <p>"Home." We walked together, and I asked if he was going to leave it any where in the morning, he said</p>
               <p>"Yes," but did not say where. He asked me to have some gin, I said</p>
               <p>"No." We then went to my uncle's, the Paviour's Arms, Fishmonger-alley - I asked again what he was going to do with it, he made no answer, put it on the settle, and moved away from it, and I saw by the corner, that it was serge. He owed me 18 s. I told him I would thank him for it, as soon as he could, for I was short; he said he had got the serge out to pay me, and if I would go in the parlour, he would tell me all about it, as he thought I had some suspicion. We went into the parlour, he begged me to say nothing about it. I said it would be the best way to tell me about it, and I would not tell - he left the serge at my uncle's, I put a seal on the bundle. I saw Mr. Webb next morning, and told him all I knew. About eleven o'clock that morning, Rushworth and I went together to Byford, to the front of the warehouse; I asked Byford how he came to take the piece out, he said he did do it, was very sorry, and hoped I would say nothing about it, and said he would get the serge away from my uncle's at dinner time, take it to the dyer's, and they would bring it back with one hundred and fifty returns - they were taken in custody on the following morning. I took the serge from my uncle's on the night of the 24th, after Rushworth left, brought it to my own house, and kept it there till the 26th, then brought it to the warehouse, sealed it, and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The men usually leave at six o'clock - A. Yes; Rushworth passed me as he went out, and wished me good night - he had nothing then; the serge is too large to be concealed - I parted with him that night, and by agreement, went with him to Byford the next morning. I had told my master, and had his approbation for what I was doing - I told Byford it was a bad job, and he said it was. I asked him how he came to get it out, because Rushworth had told me Byford had got it out - he asked if I had said any thing about it, I said</p>
               <p>"No;" he said he did do it, and was sorry for it. I did not say they should not be hurt - they were taken in custody half an hour after. I locked the serge in my own room till I sealed it.</p>

               <p>WALTER COBHAM. I am a servant out of employ. On the 4th of February, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock at night, my silver watch was in my fob, with a seal, two keys, and a ribbon. I was going home, along <placeName id="t18220220-6-crimeloc34">Cow-lane</placeName>

Nobody else was near me; I seized him, without losing sight of him, the watch has not been found, it cost nine guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you cry Stop thief! as soon as you missed your watch - A. Not half a minute after I received the blow the thief ran by me, and then the prisoner ran too - I do not believe he was pursuing the thief; he said he had no objection to my sending for an officer, and stopped quietly with me for a quarter of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200008"/>an hour till one came. I held him all the while, he gave different accounts of himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner attempt to stop the man when he started - A. No; but kept running across me, right and left, to prevent my getting up to the man, and that made me take him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock, and took him to the watch-house. I asked where he had been that evening, he said to one Williams, in Fetter-lane, for some shoemaker's lasts; that he lived in French-alley, Goswell-street, and worked at a large tobacconists in the Minories, for three years, up to the present time. I was taking him to Fetter-lane, he said it was no use to take him, I had better take him to the Compter - I however, took him to the place he described, and enquired, in his hearing, but no such person as Williams was to be found. I then took him to the Minories, and on going along, he said, he had not worked there for eighteen months - I found nobody to give me an answer; he then said he got his living by going into the country with cheese and fruit.</p>

On Friday the 1st of February, I was near Angel-street, and saw the prisoner with two others about nineteen and sixteen years old - I saw the prisoner lift up the pocket of a gentleman's coat, in <placeName id="t18220220-10-crimeloc57">St. Martins-le-grand</placeName>

I gave the handkerchief to Taylor.</p>

            . I live in Charles-street, Globe-fields, Mile End. About half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the 19th of January, I was coming home from the pay table in Globe-lane, and saw three people over the way, it was very dark; they hailed me, and one said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Is that you?" I did not go over to them, but kept walking on, and all in a moment I saw the prisoner at my right side; I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you do about at this time of night, you ought to be at home;" she said she had no home, for she had neither fire, nor victuals to eat when she was there; I said,</p>
               <p>"I am as poor as you almost"; I put my hand in my pocket, and gave her 6 d., and as I gave it her, I felt her hand in my pocket. I said</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me"; I missed a crown piece - I seized her, and took her to the watch-house, and saw the crown piece shaken out of her handkerchief on the floor - I thought her a woman in distress, and not a woman of the town; I have no mark on the crown piece. I also lost 3 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I was on duty that night - Stone's account is correct. Thinking the prosecutor might have been with her, I asked if she had any 5 s. piece about her, she denied having any thing but a few halfpence - I searched her, and found 3 s. in silver, and 1 s. 9 d., in copper; I saw her hand in her bosom, I moved her handkerchief, and the 5 s. piece dropped on the ground - the prosecutor said he lost 8 s. or 9 s., and there was a 5 s. piece among it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was among my halfpence, I did not know I had it; he took it from my hand. The prosecutor went up a court with me.</p>

I had a bundle under my arm, which I threw into the stable, and pursued, they were then turning Francis-street, and running across towards Tottenham-court-road; I cried Stop thief! the prisoners were stopped and brought back to me - I went back and found two bundles of linen tied up and thrown inside the stable door; I go through the stable to my room; I put them on a box in the stable, and saw Cousins take them away.

I secured him and took him back to Collings - I believe Hatfield to be the man, but I cannot be sure; he very much resembles him.

It was in the one pair back room, I saw it about an hour before it was lost, (between three and five o'clock in the afternoon) - I do not know whether the outer door was latched. The house was let out in tenements, and the landlord did not live in it; I have the first floor, I locked the outer door of my apartment myself that day, and took the key with me - I came home about half-past four o'clock, it was light then, the trunk was gone, I have not seen it since, but have seen a silk shawl in pawn, which was in it. I did not see it for fifteen months after, I have found nothing else; it was worth 2 l., and cost a great deal more - the rest of the property stated in the indictment was in the trunk, and was worth above 10 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at Union Hall, that you lost it a fortnight before Christmas - A. A fortnight or more, I cannot say the day - It was on a Monday.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gray, a pawnbroker in Fleet-street. I have a shawl which was pawned on the 30th of November, 1820. I took it in myself, from a woman whom I believe to be the prisoner's wife - I have frequently seen them together, they addressed each other as man and wife; the prisoner came a short time ago, for an affidavit of his losing the ticket; he said he had lost the duplicate of the shawl, and had sent his wife before to stop it, (she had been to stop it). I did not shew it to him; he spoke of it, as a shawl pawned in the name of Conner - I have the duplicate here; I gave him a printed form of affidavit, which I have since seen in Goff's possession.</p>

            . I lived last with Mr. Newcombe, of Bloomsbury-square. I know the prisoner, he asked me to pawn a shawl like this, which I refused, this was the latter end of November, 1820; he asked me also to pawn two white gowns, two white petticoats, a dark silk gown, a black silk cloak, and a table cloth; he and his wife asked me to pawn them at the corner of Seacoal-lane, I refused - they then asked me to pawn the shawl, which I refused. I called on the prisoner in Newgate, in December last, when he was imprisoned there; he asked me to do him a favour, I said I would, he said,</p>
               <p>"My wife has left me, and gone to live with another man, and she has got a shawl which will hang me; it came out of Legg-alley;" he gave me a note to carry to Mr. Gray, which I did - he told me to go and stop it before his wife got it out, as if she got it she would hang him, as it was one of the shawls taken from Legg-alley. At the time the robbery was committed in Legg-alley, in November, 1820; I was going to have my hair cut at Lumley's, which was the house it was committed at, and the prisoner came out of the house as I went in, with a large trunk on his shoulder; he went towards the bottom of Hart-street, and the next day, the prisoner came to my lodging, in a court in Fleet-street, and asked me to walk out with him, which I did; he took me into a gin shop in Fleet-market, where his wife and another woman were, they had two bundles, and asked me to have some gin with them, which I did, and on leaving the shop, they asked me to pawn the things; I had heard of the robbery, and that was the reason I would not - I did not know these were the things stolen, but was afraid, as they were dangerous characters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe he had the trunk himself. Have you not been to Bow-street, for passing bad money?</p>
               <p>The witness being informed that he had a right to refuse answering this question, declined.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you go to him in Newgate - A. He sent for me. I went backwards and forwards to see him till he came out, as he said he was distressed.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, he said he bought the shawl of a man named Swiney; afterwards he said he did not buy the shawl, but bought a duplicate of it, and that it was in pledge at Guest's in Fleet-market, with a sheet - I went to Guest's, and searched the books, but could find no account of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What information did Barnacle give you - A. He said the shawl came from a crack, I asked how he knew that; he said the prisoner and his wife had quarrelled and the prisoner was afraid his wife would have him hung, and he gave him the affidavit to take care of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Barnacle sold the ticket of the shawl to my wife, it was pawned with a shirt, she redeemed it and pawned the shawl. If he knew I robbed the house, why not give information; he owes me money, and has robbed me - I said I would have satisfaction, and then he gave information.</p>

            . I am a plumber and glazier. On the 28th of January, I was at work on the roof of Mr. Parson's house, in the back fields, Westminster; Carpenter's house is about thirty yards off; I was looking over a parapet, and saw Mascoe get in at the front parlour window of Carpenter's house; there was three men then standing by; I saw him give something out, which appeared to be linen - all the three had brown coats on; I could not swear Davis received it, but believe it was him - I saw him give it to another of them; Mascoe gave another bundle out, and all ran away; I went down and ran after them; I ran the contrary way, thinking to meet them - I saw Carpenter pursuing them, and saw him pick up the great coat in Palmer's-village, and in about two minutes, I saw Davis and Desman in custody, in a public-house; I believe them to be the men, for their dress, appearance, and size corresponded. I did not see the other two till last Saturday.</p>

            . I am a locksmith. On the 28th of January, I was at work opposite Carpenter's house, and heard an alarm; I ran out, and saw two young men running in a direction from Carpenter's, about one hundred yards off - I pursued, and called Carpenter out; I lost sight of them in turning the corner. One of them had a great coat under his arm, it was neither of the prisoners; I afterwards saw that coat in Carpenter's possession.

The prisoner was about ten days in my service, I had no character with her, but a recommendation from a Mrs. Harrington, who she had lodged with. On Sunday, the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out, leaving her in the house. I have three children, I took two out, leaving her with one - I returned about a quarter past five o'clock, she was not at home, I found the door a-jar. On my knocking, the pressure forced it open, I found the parlour door open also, and on examining it, found the bolt of the lock out, but it had passed beyond the staple. On going into the parlour, my wife went to a chest of drawers, which were not locked, and missed a small red box, in which I kept my cash. On the night before, I had put some cash in this box, there was some there before - there was six 10 l., Bank notes, upwards of forty sovereigns, between 2 l. and 3 l. in silver, also a black leather pocket-book, a gold pencil case, a silver eye-glass, and a variety of papers, of consequence to me. Within five minutes afterwards, the prisoner came to the street door with a key which she had, and with my child in her arms. I immediately told her to walk in the parlour, and told her that my red box had been stolen out of the drawers, during my absence, and I strongly suspected she must know something about it. She fell down on her knees, and protested her innocence, saying, it was impossible she could have behaved so unkindly to such a master and mistress. I told her that was not at all satisfactory to me, and that I should use every means in my power to find it out. I went out to get an officer, but could not - I desired her to go to bed, and sat up all night, to prevent her having any communication with any one out of the house - I said she had better tell the truth. Next morning, I fetched Clemence, the officer, and gave her in charge. I got a search warrant, and searched the apartments of Harrington and Fowler, and found two letters in a box there, which led me among her connexions at Woolwich - she never told me where to find the box. On Thursday, the 10th, I went to Woolwich, to Bowles, he was not at home, I saw his wife, and the prisoner's sister, Mary Bettelly, I enquired about the box and the contents; they said they knew nothing of it. Mr. Bowles brought me the box on Wednesday, the 16th; it contained 87 l. 16 s. 6 d. then, also a pair of scissars, two silver thimbles, which I could not swear to, but I sell such things - I know the scissars to be mine, and know the box perfectly. On Thursday, the 17th, I attended at Marlborough-street, asked to see the prisoner, and asked her if she knew any thing at all of the robbery, she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I do not." I then took the box from my pocket, and shewed it her, I said,</p>
               <p>"Of course, if you do not know any thing of the robbery, you know nothing of this box, or how I came by it;" she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I do know of it, I did take it from the drawer, packed it up in a cloth, took it to the coach-office, at Charing-cross, got a direction wrote for it by the bookkeeper, and sent it down to my sister, at Woolwich, to be left at Mrs. Lee's. St. Mary-street." I asked where the remainder of the property was, which was in the box, she said, she had thrown the pocket-book, the gold pencil-case, the silver eye-glass, and all the papers down the privy. I got a man to search the privy, and saw him find the pocket-book and the eye-glass there, about a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The drawer was not locked - A. No; she might suspect I kept my money there, I had locked it in my bed-room on Saturday night, and my wife brought it down in the morning.</p>

I went to Mrs. Lee, and Mr. Lee brought it to my house in the afternoon and delivered it into Mary's hands. I took it from her and opened it, there was a key tied to the handle, which was broken, and would not open it; I forced it open, and found the money in it - I took it the next morning to Atwell. She was gay and unsteady, but I never heard any complaint of her dishonesty.</p>

I there found a number of things, but I did not know which they were, as she lodged there with another person.

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. About half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday, the 19th of January, I saw Newbury go down Mr. Cox's area steps, the other two prisoners stood a few yards from the area talking together; I knew Stevens and Chidley before - I watched them; saw them running after Newbury, who had come out of the area, and was walking fast towards Five-fields, they got up to him, and all went together across Five-fields; Newbury crossed a ditch, and Stevens threw a small bundle after him, he and Chidley then crossed; I followed them into the Old King's-road - I then went down the New King's-road, still having them in sight, except for a moment. I got them in view again, and in the Old King's-road, Chidley looked towards me; then I saw them all three engaged in putting something under some dirt; I saw Newbury put something white under an old tree, and Chidley kicked some dirt over it, to hide it; I got Wilson to assist, and took Chidley and Newbury - I got hold of Stevens, but he made his escape; I took them back to the tree, under which I found the lid of the teapot.</p>

I went to bed on the 17th of January, about twelve o'clock; my brother was the last person up, but when I went to bed, the outer doors were secured. I had 292 lbs. of black tea, and 114 lbs. of green tea in the stock, at three o'clock in the afternoon, it was in the shop - my silver watch and key hung over the fire place at supper time, I left them there at night. The tea was worth 126 l., and the watch 50 s. - I had 4 l. or 5 l., in loose copper money in the till, I got up a little before seven o'clock in the morning, it was daylight - I had heard no noise in the night, I was the first person that came down. I found the shop door wide open, and a mat against it; no force had been applied, it must have been done with a picklock - the tea was in five chests, three black and two green. On going into the shop, I found the cannisters in disorder, and one of them empty, which was half full when I went to bed. I found the yard door, at the back of the house, had been opened from within, and on going into the yard, I found the yard door, which leads into Three Fox-court, broken open by a crow-bar. I had had it nailed up ever since I had been in the house, it had the marks of a crowbar. I found some person had got over the wall and down on a dust hole, and from there, crept through the iron rails, into my back kitchen window - they could then open the back door of the house, and the shop door. On going into the house again, I found the back parlour had been entered, and from 8 l. to 9 l., in 5 s. papers of copper taken from a desk, which was generally open, the watch also was taken from the same parlour. The prisoner is a strange to me. On going down Three Fox-court, I met a carman, who gave me the till which had been stolen that night, and on going further down the court, I met Okell. The same morning, about eight o'clock, I saw my watch in the possession of Forbes. I saw three bags of tea, of a similar quality to what I lost, and two of the bags are like those in my house, but the tea was not in them in my house; one is a rice bag, and rice was strewed about my shop, and on emptying that bag, I found rice mixed with the tea at the bottom of it - I cannot say whether the kitchen window was secure.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor's house is in the city. About a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, of the 18th, or the night of the 17th of January, I was at the watch-house, in Cow-cross-street; Okell, the patrol, came to the door with another person, with three bags of tea, which Mr. Gardiner afterwards claimed. I went out with two patrols, without their coats, and on entering the pig-market, I saw the prisoner apparently rising up from one of the pens; I went up and seized him, he made a very strong resistance, and said he would not be taken, for he had done nothing - we took him to the watch-house, as we went, I saw him put his left hand towards his pocket; I told Okell to secure his left hand and I laid hold of his right, we confined both his hands, and took him to the watch-house - upon searching him, we found a watch in his left side breast pocket, which Mr. Gardiner claimed, the glass was broken, but the watch was going - I asked him how he came to carry his watch in that pocket, he made no answer, but said it was his own; I asked the maker's name and number, he said he did not know, and that he had no mark on it - he said there was a person who could describe it, and knew it to be his; he did not name the person, nor produce any such person. In his other pocket, I found a drop latch, a common small box key, and a letter addressed to Mr. C. Marshall, No. 10, Lower Hart-street, Covent Garden. I went to that place the next day, and found the latch key opened the door. I locked him up, and between seven and eight o'clock, saw Mr. Gardiner, and asked him to describe the watch, which he did before I produced it.</p>

I took two, and he brought the other to the watch-house with me; my two weighed above 70 lbs.; they contained tea, which Mr. Gardiner claimed in the morning; the other weighed 29 lbs. In the morning, Mr. Gardiner shewed me his premises, the door leading to Three Fox-court, was forced open; that appeared to be the way they had got in. I went with Forbes to the pens in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner there - Forbes's account is correct. I saw the watch taken from his left hand inside coat pocket.</p>

             re-examined. The watch was in the same state it is now - it was a dry morning; he appeared perfectly sober. I went and examined the pens with a lantern, there was nothing to induce me to suppose he had been there for a necessary occasion; I saw him getting up apparently as if looking round. There was nobody else there.</p>

             lived in the two pair front - Hagerty is a bricklayer, and lived in the front parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200017"/>with his wife; two young women lived in the front room, first floor, whose names I do not know; I lived in the two pair back room with the prisoners. I am an unfortunate woman; Burrell is a pensioner. On this night, I met Thayers in Holborn, opposite Southampton-buildings; he spoke to me, he appeared tipsy - I went with him to my lodging; we had drank one glass of liquor each; we reached my room about half-past ten o'clock; he went into the house willingly with me; I took him to the two pair back room, I saw nobody in our way up stairs; when we got into the room, he asked me to cook him some steaks, and gave me sixpence and three halfpence to get them; I went and brought them to him, I was not gone long; when I returned, he was sitting by the fire, in the same room, he asked if I had any bread, I said No, and he gave me half-a-crown to fetch some; I went down stairs, and then saw Burrell in the passage, leading into the street - I asked if he would fetch me some bread, he said, Yes; I gave him the half-crown, and returned to Thayers, he was then sitting in the same place, by the fire; Burrell brought the loaf up, knocked at the door, and gave me the loaf and no change, he could not see who was in the room; he knew I had somebody with me, because I had told him so, when I asked him to fetch it; I then sent Burrell again to fetch a halfpenny worth of salt, he did not bring it - Thayer was sensible enough to know what he was about; in five minutes after, as Burrell did not bring the salt, I went down stairs across to Mr. Ellliot's, where I had sent him for it, and found him there; I told him not to wait for the salt for the man was out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you say so - A. Because Thayer began swearing about his change. Burrell came over into the parlour with me, and gave me the change. Mr. and Mrs. Hagerty and

             were then in the parlour; Burrell had a white jacket on - Hagerty was undressed in bed; I asked Angel if she would take the change up to the man, as I told her I was afraid he would strike me, she went up with it, and came down almost directly, and said the man had struck her, and she had not given him the change, she gave it to Mrs. Hagerty; Burrell was present, he said nothing; then Mrs. Hagerty went up with the change, and returned, saying, she had given the man his change, and that he was going to strike her - Burrell then went up, Hagerty still remained in bed; I do not know whether he was awake, he did not stir. Burrell asked what business the man had to strike Angel, he seemed angry, and went up stairs - I then heard a noise proceeding from the two pair back room, as if they were fighting; I heard the cry of Murder! and heard them scuffling, I cannot say who it was that called Murder! I was still in the parlour with Mrs. Hagerty and Angel, Hagerty was still in bed; Mrs. Hagerty told me to go for the watch, as she was afraid there would be a piece of work; I went, and first met Birke the watchman, and came back to the house; I had been absent five or six minutes, and before I entered the house, I saw Thayer fall from the two pair of stairs window, I saw him as he came down; he fell on his face flat - I stopped to look at him for about three minutes before I went into the parlour; there was a great crowd, and I could not get in; he remained on the ground till he was taken up - I did not see him move or hear him groan. I went into the front parlour, and found Burrell, Angel, and Mrs. Hagerty there - I did not notice the bed; I saw two children in bed by themselves; Hagerty could not have been in bed then without my seeing him, he was not there; I did not notice whether his clothes were there. I asked Burrell how the man got into the two pair front room, he said he (Burrell) had struck the man because he had struck his girl (Angel) and that the man burst the door open, and threw himself out of window; he said nothing more, Angel said nothing. I remained in the parlour about ten minutes, till Furzman took me away to the watch-house. Burrell was sitting on the table very quiet he had his white jacket on, as before. I saw no more of him or Hagerty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, BURRELL. Q. Was Mrs. Hagerty with you when you returned with the watchman - A. No; she and Burrell were in the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the door of the front room come into the staircase - A. Yes, just by our room. The noise of the scuffle appeared to come from the back room; I heard no noise on the stairs. I heard the cry of Murder! but once, and then went for the watchman. I only saw Thayer falling - I did not see him come out of window.</p>

            . In September last, I lived at No. 48, Charles-street, in the two pair front room. I left home about a quarter before nine o'clock on that evening, I have only one window to my room, and that I left open - I had no lock to my door, but tied the asp to the staple, with a piece of ribbon. The hinges were sound when I left the room, it had been unnailed before, but was mended by the landlord. I left about half a tub of water under the foot of my bed, quite under the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. If any people had been scuffling in the room, could they have overturned it with moving the bed - A. No. Mine was a turn-up bedstead, but it was down. I returned soon after eleven o'clock, my bed was in the same place as I had left it. Before I got to the house, I had heard something at the end of Charles-street, and on getting up to the house, I found a great number of people round the door; I went into the parlour, which was Hagerty's room; I saw Mrs. Hagerty and the two prisoners in the parlour, Hagerty was not in bed - I said I heard some man had been thrown out of window, Mrs. Hagerty said,</p>
               <p>"Oh my G - d, I am an undone woman, my husband has ran away half undressed, at the alarm of a man being thrown from your window;" I then accused Angel of having opened my door, and taken the man into my room; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken the man into my room, I suppose on purpose that it should be laid to me;" I said I did not know what I should do, but I thought I had better go down to Furzman, because they might think I knew something about it, and I would go to him to know whether they had told him I was not at home; Burrell said,</p>
               <p>"It is nonsense Maria and you having and words; the man ran from Maria's room, burst open your door, and threw himself out of window" - I went to the street door, and then returned to the parlour; the prisoners and Mrs. Hagerty were still there; I said</p>
               <p>"They say the man is dead," Burrell said,</p>
               <p>"Dead!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, so they say,"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200018"/>Burrell seemed greatly agitated, but said nothing more, he left the room; he had a light jacket on, I had seen him in that dress before; I do not know which part of the house he went to, but I saw him come down stairs into the passage in two or three minutes; he then had a blue close coat, and his hat on, his coat was buttoned up - I cannot say whether he had the jacket on, it was not a working jacket, it was a linen waistcoat with sleeves, a coat might be put over it; his hat was not on when he went up stairs. I went out and never saw the deceased; I returned about a quarter before two o'clock, got a light, and went to my room, and found the door forced from the bottom hinge, the hinge was broken, and the door forced back, part of the wood work was broken, it opens inward, the staple and asp were as I had left it. The water tub was behind the door; there had been a great many people in the room before me. I saw several spots of blood about the room, some by the side of the window ledge, and two or three spots on the ledge - I saw the print of finger marks of blood three steps down the staircase from my door. The water in the tub was dirty dish water, it was empty, and turned up behind the door, about three yards from the bed. I never saw Burrell go out in the street in the light jacket. I am an unfortunate woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the room Pethick slept in - A. Yes; there is a window to it which leads into the yard; I do not know whether it was open; nobody could get into the yard without going through the passage of the house. There is no carpet to my room - I observed no scratches on the floor. The water was all thrown out of the tub over the floor. I found the bed in the same place as I left it - somebody must have taken the tub from under it, for scuffling about would not overturn it. I did not go to Furzman.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About half-past ten o'clock, on the night of the 24th of September, I saw Pethick speaking to Birke the watchman. I followed her down to Charles-street, and Birke went down at a quick pace; in a minute or two, I heard a rattle spring, I went down the street, and found the deceased lying with his head in the kennel; I snatched a candle out of somebody's hand, went up stairs, and on the first floor landing, I saw Bartlett pick up the hat, and on the same landing there were spots of blood from there, up to the two pair of stairs front room window, there was also a mark of blood in the hat, quite fresh - I found the door of the room broken off the hinge, it hung by the top hinge, and pushed inward into the room; the asp was open - I did not notice the wood work. In the centre of the room, between the bedstead and the wainscot, a tub stood with some water in it and some was spilt about a yard from the bed - it struck me there had been some rough work there; I found blood on the cill of the window; I went into the back room on that floor, and found some meat which appeared to have been lately dressed, and a loaf torn all to pieces, the place was in great confusion; I then called out of window to them to take care of the deceased. I searched every room in the house, and did not find a soul; I immediately came down and asked who had brought the man into the house, Pethick was delivered to me. I went to the hospital with the man, returned, and found Furzman there, he took Angel and Mrs. Hagerty into custody. I took Angel to the watch-house, and asked her how she could use the man in that manner, she said she went up to the man for money for the room, that the man went to hit her, and her young man struck him. The spots of blood were quite fresh on the floor, window cill, stairs, and hat. I did not go into the parlour before I went up stairs.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How high is the window from the floor - A. About three feet, and about twenty-one from the ground - there are no area rails. I think the back room window was shut; I could not get to the window without turning round the end of the bed; it comes down nearly to the window. There are about sixteen stairs in the second flight.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Charles-street, on this night. A woman about the size of Pethick, called Watch! I went to a house in Charles-street, and just as I got to the door the man fell from the window on the pavement, on his face and hands. I sprang my rattle, turned the man over, and saw water on his face, and water came from his nose; I saw the two pair front window open; I remained with the man till Clark came and went in - there was a good many people collected in the street; I cannot say that I saw anybody come out of the house as I went up, I saw blood on the stairs; I saw no blood on the first landing, but on about three steps from the second flight, I saw no more blood till I came to the cill of the window; the room door was open - I saw the hat found. The water was spilt about the room.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Drury-lane. Clark called me - I went to the house, and saw a woman named Fox, standing at the door with a candle in her hand, Clark took the candle from her, and went up stairs, I followed him; I had seen the deceased laying on his face, in the street; as we went up, I observed spots of blood on the one pair staircase, four or five steps up, and by the door of the front room, of the one pair landing - I picked up the hat produced, I saw a spot or two of blood inside it, and spots of blood on the second flight of stairs; it was fresh then, no person had been up except us; I traced the blood into the middle of the two pair front room, it was in different parts of the room, not in a regular trace. I went to the window after taking the man to the hospital, and saw blood on the cill. A tub of water had been upset, and the room was in great confusion. I went into the back room, there had been some beef steaks cooked, and ready on the table; I noticed nothing more there. We searched the house all over, and could find no person up stairs; on coming down, I saw Mrs. Hagerty at the door, Angel was present, I said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hagerty, I insist on your telling me who was the person that brought the man home," she said it was Pethick, who was brought forward, and taken into custody. I took the deceased to the hospital. The table was upset, and the chairs about.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 24th of September, in consequence of information, I went to No. 48, Charles-street, and found Thayer laying on his back; Clark gave Pethick into my custody - I went to the hospital with the man, and after taking Pethick to the watch-house, returned, went into the parlour, and saw Mrs. Hagerty, Angel, and a man sitting on the table. I cannot say who he was, or how he was dressed - I asked Mrs. Hagerty where her husband was, she said,</p>
               <p>"Gone to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200019"/>the hospital with the man." I told her to come up stairs with me; I examined the place, and saw several marks of blood on the stairs, I cannot say whether there was any blood in the two pair back, but there was in the two pair front room, which was in great confusion; the door was off the hinges, and there was a tub in the middle of the room, which appeared to have been upset, and water spilt - some chairs and a table stood in the room. I went to the window ledge, the window was open and a spot or two of blood on it. Mrs. Hagerty afterwards said, in Angel's presence, that Angel had been up stairs with the change to the man, and that he struck her. I then took Mrs. Hagerty and Angel to the watch-house - Angel said she had been up stairs with the change which Pethick gave her, that the man had struck her, and had also attempted to strike Mrs. Hagerty - I have made a diligent search for Hagerty, and travelled many miles, but cannot find him.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I took Burrell into custody, on the 4th of October, at Chelsea College, in the pay-office, in consequence of information I received. I told him I took him on a serious charge, for heaving a man out of window, in Charles-street, Drury-lane. He seemed very much agitated - I think he had a blue coat and yellow buttons on; he said he was innocent of any charge. I said he must go with me, he came along very quietly, and on going up George-street, Chelsea, he said again he was innocent; I said,</p>
               <p>"Then why did you abscond, if you are innocent;" he said, his mother wished him, for fear he should be taken. He said he had been in Union-street, Borough, I think he said Star-court. His right eye was tied up with a handkerchief, I said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with your eye," he said he had some sand thrown into it. I asked him why he should disguise himself; he said, because he should receive his pension unnoticed, he used some other expression, which I do not recollect. I had not handcuffed him at that time, he took the handkerchief off his eye himself, and said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will tell the Magistrate all about it" - there was nothing the matter with his eye, I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am the house-surgeon at the Middlesex hospital. Thayer was brought in on the 24th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock at night. I saw him immediately, he was insensible; he had an extensive wound on the right hand side of his forehead, by contusion; it would happen by a blow from a blunt instrument, or by a fall - he partly recovered his senses on the following day, when I saw him, at ten o'clock in the morning, but not sufficiently to give me an account of the accident. On the second day, I questioned him; I cannot say whether he apprehended death to be near, he complained of a pain in his head, nothing else at that time - he afterwards complained of a pain in his right hip, and down the thigh. I examined him, and found bruises on the hind and fore part of the thigh, but no wound - the bruises on his hip were treated as slight bruises, the pain in his head subsided in a few days, and when that had almost subsided, he had an attack of the St. Anthony's fire, in his face, that very commonly follows a wound on the head. This went off very soon, returned in about two days, and subsided again. He had an attack shortly afterwards, of an inflamation in his right lung; he had then been in the hospital about ten days, and two or three days after, this was followed by an inflamation in the bowels. St. Anthony's fire naturally follows a wound in the head, and on dissection, the inflamation of the bowels was accounted for, by a fractured bone; the inflamation of the lung, I cannot distinctly relate to the accident; it might be produced by other causes. After being in the hospital three months, he left, was out of the hospital three weeks, and then returned; he was then too far gone to make any complaints, he was sinking under his disorder, and died in a few days. I opened his body, in the presence of Mr. Ogle - I first opened the head; the only diseased appearance there, was an unusual collection of water in the cavities of the brain; there was evidence of the inflamation of the right lung, and there was a scrofulous disease extending through both lungs, and marks of inflamation having existed in the bowels some time before; the right haunch-bone was broken across, the fracture extended across the hip joint, and a sharp piece of the broken bone extended into the cavity of the abdomen; and from this projecting piece, an abscess, containing about a pint of matter, extended six or eight inches along the spine - the hip joint itself was sound, this was the only diseased appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of all his symptoms, to what do you ascribe his death - A. To the fever produced by this abscess, which was occasioned by the confusion of the of the pointed bone projecting out.</p>
               <p>Q. He never ceased complaining from the first - A. He was never able to walk without crutches, and then with a great deal of pain - a fall from a two pair of stairs window might occasion the fracture.</p>
               <p>MR. OGLE. I am a surgeon. I attended the dissection of the deceased's body, with the last witness; I saw him a few days after his discharge from the hospital, in the parochial infirmary, he always complained of the same injury; Mr. Sweatman's account is very correct. I have nothing to add, except that the proximate cause of the man's death, arose from the quantity of water in the cavity of the brain; inflamation often follows a blow or fall, and the water, I think was produced by inflamation, that is the common case. The blood vessels of the head were fuller than ordinary.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sweatman says the abscess might cause his death - A. It assisted, certainly, death was occasioned by the effect of the abscess and water on the head jointly. The blow on the head would produce inflamation, which terminated in an abscess. I have no doubt but the fall from the window produced his death.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Bache, at the warehouse, in Moor-lane. Cochrane was guard to one of the waggons; Atkinson was waggoner; Cork was an in-door porter to Mr. Bache; Cochrane and Atkinson's duty was to carry out goods, and bring them to the warehouse; Cork had access to the warehouse, in Moor-lane.

            9 and 10, were delivered me by them, and stowed in our warehouse, in Moor-lane - I checked them off as being delivered. It is my business to take an account of goods coming in and going out. On the 21st of January, we had an order from Lawrence and Jolland's for goods, and found there ought to be such packages in the warehouse - I entered them in the carrier's book for Ansford to take them. No. 10, weighed 2 cwt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who wrote this paper - A. One Huggins, he is not here. I saw those very packages, nine or ten days after they were brought. If Ansford had not called them over, I should not have checked them off. The guard delivers goods on the road, but when brought to the warehouse, he has nothing to do with them. The waggoner is under the direction of the guard, to whom the bill is delivered. The goods in Moor-lane, are in my care; I lock up, about eight o'clock, and keep the keys. When we are short of hands, the waggoner is employed in the warehouse. We have watchmen at night, and when I am absent in the day, I have a substitute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Would Cochrane have to load and unload - A. If he had time; his duty is generally out of doors; he did not guard these goods to Moor-lane.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When goods are to be taken from Moor-lane, the waggon is brought there - A. Yes; but they generally take from there direct to Paddington - they are generally loaded by Cork, Lord, and Ansford. If they are to be delivered in town, the waggon comes into the warehouse, and the goods are lowered into it - Cork would be one of the persons to do that. Ansford calls them over, and I tick them off, which enables me to say they came into the warehouse.</p>

            . I slept in Wilmot-street, Brunswick-square, on the 9th or 10th of January, at Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200022"/>Morris's. I had been to the play with Mr. Morris and his wife, and slept there all night; he is no relation of mine, they lodge there. I have a brother named Smith, who is now indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, next morning, take away any goods from there - A. Yes. I went home in a coach, and took them with me - the goods had been in the passage at Morris's house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Morris's did you expect any goods to be there - A. No; the goods were lifted into the coach by Morris and my brother. When I got home, I opened them, and found they contained muslins, they were corded up in coarse wrappers - I did not notice whether they had been opened before. There was a mark on the wrapper, in ink, I did not notice the figures or letters. My brother went home with me in the coach; he got out at the end of Old Jewry - I went on in the coach to Tenter-street, with the goods, and put them in my passage; I got home a little past nine o'clock in the morning, and my brother came home in about half an hour. Barber and I helped him to take the goods up stairs, into the sitting room, it was opened there, and contained from sixty to sixty-five pieces of muslin; I left them in the room without packing them up again. About an hour after this, Cochrane came, the girl might be in the room, and if she was, I sent her out - Cochrane said he wanted 73 l. for the muslins; I said I I could not tell what I could give for them, until I saw what they would fetch; my brother, Smith, was present at this conversation. Cochrane said he should send his wife for some for her own use; he went away, leaving the goods, and my brother went out - I did not look at the packages when they were at my house, to see the marks of them. Cochrane's wife came in about an hour or two, and took two fine pieces and another coarse, this was either on a Wednesday or Thursday. Cochrane called again the same day, and said if either of the other two men should call with him, I was to say I was only to give 40 l. for them. On Saturday night Cochrane, came with Atkinson, whom I had seen in his company in the street before, and am sure he is the man; Cochrane said to him,</p>
               <p>"These are the goods, and Mrs. Smith is to give 40 l. for them," Atkinson said,</p>
               <p>"Very well," they went away; I think my girl let them in that day - they were in the bed-room where the muslin was. Cochrane called in the course of the next week, to know if I had any money, I told him I had not, I had told him his wife had had three pieces, he said, very well - his wife afterwards came, I gave her 8 l. I afterwards told him she had 8 l., he said, very well; he called several times for money, and I paid him 6 l., he and his wife had in all 28 l. at different times - I thought it was 30 l., but it was counted up, and was only 28 l. On the Sunday after, before I was taken to prison, on the Monday, I saw Cork at my house, it was on the 27th of January, Cochrane was with him; we went into the bed-room, Cochrane said,</p>
               <p>"Mistress how much money have you paid?" I said 30 l. Cork said,</p>
               <p>"That is, right Mistress; I thought Robert was on the shuffle" - my husband's sister was there at the time, but not in the bed-room. Cochrane went away, and Cork stopped and had some ale with my brother, who was at home, but not in the bed-room - Cork called several times at my house, and enquired for my brother, but nothing passed about the goods. My brother lived with me, he was a pawnbroker's servant out of place. I paid 28 l. in all; there was one 5 l. Bank note among it; I pledged some of the goods, (two parcels) at Mr. Sowerby's, Chiswell-street, for 1 l. 10 s., and sent some to be pledged by my servant; I think she only pawned two pieces. I know Mrs. Bowers she pawned some for me. I offered some to a gentleman one morning for sale, I asked him 30 s. a piece for the fine, and 20 s. for the coarse. I know Forster, I told him I had goods to sell, and he said he would send a gentleman to look at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Your's is a room over a stable - A. Yes; I have two rooms, one leads to the other. My brother lived with me; I have two beds in one room, and a turn-up one in another - I do not know where my brother is; I did not give him notice to be off - I have not seen him since the morning I was taken to prison - he was to receive no part of the money for them, nor pay any part, he only lifted them in the coach. I was only put to the bar once at the office; I was taken there three times, as a criminal. I did not know that my brother was off when I became a witness. I had no communication with any body. Cochrane shewed Atkinson the goods, and said,</p>
               <p>"These are the goods," he said, very well. I do not know whether my servant saw Atkinson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How much did you raise on the muslins which you pawned - A. I do not know; I gave the officer all the duplicates. I went to the play with Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and next morning, Morris came up, and said George had left a large bundle in the passage, and George came up to me, he said he had them from Cochrane, and he was coming to my house to look at them - it was bulky, I did not know the contents till I got home, I did not conceal it.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not conversation in one of your rooms be heard in the other - A. Not without paying particular attention. I told the officers of it directly they came to my house. I was not so much surprised to find muslin in it, as I might have been. I gave Cochrane's wife a 5 l. note, which I had saved for my rent; I mentioned this at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you send the servant out of the room - A. No; she was in the sitting room - I went into the bed room. I have been in custody ever since. I have had no promise that I shall not be prosecuted.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been desired by your mistress to pawn any goods for her - A. Yes; the first thing was some of her wearing apparel, this was before the parcel was brought; after it was brought, I pledged about three pieces of muslin, for 1 l. each - she told me to take them to Mr. Sowerby, at the corner of Finsbury-street, and I pawned them there - I took one parcel to Attenborough's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any woman coming to your mistress - A. I have seen Mrs. Cochrane there, on the morning the goods came; she took away about three pieces of muslin - I do not know Fenton,

Yes; I did not tell the Magistrate that it was his voice, nor that Mrs. Cochrane took away any muslin, I was not asked. I have seen my mistress three times, I do not think I have talked with her about this - I cannot say whether she has spoken to me about Mrs. Cochrane; I was with her a quarter of an hour each time, and spoke to her to-day for about five minutes - I believe Cochrane was acquainted with my mistress.</p>

About the 21st of January, I met Cochrane, at Paddington, by Pickford's warehouses; he asked me if I had met his waggon, I said, No. He said he thought the waggon had been come, and that he had been into the town, to carry a great deal of money for Mr. Bache; he put his hand to his side-pocket, and shewed me a great quantity of sovereigns, there was a handful of sovereigns.</p>

            , re-examined. Cochrane had some talk with me about money, about the time the muslin was missed; he came to me and said, he had been extremely fortunate, that he had found a purse, containing a sum of money; I asked how much, he said there was some sovereigns in it. I asked him if there was any bills in it, to lead to a discovery of the owner, he said, Yes; there was a bill; I asked if it was a bill of exchange, he seemed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200024"/>not to understand me; I asked if it was a Bank of England note, he said it was very much like one, that he found it near the London Docks - I advised him to have it advertized, he said he would look at the papers and see if the owner had advertized it. I cautioned him not to make an extravagant use of it; he said he would not, and that he had handed it over to his wife. About a week or ten days after, we had a further conversation; he said it contained more than he had told me. I asked him what, he said it contained a bill of 10 l., payable at the Bank of England, but not a Bank note, and that it had been out for three or four years, that his brother had taken it, and it was paid without hesitation - he had 32 s. a week.</p>

               <p>COCHRANE'S Defence. I can account for the money. My master sent me to Charing-cross, for twenty-one sovereigns; I often had 30 l. of his money. The money I spoke to Haynes about I found the Sunday before Christmas-day; as I was going to Limehouse. I told him to look in the papers for an advertisement - it was as hard for me to get the goods, as to break from this bar.</p>

            . She first came to live with the prisoner as his wife, about four years ago. On the evening of the 9th of February, between six and seven o'clock, or rather later, she asked me to feel her eye; the prisoner was sitting by the fire, smoking his pipe. I felt her eye - it was very much bruised all down her face. She said, in his presence, that William had done it through her wanting to take some money to the landlord. She said,</p>

               <p>"I have got 5 s." I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better take it up." She said,</p>
               <p>"If I do not go up to-night I cannot go in the morning, for I owe him so much money." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I will serve you ten times worse if you do not hold your noise." He then kicked her several times about the legs, and said he would serve me as bad as her. She went out with the 5 s., as I understood, to take it to the landlord, who lives in the neighbourhood. I sat in the room; I was in and out in the course of the evening, until two o'clock, when she returned from paying the landlord. The prisoner asked her for sixpence; she said she had not got it; and, using very bad expressions; he said, if his father and mother came out of their graves, he would kill her that night; he up with one hand, and had a pipe in the other, and he dashed her down, stood with the pipe in his hand, and with all his force, stamped on her belly several times. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do'nt, William, do'nt do that." He said, if I offered to pick her up, he would serve me worse than her. I being very ill, dare not get up, for fear he should knock me down. She lay there about a quarter of an hour, and was very stiff; she put out her hand and asked me to pull her up; she got up herself by a chair, and he came from the fire-place, kicked her several times on the legs and hurt his bad leg; and repeated, that if his mother and father came out of their graves he would kick her ten times worse. I asked her to go and have a glass of gin, as she was so ill - she was quite sober. We went to Mr. Peach's in Church-lane, and she called for a quartern of rum; it was not many steps off; three of us drank the rum between us; and when we got back he was sitting by the fire smoking his pipe - he took her by her two arms, dashed her against the bedstead, and said she had been spending his money. She said she would give him a pot of beer if he wanted it, and sent for one for him; after he drank it, she went to Peach's again and had half a pint of beer herself - I went with her - she could not drink it, and I did. I cannot tell what time this was, as there was no clock; I was there till one o'clock in the morning, staying in the room. When we came back from Peach's again, he took her and dashed her against a fender with all his force. I never saw him more severe in his life; and as she lay on the floor, he said, he did not care if his father and mother came from their graves he would kill her that night. She lay on the fender a good while; when she got up, she said something had had burst on her right side, putting her hand to the top of her neck. Morris came in then; I cannot say what time it was, but when I went out for the gin, I met the patrol, and wanted her to give charge of him; she said,</p>
               <p>"No, I won't, and I shall not be obliged to any one else who does."</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing passed about her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200025"/>pockets - A. When she lay on the floor, before she was thrown on the fender; he had taken her by her arms and dashed her on the coals, which lay in the corner of the room by the side of the bed; she lay on her back and fainted; she was quite stiff; I thought she was dead. He cut her pockets off, as she lay there, put them into his coat pocket, and sat down; and then she got up by the chair, as I said before. She said, he has got all my money, and sat down on the chair. I asked her if she would go to bed; she said, yes - and then I put her on the bed, without undressing her; - he took her by her arms and dashed her down on the floor; (this was the time he dashed her on the fender.) After he got her pockets he went out, and then came back again and sat by the fire smoking; she went and sat by him. Mr. Morris came in and fetched her some raw beef to put to her eye. I then went to bed; it was then, I think, between one and two o'clock. She never struck or offered to strike him, or did any thing to him. She called him one very bad name after he struck her. She was a thin woman, and had been very ill; she was tall but not strong.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner drunk - A. No; he appeared to have been drinking - I slept in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you so long in the room - A. My knee was so bad I could hardly move - I boarded with the prisoner, and only slept up stairs; I am an unfortunate woman - I had no quarrel with the prisoner; I saw him at breakfast, he appeared very severe then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I knocked her down at all - A. Yes. A young man and woman lodge in the back room; four or five people lodge in the house, they were all out at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you went to bed, did you leave them sitting by the fire - A. Yes; and she had her eye tied up.</p>

On Saturday night, the 9th of February, I had been at home all day, and about seven o'clock, I heard a noise in the parlour where they lived - I went into Long-acre for somesugar; got back very near eight o'clock, and before I got to the door I heard violent screams from the woman - I went into the parlour, and found her and the prisoner there; she was lying down on the floor, on her back - the prisoner was with his left hand leaning on the table, kicking her on the belly; he did it several times with great violence - when I went in, she said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Nicholls, shelter me from this villain, for he will kill me." I said, he should not ill use her, and got between them - he said, if I interfered, he would serve me the same way - I then desisted, got the woman from the ground, and got her into a chair; she cried out several times, in a low tone, as if she was hurt - she fainted away in the chair - he was sitting down by the fire, and did not help her; he did nothing.

             came in while she was fainting, which lasted five or six minutes - I gave her water, but she could not take it - when she recovered, I assisted her to a chair, and placed her by the fire; I saw the side of her left eye was very black, and swollen - I had seen him kick her there; he kicked her on the stomach, and on the head - I noticed the blackness, she said, in his presence, he had kicked her there, and that she felt very ill in her inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this - A. About eight o'clock when I went in, and I stopped there till about eleven o'clock; I got him quite peaceable, and then went to bed - he went to sleep by the fire, and she went to sleep in her chair, with her head against the wall. I remained awake; she groaned very much when asleep - I left Morris and Smith there. After I got into bed I heard a noise in the prisoner's room; I got up and went in again, and found Smith and Morris there. I believe it was between twelve and one o'clock; they were peaceable - Abbot was sitting by the fire, smoking; I went to bed in five or six minutes, and was not disturbed in the night. About eight o'clock in the morning I went out on an errand; on coming back, I went into Abbott's room, and saw him and Morris there; when I came to the door, I heard him turn from the bedside, and say,</p>
               <p>"D - n her eyes, she is dead" - I went to the bed side, and saw her lying on her right side, quite cold; she was dead; he turned away and sat by the fire, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, she is dead, they can only have to bury her." I remained in the room till Bartlett came and took the prisoner away - he did not attempt to get away; I do not think that he knew Bartlett was sent for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you lived there - A. Only five days. My husband is sergeant of the 90th regiment, and is at Malta; I am from Manchester, where the regiment had been, and being a stranger in town, I went there to lodge, without knowing what place it was - I came here to get sent to Malta, but was bound over to appear here.

            . I lived at this house, in February, in the back garret. I came home on this night, between twelve and one o'clock; all was quiet then. I went into the parlour to pay my rent. Abbott was asleep by the fire; Lees shewed me her black eye, and said, she had been used very ill. I got a piece of beef, and came back to her; the prisoner was still asleep - I put the beef to her eye; she went out of the room, and I stopped there - she returned in about ten minutes; Abbott was then awake - she sat on a chair, he got up, pulled her off the chair, threw her on the floor, and stamped his foot upon her several times, and kicked her about the body; she lay upon her left side; I do not know on which side he kicked her. I lifted her up, and put her to bed; she remained there a short time, and then he again threw her on the floor, kicked, and stamped his feet on her several times - he used a bad expression, and said, he wished he could kick her more without hurting his leg; I did all I could to hinder him, but he fell on her with such violence, I could not get between them time enough - I then lifted her upon the bed a second time. I never heard her speak again; it might then be between two and three o'clock or later - I had no watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, while you were there, give him the least provocation, either by word or action - A. Not the least - when I put her on the bed a second time, something came from her, through his kicking her, as I thought, and he said,</p>
               <p>"the **** has **** the bed;" he then dragged her off again, and kicked her - I told him he would kill her;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200026"/>he said, if he did, he would take her to Brooks's next morning, making use of a bad expression; Brooks is a surgeon, in Gray's-inn-lane, as I understood. The servant girl came into the room, helped me to get her clothes off, and got her into bed a third time - I never heard her speak afterwards; I sat by the fire all night, and about six o'clock in the morning, I heard a ratling noise in her throat - I heard her breathe afterwards; I took the ratling noise to be her sobbing and crying.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to remain in the room - A. He sat up all night; I remained there, because she asked me to stop there to prevent his beating her. I left the room about a quarter before eight o'clock; I then thought she was asleep. Nicholls was comingin as I was going out; I believing her to be asleep, told her not to disturb her - Nicholls had been in the room before that, went out for something, and then came back again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you - A. A wheeler. I never had any quarrel with him; I had been there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call for assistance - A. I prevented him myself, then he was quiet for a short time, and then went at her again. I understood the watch had been called several times before, but she would never give him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not she begin first - A. She did not give him an angry word in my hearing.</p>

            . I lodged in the back parlour of the prisoner's house. On the Saturday night, about eight o'clock, as I was going out, Lees came to me, and taking my hand, put it to her eye. She came to my room about a quarter past twelve o'clock; she was dressed - she was very much bruised about the eye; she staid with me about ten minutes, and asked for some porter; she was perfectly sober; I was in bed - I had none. After going to sleep, I was disturbed again by a noise from Abbott's room, like somebody falling down - I heard a man's voice say</p>
               <p>"Bill, do'nt beat her so, for you will kill her;" I thought it was Morris's voice; this was succeeded by a noise and scuffling again. I did not hear the woman's voice at all.

               <p>"I am d - d if she is not dead, I am glad of it." I found she was dead, and fetched the constable - Abbott was between drunk and sober, he hardly knew what he was about; Bartlett fetched the doctor, and he came directly.</p>

            . Nicholls lived in the house - she came home as near as I can guess, about eight o'clock on Saturday night, she brought no man home with her - I sleep in the one pair; I heard very little of the quarrel, for I was up stairs cleaning the house all day; between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I came down to my dinner, and in the evening, I saw the prisoner and deceased together; several people was in the room - somebody were always coming in and out; I saw him follow her into the passage, and strike her three times with his fist, she did not strike him again. I went to bed between four and five o'clock in the morning, that was the time I undressed her; Morris lifted her into bed, for the other could not, he had no strength.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been doing from eight o'clock till the time you went to bed - A. Standing at the street door to let the beds, because he would not let me come into the parlour - after putting her to bed, I asked him if I might go and lay down myself, and told him Mary would not be able to get up in the morning, nor him either; he said he would make her get up, for he would drag her out of bed, she should not play her larks with him - I went to bed, and saw no more of him till to-day. I think he had been drinking, he knew what he was about, and spoke very correct. I do not know that the deceased had been drinking.</p>

            . I am assistant surgeon to the infirmary, for the parish of St. Giles, and St. George. On Sunday morning the 10th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to examine the body of the deceased; I found her laying strait in bed, undressed - she had her shift on, it appeared very wet; I examined the body, and found no external marks of violence, except a contusion extending over the upper and lower eye lid. I examined every part of her person - I saw her again on Tuesday, about one or two o'clock in the afternoon, and attended the opening of her body; the head was first examined, there was a large coagulation of blood, of three or four ounces; It had been formed in consequence of a rupture, of a blood vessel, in the base of the brain - the coagulation was between the dina mater, and the brain - this was sufficient to cause her death, and I believe it to be the immediate cause of her death, I have no doubt of it - the extravasation would arise from being kicked or beat about the body; the treatment described, would be sufficient to cause the rupture. Apoplexy would be produced by such causes - I should think the rupture happened within four or five hours of her death; she did not appear to be at all a person likely to have apoplexy, from natural causes. External appearances of bruises are occasioned by the extravasation of blood, which settles under the skin; it is visible earlier when they are made near the bone, than on any fleshy part - it sometimes appears much earlier, and sometimes much later, but after death, it never appears unless it is produced before.</p>
               <p>MR. OGLE. I am surgeon to the Infirmary, and was present at the opening of the deceased's body. I have heard Mr. Davis's account, it is very correct, full, and satisfactory - I agree with his statement in every particular. If discoloration does not appear before death, it does not after.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard acts of violence described, can you account for the absence of all symptoms of external violence - A. Yes; there might be the termination of blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200027"/>from the head, as to be the existing cause, without any marks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We went out, came home, and sat by the fire; I got smoking, and having three or four glasses, which got into my head; I found she was getting on too, and told her not to drink too much - I went out, returned, and said something to her; there was nobody in the room - she called me names, and hit me twice on the shoulder with something; I turned round, and hit her right in the eye with my flat hand, she said you have given me a nice eye, I said it serves you right, for you always begin with me first; she went out three times, and kept on having gin and rum, and was never further gone in liquor.</p>

The prisoners came up towards me, with another man; I was standing at the top of the lane. I took one of them, and my partner the other. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" they both said,</p>
               <p>"Working clothes." They threw their bundles down, and a pump, and ran away on my saying I must see what they had got - the third man got away. I took Day - he said,</p>
               <p>"You had better let me go." He kept learing over his shoulder; - I said, if he moved an inch, I would run my cutlass through his body. I handcuffed him, I never lost sight of him - I produce the bundles. I think the man who got away had the property. We found a large crow-bar at Andrews's house.</p>

            . I was with Best on the Monday morning after the robbery; his account is correct; I believe the man who escaped had the bundle - they were all in company - I afterwards went to Andrews's house, to make a search, and found him there. I saw the crow-bar - it might be used in digging gravel; I dug up part of a pump in the garden, which corresponded with what they left behind; the metal of it corresponds in colour. Day had it on his back. I am sure Andrews was one of them; he was two or three minutes in my view. When we took him at his house, he said he had nothing to do with it, and was only walking up the lane behind them. I am sure they were all three together, and two women were with them. They all tried to escape.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN BOND. On the 21st of January, I was walking home to dinner, about half-past one o'clock. I am lame. I was in <placeName id="t18220220-34-crimeloc183">Gower's-walk, Whitechapel</placeName>

I do not think he was walking when I first saw him; I did not suspect him, and thought he might stop the other, but he did not; but when the man that robbed me came up to the prisoner, there were three of them, and all ran off together. I rather trembled, and was almost overcome; I sat down in a house for a few minutes - he was apprehended the same evening.</p>

            . On the 21st of January, I saw the prisoner standing by our door, in Gower's-walk; I noticed him, and saw another lad come up to him, he was about fourteen years old: he said to the prisoner as he turned the corner</p>
               <p>"Now." I looked the other way, and saw another lad, of the same size, standing by the corner, and immediately, as Mr. Bond turned the corner, I saw the lad snatch the watch out of his pocket, and run off by our door. Mr. Bond cried Stop thief! I could not get out of the house to pursue him as the table stood by the door, but directly the lad ran off the prisoner ran to him and hit him on the head. I saw the watch in his hand, with the chain hanging out; the lad directly gathered the chain up in his hand, and all three ran off together. A dog ran out of a cooperage and ran after them - the prisoner beat the dog back twice.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of January, I met Bond in Lambeth-street, about three minutes walk from Thompson's; he said he had been robbed of his watch - Thompson was with him, also a cooper, who described the persons. I went with Thompson to look for them, and between seven and eight o'clock, I found the prisoner at the Anchor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200028"/>public-house, Lower East Smithfield; I took him from the description I received of his hat; I found 9 s. 6 d. in his pocket.

I was serving a gentleman, and asked her to wait. I was obliged to go to the back of the shop for stockings for the gentleman, and was detained about five minutes by him. On coming to the front, the prisoner was going away, and directly she left the shop I missed a piece of handkerchief. I went after her, found her about one hundred yards off, and saw them peeping out from under a bundle which she had. I found it was my master's.</p>

I quickened my pace, and after going ten or twelve steps; they turned and passed me; I then lost sight of them until I got to Wine Office-court, when I again saw them; they were returning to meet me, and before I could recover from my surprise, one of them (not the prisoner) made a snatch at my watch, my fob was twisted inside, and the chain broke, through the violence of the pull. I attempted to seize the man, when the prisoner and the other got round me; the prisoner put his hands against me, and prevented my following the man with my seals; he ran up Hind-court, and the prisoners followed him; I pursued, and on going up the court I received a kick from one of them, near my groin, which prevented my following for a few seconds; I then followed, but lost sight of them in Gough-square. I ran down a court, leading to Shoe-lane, and rose an alarm; I turned back, came into Fleet-street, went into the court, and saw two men looking for something on the ground; one of them, who was very intent on looking, did not see me, but the others did, and gave a signal; he ran towards Fleet-street, the light reflected on his features, and I identified him; it was the prisoner. I had seen him three times by a good light, and am certain of him; he had prevented my pursuing the thief. I then attempted to seize him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now I have one of you at any rate;" he replied,</p>
               <p>"Have you, ***** you, then take that," and gave me a tremendous blow on my back. I had a stick in my hand - I cannot say whether the blow did not come from my stick, by his knocking against me. He ran back up the court. I followed, and from an alarm I gave, a gentleman stopped him; when I came up, he was just rising from the ground, trying to get away. I rose my stick to strike him, and the gentleman; thinking me one of the party, let him go; he was finally secured. I am sure of his being the man. It was a moon-light night, and there was a strong light from the fish shop.</p>

            . I am an engraver, and live in Gough-square. About a quarter before ten o'clock at night, I was sitting in my parlour, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and seized a person at my door, who said,</p>
               <p>"There he goes!" In consequence of which, I let him go. I saw a great many people coming and heard somebody had been robbed - I went in again - I have no recollection of his person. Five minutes after I heard the alarm again, I went out, and heard footsteps coming from Hind-court, and made to the corner leading to King's Head-court, and seized a person about the size of the prisoner, who was running up; we wrestled, and were both on the ground, when the prosecutor came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got you now," and lifted up his stick. I suspected him, held up my arm to protect myself, and the person escaped from me. I found the prisoner at the watch-house, and believe him to be the man.</p>

            . I am a lighterman, and live in Upper Thames-street. On the 8th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Upper Thames-street, and saw the prisoner in company with two others. I saw him first trying a door, they passed on about four doors further, and found a door a-jar - one went in, and the other two waited outside, passing backwards and forwards; their companion came out in a short time without anything - they passed on, I followed, and saw them try another door; they went on till they came to Allhallows church. I met a friend, who joined in watching them - one of them got on a step, and looked into a coach, which was drawn up, and the driver had left. They passed on, we went into a public-house and saw them return to the coach, pass it, then return, and the prisoner left the coach and walked up Suffolk-lane with something; the other two must have been between the coach and the horses. I saw the prisoner had something, followed, and caught him with this swing-glass in his hand. I took him back, and found the coachman coming out of an eating-house, opposite to where the coach stood, he said it was taken out of his coach; the prisoner then resisted and tore my shirt - I kept him fast, and gave him to the officer.</p>

I was quite sober - Lewis followed her directly; when I got to Cornhill, I missed my watch. A gentleman passed while they were with me, but did not stop - I know my watch was safe when I was in the alley; I ran to find them but they were gone. On Thursday, I saw them together, in Gracechurch-street, between nine and ten o'clock at night; I said nothing to them, but went home - I watched there on Friday night, about the same time, and saw them. I went home again, without speaking to them; I wished to speak to my father about it first, and that is why I did not call the watchman. I saw my father on Sunday; and they were taken on the Monday night - I had two constables with me. I saw my watch, on the Thursday afterwards, in pawn; nothing improper passed between us.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoners on Monday evening, the 14th in Bishopsgate-street, in company. The prosecutor swore to Lewis, and said he believed Brown to be the other - I found nothing on them; Lewis said, it was a pity she should suffer alone, and that Brown was with her. I found the duplicate of the watch at Brown's lodging, No. 72, Rose-street, Bethnal-green; Lewis said, in her presence, that they were her lodgings.</p>

On this Monday, as I stood in the market, the prisoner passed by me; it was about a quarter past one o'clock. I asked him what he was going in such a hurry for. He said, he had carried a box, and was going home to his lodgings. I asked if he had heard any thing from home - he said No. I saw no more of him till the Saturday after; he did not say he had been to my lodging. A few minutes after the little girl fetched me. On the Saturday following I was standing in the market; he passed by me; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is that Berry?" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." I told him he was the person I had been looking for. He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I have been looking for you - you have been exposing me among my country people, about taking a watch." I got assistance and had him taken into custody. I have known him ten or eleven years - I have not found it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Duncan. On the 23d of December nobody was in the house but myself. I left the house between three and four o'clock. I double-locked the street door, and left all safe; the clerk had the keys of the warehouse; he took them away on Saturday night. I returned at six o'clock, and found the street door locked; but cannot say, whether it was double-locked as I had left it. On going into the passage, I found a black bag containing silk stockings, which was not there when I left the house. The patrol was coming by, and I told him; I stood at the door, and did not leave it. The warehouse door I found wide open, which was shut when I left, and a dark lantern in the warehouse. The constable and patrol searched the place. Mr. Pearson afterwards saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it dark when you left home. - A. No; it was day-light for half an hour after.</p>

            , I am a marshalman. In consequence of information, Bradfield and Mr. Duncan, went to Grout's lodging. I remained in Bishopsgate church-yard; they returned to me there; Bradfield and I then went to Grout's lodging, and on returning found him with Mr. Duncan. I took him; we went into a public-house in Wormwood-street. I asked him if he had given Bradfield two pair of gloves to sell to Stevens; he said he had, and that he found them in a bit of paper in Bishopsgate-street, by the London Tavern. I asked him if he ever had any more, or had seen any more, he said No; there was only one pair. The question was repeated more than once or twice; he gave the same answer. I took him and Bradfield to the justice-room; this was on Wednesday the 2nd of January - I felt his right hand coat pocket and found nothing; as I was going to the left hand coat pocket, he put his hand in it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't take my money." I watched him draw his hand out, and saw a piece of paper in it. I opened his hand, and took it out; it contained four pair of silk gloves. I believe there was a penny, a halfpenny and a farthing in his pocket. I said,</p>
               <p>"How is this! you told me you had only the one pair, that you sold to Stevens." He said,</p>
               <p>"The four pair were with the one pair; I found them altogether." I went several times, and to a great many places, to find Solomon, but could not. I went to his neighbourhood, to Grout's, and several public-houses. The paper was not muddy - it was a loose bit of paper - I cannot say what weather it was on the 23d of December.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I accompanied Mr. Duncan and Harrison to search Grout's lodgings, in Still-alley, Houndsditch. I searched two rooms on the second floor - the house had no number. Grout's wife came in at the time. In one of the rooms I found a black bag; there was a bed in each room. In the large room backward in which his wife was, I found a black bag containing a quantity of mitts and gloves, all silk. I found the bag in an old broken press-bedstead; and in a box, containing women's clothes, I found a paper, containing more silk gloves, I think about four dozen. In the next room, which is a small front room, communicating by a door from one to the other, and fastened on the large room side (both rooms had doors communicating with the staircase.) I found two black bags, empty; and a pair of half silk stockings, which had been worn. I compared the three bags with the other found in the prisoner's house, they tallied exactly in size, colour, quality, shape, and tape. Grout's wife was taken, I saw her in Grout's company - he acknowledged her as his wife - she was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did he acknowledge her as his wife - A. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is true what I told you to-day, that my wife brought them, and here she is, ask her." The door opening from the small room to the staircase was unfastened; I could go from the large room to the small one.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Grout. I know Solomon; he was my father's lodger, he lodged in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200033"/>the little front room, for three or four weeks before my father was taken, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you live at the time of this transaction - A. I was servant to Mr. Lazarus, of Cutler-street; I went home three or four times a week for clean things; my father's is the large room, a door leads into the other room, which is fastened on my father's side, with a piece of leather and a nail. Only Solomon lived in the other room - my mother cleaned it, and made his bed. I never saw the bags before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you come from - A. Brand's house - he told me that he could see my father was innocent, because he was lame; and said it was my duty to come and get my father off.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mind so as you get your father off - A. No; I have no reason to care for Solomon; I am angry with him for getting my father into trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How does Solomon get to his room - A. There is a door to the staircase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state what you have to-day, before you went to Brand's - A. Yes, at Guildhall. I have been kept at Brand's for fear I should run away. I was sent to sleep at a person's the night before I was examined. I am near sixteen years old.</p>

I have examined this property; here are a pair of half-hose, partly worn; I had seen them on the Friday or Saturday before the robbery - the mitts and gloves are all their's; I had seen them in the course of two months previous; they had been many years in the house; we sell for exportation only, and pack and ship all goods ourselves; there is a private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to to say you saw that identical pair the day before - A. I saw the dozen of which they formed a part, and opened the paper - we have a mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that mark be on every pair you have - A. No, only on that dozen, as it was all we had of that quality.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Must all these goods be taken at one or at different times - A. I should think it would take two hours to remove them; they might take them away at once in three or four bags, each bag would weigh fifty or sixty pounds. They opened six drawers to get them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched after Barnett in the neighbourhood of Petticoat-lane, I knew him before; I found him on the 21st of January; I had been looking for him for a fortnight or three weeks. I took him into the George, public-house. Worster was with me, and sat in a box opposite to him - he opened the door, shut me in the box, ran off, and made his escape down Still-alley. I followed him, and was then stopped by his brothers - as he went out at the door, he said,</p>
               <p>"Joe," his brother Joe stopped me. I saw him again on the 2d of February, when I was in the Lee Hoy, Mile-end, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He was smoking his pipe very quiet, on the 21st of January - A. Yes; he was at the corner of Still-alley, which is a place much frequented by officers. I told him to come into the George, public-house and stop till Worster returned. I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is all right, or you would not be standing here," he smiled, and said</p>
               <p>"Yes, or I should not be here." This was on the day Grout's wife was discharged.</p>
               <p>GROUT'S Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the robbery. My wife brought the things up into our room - I asked what she had there, she said it was a few things belonging to Mrs. Barnard, where she was lodging.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON'S Defence. I know nothing whatever of the transaction.</p>
               <p>MR. PEARSON, re-examined. The goods were worth 500 l. or 600 l., without those found in the passage - Those found in Still-alley, are not worth above 15 l. or 16 l.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Union-place, Tabernacle-row, I have two rooms there. On the 23d of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Solomon knocked at my door, and asked me to go to his father, who lives about one hundred yards off, to ask him for a shirt and handkerchief, as he was not on good terms with him. I asked him in and went, and his father gave them to me - he went into my kitchen and washed himself, then went into my bed-room and dressed himself. I asked him to dine with me, which he did; we dined between twelve and one o'clock, and after dinner, had two or three pots of beer - he staid with me till ten o'clock. When he heard the watchman call ten, he said he should be too late, he did not leave me all that time.</p>

               <p>Q. At home at your place - A. Why, to tell you the truth, she lives with me. Mrs. White is in the family way and is not well.

Her sister did live in Pratt-street, Lambeth, a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was Mrs. Shannon or Shillitoe in your house when you left it - A. Yes, this morning she was, I left at nine o'clock, and have not been home since - she is her own doctor, she knows her complaint, and has medicine in the house. I suppose it is nine months since a doctor attended her; she had a very violent pain in her bowels this morning, and said she was very poorly, and had rather not come here - I am sure she is too ill to come; she said,</p>
               <p>"A'y'nt you going to the Old Bailey to night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, will you go," she said,</p>

               <p>Q. You only asked if she should like to come - A. She not being a married woman, did not like the disgrace. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200034"/>left her ill this morning - I understand the prisoner lived in Still-alley, I was never there. The last time I saw the prisoner before, was when he was in possession under the Sheriff. I was subpoenned to come here about Wednesday. Shillitoe let the prisoner in.</p>

On the 6th of February, I was in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner walk backwards and forwards by the prosecutor's shop; I saw him pass the door - Reeves put his hand inside the door, and took the hat out, and gave it to Woolf, who had a cap on, which he took off, and on putting it into the hat, put it on his head, when I siezed him with it on his head, Reeves ran off, and the next day, as I was taking Woolf to the Compter, I saw Reeves opposite the Compter - I took him; I knew him before, and am sure of him.</p>

            , JUN. On the 17th of February, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I desired the servant to go up stairs for my snuff-box. While she was gone, we heard somebody run down stairs, and slam the door to; I went into the passage, and met the servant with my snuffbox in her hand. In consequence of what she said, I went into the street, and overtook the prisoner about one hundred and fifty yards from the house - I recognised her as an old servant of my father's; she had left about a year and a half.</p>

               <p>"Take this, and say nothing" - she pushed me aside. There was a bundle near her, she stood close over it; she shut me into the room, and ran down stairs.

               <p>"I have not, all that I have taken you will find up by the side of the bed." I asked her how she got into the house; she said,</p>
               <p>"I got over the wall on Saturday night, and laid myself in the lumber-room, (which is in the yard,) till four o'clock on Sunday, and then took an opportunity of going into the house, while your dinner was going up, and then laid myself in the coal cellar, where you will find my shoes."

The property stated in the indictment was in the desk; it was locked, and was in the back parlour. I missed it about nine the following morning; and have found two of the bank-notes, which have a private mark on them; it was G. C. and Co., my agents, and my own initials. I had parted with none of them since I received them. I saw them in the desk when I locked it; the numbers of them were 20789, and 90. I stopped them at the Bank; and on the 8th of February I saw one of them at the Bank. The outer door of the house is always shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you recollect the number, or have you since applied to your agents. - A. I have applied since, but I know them without the number. I always put my initials on notes.</p>

I found the prisoner at the White Hart and Fountain, Rosemary-lane, about half-past ten o'clock that night; the prosecutor had described him, and said he could swear to him among a thousand. I took him into the White Hart, public-house, he ran towards the prisoner, and smacked his face, and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d thief, give me my money." He denied the charge, and said he never saw him before.</p>

            . I am near eleven years old. My father keeps the house. The prisoner was a patrole in St. Martin's-lane. One night nearly a month ago, the prisoner's daughter came to my father's for me, and took me to her father; he asked me what trade my father was, I said a currier; he said,</p>
               <p>"Is it all your father's place," I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, but Mr. Geldard keeps his goods in my father's house;" he said</p>
               <p>"You often have a great deal of leather," I said</p>
               <p>"Yes sometimes, but the leather which comes in is Mr. Geldard's;" he said</p>
               <p>"There are pieces come off the leather," I said</p>
               <p>"Yes there are often pieces come off;" he then said</p>
               <p>"Could you get some," I said</p>
               <p>"No they are not mine, I dare not touch them;" he said</p>
               <p>"Can't you get me some, don't you have some given you," I said Yes; he told me to bring some of them up - I took him what my father had given me; they were parings not worth above 2 d., and one night about three weeks ago he came to our place, and rang at the bell, I let him in, and he came to my father's room, on the same floor as Geldard's; he said,</p>
               <p>"What a nice comfortable little room you have got," and then began pinching some leather about in my father's shop - he said,</p>
               <p>"Whose is this," I said,</p>
               <p>"Geldard's" he said,</p>
               <p>"Can't I have it," I said,</p>
               <p>"No;" he said he must; I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Huggett, it will be sure to be found out, if you take it;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I will be answerable for it, if it is;" he then wrapped it up in some green baize - he took more than a dozen pieces. I said,</p>
               <p>"You had better not take them, they will be missed," he said,</p>

               <p>"You little stupied fellow, why don't you hold your tongue;" he then took them, and saw some more pieces hanging up, I said,</p>
               <p>"You must not have them," he wrapped them up, and threw them into the gutter, between the two houses, and said he would come for them to-morrow; he went away directly with the cordovan leather.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell of this - A. I did not tell of it - it was found out a week after. He kept telling me not to tell, and if it was found out, he would settle it. My father had me in the watch-house for a night.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Smellie. I have known the prisoner nearly twelve months. On Monday week he and his brother called to see me. I asked him into the parlour while his brother went to fetch some spirits. I left him in the parlour while I went to serve a customer; he went out in about a minute, and did not return. He did not stay to drink the spirits. His brother came back. A sovereign and five half-crowns were on the mantle-piece, in a half-pint measure, with other silver; it was all taken - I had seen it an hour before; nobody but me and Wood had been in the parlour. I went to look for him, and met him the same night very drunk. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old, and live in Isabella-row, about a quarter of a mile from Hobson's. About half-past seven o'clock, on Saturday evening, I saw Harrison, opposite Hobson's house dancing. I passed him - then saw him whistle, and look up towards the balcony - it is a French window. I cannot say whether it was open. I looked up and saw somebody on the balcony with a large white bundle in his hands - it was a young boy, almost as tall as Harrison. The prisoners were two of them. He threw the bundle to three persons who were below. Harrison was close to the house. I think he laid hold of the bundle. I went and called at a sadler's, next door. Before the bundle was thrown out, Mascoe said to me,</p>
               <p>"Push on;" and I went to the sadler's - I opened the door, went in, told the apprentice; he came out; and then I saw another bundle thrown from the window - one of the three picked it up - I think it was Harrison. I saw the man get out of the balcony. The apprentice ran to call his master, and when he came out, they were all gone, with the bundles; they all four went up Stafford's-place; we did not follow them. I saw Harrison in custody on the Monday, and was sure of him; and about a week after I saw Mascoe come out of the lock-up place, at Bow-street, and told the officer that he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you. - A. I live with my father, who was inspector of gas-lights, and is now promoted. I have known Harrison two years; he is a lamp-lighter. I saw him there for ten minutes, and am positive of him. There was no ladder at the balcony.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Harrison on Monday. the 4th of February, at his father's, in Vauxhall-road. He was denied to me, but I found him in bed; and Fitzgerald, who was with me, pointed to a hat in the parlour, and said it was what he wore, and said he was the man who received the bundle. About a week after, Mascoe was at Bow-street on another charge. Harrison was being examined, as Mascoe was brought out of the lock-up place. Fitzgerald said he was with Harrison. - The balcony had been painted that day; and there was fresh paint of the same sort on the back of Harrison's jacket.</p>

Next night, between five and six o'clock, I went and found the door open, and the bundle in the middle of the room. I could not find her all over the house, and sat by the fire, supposing she was moving, when she returned, and said she would swear tomorrow that I broke the door open.

               <p>"You are one of them," he said nothing, but knocked me down; Clark flew at him, and laid hold of his handkerchief, which gave way, and he got off, but was secured - nobody was near us but the four men we had passed; they were all in company together talking.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had either of the three men a light coat on - A. I think not, but cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the public-house most of the afternoon. I left at six o'clock, returned, and three men were sitting there. I came away; and at the corner of the passage heard a bustle, and the prosecutor collared me; I pushed him away, and he was going to strike me again, and I ran away.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutors. On the 15th of November, the prisoner came to the shop; I believe him to be the man - Mr. Williams and Mr. Homyer were there; he produced me a brown paper parcel, which appeared to be directed to us; he said, he was not quite clear that it was directed to the right place. I opened it, and found it contained a letter, directed to Stock, Cooper, and Watson. I opened it, and said, there was no doubt but the order was for us, and if he was going further, and would call in a short time, the parcel would be ready for him. He said, Bartlett's waggon went about twelve o'clock at night, that he was going further, and would call - I made up the order; there was thirty six yards of double twilled black sarsenet, at 7 s. 9 d. per yard, seven yards and a half of French cambric, at 14 s. per yard. I went to Mr. Taylor, and satisfied myself before I made it up - he called again that evening, and I gave him the parcel, which he took away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day of the month was it - A. On the 15th of November, about five o'clock; he returned in three quarters of an hour. He was dressed in a dark coat - I parted with the goods, believing the order to be from Mrs. Holloway.</p>

She wishes you to send on next Tuesday, by Mr. Bartlett's waggon, from the Keys, in Fleet Market, furniture sufficient for two large four post bedsteads, with yellow lining; as it is for the rooms appropriated for the Judges, who sleep at our house, during their stay on the Circuit - let it be a very good and fashionable pattern. The furniture we had of you a few years since, wearing very well, my Mamma hopes you will let it be good. Send a piece of muslin finer than the last, and four black silk shawls with broad borders, for myself and sisters, not too expensive; as they are to wear over the silk - Mamma will leave the price and pattern to yourself, so as to correspond with our dresses. We visit London next month, with Colonel Bund, and we will call - Sir your obedient servant,</p>

            . I am porter to Messrs. Watson. On the 18th of December, I received two parcels; one directed to Mrs. Holloway, and the other to Colonel Bund. I took them to the Golden Key, public-house, Fleet-market, and delivered them to landlord Rowland.</p>
               <p>- ROWLAND. I keep the Golden Key, public-house. The prisoner came and asked me to take in two parcels which would come directed to go by Bartlett's waggon. He wrote down the direction which would be on them</p>

            . I am assistant to John Reeves, pawnbroker, of Snowhill. I have known the prisoner three months. On the 21st of December, he brought some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200041"/>sarsenet for sale; he said he was an agent employed by Mr. Stevens. I think he brought forty-one yards, and think it was in two pieces; we gave him 3 s. 6 d. a yard, and sold it for 3 s. 9 d. On the 24th, we bought seven pieces of chintz cotton furniture, twenty-four yards each, a remnant of eight yards, and seven pieces of calico. I think we gave him 1 s. 8 d. a yard for the furniture, and 10 d. a yard for the calico; the whole amounted to 20 l.; we sold part to Mr. Hedges and part to Mr. Miller. On the 14th of January, he came again; I bought three shawls of him, and a remnant of six yards of cambric; we gave him 9 l. 5 s. for that parcel. I believe we sold two of the shawls - I produce the other and the cambric.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who brought the goods - A. I think you brought some, and a porter the others; they were sent on Stevens's account, the prisoner called in four or five hours for the money, and I paid him. He produced me an invoice - I did not see the name at the top, I saw Watson and Co. on the furniture.</p>
               <p>MR. HOMYER. This shawl and remnant of cambric, are part of the order I packed up; I am certain of the cambric, the shawl is of the same description, but the mark is off.</p>

On the 19th of January, the prisoner came and cheapened a side of pork; after a little time, he brought it into the shop and laid it on a board, by the scale - a person told me to take care. He went into the market, and in five minutes, I saw him come in again, put it on his shoulder, and instead of going towards the scale, he came to the door. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where are you going with that? you have not bought it," he said,</p>
               <p>"If I have not, my master has." I said,</p>

            . I am a city patrol. On the 12th of February, about a quarter before six o'clock, I was coming by, and saw the prisoner in company with two others, lurking about Powell's window. I went back, passed them, and saw the prisoner and another close to the window, and the third opposite, looking about. I got into a door-way, and think he saw me, for he went over to them, and they came away towards me. I collared them both, and took them into a public-house; and found a knife on the prisoner, with putty on the blade. I found a pane of glass partly out, and the flute five or six inches out of the hole. I knocked and told the servant. While they were at the window I heard something fall like glass. One was discharged.</p>

I found the order entered in the order book as 24 lbs. of coffee at one price, and 12 lbs. of another kind, and a loaf of lump sugar; he had called me to see the sugars weighed, which was right; on weighing the coffee there was an excess of 7 lbs - there was 43 lbs. instead of 36 lbs. The invoice was written in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200042"/>consequence of the order entered by the prisoner, for 36 lbs. The parcel was put into the bag as before, and I went to the Mansion-house and got some officers, and on returning found the order was not to go till one o'clock, as he said his friend, Mr. Charles Tousley, (who he said the order was for,) was after a house in Piccadilly, and he, the prisoner would no longer be responsible for him, but if we went at one o'clock, Tousley would be at home, to pay himself. I desired the officers to return at one o'clock, which they did - Marchmont and Harrison waited a few yards off; I brought them in, and gave the prisoner in charge, while I followed our porter with the goods, keeping him in sight all the way; We watched him into No. 147, Ratcliff-highway; the name of Akers was over the door, in which name the prisoner had given us orders before, and afterwards said Tousley had succeeded him, and begged us to continue to supply Tousley on the same terms - I went into the shop, the same parcel was on the counter, and while I was there, a receipt was given to

               <p>"The person you call Tousley is Tucker, and she is your wife;" he did not deny it, but said he had been married since July, 1820 - he was then in custody, and acknowledged having done this two or three times, I said</p>
               <p>"You have certainly been defrauding us for a considerable time, for you have been married to this woman whom you call Tousley." he said,</p>
               <p>"Four or five times Sir, is the utmost, but I must have time." (by that I understood that he was confused.) He said,</p>
               <p>"You may search my premises, and see my books." I said</p>
               <p>"Your wife says you have no books" - he said he had a day book and bills; he was taken away; Marchmont and I then went to the house, and found his wife sorting bills, and in a small place, parted from the shop, we found five or six small parcels of sugar, and things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He had been some time in your service - A. Nearly four years; I never saw Tousley.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are various receipts you have signed for money paid by Tousley - A. Yes; the coffee was ordered in the name of Tousley, the prisoner weighed the coffee first, and when I weighed it I found an excess.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that, it was delivered, and the money paid - A Yes; my servant had orders to deliver it, and receive the money. I did it to ascertain the fact.</p>

I asked him to walk into the warehouse, which is up stairs: he said,</p>
               <p>"No, bring them to the door;" and while I was turning to fetch them he walked away with the jacket. I ran after him down Dock-street, hurt my foot, and could not follow. I saw him about eleven o'clock, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Ellis's service; I was outside the door when the prisoner came; he said the jacket would not fit him, then said it would do. I turned round, and in a few minutes saw my master pursuing him. He followed him through all the dark avenues, crying, Stop thief! to the quay where his ship was. I went on board, and said there was a thief, who had stolen a jacket; one and another threatened me, and the captain said if I did not go about my business he would give me in charge. I fetched an officer from Lambeth-street, and then the man was denied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked him if it was his ship<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200043"/>- A. Yes; and he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" he pulled the jacket off, and began working with the rest of the men. He did not say the jacket was little enough for his 24 s. I never sat eyes on him before.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I am an officer. Ellis fetched me on board the George, Berwick smack; I found the prisoner down in the forecastle; he asked one of his shipmates where the jacket was; he said it was in the hammock, where I found it. He said he did not steal it, for the man owed him money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 18th of November, I bought a jacket and trowsers of him for 24 s.; I paid him; he took them up, and wanted 1 s. more. I saw that he had changed them, and I would not have them. He said he would give 5 l. to a lawyer, rather than give me money or clothes. I went to the Magistrate, who asked the man's name; I said I did not know it; and he said it was no use to come without it. I went and got his name, and told the Magistrate I wanted it done quick, as I sailed next day. He said then there would not be time. I have a witness who went to the office with me, but I did not tell him what it was for, because my mates should not call me a fool. When I came back again I went and looked at a jacket, put it on, and said,</p>

               <p>"I will keep it for the 24 s. I gave you last voyage."</p>

I asked where he came from, and was going with it; he said he came from Mr. Smith of Epping, and he had been sent down to Smith's, by the captain of a ship for it - I think he said the captain's name was Low. The cow was not warm, but unwilling to be driven. Mr. Parish claimed it the same day. He said he was first going to Smithfield, and then to the captain with the cow.</p>

On the 1st of February, between twelve and two o'clock, I gave her leave to play in the court with her skipping rope; she had a row of beads and a coat on; she came in in a short time without them, crying, and complained of being robbed. She was playing in the court ten or twelve days after, and ran in to me. I went out and called to a man to lay hold of the prisoner. I pursued and took her in Southampton-street, running towards Covent-Garden, and told her she had stolen my child's neck-lace. She denied it, and said, I had no authority to take her, as I was not an officer. I took her back - the child came down, and said she was the girl who had robbed her. She denied it. I sent for Trueman, who was with the child, and she said she was the girl.</p>

            , of Stamford-hill. On Thursday, the 11th of February, some pale malt, which had come from Mr. Taylor, of Bishop Stortford, was carted from our wharf, to Messrs. Hanbury's brewhouse; the sacks were marked I. T., and the barge had his name on it. Twenty-six sacks or thirteen quarters, were put into a cart which the prisoner, Merry, drove. I gave him a delivery ticket; it was about six o'clock in the morning, and he had another load of the same quantity between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it your duty to see the cart loaded - A. Yes; I assisted in carting, and stood within seven feet of the barge - he loaded his own cart, and did not complain that his number was not right - we count the sacks in the cart.</p>

            . I am storehouse-keeper at Messrs. Trueman and Hanbury's brewhouse. I applied to Armstrong, and between twelve and one o'clock saw Merry drive his cart in with three others, driven by Dearman, Nichols, and Tyler. Merry drove the third, and I believe his was the third that was unloaded. Here is the delivery ticket which he gave me - it is for thirteen quarters, and only twelve came. I went up to Merry, and asked him if he had not some sacks concealed about him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I have a sack." I put my hand round him, and felt one under his clothes, marked J. T., which is Taylor's mark. I took Dearman into custody, and while I was so doing, I observed Merry get into his cart, and doing something to the sacks; he came down - I gave him in charge of Armstrong, then got up in the cart, and found an old great coat pressed between the sacks of malt where I had seen him, and in the coat was another sack, marked J. T. I asked if the coat was his - he said it was not; but he supposed some person must have thrown it in the cart. I went with Armstrong to the White Hart, Newington, kept by Chapman, and found young Armstrong there, talking to Samme. Armstrong, Sen., asked him if he had had any malt in there that afternoon, pointing to the storehouse; he said he had not. Armstrong said,</p>
               <p>"You must open the door, or I will break it open." Samme then took a key from his pocket, and undid the padlock. We there found two sacks of pale malt, one marked I. T., and a small quantity of pale malt in a third sack, and about two sacks shot in the bin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the carmen. - A. Only by sight. I know Merry's was the third cart - I saw them come in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You heard Armstrong ask Samme if he had any malt in that day. - A. Yes; we got there about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

            . On the 11th of February I saw the prisoner at Mr. Bailey's warehouse, at Stamford Hill. A quantity of malt had come from Taylor's to be sent to Messrs. Hanbury &amp; Co.'s; sixteen quarters or thirty-two sacks were put in the prisoner's cart, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and a delivery ticket was given him; he stowed them himself - the sacks were marked I. T.</p>

            . I am storehouse-keeper to Villebois &amp; Co. I was in the yard when the prisoner came with his cart of malt. I asked if he had any sacks concealed round his body, or if he had seen any malt dropped by the way; he said he had not, he had never stole a grain of malt in his life. His was the first cart that came in. I took him to Armstrong in the lobby; and, after being there a short time, he said he must go up the yard and put the nose-bags on the horses - I went with him. I had taken Dearman and Merry before that, which he knew. Church came up - I told him to point out the man who put the sacks under the manger; he said it was the prisoner; he made no reply. I had taken him about ten minutes after he came into the yard; he was very near the stable-door, and might have gone in many times without my noticing him - the stable-door was ten or twelve yards from the cart.</p>

I saw him take two sacks from under his smockfrock, and put them under one of the mangers - they were tied round his middle. I took them out and gave them to Dibbin in about half an hour.</p>

I gave an alarm, and pursued him, I lost sight of him for a few yards up the passage, then three men stopped me, and began hustling me, to prevent my following him. I kept crying Stop thief! and he was stopped at the end of the passage. The men then left me - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a printer. I was coming out of Gough-square, into St. Dunstan's-court, and heard the cry of Stop thief! The passage is very dark,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200048"/>and goes through a private house. I looked down the court, and it was clear - I saw the prisoner running towards me, and knowing nobody had passed me, I sprang out of the private passage, shut the door, and by that means stopped up the thoroughfare. The prisoner came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't stop me, for I am in pursuit of the thief." I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall stop you till somebody comes up, and in a few seconds, three men came up, apparently out of breath, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is." They looked round the corners, and kept asking,</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" I still said,</p>
               <p>"This is him," but they took no notice of me - I thought I had stopped the wrong person, and let him go. He instantly ran towards Fleet-street; the crowd were then coming up the court. The moment I saw him run, I thought he was the man, and called out,</p>
               <p>"That is the man," and saw him retaken. Mr. Carr immediately said he was the man.</p>

I watched them, and saw the prisoner following a gentleman towards Fleet-market. I then saw Edwards go up Fleet-street, the prisoner, and the other with a wooden leg, followed him, and just before they came to Fetter-lane, the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I told Edwards, he returned with me up Fetter-lane after them. I saw them at the end of Black Horse-alley, about ten minutes after, and took the prisoner, I found nothing on him, and am sure he is the boy. I knew him before - the handkerchief appeared yellow.</p>

            . I keep a boot and shoe-warehouse in Field-lane, Holborn. On the 1st of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into my shop together. Woodcock offered two boots for sale. I saw they were odd, and asked whose they were - he said his father's. I asked him why he did not send fellows - he said they were fellows. I said I suspected he had stolen them. I left them all in custody, and found Russell had lost them.</p>

            . In November, 1820, I lived servant to Mr. Williams, Edmund-place, Aldersgate-street; he was a baker. I employed the prisoner to make my dresses, as I knew her sister. On the 11th of November, 1820, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, she came to me, and said a man had followed her from my master's house, saying, that he would be a bankrupt in two days, and that my clothes were not safe in the house, and if I would give them to her she would take care of them. I gave her the articles stated in the indictment; - she said she was going to take them to No. 2, Lower Coleman-street, Bunhill-row - I knew she lived there. I went after them two days after, and she had absconded. I never saw them or her till the 19th of this month - I lived at my place seven months - she never came to me - I believe my master was a bankrupt about August.</p>

I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and come out - I crossed over and took him, with a hat in his hand, and a pair of gloves in it; he said some men persuaded him to do it.</p>

On the 15th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I had been out, and on my return, I found the prisoner in the counting-house. He asked if I would buy any quills; I told him to go about his business; and on his getting down one step of the door, I observed something blue in his basket, I asked what he had got - he made no answer, but was going down another step, I collared and took him back, and found my own great coat and a pair of boots of Mr. Gowen's, which were quite new. I cannot swear to the boots. I had had my coat about a year. I value it at 3 l. He said it was his first offence, and wished to be let go. He had two hundred quills and a large sack at the bottom of his basket.</p>

            . I am watchman of Mary-le-bone. On the 15th of February, just before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going up Bulstrode-street, with a bag under his arm, about sixty yards from this coach, and in Wellbeck-street, he put it down by a gentleman's door. I asked what it consisted of; he said,</p>
               <p>"A bag with a little wool." I took him to the watch-house with it, and found part of the coach lining under his waistcoat.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Nichols's service About the 15th of January, Thatcher and Smith were quarrelling in the office, and Smith said he would tell something about Thatcher's conduct, that would bring him before a Justice; Thatcher said if any thing burnt in his heart to let it out; he was not in the employ then, he only came to see Smith. In consequence of what Smith told me I informed my employers. Part of the paper was found at Wright's, by the Coburg Theatre, some at Mahon's in Coburg-row, and more at Mahon's in Suffolk-street.</p>

            . I have been in Mr. Nicholls's service five years, last summer. I and Thatcher were employed to sell some imperfect books, for waste paper, they were sold, in the warehouse, to one Murphy, and one day, I said to Thatcher,</p>
               <p>"I should like to have the value of that pile of paper," pointing to it; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you where you can sell it, without Mr. Nicholls knowing it." Two or three days after, he prevailed on me to take part of the money, which he said he had got for selling some - this was about October; I knew he had taken some away. My share was 18 s. On the Friday before the Saturday, on which we were taken into custody, Thatcher came running to the warehouse, in King-street, I beckoned to him to go out; he said</p>
               <p>"The old thief, (meaning Smith) has sold me, but I can bring up as much against him as he can against me pretty well;" I was once going out of this warehouse, with a bundle of paper; I met him, and he told me to go on, for it was all right, and at another time, I was in Cannon-row with him, and he asked me to take a bundle and to help him with his left hand. He then left, and was apprehended next day; he told me where he sold the paper - I do not know Eaton.</p>

I asked her to let me out, which she did, and went out herself. I followed her and said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me of a sovereign and some silver, and if you don't return it, I will charge the watch with you." I was nearly an hour in the passage with her; I did not miss my seal and key till I got to the watch-house, it was fastened to my chain by a split ring.</p>

               <p>"The Sheriff." Mr. Sheriff Parkins was passing in his carriage; about that time I felt them pulling at my watch, I resisted, and in the struggle, I could imperfectly distinguish the face of the person who was pulling at it. The watch was buttoned in my fob, they tore my breeches in getting it out; the moment they got it, he gave a signal, and all dispersed in a body. The prisoner has a great similarly in countenance to the one who took it, but I think he is an inch and half shorter.</p>

            , ESQ. I was passing in my carriage at this time. On first coming from Bridge-street, I saw a large gang, and kept my eye on them all through the street, and as we came through Temple-Bar, somebody was hustled, and opposite Southampton-street there was an interruption, by carts going along, and there was a considerable noise close to my carriage window. I looked that way, and saw Mr. Middleton hustled by the same gang. An officer had got hold of one of the gang, and was knocked down, and the man rescued - he came very near my window, and I had a full view of his face - he was very well dressed - that was not the prisoner, but he went off in company with the prisoner, as I believe; he came out of the crowd with the man, and accompanied him along the street. I do most certainly think the prisoner is the man. I described him to an officer - I will not swear that he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200052"/>the man - I never saw him again till the day His Majesty last went to the House of Lords - he was then taken on this charge.</p>

            . I am a constable of Pancras. I was with Taylor in Bridge-street, and saw a gang of about eighteen - we followed, and watched them through Temple-Bar. I was behind the Sheriff's carriage, and saw Mr. Middleton endeavouring to get into the True Briton Office; he was surrounded, and being hustled by a gang. I called Taylor, and pushed in among them, and collared a man who had Mr. Middleton's pocket-book, and was putting it under his coat - that was not the prisoner - the pocket-book dropped, and I was knocked down; and he got away. I cannot say positively that the prisoner was there at that time. I apprehended the prisoner the last time the King went to the House, from a description given me by Mr. Parkins. I had seen him several times after, but was not ordered to apprehend him before.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I was in company with Colton, and saw the gang in Bridge-street. I know the prisoner was in the gang there, and in Fleet-street. I do not think I noticed him beyond Temple-bar - I was abreast of Mr. Middleton when he was robbed, but could not distinguish the prisoner then.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKINS re-examined. After he was apprehended, and before he went before the Magistrate, he sent a messenger requesting to see me - I went and saw him at a public-house opposite the office. I asked what he had to say - he solicited my consideration for his wife and family. I told him I could have no consideration for them - I must perform my duty, and that I hoped he would prove himself to have been somewhere else on that day - he said he could not.</p>
               <p>JURY, to COLTON. Q. When you apprehended him did you recollect his person as being one of the gang - A. Yes; I had known him many years - he was one of the gang.</p>

I was inquiring for a lodging, as I was too late to sleep at my friend's in Seven Dials, where I intended. She took me to a house in <placeName id="t18220220-98-crimeloc530">George-street</placeName>

She sat by the fire smoking, and was going to get something to drink, but the woman would not let her go out. She came back, and blew the candle out. I called for a light - the woman brought one - I put on my clothes - my breeches felt light. I had three sovereigns, and 16 s. 6 d. in my pocket. We left the house together. I then felt and missed my money - she ran away immediately. I am sure she is the woman - I was afraid to make a noise in the house. I have frequently seen her before, and drank with her at public-houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not go into several cook-shops with her - A. Yes; I paid for her supper - we had two pots of porter and a quartern of gin.</p>

            . I belong to the Humane Society. I was coming down Greek-street, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw two men at Ware's door, which was shut. I saw the prisoner open it and go in - two more remained watching, he pushed a butter-tray along the counter, and came out, went in again, reached over the counter, and came out with the till; and all three ran away. I followed, he threw it down, and I caught him directly - it contained 36 s. 4 1/2 d.</p>

He said, he understood we were manufacturers of flannels, blankets, and woollen goods, and if we could do those articles well for him, he should become a very good customer; he gave me his card, and said he was Colonial purveyor - this card is like the one he gave.

He said he had obtained the appointment through the interest of the Duke of York, the person who last held the appointment having died, and saved something considerable - he then took from his pocket some papers, among which was a printed letter folded up; he opened it to show me the manner in which his orders came; it was dated Chatham, and signed</p>

            . This was filled up with the quantity of things wanted, it appeared to be an authentic Government order. I observed to him that goods for government orders were generally contracted for - he said this was quite a different thing altogether; that these orders came from the Colonies to his Majesty's depot, Chatham, in too small quantities of each article, to make it worth while for government to contract for them - that they were put together, and sent up to London for him to furnish. He then shewed me an invoice of linen goods, bought of Townsend and Brown, Cheapside; I do not exactly recollect the amount; he said, if he bought any of our goods, he should refer us to them. He then said he had retired from business some years, was unacquainted with woollen goods, and would send a person to look at them; that he had taken the warehouse in Bow-lane, for the purpose of receiving and packing the goods for Chatham - he left, and in a day or two, a person called and looked at the goods, on account of White - he did not select any, but a written order came afterward, signed

            ; in consequence of which, I went to Messrs. Townsend's, and afterwards saw White. I told him of the person who had called, and that I had been to Townsend's, and told them I was referred to them by White, who had ordered goods to the amount of 150 l. or 160 l., and that Mr. Brown said White had been introduced to them by a person, who had before furnished them with a valuable customer, who had told them of his appointment, and they had sent him 300 l. or 400 l. worth of goods, supposing all was right, but that they knew nothing about his property, but relied on the representation they had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw White, what passed - A. He came to see if I was satisfied with his reference. I said I had been to Townsend's, and told him what passed, but that they could give me no information of his property; he said,</p>
               <p>"As to property, it is of no kind of consequence; these goods are sent down to his Majesty's depot, at Chatham. I send my accounts down to Chatham every quarter, they are there examined, and passed in two or three days, and then I receive a bill on Government, which will enable me to pay you, and all my engagements." I considered this a very safe account - I sent him in goods to the amount of 151 l., to Bow-lane, entirely on the representation he made, I sent twenty-two pieces of flannel, eighty pair of blankets, and eighty rugs; they were all the property of Messrs. Turners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you seen Birch, who looked at the goods before you saw White. - A. No. Townsend and Co. are persons of great respectability; their recommendation had weight certainly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200055"/>Q. Did it not have such weight as to induce you to trust him. - A. That depends on circumstances. I do not say it would, as they stated he was not a man of property. I should not think him worth credit unless he held the appointment under government. I would not have let him have them, unless I understood from him that he held the appointment - it might have influence, added to his representation - his producing the circular had weight I recommended him to another house for hosiery goods.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you believe he held the appointment in consequence of what they said. - A. Of course. I suppose they believed he held the appointment. I would not have trusted him from what they said, if it was not in consequence of his having the appointment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say it was a maxim with you to trust no person, unless you know where they dealt - A. I do not recollect - it might pass.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. After the prisoner had the goods, did you see him. - A. Yes; he acknowledged receiving them, and said the inspectors had found fault with the blankets, and he had been obliged to make some little allowance on them, but in future it would not take place; for he had been to Chatham, and given them a dinner, which cost him 10 l., and they were good friends.</p>

I thought it bad, and shewed it to one of my daughters, who said it was very bad I asked if he had any other money; he said he had no more about him. I gave the shilling to Mary. to take to a neighbour for his opinion, and get it changed if it was good. She returned, and said it was very bad, Smith came in with her, and questioned him, and sent for an officer, to whom I gave the shilling, after marking it. He was taken away, and I then found, behind some reams of paper, where he stood, four bad shillings, in a piece of cloth, three were in separate papers; they appeared the same sort as that he gave me.</p>

The prisoner drove it, and put my trunk and two boxes in with a bundle, which contained the articles stated in the indictment, and other things. On arriving at Berner's-street, the footman handed my things out, and I myself went in; and in about half an hour, missed my bundle. I immediately went to the stand I took the coach from, and made enquiry, and next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I found the prisoner at his master's in Bulstrode-mews, and asked if he had seen any thing of the bundle I had left in the coach? he said he had not put up the steps of his coach, before a woman and a man accosted him at our door in Berner's-street, with a large box and bundle, and asked him to take them to the Ship, public-house, Charing-cross, and to drive as fast as he could; that the man wanted to ride on the box, but he said he never suffered that, and he must ride with the woman inside - that the man got in the coach, and he drove them to the Ship, and had something to drink with them there, and they went off by the Dulwich, Greenwich, or Woolwich stage. I said I was quite sure he had taken up no fare at our door; he said he did. I said I should certainly take steps to obtain my clothes. When he took me up, I told him I was going to my place - I went to Marlborough-street, they said he ought to leave it in Essex-street, at the expiration of four days. I did not know the number of the coach, but it was a yellow one - I know he took up no fare at our door, for I saw him put up the steps, and heard the coach drive off immediately - I have found some of my property, I had a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You went down in the kitchen, I suppose - A. I stood in the hall, it was dark. He was summoned before the Commissioners of Hackney coaches, six or eight days after, and before Mr. Dyer, and was discharged. I afterwards got a search warrant and found my stockings in his house, and a cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the warrant was granted, you gave the officer a list of your things, was the cap or stockings included in that list - A. Not the cap, the stockings were - he has surrendered to-day, to take his trial, I did not put everything down in the list.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Berner-street. On the 5th of November, I was on duty, and just before ten o'clock, I saw a hackney coach drive up to No. 10. A young woman got out, and some parcels were taken out. I was about ten yards off - it was a moon-light night - the coachman and the servant had a few words, I could not hear what about; he came from the door, shut up the steps, and drove away immediately into Oxford-street. I saw him nearly to the bottom of the street - he took no person up whatever, if he had, I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who handed the things out. - A. I cannot say. I saw him nine or ten doors down the street. I was asked about this next night. I attended at Marlborough-street. Mr. Dyer dismissed the complaint, and sent it to the Hackney-coach office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You would not speak to it when you found it. - A. I said the same as I do now, that I did not make it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On the 5th of January, I went to Bellas's, and found this property, and some letters on the mantle-piece, directed to her, which refer to some duplicates, Bellas gave me the duplicates on my asking her about the letters, I found several other duplicates in a tea-chest, one of which was for two plates, pawned at Neats's - I also found a shirt at Stevens's. I went to the prosecutor's house in Huntingdonshire, and found the prisoner there, and said, I had a warrant to apprehend her for felony, and asked for the keys of her box; she refused, but said she would shew me the place, I asked where her letters were, she said she was not such a fool as to keep letters by her, for such a fool as me to look at, and that she burnt them; I said I had found letters at Bellas's, and a parcel directed to Bellas - she said she had sent letters to her, that the housemaid wrote some, and a baker at Stilton the others.</p>

            . I am a widow. I know the prisoner - I have visited her at Mr. Skrine's in Portman-square; she brought the things produced to my house at different times - she gave them to me as a present. About a month before the family left town, she gave me four plates; I pawned two at Neats'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You received favours from her for your husband, while he was ill - A. Yes; he died two months ago. She did not bring me honey in the cups, it was in a jelly cup - when she brought the plates, she said they were broken china, one was chipped; we had some wine given us - I did not tell her I wanted glasses to drink it with; I thought she had a right to give me them.</p>

On the 11th of February, I found six pair of soles hid in a box in the cellar, covered with something; I told Russell of it, and he saw them, and just after that as the prisoner was going to dinner, we were in the cellar; he put his coat on, and came up; and after he was gone, I went down and found three pair gone - about five o'clock he went out of the cellar, the three pair remained then - he was alone for a few minutes. I went down and missed two pair more - he was then gone to tea. Russell marked the remaining pair, and at eight I left him in the cellar for a few minutes. I then went down, sent him up, and saw the other pair was gone. He was stopped, and the leather found on him in the counting-house, in his bosom; he denied having it, but when it was found, he said it was the first time. Mr. Jackson said it was not, and he then said he had sold a good many pieces to a man named Wright.</p>

Stop thief! and his companions followed close behind; he turned to the right, and I gave up the pursuit, and went to Worship-street office, described his dress and appearance, and in half an hour I went with the officer to the George, public-house, in George-yard, Whitechapel; two went in the back way, and I and the other at the front; and as I entered, three persons were coming out; neither of them was him; and as I looked round the tap-room, the prisoner was brought in from the back premises, I immediately said,</p>

The prosecutors said the man had a brown coat on, and he believed he was a Jew. I went in first - the door is very low - I was obliged to stoop to get in, and nearly passed the prisoner as I was stooping, the place being dark. I have known him many years. I think he said, How do you do, I said.</p>
               <p>"How do you do." Atfield caught hold of him, and brought him into the tap-room. He was dressed in a brown coat. We found Garton and the prosecutor in the tap-room, and he said he was the man who robbed him - his description answered to the prisoner.</p>

            . I take in needle-work and washing. I was at my door in Flower and Dean-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a young lad of short stature, run by my door - he had a light-coloured pepper and salt coat on, and was very much pock-marked. He ran towards the end of Flower and Dean-street - nobody was running before him - the prosecutor was following him about six yards behind, calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the lad to say whether it was the prisoner or not - A. It was not I am positive. I saw no more of what passed till half-past one o'clock, when the prosecutor came back with two officers, and I, as well as many more neighbours, hallowed out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake you have got the wrong man;" it was the general cry. I went to Worship-street to tell what I knew about it, but some man said I must not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the man who was running before Atwood to be the thief - A. Yes; no other could be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He was a young lad - A. Yes; he was not fair nor dark, nor so tall as the prisoner. It is impossible for any one to take the one for the other; he does not resemble him in the slightest degree. The prosecutor came down my street last Sunday afternoon - I was at the door - he asked me to tell him the name of the street; he said then that he had made a grand mistake, as he thought it was Thrall-street, and asked if I recollected his being robbed. I said, very well; but he had got the wrong person. He said he had not; and if he had, he had sworn to him, and must swear to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you knew the prisoner - Yes, I have known him as a neighbour for twelve years; he lived in Winfield-street, with his mother and father.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was not near the place at all - A. No one was near except the prosecutor and thief, neither behind or before - Mrs. Myers was also at her door. The lad was a stranger; he was crying out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window." He ran about a hundred yard up our street, and turned down Cale-street, which is the first turning. I have not seen him since. Mrs. Myers did not go to the office.</p>
               <p>JUDA MYERS. I live in Flower and Dean-street, at the the corner of Cale-street, three doors from Prior. I was cleaning my door, and all at once heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the thief running, and as he passed me he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't stop me, I have only broken a window." He was a shortish chap, high-shouldered, and had a pepper-and-salt coat on. I think it was a dark one. I saw Atwood running after him; nobody else was running either before or behind; the chap turned down Cale-street, went up Thrall-street, and I went in doors. They passed me at half-past twelve o'clock, as near as I can tell; and in about three quarters of an hour I saw the prosecutor pass our street again with two officers; all the neighbours cried out.</p>
               <p>"You have got the wrong man." They had the prisoner in charge. I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake you have got the wrong man, that is not the man you cried Stop thief! after." I did not go to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the officers - A. Atfield was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man's coat so dark that it might be mistaken for brown - A. I think so; it was a dark pepper-and-salt colour. I should think the man would not come up to the prisoner's ear in height. The prisoner is a much darker man than him, and he was very much pock-marked - the prisoner is a little so; he is quite a different man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for one to be taken for the other - A. It would be a great mistake, for he was quite a different man, he was stout and the prisoner is slim, and he was high-shouldered. I only know the prisoner by seeing him pass our street with his bag of clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200059"/>SOLOMON JOSEPH. I am a clothes-man, and live in Winfield-street. I know the prisoner very well. I met him in Holborn this day four weeks, by Middle-row. It was on Friday the 1st of February I walked with him from there into Bishopsgate church-yard, talking about business, and when our sabbath came on. We got to the church at one o'clock, and I left him. I looked at Bishopsgate church clock, it was not five minutes under or over one. Flower and Dean-street is half a mile from the church.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How does he get his living - A. He carries clothes about, and had his bag at this time. He lives with his father in Wentworth-street. I left him at the church.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to to give evidence - A. My lodger came home about three or four o'clock, and said this man was fully committed for trial - I was surprised.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you want to be home by any particular time - A. No; I always come home between one and two o'clock - our sabbath begins at half-past three in winter, and then it moves to four, and that day it moved to half-past four. I always look at the clock to see how long I am out.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What was your reason for looking at the clock - A. I always want to know how long I am out. I had something to do in our church that day - he said sabbath began at four o'clock, and I said it was half-past. I do not know yet what he was taken up for. I would not believe my lodger, and so I asked his father what it was for; he said he did not know; and I said he walked with me from Holborn, and left me at one o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your lodger tell you what time the offence was committed, or what it was for - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to say he was with you at one o'clock - A. That was the time I left him.</p>

             I bought this pamphlet at Carlile's shop, in Fleet-street, on the 29th of December, 1821, of the prisoner - I wrote on it before I parted with it, and find that writing on it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoner when you bought it - A. Nothing at all. There were several placards of different description in the shop, one was about two shopmen being arrested from the shop, without their names being known, it was in the window, passengers could see it; there was a crowd collected round the window all day long. The words,</p>
               <p>"Temple of Reason" were written in large gilt letters at the back of the shop, and there was a bill in the window, about</p>
               <p>"the infamous sentence passed on Miss M. A. Carlile."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. By whom were you employed to purchase the pamphlet - A. By one Purton; I have received 1 l. for my attendance at different times, but not for buying this book. I did not describe myself as a yeoman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the shop in the morning, I said I had not got a book then, and did you not say,</p>
               <p>"I hope you not going to be so stupied as to give over selling them" - A. I never said any thing of the sort - he did say he had not one. I lived in New Cutt, Lambeth, and have been a broker. I have now a little property, which with economy supports me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first went, he had not got the book - A. No; he told me to call in the evening, and I should have it, I did so and got it.</p>

            . I am in the office of Mr. Murray, solicitor, John-street, Bedford-row. On the 28th of December, I saw Carlile's shop, and particularly noticed a bill in the window, written in a large hand,</p>
               <p>"Two shop-men arrested this afternoon, by the Bridge-street wretches without knowing their names - worse than the Inquisition, and one of the blessings of the late six acts - plenty of volunteers tocombat the vile crew, and the same obnoxious pamphlets may be had in spite of them. - It is a right noble cause, they shall not with all their combined attacks shut up the Temple of Reason. - Oh! thou base gang you will do our cause, no harm but good - this is the mart for sedition and blasphemy."</p>
               <p>"That part of the publication charged as libellous, was here read, it was characterized by the most revolting blasphemy, and certain expressions were contained in it, of the most seditious nature, reflecting in very insulting and degrading terms, on His Majesty and every other branch of the Constitution, and finally attempting to excite the people to acts of rebellion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read an exceeding long defence; and read the whole of the pamphlet, from which the libellous matter was extracted - declared the whole to be his own sentiments, and attempted to justify every part.</p>

I missed my coat from my hammock, at eight o'clock, and asked him what had become of it, or who had taken it. He said he did not know, and that two people had laid in the hammock; I said nobody but him had been there, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say I stole it," I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I do not say so, because I did not see you do it." I found it in pawn, returned, and told him he had pawned it, he gave me the duplicate, and I redeemed it - I never gave him leave to pawn it.</p>

            . On the 10th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in London-fields, Hackney, and had a ridicule in my hand, containing this property, I was coming towards town, and near <placeName id="t18220220-128-crimeloc694">Exmouth-place</placeName>

               <p>"Stop thief! and was a good deal frightened. I did not see him laid hold of; but a young man who was before me, ran after him. I did not see whether he laid hold him - the prisoner was brought back in a quarter of an hour - my ridicule was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was done so quick, you had no opportunity of seeing the person. - A. No; there were four or five examinations, I believe, before the magistrate. I did not understand that it was on account of insufficient evidence.</p>

            . I am assistant at Mr. Ayres' school, at Hackney. I was in the London-fields, and passed the prosecutrix, about fifty yards towards town; she had a ridicule in her hand, and was going towards town. I heard her call out, Stop thief! and saw a person run from her towards Exmouth-place; he was alone. I pursued and lost sight of him for about two minutes. I saw him come out of a private house, but had not seen him go in. I am sure the person who came out of the house was the same who I had seen running away. I went up and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man." Another person laid hold of him. I picked the ridicule up at his feet, and delivered it to Miss Gozard, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance was he when you first saw him running. - A. About fifty or sixty yards. I had passed both the prisoner and prosecutrix before I particularly remarked him as I passed, and have not a doubt about him. I am sure he is the person who ran from the lady.</p>

I was at work in Exmouth-place, at an unfinished house, about one hundred yards from the footpath, and heard the cry of Stop thief! The prisoner had got by the house - he was running alone, and the only person I could see. I pursued him, and at the bottom of Exmouth-place, I lost sight of him for a minute or two. Mr. Hayward pointed him out to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man." I found him within twenty or thirty yards of where I lost sight of him. I believe nobody was in sight but the prisoner and Hayward. I saw the ridicule on the step where he stood - Hayward picked it up. I think it impossible for any body to drop it but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was he to it. - A. On the same step, about eighteen inches - it was on the step of a house enclosed with iron rails, and a fore court. I think no one could throw it there but him.</p>

His master and Mr. Alder told him he had better tell all he knew about it; and in consequence of what he said I went and took Johnson in charge, put her in a coach with the prisoner, and took her to Bow-street - she was detained there till eight o'clock at night. I saw Alder fit the lead to the building - the nail-holes corresponded, but it was in small quantities.</p>

               <p>"He is gone." I looked at the window, missed the scarf, went out, but found nobody. I had not seen the prisoner in the shop, but I saw his brother; they live in Barrett's court. On Tuesday, the prisoner came to pawn a coat - I said he had stolen the scarf - he denied it - I said I could take him to a person who had seen him do it - he seemed willing to go. As I took him to Hughes, who said he was the person, I said I would take him to the watch-house - he said if I would not, he would take me to where it was. He took me to Gee's-court, and said he took it about half-past ten o'clock, and hid it under a water-but, and shewed us the place, but it was gone.</p>

On the 24th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the dustmen were taking out the dust; they gave an alarm that two men had come in at the front door; I went towards the door, saw nobody, and in returning, the prisoner, with another person, opened the parlour door, and came out - I asked what business they had there; they asked if Mr. Johnson lived there. I looked in at the door, and missed the tea pot and two spoons off the breakfast table, and immediately pursued the prisoner, and brought him back; the other had turned the corner of Little Argyle-street. I have not found the property; he said he knew nothing of it - they were safe a quarter of an hour before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of January, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoners talking together, in Cato-street; and about nine o'clock, I saw them in John-street, returning in a direction from Pearse's house. Salmon saw me and made off. I went up and took Anderson, and asked what he had under his arm, he said, tea, and was taking it to a friend of his. I took him into a public-house, and found it was starch; he said he would give me no further trouble, and that he had taken it from a grocer's shop at the corner of Chapel-street. He at first said Salmon was not with to him, and then that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200066"/>he was. I saw Salmon next morning in Cato-street, he saw me, and ran into his father's house, I secured him.</p>

About five or six weeks ago, he brought a bundle into my shop, and asked me to buy a coat, breeches, and two waistcoats, I refused; and in a day or two, he brought a shirt, and offered a man in my shop some liquor to pawn it; he returned and told him they would not take it in - he took it out, returned, in a few minutes, and said he had sold it, and it was his own.</p>

On the 9th of February, in the evening, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the back parlour, and secured him as he was carrying this window sash towards the door - it had been fixed to the window. He said he was carrying it into the next house. I asked which - he said he would shew me - then dropped it and ran off. I overtook him in Beck-street.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of February, the prisoner came and offered a smoothing plane in pawn; I stopped him, and asked how he came by it; he said he bought it with some more, in Chick-lane, three months ago. He wished to be let go. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday morning, the 3rd of February, I was at the Palace at the time of the relief. I saw Sooley with a child in his arm, and two by his side. Barnett was close to his left side, and the two prisoners were a little in the rear. Sooley was holding the child up. I watched Barnett, and I suppose he saw me; for he drew back. I then went behind the crowd, so as not to be perceived. I came in sight again, and saw Barnett draw back again, and come on a level with the other two. I then went quite out of sight, and heard an alarm given of a robbery, and immediately missed the prisoners. I went outside the Palace, and met Leary running after them. We ran in different directions, and in three or four minutes came into the Park, and at the gate of Cambridge-house, saw the three prisoners. Leary said, he was sure they were the persons - we ran towards them, and on getting near them, one shot a few yards a-head, and Barnett immediately ran away. I called out,</p>
               <p>"It is no use to go, Barnett, for I shall have you." He still continued running - I pursued, calling Stop thief! and told the witness to stop the others. A gentleman caught at Barnett - they reeled over in the road together. I came up and secured them. He put his hand to his coat pocket - a person caught hold of his pocket, and held it till we got to the watch-house. I found two shillings in his coat, and four in his waistcoat. Johnson made considerable resistance when I was going to handcuff him. I lost the prosecutor, but he came to the office next morning.</p>

            . I was at the Palace. Johnson and Jones stood before the prosecutor, and were looking in his face; they observed me looking at them. I turned my head, and on looking round again, I saw Barnett's hands in Sooley's pockets. He went out of the yard, and the other two followed him. I went to Sooley, told him to examine his pockets, and told him to follow Jones and Johnson out, and perhaps he would get his money. He went out, returned in a few minutes, and asked me to go and shew them to him. I went to the stable-gate, and saw the three prisoners opposite the bridge in the Park. I am sure of their persons. When I got within twenty yards of them, Barnett saw me, and ran off. I followed and he was stopped.</p>

On the 27th of January, I went into another room, which I seldom use - found it was unlocked - I missed the articles stated in the indictment. I asked her if she knew any thing of them; she said she had taken the bed into her room to air, and that she had pawned the pillow, bolster, and the coat - her husband lived with her - he knew nothing of it. I found the bed in her room.</p>

            . I am patrol. On Thursday, the 15th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, I was going down the road, toward Stratford, and met the prisoner within twenty yards of the Globe, public house; he passed and looked back - he had a bundle. I turned back and asked what he had got - he said, pork, which he had bought at Stratford, for 3 s. 6 d." I was sure he could not buy it for that - I untied his apron and found the pork; next morning I found the owner - it is pickled.</p>

I went over and missed some harness - I secured the door for the rest of the day - and about half-past eight o'clock at night it was broken open again, and the roller taken. The prisoner, who had worked seven months for me, did not come till the Monday morning. I told him what had happened, and asked him to sit up on Monday night to watch the place, which he did, and told me next morning he was going to leave his employ, and work at home. He went away - Brown gave me information.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of January, at ten minutes before six o'clock, I was on duty, walking about, between the theatre and Bedford-street - I saw some people at the corner of a court. Directly I got up the prisoner ran across the road, to the corner of Adam-street, and had got this bundle up against the post, he was surrounded by six or eight people - I went away; I stood behind a coach, and saw the prisoner go away with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200074"/>two more, with a bundle on his shoulder, the other two were walking on the curb close behind him.

            . I am a constable, of Bow-street. I have seen the defendant serving in Carlisle's shop, No. 55, Fleet-street. I bought this pamphlet of him on the 21st of December, (Looking at it.) I saw him next day, selling behind the counter, and asked his name; he said it was a question he had no right to answer, and would not. I afterwards applied for a warrant, and got one, and went to see it executed about a week after. I had been several times to look for him in the mean time, but could never see him there till nine days after. I then went with a City officer, who apprehended him, he was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HILL. Q. What led you to know Carlile's shop - A. On account of a former conviction on the same week. A gentleman named Sharp applied to me to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he is Honorary Assistant Secretary to the Constitutional Association - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do this for the public good, you do not expect to be paid for it - A. I expect to be paid for my loss of time, I expect him to pay me.</p>

On the 8th of February, I came in and found my husband at home - I went to make the bed, the prisoner came in, and stood talking with us about five minutes - I put on the sheet, looked round for the blanket, and missed these things and her. I had pulled them off the bed just before; I did not see her take any thing - I and my husband were both in the room. My husband is not here; I went over to her, and said she had got my bed clothes; she denied it. I looked about the room, and in the cupboard I found the bed-tick and the apron in the chair she sat in - she was sitting on it. I have not found the blanket. I said I would fetch a constable - she threw the things in the kennel after me.</p>

I was on duty in Mile-end-road, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, of the 11th of February, and seeing the prisoner come up the road, I asked his business - he gave no satisfactory answer; I thought he answered the description of a man suspected of several robberies; and took him. As I took him to Bow-street, Pearce came and said he had broken open her box, and stolen the clothes - I found a tool on him, which corresponded with the marks on the box.

Donovan was close to her - she fixed on another pattern, and told me to cut one off, and she would pay 6 d. on it, and call next morning for it. While I was cutting it off, I saw he draw the two from under the piece off the counter, and put them on the floor; she then said to Donovan,</p>

               <p>"Look at my boot, and see how it is wearing out;" Donovan immediately stooped down. I knocked at the parlour door, and Chapman came out.</p>

I passed between the men and the women, and felt a finger at my waistcoat pocket. I immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I'll not be robbed, keep your hands off;" a young man rushed before me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you say I robbed you?" I said, I'll have nothing to say to you." I was going on, and at the corner of Black Eagle-street, somebody behind pushed against me, and shoved me up the street, and one of them violently thrust his hands into my waistcoat pocket, and took out my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200077"/>watch. I cried Stop thief! he was followed to the end of the street, and somebody said,</p>
               <p>"We have got your watch." I found the prisoner in custody, and gave him in charge at the watch-house. I cannot say whether he was one of the men, my sight is very bad.</p>

            . I was coming along Brick-lane, between five and six o'clock, and opposite the end of Black Eagle-street, I saw the prosecutor surrounded by three fellows, and from the position they were in, I thought they were robbing him - I was running to the spot, and had got as far as the middle of the road, when all three ran off - the prisoner up the lane, another in the opposite direction, and the third down Black Eagle-street, where he fell down, and I overtook him. He got up and was running off again, I struck him on the head with my umbrella, he then turned from the middle of the street, towards the pavement, when several persons seized him. I saw his hand in a position, as if he had thrown something in the kennel, I picked the watch out, and with several others, took him to the watch-house - it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry and joined in the pursuit for twenty yards, and saw a lad drop something - they collared me and said I was the person who dropped it.</p>

I got up and asked him the time; he said half-past four; but I heard the watchman go half-past five. He said he got up to call a friend, he got a light, and lit my candle; and while he was gone down stairs I looked into my box and missed my trowsers, and my silk handkerchief, which hung on a nail. I found my hat put on the top of his bed, with Oyler's handkerchief and waistcoat. He came up again - I saw him take them and go down with them. We went and took him on the stairs with them in his hand. He said, if we would let him go he would give me my trowsers, and that they were under the cellar stairs. I found them there with Cockey's things.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 1st of February, I was standing at my door, at Battle-bridge, and saw the prisoner go by with others - I followed them along Pentonville, through different streets, across the fields - I called on Jordan, who followed with me, as far as <placeName id="t18220220-202-crimeloc1090">Theobald's-road</placeName>

I saw something pass from one of the others to the prisoner, who put it under his apron - he ran off as hard as he could, and I caught him in Bloomsbury-square. I sent Jordan after the gentleman. I took the prisoner, and asked him where the handkerchief was; he said, he had no handkerchief. I took him into a public-house, and found the handkerchief in his breeches. One of the three was a little boy.</p>

            . Colton called on me to follow three suspicious characters into Little Gray's Inn-lane, where one of them pulled a gentleman's handkerchief half out - they then went on. I saw them attempt several gentlemen's pockets - the show went from Gray's Inn-lane to the King's-road. Colton sent me after the gentleman; he promised to come to the office, but never did. I did not see him take the handkerchief - one of them was quite a child - they saw me, and called out my name, to alarm the others. I am sure the prisoner was one of them; he was covering the boy while he did it.</p>

            . I am a constable, on the Bow-street establishment. On the 26th of December, I bought this pamphlet at Carlisle's shop, in Fleet-street, of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to learn his name - A. I tried to watch him from the shop; I went in and identified him when the warrant was issued - he is the person it was issued against. When I bought the pamphlet he was behind the counter, apparently serving, and behind the counter selling the same work when he was taken; there was a great many people about the shop then, and on the 27th, when I went with Harrison to take him, I did not learn his name till I got to the Justice-room. The book has my name on it, which I wrote on it a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you messenger to the Constitutional Association. - A. I was employed by a gentleman named Sharp, who I have heard is connected with the association - I am not regularly employed by him; I have been employed to go no where but to Carlile's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been concerned on any other business for Sharp, besides at Carlisle's shop - I have employed persons myself, on account of their determination to sell those books, and myself being known.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose determination - A. Why the people of the shop. I have seen placards in the shop to that effect</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the placard. - A. That the address to the Reformers of the 24th of June was still to be had.</p>

            . I was housekeeper at Mr. Carlile's. When this man was arrested, on the 27th of December, I lived there; I had just come down to prepare dinner for the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What two men - A. The man unknown, and the prisoner - I saw some one open the counter, and assume an authority, which I thought he had no business to do. I opened the door directly, and asked what he wanted; it was near one o'clock - he looked very contemptuously and made no reply. I asked him again what he came for, and he was talking to Purton, the spy.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a spy - A. An informer; persons who go and buy these pamphlets to entrap them; they buy them and pretend that they understand them to be sedititious, and I heard Purton say to the officer,</p>
               <p>"That is not the man."</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he speak of - A. I suspect by the conversation that passed between them, that the man they wanted was gone away, and that the prisoner was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether he wanted that man or not - A. I did say something, but what it was, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to him,</p>
               <p>"This is not the man who you are going to take away" - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so - A. I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious what you say, you did not say</p>
               <p>"Do you mean the prisoner is not the man" - A. No, I did not. I heard the officer say to (Rhodes) the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I have got a warrant for you." Purton was in the shop, I directly said,</p>
               <p>"If there is a warrant against you, hear it read, and see that it is in your own name" - his name is

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That we may not differ about persons, is that the man, (pointing to him) who you call Purton the spy - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is that man the officer with whom you had the conversation - A. I cannot say whether that is the person who arrested Rhodes, or the man unknown, he arrested one of them; there were two men arrested that day, within an hour, and I asked both officers to let them stay and dine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the men, or Purton only - A. Oh! of course, I should not ask Purton to dinner, I only asked the officer to let the prisoner dine, the man unknown was arrested afterwards by another officer. I am married, I have lived at Carlile's since

             went away, since November, till the shop was closed - I was housekeeper, I am not related to Carlile.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the misfortune to be indicted for selling these pamphlets - A. If you call it a misfortune, Sir, I have, I would rather enjoy my own opinion, of course, and be indicted for it - there are two indictments against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Either of them for publishing Pain's works - No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it for selling pamphlets, at Carlile's shop - A. Yes; I was shopwoman there for three months, that was in the spring - I left just before November. When the indictment was found against me, I was removed from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away, and returned as housekeeper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of enjoying your own opinion, have you any belief in the Holy Scriptures - A. I shall not answer that, I do not think it a question I have a right to answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. The question is whether you believe the Holy Gospels, on which you have been sworn - A. When I am brought to trial, perhaps I may give my opinion.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who hired the prisoner and other man to serve in the shop - A. I did not; the prisoner had served there a very few days, I think not a week; the other man had only been there during the time the prisoner went, and the officer came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Well but how many days had he been backward and forward - A. That I cannot tell; I have seen placards in the shop - when there is any thing to sell people generally put up placards. I never saw one saying</p>
               <p>"This is the mart for blasphemy and sedition;" for I very rarely pressed myself in among the crowd, to see them - I swear I never saw it in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see it then - A. I saw it in my own hands, though whoever copied that placard out of the window did not copy the inverted comma's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the words blasphemy and sedition were not there - A. I mean to say, I cannot say any thing about it; it was given me with many others that were given me for waste paper. The placard I speak of was copied in the newspapers, and I said</p>
               <p>"That placard had better be taken down."</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to state again, what took place at the time Purton and the officer came into the shop, telling you I mean to contradict you if you speak untrue, and that you will hear of it in a different shape - now I ask you again, were you in the shop when Purton came in - A. I tell you I was in the little room, and saw the officer open the counter; Purton was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the officer say or do to Holmes - A. I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell me again - A. No I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. I say you must - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you do not answer questions that are material, the Court will commit you for contempt. If you come forward as a witness, you must answer all fair questions.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the officer say or do to the prisoner when he came behind the counter - A. I told you that when he came behind the counter, I opened the door of the little room, and asked what he wanted, he turned round and made no answer, but said something to Purton, and, by their motions, I thought that they had got the wrong man, and that they wanted another man, who was gone away; then I asked him a second time, and he said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200082"/>the man</p>
               <p>"I have got a warrant for you." I told him to hear it read, and see that it was in his own name; then I asked him to let him stay and dine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Purton say or do any thing all this time - A. Something passed which I did not understand, for I retired into the little room.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I heard you say, Purton said that was not the man - A. Yes; that I did, and they also asked if there was any other woman there besides me; the man unknown was also in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he behind the counter at the time - A. Not at the moment, but he was coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man before or after Purton said,</p>
               <p>"That is not the man" - A. I think it was before; I cannot say whether he was present. or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath, was not that man, whom you call</p>
               <p>"unknown," called by some Christian or Sirname - A. I do not answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. You can answer Yes, or No. - A. Then I must answer Yes; I called him by the name he went by, and the prisoner called him by that name also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise that person not to give a name. - A. I never advise any thing.</p>

            . I am a Marshalsman of the City. I went with Purton, on the 27th, to apprehend the prisoner, at Carlile's shop; there was no name in the warrant. Purton was to go into the shop, and if he stopped I was to go in directly; I did - he was buying a book of the prisoner, and pointed to him. I took him; he gave a nod, and I lifted up a flap to stop him going into the room; I told him I had a warrant against him. Purton did not say</p>
               <p>"That is not the man." I had two warrants; the lady asked me to let him stop and dine. I said the Magistrate was sitting, and if he was gone he would be locked up till next day - she asked me a good many times to let him stop to dinner, and called the man down whose name is unknown, and then he put his hat on, and came away with me. When that man came down, Purton said</p>
               <p>"That is not the man."</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. Did not Purton swear he bought the pamphlet of me the day before, that is the 26th - A. I do not know; I signed my name on the book he bought on the 27th - my name is not on the one produced.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In consequence of there being no name in your warrant, Purton went to shew you who the man was - A. Yes; he would not give his name at the first examination.</p>
               <p>JURY to PURTON. When did you buy the pamphlet produced in Court - A. On the 26th, here is my memorandum on it</p>
               <p>"Bought on 26th of December, of a short stout man, at the shop of R. Carlile." I wrote this within a quarter of an hour; before it was out of my possession; I have not written on the one bought on the 27th - there was no man in the shop like him, and I have seen him in the shop before.</p>

            . On Saturday night, the 17th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock, my business caused me to be in Clare-market. I was coming home, and was going into a public-house in <placeName id="t18220220-206-crimeloc1108">Drury-lane</placeName>

I seized him and called to the watch, Callahan came to his assistance, and got him from me. I then seized Callahan, he pulled me across the road, and as I was calling Watch! he called to Caps for assistance, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't go away," Caps, then came and joined him. I was contending with them both, they got off, and my wife and myself called out Watch! the constable came up and rushed among the crowd, and took me into a shop - I was bleeding, I said I should know the man again, and went to look for them in Queen-street, and on coming into Drury-lane, Jones pointed over the way; I saw Caps run over, I said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man who robbed me." Callahan was taken the same night in Drury-lane, about one o'clock - I am certain they are the men.</p>

            . On Saturday night, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Drury lane, and saw the prosecutor holding Callahan, who was striking him; Caps was standing by, they came into the middle of the street, when Caps seized the prosecutor and turned him on one side - the prosecutor kept calling for the watchman all the time. They got on the pavement, and the prosecutor seized Caps again, but they escaped, and went down Stewards rents; I followed them, but not knowing the man was robbed, I turned back. After hearing he was robbed, I went after them, and in Wild-street I saw Caps; he saw me, and went into Little Wild-street, then took to his heels and ran off - I followed him across Queen-street, into Drury-lane, and then turned back; the prosecutor and constable then came up - I pointed him out, and the prosecutor said</p>
               <p>"That is one of the men who robbed me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A tailor. I did not know the prosecutor, he had cried Watch! but not Stop thief! when the watchman came up, he said,</p>

               <p>"It is odd you should fight with the man so long, and not say you was robbed." Caps ran away as soon as he came.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. About twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, I was going to bed, but heard a violent cry of</p>
               <p>"Watch! Watch! I will not let him go;" considering that there was a watchman near, I did not go out immediately; but as the cry continued, I went and found the prosecutor covered with blood - I took him into a baker's shop, he said he had lost his watch. The people were complaining that no watchman was to be found, there ought to have been three near the spot. As soon as I got up, there was a rush down Stewarts-rents; I ran round into Wild-street, and Drury-lane, and just at the corner, the prosecutor ran across, and stopped Caps, who was going towards Broad-court, he said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man," I immediately collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, it is you." The prosecutor said he should know the other man, and Bartlett said he had seen a man with Caps, who he knew; a person fetched us to the corner of Clare-court, where Bartlett took Callahan; he said to Bartlett,</p>
               <p>"I'll go with you, you have been a friend to me, if I had taken your advice, I should not have been in this."</p>

I was coming down Drury-lane, and by the burial ground, I saw the prosecutor and Callahan wrestling, he got away; Caps came between them, and forced them, apart and both ran down the court - I went with the constable after them round Wild-street; he went over the way and collared Caps.

            . I am an officer. On Monday evening, the 10th of February, I was coming by a chapel in Barbican, a great many people were coming out, I saw the prisoners following a lady and gentleman. I can speak positively to Phillips - they followed them to <placeName id="t18220220-209-crimeloc1124">Bunhill-row</placeName>

I said, if he would return, I thought he could recover it - we ran up Bunhill-row; but they got into Blue Anchor-court, and we lost them. The gentleman said his name was Burrell. I knew Burrell of White Cross-street, and thought that it might be him, but found it was not. Half an hour afterwards, we found the three prisoners, with two others, in a coffee-shop in White Cross-street, and took all five to the watch-house. I could not find the gentleman. I am sure they took a handkerchief from the gentleman. I saw Phillips take it.</p>

               <p>Q. Just turn to where he speaks of the delivery of the parcel - A. He was asked whether he had a parcel to carry to Russell's warehouse - he said he had three to carry out that day, the 1st of December, 1820; that he received the parcel in question from Mr. West, Sir J. Perring's clerk - that he went to the Swan-with-two-Necks, and delivered the two others, and then went to Russell's office, with the third, the one in question, and got there not much after seven o'clock in the evening - that the first person he saw there was a working man, who loads the waggon, he desired to be served first - laid down the parcel, and came away - and was certain that the parcel he received from West was the same he delivered. He was asked, on cross examination,</p>
               <p>"Do you know a person named Nightingale - A. Yes, my Lord. Q. Is he a man with one arm - A. Yes. Q. And very red whiskers - A. Yes." He could not exactly say how long he had known him, not to be intimate with him - he first saw him about three years ago. He is then asked. Q.</p>

            . I am clerk at Russell and Co.'s waggon office, No. 12, Friday-street, and have been so nearly six years. It is my business to receive parcels and book them. On the 1st of December I recollect the defendant coming to the office with a parcel, and knew him before. He came about eight o'clock in the evening - we have no dial in the office, but I say it was near eight o'clock, because we were to have a supper that night at eight o'clock. He had a person with him, whom I afterwards saw at Guildhall - it was Nightingale; he had but one arm, and very red whiskers. I am quite sure he was with him. Painter produced a parcel to me, and paid 1 l. 2 s. 8 d. insurance on it. I locked it up immediately in an iron safe at the top of the warehouse, in the counting-house. I keep the key - there were four or five other valuable parcels there, worth 1400 l. or 1500 l. together. This parcel was insured for 450 l. I put it in the waggon, on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock. I had kept the key all the time, and took it out of the safe about four o'clock, and locked it with the other valuable parcels in a strong box in the waggon, and saw the goods loaded over it - there was 95 cwt. put over it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Painter brought it, did any thing pass between you - A. Yes; two persons came into the office nearly at the same time as him, to enquire about a parcel from Bridport; I referred to the weigh-bill and found no such parcel. Painter blamed me for not attending to him first, and asked if I meant to keep him all night; he did not ask for any thing to drink, though he generally did on other occasions, and he used not to appear in a hurry - the waggon left our office, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, the 3d of December - Willis was the waggoner, and Bury the guard; it arrives at Plymouth in about ten days, there was nothing to be delivered till he got to Blandford, where he would arrive on Wednesday the 6th. I never heard any complaint of the loss of the other valuable parcels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The parcel was brought about eight o'clock in the evening - A. Yes; on Friday; I did not say, at Guildhall, that it was about seven o'clock; it was between half-past seven and eight - I did not say the key hung on a nail, that was the key of the strong box of the waggon. I did not know either of the two persons who called about the parcel; I never saw them afterwards - there were two people at the door, named Hodder and Maize, and who were examined at Guildhall.</p>

I consider it to be about six o'clock when I got there, and my motive for thinking so is, I usually take tea at five, which would last about half an hour, and I think it would take half an hour to go there; it is a chandler's shop - Nightingale was in the shop. I staid there about an hour, and left a little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you went in till you quitted the house had Nightingale been out - A. I did not observe him out, and think if he had gone out his wife must have gone into the shop. I think it quite impossible that he could have gone to Friday-street.</p>

Nightingale, my son, was at home. I had let my apartments the day before, and had been robbed, and went to consult him, whether I should leave the house or continue in it. I do not know what month it was, but I was robbed the day before, which was Thursday. I went there about four o'clock, and staid till the shop was shut up, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out of the house all that time. - A. Only in the shop, and at the door, and he went to the public-house to fetch the supper beer.</p>
