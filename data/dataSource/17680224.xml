            . About two o'clock on the 26th of January, going into King's-head-court out of Fetter-lane, the prisoner at the bar with two others hustled me, and stole my handkerchief; I had my child in my hand; I went to lay hold of the prisoner, he ran away and threw this pot from him; I called, stop thief, and in a few moments I got hold of him myself; he never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did the prisoner use your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw him in my house to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Going along Little Moorfields I found this pot lying under a wall in the dirt; I took it up and washed it; I could neither write nor read, so I took it to a person that told me who it belonged to, and I was going to carry it home.</p>

               <p>Smither. He gave but 6 d. a pound.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240006"/>Prosecutor. The duty is six-pence halfpenny a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Smither. He knew us all very well; Haines, Braine, and I, were all camen; he knew we stole it, and was up on purpose to receive it, at about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Smither will swear any thing, he is one of the Saltpetre-bank evidences; I never saw him in my life before to my knowledge; I had two servants, were they here they could clear up my innocency, but by some means or other they are got out of the way; they promised faithfully to come, but they are not.</p>

            . I happened to be at Mr. Hunt's that morning, I saw two porters bring those hides through the house into the skittle-ground; when Mr. Hunt got up there came the prisoner, who said the hides were his property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Liscoe. I am a wharfinger at Hays's wharf, in Shad Thames; we had delivered a lighter, and missed ten hides, I do not particularly remember the day, it was about a fortnight or three weeks ago; they were marked A, B, and C on the left horn, that is according to the quality of the hides.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side the water is Hays's wharf?</p>
               <p>Liscoe. That and Horsleydown are both in Southwark; I do not know where the vessel lay when the hides were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the hides been in the lighter?</p>
               <p>Liscoe. I think they had been in her a day and a night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they come from?</p>
               <p>Liscoe. They came from Cork in Ireland; the vessel that brought them lay in the stream in the middle of the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the hides ever on the Middlesex side the water?</p>
               <p>Liscoe. When the hides were put into the lighter, the lighter was carried over to this side the water, being Sunday; I can swear to the hides by the marks, all by the same branding-irons; they were all raw hides, salted and tied up.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch and money when you met with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I had at that time felt them in my pocket; I did not perceive her hand within side my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I was not very much in liquor; I cannot say but this affair brought me more to myself than before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I never saw her before that night to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found your watch again?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Mitchell. No, I did not, she was not first with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was along with a woman; he wanted me to go along with him; I said, excuse me, I am going home; he said he would make me a present of 5 s. 3 d. he put his hand in his pocket, and wanted to make me a present of 3 d. to buy half a quartern of brandy; I said I could put my hand in my pocket and find 3 d. at any time, I would not take it; I was going away; he said, my dear, stop, and let me talk to you; he wanted me to go and drink a glass of wine with him; he said he had no money about him, but he would make me a present of a 5 s. 3 d. I said, if you want to see me another night, you may; the watchman came past, and said, what are you doing; the gentleman said, I am only talking to this lady; the other woman stood by all the while; he said he would treat the watchman with something; we stood talking a quarter of an hour; the watchman came again, and said, you are a long while talking, and desired we would go along about our business; I said, we were about no harm; he said, if you do not go along I will make you; then I set out, and stopped at the corner, and the gentleman came to me, and said he had lost seven guineas; then he said he had lost three or four guineas; he took me to the watch-house, and they stripped me to my smock, and found nothing upon me.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. What say you to this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is all real invention, there is not a tittle of it true; she told the magistrate a different story; I neither offered her a 5 s. 3 d. not 3 d. I did not mean to stay with either of them, it was really a piece of simple curiosity in me.</p>

On the 15th of January the prisoner came into the room of the house where I lodge, about two or three in the afternoon; I thought he came to pay me for work I had done for him; he sat down in a chair by my bed-side, where my watch hung; he staid till between five and six; he said he had three halfpence, and desired me to be two-pence for a pot of beer; after that he wanted a dram of gin; then I went to go down, he said I need not, for he would take it at the bar; after that I said, I must go up and lock my door; he said he would; he went up and took my watch, and locked the door and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took your watch?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Because he owned it; I went directly up stairs after he was gone, and missed it; I went to Justice Girdler and got a warrant; after that I heard he was in New Prison; he was taken before the bench of Justices, there he owned it; he said he had pawned it at the end of Featherstone-buildings for a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I always owned to it, and told them where it was pawned for a guinea and a half.</p>

             and John Taylor, two watchmen, deposed to that of her confession in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>These people, my prosecutors, keep a disorderly house in East-Smithfield; she drawed me away from my mother, a green grocer; she lives now in New Rag-fair; what money I got from men, this woman made me give to her; when I threatened to go from her she said she would lay me rotting in a goal; I never had a husband in my life, I was backwards and forwards at her house three quarters of a year; she and her husband get their living by unfortunate girls, and when they are for going away from them they threaten to put them in goal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pain. What is the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Pain. He is a baker, he rents a house of my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he carry on baking?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they get their living?</p>
               <p>Pain. I never heard any cabal in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they keep a reputable house?</p>
               <p>Pain. I never hear no noise, they always pay me honestly, and I have no business no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. to C. Taffe. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. I have known her about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she lodged a week in your house, did she lodge with you no longer?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. I once lett a room to her and a young fellow, but that was not in the house we live in; I know nothing of any one that belongs to her; when I first knew her, she lived in a yard where my house was, in Hog-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she has a husband, what was he?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. He was a picture frame maker.</p>

            . The watchmen told me they had taken a man, last Saturday was se'nnight, in ripping and cutting of lead belonging to Mr. Isgrave, a tenant of mine; I attended the examination before Mr. Girdler, it was the prisoner at the bar; he was charged upon oath of two watchmen; he there confessed he did rip the lead and threw it down, but denied that he had any intention to take it away; the Justice asked him if he intended to do it in play; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own that any body was concerned with him?</p>
               <p>Stevens. He said there was no body concerned but himself.</p>
               <p>- Bagget. I am a watchman; about half an hour after four, last Saturday morning was se'nnight, I happened to be coming by the back-side of the soap-house, I heard something fail; I stopped, and my brother watchman came; I told him I suspected there was somebody robbing the place; we both got over into the place, there we saw a brass candlestick with a light in it on the ground, that was soon blowed out; there was a ladder against a beam on the inside the soap-house; we stood there about ten minutes, then came down a piece of lead, after that a hatchet; the prisoner came down the ladder, we started from behind the door, and took him; he lived in the neighbourhood; there were 160 pounds weight of the lead; we took the prisoner to the watch-house, and after that he was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weatherall. I went up the ladder about a quarter after five that morning, and found about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240024"/> ten feet of lead belonging to a gutter was cut away, and the other end of the gutter had twice the quantity cut off; that seemed to have been done before, by the appearance of the wood work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was lying there, I heard a noise in the soap-house, I went up the ladder to see who was doing the mischief; I did not cut the lead.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the shop was the bacon taken from?</p>
               <p>English. It was taken from the window; it was pretty near 200 yards from my shop door where I took the prisoner with it.</p>

               <p>Coming through Wapping, as I was going to see my aunt, I heard stop thief cried; three fellows ran by and dropped this bacon in the kennel; I made a full stop, and this man came and charged me with stealing his property; I made no resistance, but was very willing to go where he chose to carry me.</p>

            , at Mrs. Martin's, she is house-keeper there, opposite the door to the House of Lords in New Palace-yard. Going along the Green Park, I saw a person about twenty yards from the Mall within the gate; he crossed over to me; he collared me, and said, d - n you for a rogue, give me your watch and money, or I'll knock you down if you stir another step; he took me back to the gate, and took the key out of my pocket, and let me into the Green Park; I went about an hundred yards farther; there he stopped me and rifled my pockets of all I had; he took 7 s. in silver, my pocket handkerchief, the key of the Green Park, my gloves, and my tooth-pick case, and four tickets with my Lady's name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, he had not, only my stick which he took from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nobody at this time?</p>
               <p>Baker. I saw two people at a distance, which frightened me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out?</p>
               <p>Baker. I had not presence of mind, my fright was so great; he said, if you don't bring me two guineas to this place in the Green Park to-morrow morning, I'll knock you down from behind the carriage the next time I see you; I told him I would; then he let me out at the gate, and I went into Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Baker. This was about seven o'clock; I left my Lady at half an hour after six; we were not above 20 minutes in the Park together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go willingly back to the Green Park?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I did not; after he had robbed me he took me towards the pond, and after that he went and let me out towards Piccadilly; the next day he came to my master's door about three o'clock, and knocked, the porter opened it; he asked for his fellow servant; the porter said which servant; the porter shut the door upon him and came for me; when the porter opened the door I saw him and said, d - n you for a rogue, you are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240025"/> the rogue that robbed me last night; he ran up the square as hard as he could run; I did not pursue him, I don't know how he was taken; there were several of my fellow servants after him before me; we could not all leave the house; he was taken in about half an hour, and they sent to me, I went, it was at a house in Oxford Road; the constable asked me if there was ever a person there that robbed me; the prisoner was put into a corner of the room, I found him; I believe there were an hundred people in the room; the prisoner I am sure is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention your being robbed when you got home?</p>
               <p>Baker. I told all my fellow servants of it, and two chairmen, when I came home, I was very much surprized; I told the porter of it at my first going into the house; I went with the prisoner before a Justice of the peace, he would not confess any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say I robbed you near Spring-garden gate?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did; he robbed me in the Queen's Park.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you ever said I robbed you in St. James's Park opposite the Mall?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What discourse had we when walking up the Mall?</p>
               <p>Baker. That discourse was what I have told your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you let me through into the Green Park or not?</p>
               <p>Baker. The prisoner took the key out of my pocket and let himself through.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. As it was at such a seasonable hour, why did you not make an outcry, as there was a centinel so near to have me taken?</p>
               <p>Baker. As for that I had not the presence of mind; he had hold of my collar all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the Mall was you when the prisoner first came to you?</p>
               <p>Baker. I was almost opposite St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call to the centinel?</p>
               <p>Baker. I had not the centinel in my head at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In going back to the Green Park, did you not go by a centinel-box?</p>
               <p>Baker. Yes, I did, but he had hold of me, and had my stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did you go to a centinel-box?</p>
               <p>Baker. Within seven or eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you see people passing and repassing at eight or ten yards distance?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe whereabouts in the Mall he first attacked you?</p>
               <p>Baker. It was about the middle of the Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say you should like such an agreeable man as me for your fellow-servant?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not ask me to go and spend the evening with you, and drink two or three pots of beer, as you had little business to do?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not let me through into Piccadilly?</p>
               <p>Baker. I never did; he let me through, but which way he went I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. The reason why you did not call out to people when in Piccadilly?</p>
               <p>Baker. I did not see any body there, I had not presence of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come out into Piccadilly?</p>
               <p>Baker. He did; I ran away as fast as ever I could when I saw he was gone, I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not shake hands with me in Piccadilly and part?</p>
               <p>Baker. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether he did not give me the key of the Green Park to let myself out, and to let myself into the Green Park to meet him.</p>
               <p>Baker. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to meet the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Baker. I told him I would bring him the two guineas into the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you to have brought it?</p>
               <p>Baker. I was to bring it in the morning, the hour he did not mention.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What is the reason you did not come the next morning according to your promise?</p>
               <p>Baker. I did not think it worth my while to meet such a rogue, I hoped never to see him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you did not wish to see him tried for it?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, my Lord, I never wished to be frightened so again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The next day morning he was not there; I looked at one of the tickets and took it from the ground; I waited impatient till twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240026"/> o'clock; he not coming, I went to the house; I saw him putting his buckles in his shoe; he saw me, and pointed with his-hand, implying he would follow me.</p>
               <p>Baker. I was not buckling my shoe, I never saw him till the porter opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. from pris. When I was before Major

I am chairman to Lady Duncomb; I was with her on the 12th of January; she went to South Audley-street near May fair, to Mr. Duncomb's mother; the prosecutor was with me that night; he left us at near half an hour after six; he said, gentlemen, I wish you good bye, her Ladyship has been so good to let me have an hour this evening to myself, and went away; I saw him again about twenty minutes before eight; he was in a great terror, I never saw a man so frightened in my life, he was so confused he could hardly speak; I asked him what was the matter, he with an oath said, I have been robbed to night; he said he was going down the Green Park, after he let himself in, and when in St. James's Park, he was accosted by this man; that he dropped a great oath and said, if he did not deliver his money and watch he would knock him down; he said the man collared him in the Green Park, and rifled his pockets three different times; I asked him how much he had lost; he said he believed eight or nine, or seven or eight shillings, his pocket handkerchief, a pair of gloves, a tooth pick case, a key, and 2 or 3 of my Lady's tickets; he said the man took the key of Lord Bath's gate out of his pocket, and let himself out. The prisoner came the next day about 3 o'clock, I was then in the servants hall; the porter was in the porter's hall, he let the prisoner in; I was not near enough to hear what passed; the porter called, come up, come up, here is the man that robbed James last night; I ran up the area steps, and pursued immediately down Audley-street, till he got into a house, a chandler's shop, in Oxford Road, he got the heels of me; we went into the house, and up and down two or three times: they would not admit my fellow servant; I said I was very certain the man we were after was in that house; they told me I should not without a proper officer or a warrant; I went for a warrant, and at my return they had got the prisoner; we took him up into a room and searched him; there were a watch, three handkerchiefs, three or four shillings, a pair of gloves, and the key of Lord Bath's gate; we took him before Major

               <p>Winefred Townsend. I was a lodger in the same house, I have known the prisoner ten or eleven years; I had no suspicion of her being with child till the 7th of this instant; she came up to me in my room that Sunday morning, between ten and eleven, and staid with me all the afternoon, she made no complaint; on the Monday Mrs. Adams came and told me there was something in the vault; I went down with her, and there I saw the after-burden, I took it out; the prisoner was then in my room; I went up to her, and told her what I had found; she said, what do you mean; I bid her come down and see; she did not; I went down, and looked in the vault for the child, I could not see any; I went up again, then the prisoner was gone to Doctors Commons; I and Mrs. Adams went there to her; I asked her to go home with us, she did; then we went into Mrs. Adams's room, we found nothing there; then we asked her about the child; she bid me go up stairs, and she would follow me; she went to her box, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240029"/> took the child out; it was clean, it seemed to have come to its full growth, there were no marks of violence upon it; I asked her if it was born alive or dead; she said it was born dead; she did not tell me where she was delivered.</p>

            . I am a black-milliner, and live in Foster-lane, Mrs. Dixon brought the six pair of stockings to me, and told me they were the property of a gentlewoman that had kept an hosier's shop; that she had married an extravagant man, a clerk to a merchant; she asked me if I could dispose of any of them; I told her I would try; I did dispose of eleven pair; she brought some to me at three different times, the first was the 29th of December, four pair of women's silk hose; after that she brought seven pair more, I disposed of them; the next was the 11th of January, there were these six pair; she said the gentlewoman was very ill, going to lie in, and could not come herself; I went to Mr. Bruin's on the 15th (the rest as Mr. Bruin had deposed.)</p>

On the 24th of January the watchman alarmed me at four o'clock, and told me my house was broke open; I came down and found the shutters of the kitchen-window down, and two panes of glass taken clean out, and a mahogany tea-chest taken away; that was brought to me about six o'clock broke to pieces; Walker's sister told me he had been out all night, and very likely he knowing the house might come and do it; she took me down to the market where he was; I told him I would forgive him, if he would let me know if he did it; he would not confess; I brought him to the fitting Alderman in Guildhall, there he was cleared; after that, the man where he works at, a paper-stainer's, came and told me there was Ross that worked with Walker was likely to be concerned; I went to him, and told him I would forgive him if he would tell; then he told me that Walker and he did it; we found the tea-spoons by his directions; he went with us to the pawnbroker; he said there were three of them concerned, and that the other boy pawned the spoons; I really believe this is the first offence that Walker has committed.</p>

On the Sunday morning, a little before nine, my man was drawing the bread, I heard the prisoner come down stairs, I knew her by her foot; I desired my man to get on the cellar-stairs, and look through the crack; after some time he called to me, run up, run up, you may catch her at it; I went to go up, and was so terrified I could not; she met me on the stairs, and asked me for some water; after she had some, and was gone up, my brother said, why did you not lay hold of her, I heard her lock the till again; she came down again soon, and asked me for change for a shilling; I gave her 6 d. in silver, and the rest in halfpence, most of them sandy ones; when she was gone up again, I called my brother; then I went and unlocked the till, and told the money; there was 2 s. and one penny gone in halfpence, twenty-two pence of it in halfpence marked; then I thought I might get myself in trouble if I took her up, and she had none about her; on the Monday morning she came down, and said, Mr. Hornby, are your rolls baked; I said, go down stairs, I shall draw directly; she said she could not stay, she would send down for some; in a few minutes she sent her little boy down, I served him with three, he gave me the money; I said to the girl that was standing by me, do you look at this money before I put it in my pocket; there were two of the three halfpence marked; I got a constable, and we got a warrant and took her up; she turned out her pocket, and said, can you swear to halfpence; I said I could to them that were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240037"/> marked; there were five of them marked (the marked halfpence produced in court;) we used to keep two keys to this till, I one and my wife another; my wife's key has been lost six months.</p>

            . I live in Fenchurch-street. Coming along Leadenhall-street, I saw Carroll pick Mr. Redman's pocket of his handkerchief, and gave it to Wall, there were three of them; I went quick after Mr. Redman, and told him; he turned, and came after me; I stopped them all three, and searched them, there was nothing found.</p>

            ; the two prisoners went for mistress and maid; I lodged in a two pair of stairs room, they lodged in the same house; there was (I think) 27 l. 17 s. 6 d. locked up in my box; the last money I had out of it was a half-crown piece, five weeks ago last Monday, it was safe then; I missed it the Thursday after, between five and six in the evening; the prisoners went out of town that day, about one in the day; they said they were going into the country, and said they would be back the Monday following; they did not come back till the Tuesday, when I missed my money, I found it locked as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guineas were there of the money?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. I cannot justly say, I know it was in gold and silver; I had been working for it fourteen years a servant in the country, thinking to get me some good clothes here, to go into a good service in town; I know there were guineas, half guineas, a crown-piece, and a half crown. I suspected Revell the maid. Two or three days before she had no money, she borrowed 6 d. of me, and was obliged to borrow some halfpence of another lodger in the next room, to buy some coals; but when they returned, they flash'd away; they had got new things, they got gowns out of pawn, and they had got a watch; we got a constable, and took them up; they were searched, they had no money; they were carried to goal that night, the maid denied it; the mistress said she believed the maid had the money out of my box; the next day they were taken before my Lord Mayor, there the maid confessed she had taken the money out of my box; that she owed several debts, and had paid them all, and had bought her mistress that gown she had on; she said, when she brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240043"/> money down she gave it to her mistress, and her mistress parted it between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her mistress hear all this?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. She was by, and heard it all.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the mistress say to it?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. She denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came to do it?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. I had just bought a new hat, and she said she desired me to let her mistress look at it; I went up and unlocked my box, and took the hat and carried it down to her mistress to see it, to have such a one; (this was all true;) the maid went down with me; she said she went up again, and took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the box after you took it out?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. I cannot say whether I did or not; I brought it up again after the mistress had looked at it, and put it in the box, and locked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the mistress own she gave the maid orders to fetch it.</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. No, she denied that, or that she had any hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your money again?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. No, I never got a farthing again.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any lock to your room-door?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. No, there is none that will lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your money, in any thing, or loose?</p>
               <p>D. Foulkes. It was sewed up in a piece of new leather, and put into a linen purse, and sewed in, and that was put down in a nook of the box.</p>

            . Mrs. Robinson came with the other prisoner, and called her her maid, and took a lodging of me, she went for a captain's window; they lodged with me between two and three months; they nor only robbed my niece, but they robbed their lodging; the maid had borrowed money on the Monday, and on the Tuesday in the afternoon, after they came home, we saw them in good new clothes they never appeared in before while in my house; the maid had a linen gown, and the mistress a linen one and a bed-gown; I had just before been dunning the mistress for money she owed me at this time; they were in my debt 3 l. or thereabouts; I had seen my kinswoman's money, there were guineas and half guineas, and some silver, but a little silver; it was in a bit of new leather, sewed up in a bit of an old sheet; she had cut a little hole in it, just to take out what she wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did they go away?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. They went out on the Thursday in the forenoon, they went out of the shop as if they had been frightened; Mrs. Robinson hold down her head as she went out, and seemed confused; she had stepped back, and told my servant she should be back on the Monday following; after that my niece went up for money to buy her a gown, and came down and said she missed all her money; then we went to Justice Fielding, and put them in an advertisement; on the Tuesday about ten o'clock they came home, they were going up into their room; I asked them where the money was that they had robbed my niece of; Revell the maid was very impudent, they both denied it at first; they said they had been in the country to see the maid's father, and they imagined we had been robbed while they were gone, and then we wanted to lay it upon them; we asked them where they had the money from, which they bought the watch and things with, and to fetch their things from Mr. Flude's, a pawnbroker; Revell said it was nothing to me where she had the money; we sent for a constable; the maid was very saucy, and said she would not go to the Compter without a coach; she bid the constable shew his authority; he shewed it, and took her to the Compter; after she was gone, I talked very closely to the mistress; then she told me she believed the maid had the money out of my niece's box; I asked her, if she had not gone halves in it; she said she had had some of the money, but did not say how much; after that my husband came home, and took her to the other Compter; the next day they were both taken before my Lord Mayor, but before they went there, I went to the mistress, and told her, I hoped she would say the truth; she said she would; she believed her maid had the money out of the box, and that she should say before my Lord Mayor; then I went to the servant, and said, your mistress says you had the money out of the box; she said, how can my mistress be so base to confess that I took the money, when at the same time she got some keys for me to fit the lock, and that my mistress contrived another way to get the money; that we contrived that mistress was to want to see Dolly's hat, that we might make one like it; I was to ask Dolly for it; that I should go up stairs with her to talk to her, that she should forget to lock her box; that I came down with Dolly to my mistress, and my mistress kept her in discourse, while I went up and took the money; and then as soon as I came down, mistress and I went out, and parted the money; I asked her if she counted it; she said no; then they were called in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240044"/> before my Lord Mayor; there I heard her repeat the same, and the mistress acknowledge the gown she had on was bought with some of the money, and also a gown and petticoat the maid had on was bought with part of the money, and that she herself had part of the money: I understood the maid had been up stairs with my niece several times, and had looked in her box, when my niece took things out.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this conversation?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. This was in the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not she deny knowing any thing of the robbery?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. No, she did not; but said she never saw the box, and never was near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not advise the mistress to make her escape?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. No, I never did; she offered several times to give ten guineas to make it up, but I would not agree to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go after her friends about it?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. No, I did not, but they came to me several times.</p>

            . I am husband to the last witness; my niece going to fetch some money down on the Thursday, in a trifle of time after the prisoners were gone, the maid left word with my servant they were gone into the country till the Monday following; upon the money being missing we suspected them; by enquiring, found they had changed gold in several places; when they came in on the Tuesday evening about ten o'clock, we took them up and sent for a constable, and gave him charge of them, they having robbed their ready furnished lodgings of a table-spoon, a sheet, and other things, and upon suspicion of having robbed my niece of her money; the constable and I went with the servant to Wood-street Compter; there the servant told me if I would forgive her, she would tell me the whole truth, and went on her knees, but I would not admit of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make her?</p>
               <p>Cherry. My answer was, it was not in my power, if the law will forgive you I am content, I shall go no farther than that; when we came back, the mistress would fain have staid in the house all night; we being told that she said she believed the maid had the money out of my niece's box, and that she had share of it; we took her to the Compter; when we came to the Mansion-house the next day, I heard the conversation between the maid and my wife; my wife has told it as it really was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the maid and mistress together at that time?</p>
               <p>Cherry. They were in the same room, but I believe they could not hear one another; the maid said the mistress had furnished her with keys, and teazed her, and would not let her rest till she had done it; they had change of raiment which I never saw before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cherry. I am a ticket-porter, I live at No 7 in Philip-lane, near London-wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any promises made to either of them?</p>
               <p>Cherry. No, there were none at all as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Cherry. What say you to that question?</p>
               <p>M. Cherry. I told them both if they would let us know the truth, I would forgive them as far as in my power.</p>

            . I lodge in the next room to that which the young woman lodged that lost her money; I was in my room, and heard the maid ask for the hat, and saw the young woman give it her out of her box, and saw them both go down with it, and while the young woman was trying the hat upon the mistress's head, I heard somebody come up stairs and go into the room where the young woman's box was, but I did not go to see who it was; I have several times before thought I heard the young woman, I mean the prisoner in her room; I have opened my door, and seen Revell there looking over things upon the table by her box. One night the maid was in my room and pulled out a great bunch of keys (as my key was missing) and unlocked my box with one; she said there were keys there that would unlock any lock in England; she came up to me, I think it was the day before they went into the country, and asked me to lend her a groat; after that she came up and paid me the groat, I saw more money in her hand; she then said she was going into the country; she said her mistress had 50 l. a year salary, and was going to receive it; they were very deplorable before that, she had hardly any thing to cover her; and so was the mistress in as bad a condition, she had hardly a hat or shoes to her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240045"/> feet, a day or two before they went into the country, and when they came again they flashed away with all new things; the maid had a ring on her finger, new silver buckles, and I saw a ribbon fixed to the bed's-head to hang the watch to; I opened the door for them when they came, and I received the bundle of clothes from them, and I went and got change for a 5 s. 3 d. piece for them to pay the coachman; Mrs. Cherry came down stairs and said they must not go up, for they had robbed her; the maid was very saucy; the mistress said Sophia had received 30 l. of her father to go down into the country, as she said the maid had told her; I heard them both confess they had the money; the maid and the young woman that has been robbed lay together, and she said she pulled the bed from the wall that the maid's pocket might fall down, that they might get the key; she said her mistress would never let her be at peace till she got the money; that she said, you know I want money, and money I will have, you must get the money, I want things; the maid said, she did not care to do it, and the mistress answered, there is no more sin in it than to eat her own breakfast.</p>

               <p>Anne Green. I live in Denmark-court, I have known the prisoner about five years, he brought this piece of cloth for me to make him some shirts, on the 16th of February; he told me he bought it in Smithfield for 12 s. I asked him how he came to get such a bargain; he said he met a man in the middle of Smithfield, who proffered it to him for 15 s. he said to the man he did not want such cloth; the man followed him, and said, he would let him have it a bargain, and upon looking at it he told him he would give him half a guinea; then the other said he should have it for 12 s. so he bought it; he asked me what I thought it was worth; I told him I thought 2 s. a yard, and I thought the man came dishonestly by it; he said the man pressed it upon him; he desired me to measure it; I had no yard in the house, I had a yard of ribbon, and when I came to measure it with that I found It to be 24 yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hall. Do you know whether the prisoner had seen the cloth in your house?</p>

            . I am a constable; the prosecutor applied to me on the 19th of February, about eight in the morning; he said he had been in a room a little below me, he had been and got the prisoner's name; he said she was called Black Bird, or something like it, and said she had robbed him of about 20 l. I went with him where I thought she used, but we did not find her that day; on the Tuesday evening I went to the White Hart in the Strand, she was there, she had other cloathing on; I searched her, and found a guinea and a half, and a moidore; I took her to the Round-house, and from thence to Justice Welch; there she said a taylor had given her the money, and that she was to be married to him the next Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. At the time you lay down was there any body else in the room?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, there was one woman in the room before I lay down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, the prisoner and I drank together, but I did not drink with the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor did you drink there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. We had two quarterns of aniseed, two pots of twopenny, and six pennyworth of ham and beef.</p>

               <p>Hendrey to the question. When my wife has been ill, the prisoner has come and washed the pots, and done business in the parlour; I never missed any thing by her.</p>

I am daughter to Mr. Law; the prisoner came into our shop with two other men, one of them we hear is called Leicester; the prisoner said they wanted to see some red handkerchiefs; I took down a piece, and shewed it them; Leicester pulled out a piece of sheeting from a bundle a little way, and then went to the door: the other man said good bye, and they nodded their heads to him; I asked the prisoner if they would do that I shewed him; they answered, no, it must be finer; I went to shew them a finer, then the other pulled the piece of sheeting out farther; I said, gentlemen, will not these do; the prisoner said, pointing to the other, I think that a prettier pattern; then I went to reach down another parcel, then Leicester took the piece of sheeting quite out, and was got half way out at the door; there was a customer in the shop laid hold of it; I came as fast as I could round the counter, and called, thief, thief, then Leicester made off; he left the piece half way out of the shop upon the ground; the prisoner was still in the shop; he was secured, and asked what account he could give of himself; he said he lived in divers places, but would give no particular account; my mother sent for a neighbour; as the door was opening, the prisoner made an attempt to get out, but he was prevented; at last he sent for what he called his mother-in law; she said she was his mother-in-law, but we found she was not; he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I was in the shop, when the prisoner and two other men came in all together, the prisoner wanted a red handkerchief; Miss shewed him some; he did not like them; then she shewed him some others, they would not do; he wanted better; when she was going to take some down, Leicester took a piece quite from the counter; he was going out at the door, but I laid hold of it and prevented him.</p>

               <p>I was at work at my father's; I came down after work, and went to buy a handkerchief; I came to the corner of Catherine-wheel alley, Whitechapel, I went in; the gentlewoman shewed me some; she asked 22 d. a piece; I asked if she had no finer; Miss Law said there was a man at the door, the evidence said that was her husband; I said, please to cut me off one at 2 s. 4 d. and I'll go directly; a stranger to me endeavoured to take a piece of linen; they said, it is gone; I turned round to take hold of the lappet of his coat, and after that they detained me, for making an attempt to rob the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he use the word they or he?</p>

            , a customer that usually used the house, he was none of their company; Asgood told him, he was a deceitful man, and upon the whole he said he should like to put him on the fire and broil him; upon that Mr. Newton said, gentlemen, you behave very badly. I do not chuse to have this sort of behaviour in my house; if you behave in this insolent manner, I must certainly call for an officer; he sent his servant-maid out for one; she returned, and said he was not a home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the five people hear him bid her go for an officer?</p>
               <p>Crowther. They must hear him bid her go for a constable; in the mean time Asgood got up, and struck Mr. Newton twice on the ribs; Mrs. Newton seeing that, said to me, for God's sake do stop them; I then got up; then Asgood came to me and said, are you the man that is to stop us, and struck me on my right eye, and gave me a very bad eye; they left me, and went out of the house; Mr. Newton was then out of the house, calling the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Newton say any thing at going out?</p>
               <p>Crowther. He said, are we to be beat and murdered in our own house, and then went out; I went out of the house about 30 yards, and heard him, almost up at the watch-house, calling the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Crowther. They were ran down the alley by the house side, called the Paved-alley, it goes down to Fleet-ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were in the house when you was struck?</p>
               <p>Crowther. To the best of my knowledge there were three, if not four of them, gone out of the house when I was struck; Stoaks went to the bar, and said, do not make disputes about the reckoning, I will pay the reckoning; he then came back again from the bar, and struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after Asgood struck you?</p>
               <p>Crowther. This was immediately after Asgood struck me, then Newton was out of the house; Stoaks quitted the house immediately after he struck me; I went to the door, and heard them run down the alley; I went about 30 or 40 yards towards Mr. Newton, I met the two watchmen coming about 40 yards from the house, I told them they are gone down the alley; they immediately went after them, and I followed them to the top of the stairs at the bottom of the alley; the watchmen were both gone down, the barge-men were secreted under the corner of the house; I did not go down as the watchmen went down, they immediately flew out upon them, there was no light, but I could see something of them, but could not distinguish one from the other; I could not distinguish hardly any thing, only I heard a great noise at the bottom of the steps; I can only say I saw the shadow of some men, and heard the scuffle; I thought I had the glimpse of some men, I thought there were something like blows passing, and it seemed as if there were a great many men all scuffling one among another; I then returned back again to Mr. Newton's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stay on the steps?</p>
               <p>Crowther. I suppose I might stay a minute, or rather more, I did not go down the steps; the deceased and Bartene came into the house between eleven and twelve; the deceased said, see here Mr. Newton, we have been cruelly used, and sadly beat, and I hope you will see us righted; Mr. Newton said, I will do all in my power to see you righted; Mr. Newton ordered them a pint of beer; the deceased pulled up his wig, and the blood stood in his right ear; they drank up the beer, and returned out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else said by the deceased?</p>
               <p>Crowther. Ridley said the man had taken his staff from him, and beat him with it, that was almost as soon as he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Duncomb?</p>
               <p>Crowther. He went with me to the head of the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not go farther?</p>
               <p>Crowther. By reason I had been ill used enough already, and they were very powerful men, and I thought myself in danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body use Duncomb ill in the house?</p>

               <p>Catlin. I cannot tell that, it might be to make water; the watch was sent for, they came down the court after them in about two minutes or less; I came back to them, Asgood drawed the staff out of the watchman's hand, and made a blow at him.</p>

               <p>Catlin. There was a lanthorn, but the candle was gone out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased Ridley?</p>
               <p>Thompson. No, I saw nothing of him, nor heard nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any staff when you came first there?</p>
               <p>Thompson. No, I did not; the other men stood over me while Asgood went for that; they stood two on one side and two on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was Asgood gone for the staff?</p>
               <p>Thompson. This was just at the turning at the bottom of the steps; he was gone about a minute.</p>

            . The deceased was my husband; he was led home that night by one of the watchmen; I asked him the meaning of his coming home so soon, he had a bit of a candle in his hand; he said he had been beat in a most cruel manner by five villainous fellows; I asked him where his staff and lanthorn was; he said he believed his staff had been his death; he held the candle and lifted up his wig, and shewed me his right ear running down with blood, and his right nostril; I persuaded him to come to bed and compose himself; he said he believed he was so bad he could not come to bed; with great persuasion I did with my help get him into bed; after he was laid about four or five minutes he cried out, Hannah, my head, my poor head! I begged of him to compose himself and go to sleep, saying he would be better then; in about eight or nine minutes he called upon the Lord to look down upon his poor children, and said, O Lord, was I but sit to die! and I never heard him speak a word after, nor saw him open his eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>H. Ridley. He died on the Saturday morning, about half an hour after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any thing else that he said?</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 10th of last month, about half an hour after eleven o'clock at night, I was called to go to Mr. Newton's; Mr. Ridley went to the house, and I followed him to the door; the people were gone out of the house, we were told they were gone down the Paved-alley; Ridley went down after them, I went with him to the bottom of the first steps, there are two flights of steps, I stood upon the top of the second flight going down.</p>
               <p>Q. How many steps may there be in the lower flight?</p>
               <p>Bartene. I believe there may be about a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go no lower?</p>
               <p>Bartene. No, I did not; Ridley went down with his lanthorn and staff in his hand, there is a lamp at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you as you stood see what was done at the bottom?</p>
               <p>Bartene. I could see nobody, but I heard he was knocked down; I heard him knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him that was knocked down?</p>
               <p>Bartene. Because I missed him some time, and then he came to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay upon the steps?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240054"/>Bartene. I staid on the steps about a quarter of an hour; we had lost him a good while, and I went up to the watch house to see if I could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go down?</p>
               <p>Bartene. I was afraid to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the Court what you heard when you was upon the steps, did you hear any scuffle?</p>
               <p>Bartene. No, I heard no scuffle.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor nothing said?</p>
               <p>Bartene. No, nor no words.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern who was at the bottom?</p>
               <p>Bartene. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of what passed?</p>
               <p>Bartene. I heard the tongues of people at the bottom all the time I stood on the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Ridley next?</p>
               <p>Bartene. That was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear him say at the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Bartene. He said he had been very ill used by two or three men, knocked down, and his lanthorn beat to pieces; then I went with him to Mr. Newton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Bartene. I had no lanthorn, I had only a staff; I could notice Ridley when he was at the bottom, for he was all in darkness in a minute; I believe he was knocked down as soon as he got to the bottom of the steps; he brought his lanthorn up to the watch-house, it was knocked all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how many blows he had bad?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he repair it?</p>
               <p>Haguerone. I do not know whether he did or not, the ship made no water before, and after that he began to make the hole she did not make water; there was one Champion on board. I told him what had passed; we both agreed to watch the captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was a cargo on board?</p>
               <p>Haguerone. The captain always told me there was. On that morning there was no complaint of the ship making water, till after the captain told me he had begun to make the hole; we were obliged to go to the pump; the ship made less water in the night; I imagine he had in part stopped the hole, least she should sink in the night; we were obliged to leave the vessel at about half an hour after eleven in the forenoon on the Thursday, in order to go on board an English vessel within about a cable length; when we apprehended danger, the captain was laid down on his bed, but not asleep; I went and told him he had begun his work; he said he had done nothing; he was one of the first that went out of the ship to go on board the English vessel, Champion was the last man that staid on board our ship; the ship disappeared in about three hours and a half after, whether she sunk or drove out of our sight I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ship you was on board at anchor or under sail?</p>
               <p>Haguerone. She lay at anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. What water was in your ship when you all left her?</p>
               <p>Haguerone. The water was up to our middles in the bread-room, I believe the hole must have been made in the bread-room, and I believe he made it while we were under sail; we suppose it was made in the night, for we watched him in the day.</p>
