I know the prisoner; I saw him in my shop; he came first to look at some gold blank seals, which was the 18th of May; he said he would either have his arms, or a crest engraved on one, he did not know which; I pulled out the drawer, and he looked some of the seals over, and one thing or another; he came three or four times, till Friday, the 21st, at four o'clock; then he looked at one thing or another; and he agreed for a gold blank seal, and a pair of gold sleeve buttons, and a shirt pin; and he put them together, and said he had forgot to bring his money out with him; and he would go and fetch the money; and leave a shilling earnest, and be back in a few minutes: I went to put my drawer up again; and looking it over, I missed a diamond hoop ring, a fancy ring, rubies and diamonds, a paste ring, with a single stone in it, a fancy ring, with emeralds and diamonds, and a gold seal.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the worth of these things all together? - About fourteen pounds. One of my servants knew the young man; and he lodged at her father's house; I sent the girl to see if he was there, or to let me know when he came in; she brought me word he had not been at home for two nights; I went myself to her father's, and desired to know immediately when he came home; on Saturday last, I heard he was come home; and I went immediately to the house, and found the prisoner in the back parlour; I seized him immediately by his collar, and dragged him out at the door; nobody else had been in the shop, or handled the things, but him; I intended to carry him to Bow-street; but at the end of King-street, by Covent-garden, he stopt and said, if I give you your rings back, will you make it up? I do not know, said I; but says I, have you got the rings about you? he said, yes; if you will step over the way, I will shew them you; so we stopped at the orange shop against Lowe's hotel; and he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket; says he, there is your ring; (produced; a common ring); that was my property; says I, you scoundrel, that will not do; you have three rings more; then he ran away, and I after him; and overtook him by the church; well, says he, if you will stop, I will tell you where I sold your hoop diamond ring? says I, is it far? he said, no; and he brought me to Butcher-row; we stopped there; and he said to the man, I sold you a ring yesterday; I must have it back: the man, Mr. Lake, very readily delivered up the ring, which is this, a diamond hoop ring, cost me eight guineas at first hand; he had sold it for a guinea and an half; says I, where are my other two rings, and the gold seal? he told me, if I would go with him into Fleet-street, to a pawnbroker's, where he had pawned them, or sold them; I do not know which: the pawnbroker informed me he had sold them and the seal too, to one

            , in the Old Bailey: and the prisoner told me, if I would let him send for some friends, he would satisfy me, and make the matter up? I told him I would not run such a risk for five hundred guineas; it was out of my power; so I brought him to Bow-street, before Mr. Justice Bond, and gave him into custody. The prisoner comes of very reputable parents: his father is a very worthy man: he is head butler to the Archdeacon of London; the things are my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You understand the prisoner to be acting under the impression of a promise? - I said, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>This was not all taken at once? - No; it was taken from the 18th to the 21st.</p>
               <p>You did not see any article taken? - I did not; they were there two minutes before. And I beg this honourable Court, on account of the prisoner's father, that is now in tears for an only son, to shew him all the mercy in their power.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Thursday last, the prisoner brought two rings to me, and a gold seal: I live in Fleet-street; I am a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260004"/>Court. You know, of course, the value of jewels? - I do, as well as most in the trade, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner bring them to sell, or to pawn? - To sell.</p>
               <p>Did you buy them of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you give him for them? - For the two rings, one pound ten; I have proof it is a fair price, by the person that they were sold to afterwards; they were two old fashioned rings; the one in the form of two hearts; the other was intermixed with coloured stones, in the form of a basket of flowers.</p>
               <p>Were there any diamonds? - A few in each.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at those rings? - They were since sold to one Sanders, in the Old Bailey, who told me he would be here; indeed he broke them; I purchased a gold seal, which is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much did you squeeze yourself, to give for the seal? - I did not squeeze at all; I gave a fair price.</p>
               <p>How much did you give? - Sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Was it old, or new? - It was old.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I mean to swear I bought it as a second hand one.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear it was old? - I mean to swear I bought it as a second hand one; I wish to tell the reason? I bought it from his watch; therefore I had reason to think it was old.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a year old? - I really cannot tell; there was no date upon it; it was a modern make.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you venture to swear it had the appearance of having hung to a watch a single day? - Certainly I will.</p>
               <p>Was the polish rubbed off; yes or no? - No.</p>
               <p>Now what is become of it? - It is sold for twenty shillings to a stranger, on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you bought a blank seal with the polish not rubbed off, and of a modern make, as an old second hand seal? - I did not say old.</p>
               <p>Yes, you did. Did you buy it as a second hand seal? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you take him to be a person of the trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any question? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Who did he represent himself to be? - I knew him very well; he lived next door but one to me.</p>
               <p>In what situation? - As a shopman to an oilman.</p>
               <p>Did you expect that lad should have a new modern gold seal? - I knew he had left that occupation; I could not tell what occupation he had.</p>
               <p>So this discarded shopman to an oil-man, you think was likely to have a modern gold seal: will you swear that? - Swear! certainly.</p>
               <p>Such a discarded shopman to an oil-man, could not fail to have diamond rings of his own? - Well, Sir; he said they were sold for another person, by commission; for Mrs. Aldridge, of York-street, near the Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Have you your books here? - I can send for them.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mrs. Aldridge? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry about her? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the lad you would receive as many more things of that sort as he would bring? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you not, Sir? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask him if Mrs. Aldridge had any more? - I sold them in the course of about two hours, or less.</p>
               <p>Have you such quick returns constantly? - Things that are old, are only fit for breaking.</p>
               <p>Will you state that these were old, and only fit for breaking? - The rings I speak of; the one, I believe, was made nineteen years ago; they were old.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear they were in a state fit only for breaking? - They were, on account of the old fashion of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260005"/>How long have you dealt with Mr. Sanders? - For these six years, or more.</p>
               <p>By what name? - By what name! he is known by the name of Sanders; no other name.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - He is not; he lives over the way, directly opposite; his Christian name is John.</p>
               <p>Did he come to you, to know if you had such an article? - He called; he does not call every day, but most likely, seven or eight times a week.</p>
               <p>Did you send for him, to tell him you had something fit for the melting pot? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had those things the appearance of being old, or worn, or put upon a finger, except to be tried? - I do not know that they had; if I had put them in the window, they might have laid there twenty years.</p>
               <p>Does Mr. Sanders buy a good deal of plate? - No, Sir, very trifling.</p>
               <p>To how much account? - I do not know; I have no book of the transactions.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you had disposed of all these to Sanders, before you heard that Mr. Tewlings had lost them? - The two rings I will, upon my oath: I had nothing in my possession when Mr. Tewlings applied: the seal was sold on Friday to a gentleman, who by accident came in for a blank seal; we had others, but none of that size; I had it the day before.</p>
               <p>Had you put that in the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much do you think the gold of these rings was worth? - The gold of the rings was very trifling; two very small hoops.</p>
               <p>How much is the gold of this seal worth? - Twelve shillings: the stone was a cornelian.</p>
               <p>What, is that worth but four shillings? - I do not know the value of a cornelian in particular.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, what was that old cornelian worth? - I think it might be worth five or six shillings, and no more.</p>
               <p>How long have you carried on this roaring trade? - It is an upright trade.</p>
               <p>It will very likely put you in an upright situation very soon; boys would not be here, if it was not for such men? - I am sorry you are misinformed.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What was the value of these things? - I gave three guineas and a half for the ruby ring; it was like two hearts; one was sine brilliants, and the other a fine ruby; the seal cost me about a guinea and a half, or thereabouts; and as for the other basket ring, that was a present to my wife, and cost four guineas.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner first called on me, on the 19th of May, to shew me a seal to buy; I advised him, on looking at it, to sell the seal where he brought it; and he told me he bought it of Mr. Warboys, of Ludgate-hill; he went away, and returned, and said he had sold it to Mr. Warboys, for twenty shillings; then he called on me on the 20th, on Thursday, and shewed me a large single stone ring, with a gold mount; and asked if it would suit me to buy it? I told him it would not suit me; he had at the same time, a fancy ring on his finger, of a double heart, set with diamonds and rubies; he left me, and told me he had served his time in the city, and was well known by people about; then I did not see him, I believe, till Friday, the 21st; then he called on me, and asked me if I had ever a large lady's ear-rings and necklace; and shewed me a ring he had to sell; that was the hoop ring; I asked him whose property it was? he told me it belonged to a lady that had been in great life, and had a vast number of these things to dispose of; he gave me the name of John Brown, at Mr. Aldridge's, No. 4, York-street, Middlesex Hospital; I bought the last ring of him; the hoop ring; I gave him a guinea and a half for it, which he informed me was the price the lady had set upon.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the value of it? - I hardly can ascertain the value of it, without it was taken to pieces; I had it but a little time in my possession; the worth of these kind of things is no more than the materials.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260006"/>Then you can form a little guess by the quantity of stones; you know they were diamonds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you could form some little guess whether they were not worth about a guinea and a half? - I take it, it was worth two guineas; I believe the trade well knows, if they were to see the size of the ring: I am not a compleat judge, to say exactly; I have a better ring than that, which I could dispose of for little more; but buying and selling is a great difference; I gave it up directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been a buyer and seller? - About ten years.</p>
               <p>You have but a slight knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>You run the risk of buying and selling? - Yes; I have lost by that.</p>
               <p>How came it that you did not see the lady? - It was my intention to wait on the lady on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Look at that boy; he had a fancy ring on his finger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the things appear to be old things; such as a lady had worn for many years? - They might have been made for years.</p>
               <p>Had not they the manifest appearance of coming fresh from a jeweller's shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And to your best judgment, two guineas was the utmost value? - It is impossible to swear.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear they were not worth more than two guineas? - They were not worth more to me.</p>
               <p>What means did you take to ascertain that? - By the one I have of my own.</p>
               <p>So you keep one by you, by the way of a pattern, to swear by? - No, Sir; I did not compare them, but by my ideas.</p>
               <p>Did you believe this story from a boy not sixteen, an apprentice to an oil-man, that a lady should send him all the way from York-street, past some hundreds of shops, to Butcher-row? - It was near his neighbourhood, where he served his time.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire whether his story was true? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of April, I took the prisoner into custody in the Park; coming along I asked her where her mistress's property was, that she had robbed her of? she would not tell me then, till I had got a little farther.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make her any promise? - Not in the least. I took her to a public-house in Litchfield-street, and took her into a room, and was beginning to search<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260009"/>her; she immediately put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out four or five duplicates, and gave them to me; I asked her then, how she got the things out, after she was discharged from her mistress? she then told me, she took the key of the street-door with her when she was discharge, and took her box away, and went and left her box at a friend's house; and some time after, went back to her master's the same night, and let herself in, and went up stairs, and took her mistres's clothes; and opened the back door, and carried them out on the leads. I asked her, if there was any one concerned with her? she said, she threw them down into a back private yard that led into another street, left the back door open, and came out the same way she went in; and went then and took the clothes from the place where she threw them over, and carried them, and put them into her box, which he had left at her friend's.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar coming up out of the kitchen, on Saturday, the 22d of May, about half past two or three o'clock; I thought his pocket looked big, and I followed him out of doors: they were goods which Mess. Robbins were employed to sell for some creditors; I saw them in his pocket, and desired him to walk back, which he did very readily; and he had two candlesticks in his pockets, and one candlestick in each thigh of his breeches behind; he had a pair of snuffers and stand; the flat iron we could not swear to: the prisoner hardly spoke a word; but before the justice, there was found in his pocket a piece of paper, giving an account of the sales that were that day; and Robbins's name was on them.</p>

               <p>He knew nothing of the candlesticks; nor never saw them before he saw them on me. Before the Justice, Mr. Robbins said they were not his property, but were the property of Mr. Sturt, who was in France. Then Mr. Read asked the witness if they were his property? and he said, no; then Mr. Read said, I suppose if they are not your real property, they are your local property:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260010"/>now at that time, that man knew no more of the meaning of the word local, than a child; but then he said they were his local property; and that there might be hundreds more, for aught he knew.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough of the parish where the house was broke open. On the 24th of April, I received information and description of four men, by Jackson and another young man: I know none of the prisoners: I thought the description applied to a Jew. On Wednesday, the 26th, I was sent for: the evidence, Smith, was at his house: White was then in custody at Jackson's: I went and took the prisoner Smith; he turned evidence; and he told me of the other persons, and where these implements were to be found; I took him with me into the field; and in a hallow tree he said there was the chisels; I got up there, and found they were gone; then he looked for this cutlass and this crow, that were hid in the hedge, and a little hay thrown over them; they were gone; then he took me to a little place in the field, and there was this dark lanthorn hid; that I found: then I went and took Isaacs into custody: I went afterwards with Maxfield to the same field; that was to the same tree that Smith took me to: Smith, the accomplice, shewed me the very same spot where Maxfield told me he found the crow. On the 29th, I took Read and another in company, close by where Jackson lives. On the Saturday, I took Jenkinson at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found that relates to this subject, on either of the prisoners? - No: Isaacs gave me these things.</p>

               <p>What time was this? - I think it was six o'clock, or a little before. Says he, I want to the amount of about four pounds; I had but one pound one in silver; I said, if this will do you any service, you are welcome to it? so accordingly he told me to give this one pound one, in silver, to Mr. Smith, for his use, and to call for the remainder at night; the remainder I gave him at night, was two guineas and a half in gold, and half a guinea in silver; that was the part of four pounds ten and sixpence.</p>

Mr. Smith came the next day, and he was paid.</p>

               <p>Where did you meet that night? - At my lodging.</p>
               <p>Where did you live? - In Camomile-street, which I have not left. I had a small house near Jenkinson's, which I was going to live at.</p>

               <p>What became of you after that? - We went home to my lodging in Camomile-street. We sent White away to this little house, to stay there till we came to him, which was about twelve o'clock, at the back of Mr. Jackson's skettle-ground. Read, Jenkinson, and me, went to White; he was asleep: then I went and looked at Jackson's; he was not in bed, and we came home: at two o'clock, Jenkinson got over Jackson's pales; there was no light then; there was a light at twelve; I followed Jenkinson, and Read followed me: White continued in the little house; our dark lanthorn was so very hot (the candle was so very thick, it heated the lanthorn) we were obliged to put out the candle; it rained very hard: Read and me shoved up the cellar window, and put a chisel in; then we broke the bolt: White never was in the yard at all; he staid in the small house till we brought every thing to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260014"/>the small house joined the skettle-ground; he waited to lend a hand away with the things.</p>
               <p>Supposing there had been any alarm, could he have afforded you any assistance from that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was that small house situated, by Jackson's? - It joined the skettle-ground; only a small passage parted.</p>
               <p>So that he was as handy there, as if he had been with you? - Yes; and out of sight.</p>
               <p>Did White know the purpose you was upon? - We made an agreement to do it, in the evening; we all supped together; then we went up the cellar stairs, and let Jenkinson in at the back door; the cellar door was open; then I got a gimblet that was on the stair-case, and fastened the staircase door, that nobody should come down stairs; it was a cooper's gimblet, which we found on the stair-case: while I was doing that, Read went in and brought out a milk-pot and some spoons; then we all three went in together, and got all these things; the till and all; then we took them over to my house, and packed them all in a box; we took the money and the candles we had taken, and put them in a bundle, and put the things into the box: then Read and I went forward; Read had the plate, and I some of the candles; we went back again; we thought we had left the money behind; White put the box of candles on his head; and Jenkinson put the money in his pocket: White was in the passage of my little house; then we all came away to Isaacs: White carried the box; I had nothing; I gave

             the candles which I had: Jenkinson had the money; we sold these things to Isaacs; I made the bargain, because he could not deal with us, all talking together; he gave two guineas for the clothes, six shillings for the candles, forty shillings for ten ounces of plate; and for the silver handled knives and forks, half a crown.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Isaacs make a good hard bargain? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were you paid? - No; they gave me a guinea; he borrowed it of Sakie in silver; it was given to me; we all went away. White was sent away as soon as he had brought the box; we were to call again in the evening, for the rest: we went to Leadenhall-market, to a house that was up, and had a pot of beer; then we went and bought some steaks for breakfast; we breakfasted together; in the afternoon, I was gone out, and Read and Jenkinson went to get the money; but he would not pay it to any body, till we were all together; then he paid us all together: when I came there, Read and Jenkinson were waiting: White was with me all the day; but he was not with me at the place, when I received the money; I left him at home at my place, while I went for the money in the evening; I got two guineas and a half, and some silver; and they said there was six and sixpence due; I was very much in liquor; I went the next morning for it, and they would not pay any body; for we had a quarrel and a fight, about not parting the money, in the middle of the street; we went home to my house, and parted the money.</p>
               <p>Had you any implements? - Yes; there was a pistol and crow, a dark-lanthorn, and two chisels.</p>
               <p>Whose were they? - Read bought the chisels.</p>
               <p>What did you do with these, after you committed the burglary? - White and I went and hid them in the field, while Read and Jenkinson were counting the money.</p>
               <p>You afterwards described to Shakeshaft, the place where you placed them, before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the place where White and you took them to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any cutlass? - Yes; it came out of the house; it was in the hedge.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Isaacs? - About a month.</p>
               <p>When was you taken into custody? - On the Whit-Sunday after the robbery: White and me were together; then I gave information against the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260015"/>What did you do with the light that you had in the house? - We left it burning on the dresser, and the gimblet still in the door.</p>
               <p>Jury. What part of the dresser did you leave the candle in? - At the corner of the dresser.</p>
               <p>Not near a shelf? - No; we left it to give a light: the pistol belonged to one Selwood, over the water; and I borrowed it.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you cohabited with these people? - I have known them some time; but I have been acquainted with them about a fortnight. Jenkinson lived at Lambeth, with his sister. White lived over the water: I took this small house, to keep out of the way of every body, that nobody should know where I went to; that I might work, and nobody know me: I am a cooper.</p>

               <p>This is my wife's cloak: one large damask table-cloth; there is my name at full length; the other is not marked; one of the sheets, I believe, is marked with H. M. or E.; I believe them to be my property; the knives and forks, and cutlass, I am sure to.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jackson. This cloak is my property; I know it by a piece; the jacket is mine, and the large table-cloth; I believe all the articles to be mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Was it day-light, at the time this business was transacted? - No, Sir, it was not day-light; it was about two o'clock, when we returned the second time.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark? - Yes: it rained, and was very dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long have you had this small house of Jackson's? - Since Easter.</p>
               <p>Who projected this robbery? - We all agreed upon it together.</p>

               <p>Court. Where was you at the time this robbery was done? - I was at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to prove that fact? - No: I told you if you would put it off till to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - A stay-maker.</p>

               <p>I laid at my mother's that night.</p>

               <p>Where did this wool go from? - From Crutched-friars. Hill got away: I told Pate it was my property, and asked him where the other man was? he said he would go and fetch him: he left the basket, and went away; he was not taken till some days afterwards; I know the basket; it is marked S. B.; I am sure they are the men. Hill was my servant some years; he drove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260016"/>one of the carts; he was not taken till after the other was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long was it till they were taken? - I cannot recollect exactly; it might be about two or three weeks.</p>
               <p>They were not taken till the indictment was preferred? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you take your carman up, who had the care of this load? - Next day.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - He was tried here, and cleared.</p>
               <p>When you came up to Pate, what did he say? - He said either cotton or wool: Mitchell is gone off.</p>
               <p>How long had Hill lived with you? - Five or six years.</p>
               <p>He had been trusted to a considerable amount? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the quantity that Pate left with you? - Thirteen pounds, I understand.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the broker who weighed off this wool; I can only speak to the weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Bond. What was the colour? - The same colour: all Spanish wool is white.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Martin. I have seen the wool: the officer had it in his possession; I compared it with the other; it looks like it; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. It turns more upon the baskets than the wool.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were their hay-baskets; they had a lawful right to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond. The baskets are worth eighteen-pence; the man had the baskets in his custody.</p>
               <p>Martin. I saw the wool weighed; I took the weight down: the warehouseman put it it in the scales; I never saw the bags weighed again; I cannot tell whether the wool was deficient.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bond. Did Hill return as usual to work? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mitchell had the care of this load? - Yes; and he is off.</p>
               <p>Court. Mitchell being the carman, and having been tried, and gone away, he might have given it these men: we certainly cannot make any thing of this case; for if he had been an honest man, he would not have gone away.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of April, the prisoner was coming by my stall with some leather: I said, you may as well leave it with me, I can use it; my stall is in Tooley-street; he did not seem to take any notice; he went away; and he returned, and I said, what do you want? he asked me to buy a dozen of soles? I said if I liked them, I would buy them; I went out in the evening, and told my wife I expected him; and he came; and a person came for me; and I got a constable; he said eleven shillings was the price; I said, I suspect you have stolen them? he said he bought them of a man, and gave half a guinea for them: I delivered him to the constable.</p>

               <p>Harvey. Here is one remarkable one, I can swear to; I thought it would not do for a sole, and I was going to cut it, to make it a fore piece: they are Mess. Newman's property.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not they have been disposed of? I cannot say; I had not missed them; it is impossible to miss them.</p>

               <p>William Hay. About five or six weeks ago, I went out with Bailey and Cole, on the road leading from the Foundling Hospital to the Duke of Bolton's. We stopped a gentleman, and robbed him of his watch and umbrella, and a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Who robbed him? - I did: the others shared in it; I do not recollect any thing of a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - Only asked him to deliver his property; he said, do not use me ill; I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your umbrella? - I believe it to be mine; the handle is rather broke, and the whalebone rather torn from the canvas; I cannot swear positively; others may be in the same state.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAILEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The umbrella was given to me by a person in Fleet-market, to leave there; and he was to call for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cole was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Did you know from whom that cry of murder proceeded? - No, I do not; only I heard murder cried, and saw the prisoner run away; that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Sir, I take it as a great favour. That gentleman was not the officer that took me: and before Justice Staples, the prosecutrix said she lost a silver locket and a handkerchief; but never mentioned any thing else: and the person guilty of it, is now in the prison for another affair.</p>
               <p>How do you know who was guilty?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was standing in a room right facing her room; and the prosecutrix came and said, Bet King, my name-sake, had knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you live? - Please you, I am an misfortunate girl at present; I used to get my living in the street.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this case depends intirely on the evidence of the witnesses on the part of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutrix. Do you know the other person that the prisoner mentions, that she says robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know whether you know, gentlemen, that there is a reward of forty pounds in this case; the articles she has lost are very trifling; but it is for you to consider, whether you think that woman would be induced to give a false testimony, for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish you would seek into the prosecutrix's character; she is a misfortunate woman like myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You are at liberty to call any witnesses to your character; but you seem to have no character of your own.</p>

               <p>Jury. How do you know that piece of cloth? - It is marked with a stain or two, that was in it when it was bought; and it is cut; here is the other part of it; there are no stains on this piece; here is one stain.</p>
               <p>Will you venture from that circumstance, to swear it was your cloth? - I am sure it was my cloth.</p>
               <p>Was the cloth measured before it was stolen? - Not since I cut some off; I suppose there might be about seventeen or eighteen yards; I had not measured it before, the other part of the cloth was found on the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. The other prisoner was tried the last sessions, and acquitted: did you know this was Hughes's? - I knew he lodged in Carnaby-street.</p>

               <p>Let a good part of it out in lodgings? - Only one front door and back door; no part of the lodgings are divided; nobody joins with me in the rent of the house.</p>
               <p>For aught you know, they might have been taken out separate? - I cannot say.</p>

On the 6th of May last, at nine o'clock, I heard a knock at the door; I went up and opened the door; there I saw Jones, alias Ayres; he says, is this Mr. Hutton's? I told him it was; he said, Miss Hughes's compliments, she is sorry she cannot wait on Mrs. Hutton to-morrow morning; I said, I do not recollect my mistress has such an acquaintance; he said, yes, Miss Hughes of Great Queen-street; I shut the door, and he came in; I rather stopped; he said he was rather in a hurry; he drew out his watch, and said it was rather past nine; I then said to Jones, otherwise Ayres, it was not quite convenient to deliver that message just then, as my mistress had company in the drawing-room; I would deliver it after supper; I then delivered it to her after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260035"/>supper; I let him out; I swear it was that man; I heard another knock at the door, and of course went to the door, and opened it: the servant was then preparing the supper: the prisoner

               <p>Court. Was the other prisoner with him? - No; I did not see any body with him; the parlour door was open, and a candle burning on the side-board; I looked at the direction; and instead of Hutton, I saw it was Hatton; at that moment I heard the door open, and the sound of a person's foot; I turned, and saw the two prisoners; Jones with a great coat in both hands; and Richards I saw take this hat off a brass nail; it was hanging in the passage; it dropped on the floor; and I directly cried out, stop thief! and followed them; they both went out; Jones went up East-street, and

               <p>Court. Before the time you went back to secure the door of your master's house, you had made such observation of the person of Richards, that you can be sure he was the same person that took the hat off the nail? - I am sure of it; for I took very great observation of his person in the passage, when he delivered the note to me: I am sure Richards is the man that delivered the note to me: I am sure Jones is the man that came with the message.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man that came with the message when Richards was there? - I am sure of it; this is the hat; it is Mr. Hutton's property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am counsel for the prisoner Jones.</p>
               <p>Was there day-light enough, when you pursued, to know the man's face? - I know their faces by the light of the passage; there certainly was light enough both by the daylight, and the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - I am positive I could tell the man's face by the day-light.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that there was a sufficient light in the street, without the assistance of the lamp, merely by what is called day-light, to distinguish the faces of these persons at the bar? - Not at a distance; but what with the help of the light and the lamps.</p>
               <p>Do you consider that hour when you saw these men, as night or day? - It certainly was night.</p>

On the 6th of May last, as I was going to my lodging in Bedford-square, at half past nine, as near as I can recollect, I heard the noise of stop thief; I stopped a little while, and heard somebody running; and presently I saw there were two men coming; the one a little way before the other; and he that came first, I laid hold of; and he was very much frightened, I fancy, for he trembled exceedingly, and said he was not the man; that was the prisoner Richards: Slade cried out hold him fast; he came up in the course of a minute.</p>
               <p>Did you let him go? - I never let go of him at all: then Slade came up, and said that was the man; he laid hold of him; he begged still to be gone, for he said he was not the man; we led him backwards nearly up to his master's door; and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260036"/>was a great many people got about; and I believe, another prisoner; but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it at this time light enough for you to discover the faces of the prisoners at the bar, from Heaven, and without the assistance of the lamps? - I cannot say I could discover it by day-light, as there was lamps; I cannot say whether there was day-light sufficient, or not.</p>
               <p>Jury to Slade. Is there a globe in your master's hall, or a burner, that shewed light in the hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What distance is it from the hall-door? - It seems to be four yards from the street-door: it is a round globe with three burners, but only two lighted.</p>
               <p>Had you a candle in your hand when you opened the hall-door for Jones? - I do not recollect that I had; I left it in the parlour.</p>
               <p>How near was Jones to the light in the hall? - He came just on the mat, just within the door.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Freeland, in East-street. On the 6th of May, Thursday night, between nine and ten, I was out on business in a milk-cellar in Boswell-court; I heard the alarm of stop thief! I came out of the cellar, and saw Jones running by as hard as he could run; I was not certain whether it was him or not; I came to the steps, and an alarm was made; I pursued him; he cried stop thief several times; I took him in Queen-square, and brought him back; he had nothing in his possession: I met a congregation of people coming towards him: I delivered him to Ball, the constable: the prisoner Jones, otherwise Eyres, is the man: we came back into East-street, where the alarm was given; we saw the other prisoner, and the congregation of people.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it light enough to distinguish a man's face, without the assistance of lamps? - Why, I really believe I could discover a man's face within eight yards of me; there was day light enough then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is evidence enough to the day-light. In the case of life, your lordship knows there is no limitation of distance by the law: the law says, that if there was light enough at the time a man's countenance could be distinguished thereby? - I took notice of his face; I had a right to do so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. I leave it to my counsel; I have nobody here.</p>

The young man came between eight and nine in the evening, of the 3d of April (he knocked twice at the door) with Miss Campbell's compliments to my mistress; would be glad to know what time on Monday she would send her things; or whether she should call on her; I received the message, and went up stairs and delivered the message to the ladies; they had some suspicion, and desired I would run down; as I came down stairs, the street door bell rung.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner that delivered the message to you, in the passage, when you came down again? - He opened the door, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner at the bar? - To all appearance it was him; it certainly was him; I never saw him before; James rung at the door; the young man opened the door, and let him in; James ran after him; I did not miss any thing till the ladies came down and examined the parlour; and the plate was gone; I examined after, and found three silver waiters and some spoons were gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw the man that brought the message, till this man was in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was you sent for to go and see him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You expected to see the man? - Not without. I knew him.</p>
               <p>You was told that such a man was in custody? - I was told by the description I had given.</p>
               <p>Was not you told that a man was in custody that had robbed other houses? - I was told three men were in custody; and I picked him out; that was about six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>So that you saw him in custody for this sort of offence? - I really thought it a real message.</p>
               <p>Therefore, of course you had nothing to attract your notice of the man? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>He was gone before you got down, out of your sight? - He was.</p>
               <p>It was between eight and nine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard the two last trials? - I have.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry for it. Who was the person that gave your mistress this information? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who went with you to the place? - Another young woman in the same street, at whose house this young man had been.</p>
               <p>Had that young woman seen him? - Yes; and swore to him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Had she seen him before you went? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had not that young woman seen him at the watch-house? - She saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Did she not tell you as she went along, that she was quite sure he was the man? - She did not.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - Nothing: nobody asked me to see whether that was the man; I had no talk at all.</p>
               <p>You knew from her, that the man had been at her house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This gentlewoman heard you say, to all appearance, this is the man that came to our house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I should think, as a conscientious woman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260038"/>where a man's life is at stake, you would not carry it further? - I have no reason to doubt it.</p>
               <p>Do you think you could swear to me to-morrow? - I dare say I could.</p>
               <p>Not without this wig, I think you could not? - I saw you at Guild-hall without a wig; and I could swear to you then.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your plate has never been found? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did you pursue the man? - A considerable way.</p>
               <p>You cannot speak to the man? - No.</p>

               <p>I am cellar-man to Mr. Hodgson. I saw the prisoner help to load the cart: my master went away; and the prisoner, or Nichols, asked for something to drink; I took them both into the cellar, and gave them some rum; the prisoner had two glasses, and Nicholls one; they staid about three minutes; the prisoner said he was a ticket-porter, and his father was a livery-man; when we came up, the prisoner jumped up into the cart in the presence of me and Nichols, and took the reins in his hand; the prisoner said, will you get up? Nichols said, you are older than I, do you ride; he drove the cart away gently; Nichols says to me, the man has charged me too much; he has charged me a shilling for shewing me the way from the Vine Inn, besides some beer; that was all that passed; he shook hands with me; the horse and cart was not above fifty yards off, I believe; I understood he was driving the cart for Nichols; Nichols went away, and followed the cart; the cart was just out of sight; about three hours after, Nichols came back with another man; he said he had been at Islington; and he came back with this man, who shewed him the way, to know if we knew any thing of the cart? my master asked him if he had been at the Vine Inn to look for him? he said he had not been there; and I went there, and the ostler said he had not seen any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was Nichols sober? - Yes; when he came back, he was more sober than when he went away.</p>

On the 19th of May, my child was taken from the door, about eight in the evening; I left the child at play, and went up stairs to put my other children to bed; I looked out of the window, and called for my child; it is not six years old; I called it to go to bed; and it did not answer; and I came down stairs, and went to my neighbours to look for her; and I could not find her; about nine she came back by herself, stripped of her frock, skirt, and the clasps out of her shoes; I asked her where she had been? and she said a woman took her to <placeName id="t17900526-51-crimeloc240">Fleet-market</placeName>

               <p>I am a patrol: I heard the alarm of fire: I went round towards Long-lane; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260052"/>came round to the fire several people were trying to break open the door; at the end of the place I saw the prisoner with these things under his arm; I saw him come out of the side door, under the gate-way; he began putting the things in his pocket out of the bundles, and two women came and disturbed him; at last he went towards Barbican; I stopt him with the property; he would not give me any answer; but began to strike at me several times; I took him to the watch-house; I took several parcels from under his arm, and delivered them to one Mr. Durant, a pawnbroker, that was with me at the time; he brought them to the watch-house, and delivered them to me; the prisoner tried to trip me up: he shuffled a pair of white cotton stockings out of his pocket, and one Mr. Wright took them up, and brought them to the watch-house; and Mr. Wright took three parcels more out of the prisoner's pocket; there were eleven parcels in the whole carried to the watch-house; the prisoner behaved very ill, and almost killed one man; he tripped him up, and jumped upon him, and cut another in the cheek: he behaved terribly at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sadler. I was at home when the fire broke out, which was at the back part of a building, about half after twelve; we endeavoured to get out all the things we could; I did not see the prisoner there; I know nothing of him; I was present, and in the shop when the man tied them up; he took them from the counter; he is not here; I do not know the value of the whole articles together; here are four yards of linen cloth, value four shillings, a white muslin gown, value six shillings, a Manchester cotton gown, value six shillings, a black petticoat, value three shillings, a linen shirt, value four shillings and six-pence, a silk handkerchief, value three shillings, a pair of shoes, value two shillings and sixpence, a pair of silk stockings, value sixpence, a pair of cotton stockings, value four-pence, a linen bed tick, value two shillings, a man's cloth coat, value nine shillings.</p>
               <p>(Mary Green deposed to the silk cloak.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I saw the fire I asked one of the watchmen where it was; he told me; I went to see whether my brother was in danger: I saw many people there; and a woman came in and plunged these things upon me, and said, for the Lord's sake take these things, our house is in flames; some of them fell down; I picked them up; I went to the pawnbroker's in Barbican, whose name is Burrows, and nobody came when I knocked; my wife went the next day to find out Mr. Berry's people; she enquired of two lads whether there were any women that assisted at the fire; and Mr. Berry said they wished to avoid prosecution: that is the truth, as I hope for salvation at the last day: I was going back to see whether there was anybody to take them in; I work hard for my bread, but they have completed the business.</p>
               <p>Court to Conway. Have you had any quarrel with this man before? - No, never; I never spoke to the man.</p>
               <p>Is there a pawnbroker of the name of Burrows? - There is.</p>
               <p>Did he stop there, or attempt to get in there? - He did not; he went up the court, but did not knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have some friends here to speak to the principles of my character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe all your friends have cautioned you against your acquaintance with this man; and told your he certainly was married? - No friend ever could find out; nobody cautioned me: I had my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260054"/>sister and others to his face; I had a reason, when he never came nigh me, and took my money from me.</p>
               <p>Had not your friends cautioned you repeatedly, that he was married? - Never a one; she linked me in the mess; she deceived me in every thing, and so did he.</p>

               <p>Did not your friends caution you not to have any thing to do with him? - I had no friends in the case; I consulted my friends as far as I could; I went and told them what sort of a man he was.</p>

               <p>Then what was the occasion of your enquiries, if you had no caution? - Because he went away from me so many weeks.</p>
               <p>And it was uppermost in your mind? - My reason was, for his ill-treatment; I had the reason which every woman has, if they are going to be married, to wish to know whether he was a single man or not: I heard

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Is your master a married man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be precise to the particular time you went up stairs? - It was after nine, I suppose about a quarter of an hour; or it may be more.</p>
               <p>What do you know about the time? - Because I was in the shop; and I asked my mistress if I should put the children to bed; and she asked what it was o'clock; and I looked at the clock; and I said it was past nine.</p>

               <p>You could not, of course, perhaps, see very well beyond the stair-case, without the candle? - But there was some day-light.</p>
               <p>If you had been looking through the window: you do not mean, to be sure, that it might not be light enough out of doors, for you to see the face of any body you knew; you might have distinguished the face of a person who was looking in at the out-side of the window? - If I had a candle, I might.</p>
               <p>Suppose now for instance, the servant at the next house was peeping in at the outside of the window, coming along the leads, could not you have distinguished his face without a candle? - I will not be sure I could not.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time examine his coat, to see if it was rent? - I did, at the Compter, the same night; he never was out of their custody; his coat was rent across the flap, in the main cloth.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that he is the man you had the scuffle with? - Not the least doubt in the world: then I got a ladder and got over the party wall, into the empty house; the street door was shut after he got away from me; I put my hand against it, and found it fast; we found it within-side, on the spring bolt to the lock, that would open with a key; I saw the trunk found; I was in the passage of the empty house: the trunk was brought to me by Wilson, when I was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was darkish; it must be dark; it was a dark evening.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or day-light? - It could not be expected to be day-light at that time in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was it night? - It was not; it was dark.</p>
               <p>Could you have made out the face of a man, without the assistance of a candle, of some other artificial light? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Have you any other servant that has access to your garret but her? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any partner in the business? - No.</p>
               <p>You rent the whole house yourself? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260058"/>I take it for granted, you was not in your maid's room that day? - I was not.</p>
               <p>She has told us she was not there later than twelve; therefore how long this window had been open, you cannot possibly say? - No.</p>
               <p>You seemed at first of all to say that it was darkish, which led me to conclude you did not mean to say it was quite dark? - It was a darkish evening, as we may call it.</p>
               <p>If you had seen any of your neighbours on the outside of the door, could you have distinguished their faces? - I do not think I could, without I had been close to them; if I had been close to him, I certainly could have known his face.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough for you to distinguish his features? - There certainly was before that time.</p>

Mr. Dixon's maid came to our house, and desired me to go to her assistance, somebody had stolen all her clothes; that was a quarter past nine, quite dark; just as they got from the door, I saw Vale jump from the top of the door; whether the door was open or shut, I do not know; I immediately pursued after him.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the man you took on the ruins, was the same man you saw jump from the steps? - Yes; that is the same man; he laid down in the ruins; I took him by the collar, and pulled him up; I asked him how he came to do the fact? he said, what did I mean? I brought him back to Mr. Dixon's; I left him: me and another young chap went to the place, and within a few yards of that place, where I took him, I found a dark lanthorn; and a little further, we found a match and tinder-box in the way that he had ran, from the empty house to the ruins; and a little farther than that, we found a man's shoe and buckle, and gave them to the constable: the prisoner had no hat, nor shoes, nor buckles, when I took him; it might be fifty yards or nearer to the empty house.</p>

               <p>I am a confectioner. On the 2d of May, the prisoner brought a box of peel to me, to sell; it was a wooden box; he applied to me a week before, to know if I would buy it; he asked me six-pence a pound for it; I offered a groat; I stopped him; I have got it here: (produces it): I know the box to be the same; I marked it, and gave it to Mr. Tilt.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Tilt. Look at that box; who gave it you? - Davis brought it me on the 3d of May; it is marked R. Medge, Oxford, who is a customer of mine; the tare of the box is marked at one end; I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen it before Davis brought it? - I cannot say; I put it in the garret, where we keep empty boxes.</p>
               <p>What is it worth? - The box is worth eight-pence; the contents I cannot swear to; I could not miss such a quantity: the prisoner is my apprentice; he was in the last year of his time.</p>
               <p>Do you give your apprentice the old boxes? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I do not wish to give the Court any unnecessary trouble; I did take the box; I beg for mercy; I would have given all I had in the world to have got it back again into the shop; I was in great agitation of mind at the time.</p>

I missed my watch: I went into the water closet about ten at night, and lost it there: I missed it soon after; but it was gone: the prisoner left my house on the Friday. I gave information in Bow-street; and they sent printed bills, with ten guineas reward: I found my watch at Bow-street, in the hands of the pawn-broker, about three weeks ago, on the Monday, I was sent for to Sir Sampson's, and saw the prisoner; I believe he said he took it from the water closet, but meant to return it; I am sure he said so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your house is in Soho-square; a hotel? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then this necessary was frequented by those that use your house? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Therefore a person finding a watch there might not know it was your property? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, I believe had lived at your house? - He had.</p>
               <p>You did not know much of him yourself before? - No; he had been there about six or seven days.</p>
               <p>And when he was apprehended in Bow-street, he said, he meant to return it? - He did so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Cates, pawnbroker, in the Strand. On the 23d of April the prisoner came to our parlour door, the private door, and rang at the bell, as he had done before; he had been a customer of ours for six years: we had before received gold watches of him: he pulled out a gold watch and chain, and wanted twenty guineas upon it; I told him it was not customary to lend so much money, but if he liked to leave the watch, I would lend him ten pounds; I did so: on the 8th of May the prisoner came again; he brought the duplicate, and said, he wished me to buy the watch; I told him it was not lawful for us to buy such things while they were in pledge, but if he would leave it till Monday I might hear of some person that would buy it; according, when he was going, I thought this might not be the watch we had formerly had; I turned to the books, and saw the description of the hand-bill; I went to Sir Sampson, and Mr. Hooper was sent for: on Monday the prisoner came, and some of Sir Sampson's men were waiting to take him into custody: he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that was the watch he pledged with you in April? - Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This gentleman had before pledged his watch with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore he did not come either disguised, or privately, but to a person who knew him? - Yes; we have had a gold watch of his for six years, backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. He gave you the key himself? - Yes; he said this little key opens the table drawer, and there you will find the two seals, belonging to Mr. Hooper.</p>

On the 22d of April, at night, this prisoner came up the lane; and Mr. Emanuel asked him if he had any thing to buy or sell? he said, he had; and Emanuel called me; I went and said to the prisoner, what do you ask for that cloth? he said, threepence a yard; I sent for an officer: the prisoner would not wait; I said immediately, go over to your shop, and tell a person to detain him; but mistrusting the cloth we sent for Davidson, and he was apprehended: it was the prisoner Taylor that produced the cloth: it was wrapped up in a red cloth.</p>

               <p>I am a cooper, in Mary-le-bone-street, Golden-square. On Saturday, the 1st of May, between six and seven, I saw one of Mr. Hodges's carts coming up Oxford-street loaded with sacks: I saw the prisoner Palmer bring one sack loaded with corn or sugar (God knows what it was; it might be saw-dust) and carry it into Marlborough's house; the cart went on, and stopped about ten yards up Francis-street, while the man came our. In the afternoon, between four and five, I saw another of Mr. Hodges's carts; I was coming into my house; it was loaded with sacks in the same manner, and this same man, he did not take it from the cart; that I do really believe; for the carman put it on his shoulder; but he brought it from the cart to Marlborough's house; I saw him come out; the cart and he went up Francis-street likewise: as to Marlborough, I know nothing of him; but he certainly carried the sacks into that house; what was in them, God knows, whether corn or saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not examine at either of the times, what number of sacks were left in the cart? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether this was a sack picked up in the road, after the compliment was compleat, you cannot say? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>What is a trouncer? - When I have had coals come in, they have asked me if the trouncers should trim them; that is all I know: I recollect, in putting it down, it fell in the street; I thought the carmen were worse than him, for they gave it to him.</p>

               <p>Court. His evidence is certainly competent.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I used to work at the coal-wharf: I was the first carman, on the 1st of May, I had a load of oats, fifteen quarters, to carry to Castle-street, Oxford-market.</p>
               <p>Did you go with it safe there? - I went up Mary-le-bone-street, and the other partner with me took a sack off his cart, and told me to go on.</p>
               <p>Where did he carry it to? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You mean Palmer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the carman, and he the trouncer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you came to unload, how many sacks had you? - He told thirty full sacks.</p>
               <p>Were there thirty full sacks? - I do not know; I did not tell them when they were loaded.</p>
               <p>Had you taken up any sack in the way? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the sack that was taken from your cart, one of those that were loaded at Mr. Hodges's wharf? - Yes.</p>

               <p>He did it without your consent, I warrant you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were to carry the thirty sacks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you carried him thirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So they took you up for this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you was sent to gaol? - Yes, worse luck.</p>
               <p>Was afraid of being hanged, if you did not tell this story? - I tell no more than the truth.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you say that he took that sack without your knowledge? - I did not know he took it off; he told me to stop the cart, and I stopped.</p>
               <p>Do not you always walk together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not the cart always tied? - I did not help him to take it off.</p>
               <p>Who did?</p>
               <p>Darmer. A man or boy, God knows which it was, helped him; he could not take it off himself.</p>

               <p>Do you usually let a man take a sack? - I never did in my life, not before this time, nor at this time; I was not sure that he took it from my cart.</p>
               <p>You said this moment, that you saw him taking it from your cart? - I saw him with the sack on his back; I did not know any thing at all more than seeing the man with the sack on his back; I was along with the cart.</p>

               <p>I am book-keeper to Mr. Grill. About the beginning of April, Mr. Scott came to the compting-house of Claes Gill, a merchant, in Dunster-court, Mincing-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the name on the bill? - Mess. Grills and Maracho. The witness, Mr. Scott, asked if this bill was a good one? I told him if it was meant for Mr. Grill, it was not worth one farthing; that we knew nothing at all of the drawer; and he went away seemingly very much disappointed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grill has no partner? - No; he is the Swedish consul, and lives in Dunster-court, Mincing-lane.</p>

               <p>I executed a warrant on the prisoner; and when I came to question him where the acceptor of the bill lived, he told me he was a clock-maker, in Mincing-lane; I went to Mincing-lane, and I could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you take the prisoner with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Blackett. This is the bill that Mr. Scott brought to our house; it is not Mr. Grill's acceptance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. It does not purport to be Mr. Grill's acceptance? - No.</p>
               <p>To Freeman. I think you have retired on your fortune: are you still an officer? - I was at that time.</p>
               <p>It is since this you retired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now you are a gentleman on your fortune: you did not ask the number where the watch-maker lived in Mincing-lane? - No; he gave me no direction of the number.</p>
               <p>And you did not take him with you? - No, for this reason: when I informed him I had been there, and could find no such person; he said he was gone to Birmingham; and so he told the magistrate.</p>
               <p>You went in all the courts? - Yes; I believe there is but one.</p>
               <p>Who did you enquire for? - For Mr. Grill, the clock-maker; that was the direction he gave me: when the prosecutor told him he had been to the Swedish consul, the prisoner said, that is not the person.</p>
               <p>Then he never pretended this was Mr. Grill, the Swedish consul? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>He spoke English perfectly well? - Yes, you will hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I submit that this foreigner did not say it was Grill, but Grillo, the watch-maker.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>First my prosecutor makes a misdate in the day; he mentions my bringing the note to him the 1st of April; and I brought it to him the Easter Monday, which I believe was the 4th; and I offered him if he would take this note upon the usual discount, I would pay him what I did owe him? upon which he said, yes; and I gave him two shillings and eight-pence discount, and paid him his debt: the note I had received from Grillo and Marachot, on Good Friday; Grillo alone gave me the note for him and his company; it is only signed by him; he gave me the note in my room, in fetching his work; I am a watch-gilder and watch-case-maker; I never was at his apartments; he told me he kept a private house; and that it was next door to a sugar-baker's in Mincing-lane.</p>
               <p>Was you ever at his house? - I never was at it.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to tell the prosecutor that any body knew him? - Because he always paid me very honest.</p>
               <p>What was your reason for refusing to go and shew the house? - He told me the direction; that it was next door to a sugarbaker's: after I gave this note to Mr. Scott, he told me that that note was not good; and I knew that this Grillo had much commerce in Birmingham.</p>
               <p>But if you knew he was in Birmingham, why did you not tell him so? - He had the note two days after.</p>
               <p>But as soon as you knew he was not in town, you should have informed him of it? - Mr. Scott did make no scruple of the note at the time; I have had notes of him before, and they were always honestly paid.</p>
               <p>To Scott. Have you ever received notes from the prisoner at the bar, that have been honestly discharged? - I once received a note that was drawn on Cox in Shoe-lane; and that note was paid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Cox, the jeweller, you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>

On the 26th of April, I had information that there was iron under Henman's bed; and we found it under his bed: the constable has it; his name is

               <p>Mr. Beth, Prisoner's Counsel. Pray what number do you live at in John-street? - No. 2.</p>
               <p>Do not you bring strange men to your house usually? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Have not you brought strange men to your house? - No; I defy any body to say so.</p>
               <p>Are you a married woman? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Does not a gentleman from the city very often visit you? - He does.</p>
               <p>You say you never brought a stranger there? - No.</p>
               <p>What reason had you to suspect this servant that you put so much confidence in? - I put confidence in her because I had a good character of her; I had no other reason to suspect her, than she said two strange men followed her to the house: my servant boy has lived with me near a twelvemonth; I never found him dishonest; the towel was found in her box; I do not suppose she took that with intention to steal it; I think she would certainly have taken something of greater value.</p>
               <p>Did you never bring a stranger there? - I think, Sir, you ask me very odd questions; if I must speak the truth, I never took strangers.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion of the gentleman that visited at your house? - I believe that gentleman's character will bear enquiry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff. A gentleman behind is telling her to say no: (the gentleman ordered out of court): I believe her not to be a good woman; her husband has now been in Newgate four years, also condemned for his life.</p>
               <p>Were not there a great many gentlemen that visited your house that you might as well have suspected? - No, Sir; none at all; the property I used the day before I went out of town; and I saw it all.</p>
               <p>Did you lock it up? - The gentleman that put it up is in Court.</p>
               <p>What servants have you? - A foot-boy, and a servant of all work.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; to search for the spoons: I looked into her box, which was packed up, and tied with a cord; I found no spoons in it; I only found this towel: I enquired about the spoons, but heard nothing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fenton. This towel is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. What did the prisoner say? - She said, this is my mistress's to be sure.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Penton. I know no further, only that those spoons were lost during the time my mistress was out of town: I had no suspicion of the prisoner till I saw two strange men come home with her; and I asked her who those two men were; it was on Tuesday evening, the 11th of this month (my mistress went out of town on Sunday, and returned on the Wednesday): the prisoner told me those two strange men she did not know; that they were two strange gentlemen to her: and there was a pot of porter standing in the kitchen; I asked her how it came there? and she told me, she fetched it for those two gentlemen, and asked them to eat some bread and cheese; and I asked her what made her leave the house to fetch them porter, if she knew nothing of them? and she said, did I think such genteel men as them would touch any thing? and I made her answer, I did not know; and I took up some knives in the parlour, which I had been cleaning, and I missed those spoons out of the boxes; I missed eleven spoons; I saw them in the knife box in the parlour, on the Monday: when I went up to bed she called to me: I lay in the next room to her: and she said, the clock was gone, which I did not know; and I asked her why she did not let me know the clock was gone before we came up? and she made answer, because she thought it would make me more uneasy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260082"/>Mr. Beth. These were very genteel people I believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them in your house before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when they knocked at the door? - I was behind them, at the street door.</p>
               <p>Did not they ask for your mistress? - No such thing. I was going of an errand to Park-street: and I gave her the key of the street door, and told her to take care of the door; and she laughed, and said, do you think I will not: I thought these were two clerks, where she lived last: I thought by their conversation they were acquainted, for they were talking very high together.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was you before you came home again? - I was two hours.</p>
               <p>Did you find the men there when you came back? - No.</p>
               <p>Who did they ask for? - They were coming home with her hand in hand: I saw the time piece in the afternoon; I cannot say what hour; it might be about two.</p>
               <p>What time was it that these two men came home with her? - At ten in the evening: the prisoner went out at five, and came back at ten: I left the men on the step of the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Do not you know that this servant was standing with the door open, in order to bring gentlemen into the house, and do not you know that she has brought gentlemen into the house? - No, Sir; I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this woman, this prisoner, was often sent out to the streets, at different hours, in order to bring gentlemen to this lady? - She never was sent out before; I always went out myself.</p>
               <p>Have not you brought men when you returned? - No, Sir, never.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - They had boots on, their hair dressed, and flapped hats, and great coats, and sticks.</p>
               <p>Were they not as well dressed as this gentleman that visits at your house? - No, Sir; they were exceedingly well dressed.</p>
               <p>Do not you see gentlemen of this lady's acquaintance not so well dressed as they were.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not understand that there has been any imputation thrown on this lady's character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. My lord, I only wish to establish this, that many gentlemen visit that house; that the lady has been in the practice of sending out this woman to bring home gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. She has told you she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Were not these two gentlemen who called, as genteelly dressed as that gentleman that is at present with the lady? - Yes; as he is now; but he has more clothes; perhaps they have not.</p>
               <p>What was your reason for thinking they were clerks? - Because they had the appearance of clerks; I have seen a great many clerks; and this woman living with a linen draper; as she told me she was going to receive her wages; and I thought they were clerks she had brought to protect her home.</p>
               <p>You do not know that the prisoner was sent out by the lady for any other gentleman? - No, Sir; I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Court. No; he says she never was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master is gone for; Mr. Walker, a linen draper, in King-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Did you take up the bag immediately as it was dropped? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>How long might it lay? - I suppose a minute.</p>
               <p>Other persons might have passed? - The court is no thoroughfare.</p>
