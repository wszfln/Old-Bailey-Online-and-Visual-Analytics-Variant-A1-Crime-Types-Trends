               <p>I am a servant; I saw the clock that evening between four and five; I shut the windows that night; there is a stable yard communicates to Lady Godolphin's house, in this yard there is an access immediately to the house; in consequence of the clock being missed, we searched the house immediately, but we could find no clock, nor any body in the house; there was no other step taken then; I did not see the prisoner till the day he was taken; I believe he was apprehended near Monmouth-street. I did not go with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a clock was this? - I cannot describe the clock, but it was in a black case, it was a table clock; I don't know the maker's name.</p>

             did, and the prisoner was present, when they placed it on the table, I told them it was an old family piece, they said, it belonged to Penry Jones, the prisoner at the bar; with that, I asked the prisoner at the bar how long he had had this clock? he said, he had had it three weeks, I told him, that never could be, for I knew it was an eight day clock, and it was then going, and that he must come dishonestly by it; then they asked me if I would make a winder to it? I told him no. I asked Penry Jones if he knew the consequence of it? and I told him to take the clock back again to the right owner of it, then they both laughed at me, and said, would I not make a winder to it? I said no; and I had no further discourse with them till I saw the prisoner at Bow-street. This clock was in a black ebony case. The name I verily believe to be Knibb. I observed the name at the time, and I verily believe it; the circle of the clock was pierced. They came afterwards to the public house where I was, but we had no conversation there about the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a perfect recollection what the boy said there? - He told the magistrate that he had stole the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where? - He said, he had stole it of his mistress our Lady Godolphin, and that he had given it to a coachman to sell.</p>

            , and the young woman, was at our house that night, they left the house about half after ten, they all went out together, I believe there was five of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember a man in a green coat? - Yes, there was a short man in a green coat and a black crape about his hat, the same night I was going out with a pot of beer, and I heard that the patrole was knocked down, I know him; I was coming out of the house with a pot of beer, and I saw the old gentleman laying down at the end of the door, and I went to pick him up, and the woman was laying down by his side, when he got up his hat was gone; the woman lay on his left side, and with one hand about his arm, and the other hand was by his left hand pocket, there was nobody with me; when I got up to him one of them called her, and she made answer and said, damn him let him lay, I will have no more to do with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Goodall. I will not deny drinking in the house, it was pretty nigh eleven o'clock when I came out, and I went home about my business; I am innocent of the robbery, and I leave you to judge whether I would rob this man knowing him so many years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Allen. I was at this public house, and when I came out there was a mob at the door; I saw a man laying on the ground and thought he was in liquor, so I took no notice at all of him, but went towards my own home, and I saw this hat lay and I picked it up.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; in consequence of an information I apprehended the prisoner Turnbull, on the 27th of February, I apprehended him at a place called the World's End; I believe it was the house where Turnbull was quartered at, he belonged to the Middlesex militia, and was quartered there at that time; I searched him, and I found on him a powder flask, which I have here; there was another man present with him; I searched him, and I brought him along with me to Tunbridge Wells; he told me that he had a trembling on him for two or three hours before, and that he had a dream the night before that his mother was dead, and he expected what had happened; he knew what I came for as soon as he saw me; I asked him if he had any box, or any thing else? he said he had not; he was giving some things out of his pocket to a comrade, the comrade said, that is my powder horn, I then took the powder horn from him, and brought him to London. (The powder horn produced.) As I was coming along in the coach with this Turnbull, I did not tie his hands; while I was in the coach I was taken very bad and sick, I had occasion to put out my head, I wanted to cast up, while my head was out of the coach, I felt something at my pocket, and afterwards when I felt, I found I had lost the horn; we were then out of the coach, I told him he had used me very ill, he had picked my pocket; he said, he dare say I had let it fall at the bottom of the coach; accordingly I went back to the coach, and the coachman found it at the bottom of the coach. (Deposed to.) On the 26th I had notice of a box being left at Mr. Cook's the furrier's, that was the property of Turnbull. I went to Mr. Cook's and I saw Mr. Cook's servant girl, and the instant she saw me, she was ready to faint away, she said, she knew very well what I came about; of Mr. Cook, who is now in court, I requested to see that box, and therein I found a great quantity of things which I now produce. Mr. Brooks's man has seen them, but Mr. Brooks has not. (The articles produced and deposed to.) I apprehended Somerville on the 22d of February, at the Bull's Head in Crown-street, St. Giles's; Miller and I were together, he denied his name at first, he was playing at knock up halfpenny in the tap room; I looked very hard at him, and said pray, is not your name Somerville, he said, no, I pulled off his hat, and I saw his hair was dressed up in a soldier's form, I said to him your name is Somerville.</p>

I went to a house, No. 5, in Shaw's-Gardens, I found a deal of property there; some belonging to Mr. Brooke's, and some belonging to other gentlemen in the chambers, here is a pocket book, and two silver spoons, a pair of boot buckles, and two pair of stockings, and a chissel, which has the top broke off, and which piece was found in the Chambers<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100011"/>of Mr. Brooke's, in one of the drawers, and they correspond.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutors Messrs. Hanbury and Reed. On the 16th of March, I saw the prisoner between five and six in the afternoon in the brew-house; I saw him come from the store-house and take a drink of beer, and after some time, he came up to where the cock lay, the cock was laying in a barrel that was full of beer, and he pulls it out and looks at it, and puts it in again, and then looked about him, and after that he pulls it out again, and lays it across his knee; then he took a knife out of his pocket, and cut the leather off that was fastened to it; after that he fixed the remaining part of the leather under the steering, that the barrel was fixed upon, and he went away with the cock in his hand, and I followed him; in two yards from the place, I catched him by the shoulder, I did not see the cock with him then, so I asked where the cock was that I saw him cut away? says he, I have cut off no cock, I have been taking a drink of beer; so he got his hand under his apron, and I put my hand there, and I found the cock in his hand under his apron, and I took hold of the cock at this end, and he struck me on the breast with this end of the cock, and I led him along, and he seemed not very willing to go, and I called assistance, and I secured him, and took him before the Lord Mayor; I carried the cock in one hand, and he in the other; when I see him take it, I was about fifteen yards off him in the store house, just opposite to him; I was in the dark, and he in a light place, I could see him very perfectly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now mind and speak the truth. You say you are an apprentice to Mrs. Taylor? - I am; Bromfield was a journeyman there; the prisoner he asked me for some hair, I believe it was one Tuesday night, a month or two ago, to make a brush; I told my mistress of it, that Bromfeild had asked me, and my mistress told me to give him some; I gave them to him, and I saw him put the hairs under his apron about a pound.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Taylor. What is a pound worth? - Two shillings and six-pence.</p>

               <p>Q. What is it? - To bind me to speak the truth. I was in the shop that night; I came in between four and five, and I saw that woman, that is there, and two more; when I came in the muslin was on the ground, and this woman dropped an halfpenny, and in picking up the halfpenny, she picked up the muslin, and put it under her cloak, and I told the gentleman of it, and he went after her and brought her back. I saw her brought back, but I did not see her drop it.</p>

               <p>I was in the shop when this woman was brought back. I saw her take her hand within side of her petticoat, and drop the muslin down from within side of her petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the muslin fall from her? - I did; I see her kick it with her foot (here is the foot mark on it) when she dropped it from under her petticoats.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that gentleman brought me back he searched me, and I had not a halfpenny worth belonging to him. I deal in a few oranges; I have three poor fatherless children; I went in with this woman to buy an apron, and I came out with her, and then this gentleman came out afterwards, and desired me to go back, and before we got to the door he searched me, and found nothing.</p>

               <p>In consequence of some information, I went to the Fleet Prison; I went first to the strong room where the prisoner was in custody in the Fleet Prison; Mr. Lawrance, Mr. Carpmeal, and Mr. Harper went with me, and another person whose name is Bryan, I searched the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these people all go into the strong room with you? - They did; in his right hand breeches pocket I found some silver, this was on the 25th of February, I don't remember the day of the week, about eleven or twelve o'clock. (The silver produced.) When we had so done we went into a room, his apartment, and there I saw a box which the prisoner declared was his; Mr. Lawrance took the base metal out of the box, I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this box open when you first saw it? - No, Mr. Lawrance opened it, he took out some half crowns, shillings and six-pences, and some broken pieces, and I think one half crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these appear to you to be good or bad? - Bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man was in the strong room? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the room where you found the box? - It is the next floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the room where you found these things? - I think only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his name? - I do not, he told me it was the man he was chum to.</p>
               <p>Q. That man is not here to day? - I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a prisoner likewise? - I understand so.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk about a box which you found there. Did the prisoner go with you to the room where you found these things? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you only talk of a box in that room? - We went back to him after we had been to that room and told him what we had found, he said it was his room; and Mr. Lawrance produced the money to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never saw the box from which you took this money from? - He did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100017"/>Q. In point of fact he was not taken to that place? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the box opened? - I cannot tell whether it was opened with a key or without.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the money that was found the half crown, shilling, and other pieces of money appeared bad to you? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. No man living who saw it could doubt it was bad? A man would have been a great fool to have taken it - I should not have taken it if I had looked at it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You have been asked as to this box, if I understand you right, you took this money to the prisoner, and asked him if that was his box, describing the box it was taken from? - Mr. Lawrance did; he said it was his box.</p>

               <p>I am one of the city officers; I went with Mr. Clarke into the Fleet Prison, the prisoner at the bar was sitting at the further side of the fire place in the Strong Room, in the Fleet Prison; I searched him, in his right hand waistcoat pocket I found these papers, I went with Mr. Clarke into another apartment, which we were informed was his room, he acknowledged the box I opened was his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the apartment? - I don't recollect he did. We found a little bench on the window, and on the bench a flask. (Produced.) On the bench there was a parcel of files, they were all open in the room on the bench; the bench was on the front before the window; I found all these things on the bench or under the bench, some galley pots, a pewter pot, some broken crucibles, a parcel of metal, a hand vise, several files, a vial, and a bottle with liquor in them; here are four galley pots, I will not be certain for all, but three of them were on the stone outside of the window. Then I went to the box, the box was locked, I opened it with my bureau key, and I found this base silver, a half crown, five shillings, and one six-pence; five incomplete things, which I will call shillings, two six-pences, incomplete, and then there was some get, and this paper was likewise in the box. There was some spoons found which are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any spoons in the box? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you found these things? - Carpmeal, and Mr. Clarke, and Bryan, and Harper; I went back after to him, and he acknowledged it to be his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him the money that was taken out of the box? - I did not I attended the examination, and he saw the money; I shewed it him while he was under examination.</p>
               <p>Court. When he acknowledged the box did you describe the room where the box was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body in your presence? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You had been in a room, and asked him if that box was his box, he said it was? - Now all these things were public for any body's inspection, perhaps you have heard that he has a Chum? - I have heard that; the Chum was below, and was brought up to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Chum had the key of the door, and he let you in? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And all these things were found at that window on the bench public? - Except that which I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was your key that opened the box? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us look at it, this is a very common key? - It is, but it was with some difficalty I got it open with it I assure you.</p>

               <p>I am the Chamberlain of the Fleet; the prisoner at the bar occupies No. 9, the room where the officers went; his Chum's name is Hunt, he was chummed on him the fifth of February, 1793. The man at the bar was the master of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he occupied that room before February? - Some years; he moved to another room, and moved back to that room again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been confined in the Strong Room? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go into his room while he was there? - Frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there in the month of February? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a box? - I see two or three boxes there in the room, the day they searched the room; I believe they searched several boxes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say Hunt was the Chum then; who had been his Chum before? - One Rushton and others.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was not rich enough to buy off his Chum? - I never knew he did, as long as I ever knew him, he had his Chum; I cannot charge my memory that ever he paid his Chum out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this man had had the misfortune to quarrel with several of his fellow prisoners? - He has quarrelled with his Chum.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe very shortly before this time he had a complaint put in against him, for an assault on some person? - He did, his name is Tracy.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, I believe this man is disliked by almost all the prisoners in the Fleet Prison? - I cannot tell; I have known him to have a quarrel with that man that was chummed upon him, and was obliged to put in bail. Tracey had been his Chum. Hunt introduced Tracey as his Chum, who has slept in that room during the absence of this man in the Strong Room.</p>
               <p>Q. Hunt then introduced Tracey into this room, who has indicted the prisoner for an assault. Now Mr. Keene how long before this discovery was made, was this man confined in the Strong Room, and unable to visit this room, which was his, was it four or five days? - I cannot speak exactly, it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for four or five days this room, and whatever the man had in it was completely at the disposal of Tracey? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And Tracey who has an ill will to him, and indicted him for an assault has slept there, and been in that room. Now we find how very easily the box was opened; if that box which was opened was his there is nothing more easy on earth to open. Did not this man make pewter spoons? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he sold them about the prison? You have seen him at work? - I don't know indeed; I have seen him rasping and filing spoons when I have come in to gather the rent; I believe he has sold several in the prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Who is Mr. Tracey? - The man that was concerned in raising the Royal George.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired to get rid of Tracey? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not like him to come into the room? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You told us you saw a box in that room which the prisoner acknowledged; was it described to him? - The colour of the box was described to him; there was one a deal box and this was a dark brown box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you had been? - We did not; we went to him and searched him, and then we were directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100019"/>to that room as his room, and then we went back and shewed him what we had found, and he acknowledged it was his box it was taken out of.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before, that he had not seen the property? - He did not see it, he said, the box was his that the property was taken from, but he never was shewn it.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a bill of perjury preferred against you, was it tried? - There was a man of the name of Dillon.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer the plain question; have you been tried on that indictment for perjury? - I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say only that you believe? was not you struck off the list from practising at the English bar? - Upon my oath I was; and hindered from proceeding in this kingdom, without being heard. I believe there was no other reason for striking me off, but because I was an Irishman. On my oath I was not heard. On my oath there was no ground for the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. I look upon him as a competent witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I do. I have known him some time; I knew two apartments that he occupied; the first apartment was No. 14, and I remember him at No. 2. There was only a wall between his apartment and mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at No. 9? - I have been with him in the apartment No. 9, I think it is in the third gallery, I called on him only once there to the best of my recollection; I went into his room, he was only sitting by the fire and doing nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at work there? - No, never. In No. 2, I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - I believe four or five months ago, when he lived at No. 14 or 15, there was some report of this business from a woman that he lived with; but I have often waked at night with the noise at No. 2, I was curious to know what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this is nothing to No. 9.</p>

Richardson, says he, it is only wanting four or five minutes, it makes no difference, says he, to the company, I live but just by, then says I, I must rub you down; I put my hands down him, and I felt the tea in his pocket, and he immediately wrenched himself away from me, I pursued him, and he endeavoured to make a run, and wanted to make to the gate by force, and I said, Rickman, you must not let the man go out, and I immediately stepped forward, and stopped him again; then I said Barnes, I have had a suspicion some time; now says I, you must go up to the officer Mr. Wilson, we went up, Mr. Wilson was there, and Mr. Wilson sent for the officer, and Mr. Noble came in, and Mr. Noble immediately searched him, and found the tea, and it was put into a sheet of paper before my face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What the prisoner said that that way was his nearest way home was true? - It was, he lived just by.</p>

The saddle is here; I can swear to the saddle; I set Mr. Hull's name in the saddle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The name he put on the saddle, he did it at the office.</p>

               <p>My partner and I was at work, and we saw the prisoner go down the yard with the saddle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A gentleman was coming out exactly from the place, and he said, he would give me 6 d. to carry it for him to Oxford-road.</p>

I made answer and said, there was none at all; I saw him do nothing; I did not see him take the bason at all, a little girl was in the bar, and she told my mistress the soldier had got the bason of halfpence, I turns round immediately, I see the bason under his arm; I ran out after him; he threw me down in the mud, and used me very ill; I cannot swear to the pattern of the bason, but I can to the pieces; the bason used to be kept on a barrel in the bar, and my mistress had moved it under the counter; I saw it there while the soldier was there. The scuffle was about five doors off; I picked the pieces up in the street, and three shillings of halfpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time in March, the waggoner, the defendant, coming to your master's? - Yes, on the 7th of March, about five or half after five in the evening; some oats and beans came in Mr. Reed's waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of oats and beans you was to receive? - No, not in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you did receive? - Nine sacks of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these nine sacks of beans? - Put them up in one part of the warehouse by themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. All that you received of Blinco you put into your master's warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before there was any mention of a loss? - To the best of my recollection it was not till Saturday night; I was not acquainted there was any deficiency before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Saturday night you told your master there were but nine sacks; did not your master accuse you? - Of what.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a sack deficient, and you told him you never received but nine? - Yes. I know the situation that I left the sacks in; and they were all right as I received them.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master was very angry that you had not ten sacks to produce, therefore of course you told him you received but nine? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Who was with Blinco? - The man that was with him is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You would have had to make up the ten sacks good, unless you had thrown the blame on Blinco? - It was no mistake, because I knew how I put them.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you the question? - Yes, to be sure I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was the best way to say there was only one nine sacks? -</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there not a bill of parcels delivered? - Not that I see.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to swear that there was not a bill of parcels delivered with these goods? - I will not swear there was, or was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear they did not deliver a bill of parcels? - They did not to me, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that delivered these beans? - Blinco.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you count them when they were delivered on Thursday? - I did not, no more than place the beans in one part of the warehouse by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you neither count them, nor receive a bill of parcels? - I know there was no more than nine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You might have put up ten, and somebody might have slipt out one from your warehouse, as well as any other place. Is not that possible? - It is possible.</p>

               <p>I deal in corn. On the 7th of March, about half past five in the evening some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100028"/>corn was delivered by Blinco and another man, whom I have never seen before nor since, he ran away; there came in the waggon twenty quarters of oats, and ten quarters of beans; I delivered the key to Vowel and told him where to put them, but I did not see the beans delivered myself; I went in the moment they were unloaded, and I found there were ten sacks together, but one was a sack of oats, which was taken away from the other side, and put to the sacks of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bill of parcels? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quantity of oats? - Yes, but I had only five quarters left there; fifteen were put at another place; the bill of parcels I have got here, it was sent to Mr. Reed again as a receipt. On Saturday night Mr. Reed applied to me to know if I had received my beans safe, I told him I believed I had, as there were ten sacks together; but when I came to examine again more particular I found one sack of oats short.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You yourself signed the bill of parcel, that all was right? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that when you found it not all right, you expected Vowel to make good the sack of beans? - I should not look to him for the sack of beans.</p>
               <p>Q. Vowell had access to this warehouse of your's? - The key was never out of my possession after Vowell stowed them, till Mr. Reed told me he suspected the carman stealing the beans.</p>
               <p>Q. The beans have never been found I believe? - Yes, they have.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoner's at the bar? - I know one by sight very well, the eldest man of the two Hoskins, he works in the market as a porter, and comes into my house frequently for a pint of porter; the other is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Hoskins in the evening of the 7th of March? - Yes, he was at my house the 7th of March, by himself first about six o'clock in the evening, it was on Thursday; he came again afterwards with the waggoner that stands there, it was in less than half an hour after the first time, the waggoner came in and asked me to let him leave a sack of beans; I asked who it was for, they did not give an answer in a proper manner as they should, and I said take it away, I will have no such a thing in the house; they took it away again, and put it in the waggon again; and went towards Aldgate, and then it was offered for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the waggon the time the waggon was at the door. How many sacks were in the waggon at the time? - I cannot tell what quantity; then they brought it back from Aldgate and pitched it at the door about a quarter of an hour after, as I have a stand at the door; I made them take them again off the bench for fear they should break it; and then Hoskins took it on his back, carried it along the street, and he was stopped by the patrole, I did not see him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Blinco? - I don't know, he was not with him at this time; the patrole stopped him in the street in about two minutes with the sack of beans and brought him back, and they were pitched at my door; and the patrole asked me to take it into my house, I let him, I have brought it in a coach here to day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never see Blinco before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was the 7th of March, therefore you are not certain Blinco is the man? - I am not; Hoskins I know very well; it was Blinco and another man that came first, Hoskins was employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100029"/>by them to carry them, Blinco is the man that came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of that - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see him before in your life? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him afterwards till you had the hearing before the justice, I believe that was the Saturday following two days afterwards; and then you was not certain Blinco was the man, you saw on Thursday? - Yes, I am certain Hoskins was not with him at first, but Hoskins was the man who was afterwards found with the beans.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you to leave the sack of beans? - Blinco asked me that.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole of Whitechapel High-street. On the 7th of March last, at night I took the prisoner Hoskins with the sack of beans on his back, he was going on; I asked him what he had got there? he said beans; says I, where are you going? he said, to Mr. Johnson's, with that I told him I should stop him on suspicion, he said he would take me to the place where he took them from; he went back to the Seven, Stars Whitechapel, the house of Mr. Turner, and pitched them on the pitching block; about half an hour after, I saw Mr. Turner. Then I took Hoskins to the Rotation office; Mr. Turner had them delivered to him, and has had them ever since. (The sack produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I am a coachman; I drive a stage coach, I come to speak against the prisoner Hoskins, what was said to him at the time they gave him the beans out of the waggon, at the Rose and Crown, Aldgate, High-street, Mr. Fisher's, the man Hoskins came into Mr. Fisher's and asked Mr. Fisher if he wanted a flyer? he told him he wanted no such thing, this man directly Hoskins goes out, and he told the man it would not do there, he should take them to some others; he takes them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100030"/>out of the waggon and goes to the Seven Stars.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner there? did you see him at this public house? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other man with the waggon besides this man Hoskins? - There was; some man gave him the sack out of the waggon, and it was carried to the Seven Stars, about three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you hear about it? - The words that was said when it was delivered out of the waggon by the other man was, that he was to bring the money to him at the Magpie and make the most of it; he took them and offered them for sale at the Seven Stars, to a man at the door, and a man bid him eight shillings for them; they were not sold.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened before the watch was in your hand? - I was shoved four or five yards before the watch was taken from me; then they had me tight in their arms; I pulled the watch out of my pocket myself, in order to secure it on their attacking me, and I had it in my right hand, and the watch was taken out of my hand by main force, and my wrist bent almost double; my hand was sprained for three weeks, I could not use it; I saved part of the chain, and the seal and the key.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't happen to know whose hand took it? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time it was taken had he hold of you? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen that watch again? - No. I gave about hand-bills and advertised, but I never saw any thing of it. I held Stanton by the collar, the rest went off, and I detained him till the watch came up; he was examined, nothing was found, the watchman examined him directly; the watchman is here; I told the watchman I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe what sort of a watch it was? - I did not; it was a metal watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now, Mr. Bellchamber, it is well a man should continue in the same story, you have been saying that you had got the watch in your hand, and one of them pulled it out of your pocket; how came you to say before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100031"/>the magistrate that it was taken out of your pocket? - I believe I did not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read the information to you,</p>
               <p>"you met four or five young men who ran violently against you several times, one of which took the watch out of your pocket." - It was taken wrong the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention a word before the magistrate of this man's laying hold of your arms, while the others robbed you? - I might not say it then, but I know he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined before the magistrate the next morning; then the next morning you must at least have as good a recollection of the matter as you can have now? - I was not asked above four or five questions.</p>
               <p>Q. I think the most material question in the description of a robbery, is how it was committed; there you did not mention a word of his having held you while the other robbed you? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate asked you how it happened, how came you not to mention that this man enclosed you in his arms while the other robbed you? Because that is a very material circumstance, however you did not mention it there? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now another question; was not this man taken up for an assault on the watchman, and not for your robbery? - No, because I had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you whether the man was not taken to the watch-house on the charge of assaulting the watchman, and not for a robbery on o? - I charged the watchman with him as soon as he came up; I don't know was taken for assaulting the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. But when a man's life is in danger we wish people to be positive; was your charge made before you made it at the watch-house? - I gave charge directly the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you gave charge before you got to the watch-house? - He was taken away immediately as soon as the watchman came up; I said take charge of this man for he has robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you mention a tittle of your being robbed by this man before you got to the watch-house? - Certainly I did, I certainly gave charge of him as one of the people that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was he searched? - In the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. They did not search him on the spot? - They took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear that you told the watchman you lost your watch before you got to the watch-house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Will you stand by that that you gave charge of that man, as one of the persons that robbed you before you got to the watch-house? - I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put it in such a way as you shall understand; on your oath did you at all charge this man, as being one of the persons concerned in the robbery before you got to the watch-house? - Yes, I did charge him before I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got to the watch-house you had the chain about your finger? - I had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you mention the circumstance of having lost your watch till the watchman asked the question, from the circumstance of seeing the chain in your hand? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you was perfectly sober at that time? - No, I was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. We want to know what time; from five o'clock in the afternoon till one in the morning? - No, not so much as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100032"/>that; it was from about half past nine, and I had been drinking till between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. All that time you had been drinking? - Part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you was so drunk, as not to be able to know what you was about? - I certainly was in liquor a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how far you was got in drunkenness, upon your oath had not you drank till you was perfectly insensible - I was not so bad as that, I own I was very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you answer the watchmens questions that they put to you, had you the power of utterance at that time? - I don't know about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know whether you was able to articulate a word to the watchman? - Yes, I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was able so to express yourself, as to have your words understood? - I should think I was not so intoxicated as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you was at all sensible of what passed? - I recollect being stopped by them; I recollect going to the watch-house, and seeing the man searched.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give a different account before the magistrate than today, do you think you had got over your drunkenness the next morning? - I was not perfectly sober then, I did not go to bed till between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And the magistrate did not sit till twelve o'clock, and yet you was not perfectly sober then; your situation in life is only that of a waiter? - That is my situation.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this watch? - I valued it at 4 l. it cost me seven guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Mews the brewer; I don't exactly recollect the night, but I think it was about five or six weeks ago, I had been spending my evening in Maiden lane, Covent Garden, and coming home, I went through the Piazza's, and I saw five or six men surrounding the prosecutor, and I stood for some minutes, I believe ten, and I see them hoist him backward and forward, and several of them struck him; after standing this time I remonstrated with two or three watchmen who stood round, for suffering the man so to be insulted, without interfering. The watchmen then made an appearance and interference, which gave me an opportunity of going in amongst them, I went in, and immediately laid hold of the man, who had been confining the prosecutor by the arms during the whole time of the bustle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner that man? - I think he was; on my taking hold of him, I directly told the watchman to take him to the watch-house, and I would bring the prosecutor; they did with some little difficulty; I got the prosecutor to follow after; I accompanied the prosetor to the watch-house, where he gave charge of him; I did not attend any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge before he came to the watch-house? - No, sir, I gave him into the custody of the watchmen, I did not attend to it any further, I then left him, I might stay there as much as a quarter of an hour after; when I got into the crowd, I observed the prosecutor had got a watch chain in his hand, he said, they had wrenched the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you hear the watchman at the watch-house ask the prosecutor what was become of his watch? - I don't recollect that question.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prosecutor at that time any share of recollection so as to recollect what was past? - He was in a state of intoxication, all the account he gave was that he came out of a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to give any account of the transaction at the watch-house? - No, he only said, he was ill used by the people, that is all that I recollect of the circumstance; he appeared very much in liquor; but the whole of the business seemed to have brought him something to his recollection.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; about half after one, on the 1st of March, there was some people got about Bellchamber here, and the watchmen threw their rattles, and I came up to their assistance, and Mr. Bellchamber had hold of the prisoner, and the prisoner had hold of him by the breast, I asked the prisoner what business he had with him? and he said, what was that to me, he wanted to take care of him, so I told him to go about his business; with that, he made a strike at me at my breast, and I took him out of Mr. Bellchamber's hands, then with that Mr. Wilkins came up, and he said watchman take him away, and take him along to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. While you was in the street did the prosecutor give you any charge of the prisoner? - Yes, he told me to take care of him, for he was one of the people that robbed him of his watch; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before Mr. Justice Addington at Bow-street? - No, I was not. On this, I was for myself, because I gave charge of him for striking me.</p>
               <p>Court. He was examined at the watch-house? - He was, there was nothing found but a couple of shillings in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your Worship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I had been spending my evening with a few friends, and was going my way home, through the Piazza, Covent Garden, I saw a crowd about the prosecutor, and seeing him a decent man, I thought I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100035"/>take his part; the watchman came up and took me, this watchman said immediately, I saw a man run out of the crowd, and very likely he was the man that robbed him: But however this prosecutor, by the persuasion of other people, thought proper to charge me. I never before this was in the walls of any prison, my name was never known to be amongst suspected persons, and I hope you will find me as innocent as I am conscious I am myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

S. G. I sent for a constable, the constable came, and between his thigh and his breeches, he took out four more tea spoons, and then he further searched him, and took out of his pocket a guinea, two six-pences, half a crown, and several halfpence, that is all we found on him, and several duplicates; the duplicate of the watch was found in his pocket the next day before the magistrate, he was a lodger, he lodged with another black man.</p>

(The watch deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to the house to get a pint of beer, and setting and drinking it, the other black man I sleep with, my bed fellow, asked me to go and pawn the watch at the pawnbroker's, he told me to ask three guineas, they said one guinea; I went back to tell him, and he told me to go and get the guinea, and I went and when I came back I gave him the guinea, and then he asked me to go and pawn the spoons, and I would not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these men talking together do you know? - I did not see them talking together; they came out of the house as near together as possibly could be; as soon as they heard the cry of stop thief they throwed down the things, and a witness that is here see them do it, and this man was never out of my sight till he was taken; I am sure I did not lose sight of the prisoner after he threw the things down from under his arm; he was brought back to my house, and from there he was taken to the New Compter; I saw him brought back to my house and I went with him to the Compter and things likewise, and the things were given into the hands of Mr. Prior; these two boxes contained all the articles; the things here are only the things that were in this paste board box, the other box has not been meddled with.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go back to your room after you took the prisoner? - In less than two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you conceive they got into the room? - They must pick both the locks; there is a lock which is fastened on the door, and a padlock outside; neither of the locks were broke, neither the one nor the other, and the lock, which was the padlock, was found behind some tubs close against the door, in the same stair case, the staples were not in the least injured they were all as when I went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This you say is your dwelling house; - I rent two rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down first in the morning and left your wife at home, you left the keys with her of course? - I never see any thing more of them till she brought them to me.</p>

               <p>Q. It is generally open? - It is in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if the indictment states that no person was in the dwelling house, it is not so. You know that you have indicted this man capitally? - I suppose it is for a capital offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever heard there was a reward for convicting a house breaker? - I have.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cutler and headborough in the parish of St. George's. On Saturday the 23d of February between two and three in the afternoon as I was going down Fleet-lane I saw some people running and I walked leisurely after them, they were running in a lane on the right hand called Sea Coal-lane, and I saw them stop, when I came near I saw a man holding the prisoner at the bar by the collar, somebody said, why do you collar the man? for he is no thief, and if he is you have no right for you are no constable; and he let go the prisoner and the prisoner ran off, and he ran down by me, and I pursued him, and took him in a Baker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Mansell present when you took him? - He was not in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100049"/>when I took him; when I took him in the shop I put my hand on his shoulder and told him he was my prisoner; several people came into the shop and one of them assisted me to take him to the Compter. There was two boxes laying in Sea Coal-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you never been here before? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps convicted your man before? - I convicted!</p>
               <p>Q. What was you here before for? - I have been here several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever a person convicted on your evidence? - I don't know it was on my evidence, but I was a party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear on conviction of a man for house breaking that there was a reward? - Since I found he was convicted I was told of it by a person in this court.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were some persons running up Sea Coal-lane? - Yes, the prisoner was one; I don't mean to say I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the good fortune to run into a shop, it was the likely way for him to escape? - He certainly could not see me till I took him in the shop; there he was secured; I secured him myself.</p>
               <p>- BASCOE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watch maker; I saw the prisoner come down with the box in his hand and another man with him, with another box; the prisoner had a bonnet box the other had a wooden box; they came down from the one pair of stairs of Mr. Mansell's dwelling about half after two; I saw him go down the steps with it in his hand, and the prosecutor was within three doors of his own house, he went in and went up stairs, and came down again and pursued after the man, and the prisoner threw the box away into Sea Coal-lane; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I did not see the prisoner taken; I saw him go by my window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp You had never seen the prisoner before? - Never.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I produce the property belonging to the prosecutor, a bonnet box, four gowns, a tea kettle, and several other things; this box was brought to me to the Compter; I had it of Mr. Mansell; when the box was brought there, there was a number of people present.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mansell. Did you see the prisoner run into the shop? - I did not, I saw him when the other man Hughes took him and brought him back to the things, but then he let him go, and then he was out of my sight, and Leclere took him; I never saw him no more after Hughes let him go till I saw him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is alledged to me I am totally innocent of. On Saturday afternoon I was coming down Sea Coal-lane, I had got a bad leg; I had been to have it dressed, and I saw two men pass me, and I saw a man throw a box off his shoulder, and the other from under his arm; with that I went to pick up one box out of the kennel, and they said, don't touch it for they will say you are the thief; I was going to alderman Boydell's and this man came and took me; I said, for what? I said I will go wherever you please; I went to the Compter, and then that Mansell came and the watch maker, and swore that I came out of the house; I am as innocent as any gentleman of the Jury.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>On Friday last the fifth of April, about a quarter before six o'clock I was sitting in the counting house by myself, I heard a disturbance in the warehouse, and I looked and I saw the prisoner taking something out of a box, which from the noise and situation I supposed to be nutmegs; the box was in the warehouse on the shelf; I saw him through the window out of the counting house, by which we have an opportunity of looking all over the warehouse; I opened the counting house door, and he immediately came from the place, and he took up an old bag, and I asked him what he wanted? he said, he wanted an apron; I immediately charged him with the theft of taking these nutmegs, and the acknowledged it, and I brought him to the counting house, and I took out of his right hand coat pocket fifty-nine nutmegs; this is all that passed at that time; I was at his apartment the same evening, (the prisoner was then in the Poultry Compter,) the prisoner's wife was there, we found some black lead pencils, cocoa, and several other articles; to the best of my recollection thirty-two black lead pencils and twenty-three others, we found some cocoa, the box had our label on it; we gave these things into the custody of the officer, his name is Hickens. I have no more to observe, except the manner in which he got into the house; I was told how he got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you told that in the prisoner's presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The place in which you sat, and in which you saw this was a place separated from the warehouse commanding a full view of it? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the prisoner must know that? - He must; when I charged him with taking the nutmegs he acknowledged that he had taken them illegally.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that Mr. Hodgson? did not he say that your porter had given him leave to take some at the usual price? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DICKENS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable that took the man, he was delivered to me about six o'clock last Friday evening, the day of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100051"/>Q. Was any nutmegs delivered to you? - Yes, and I have kept them ever since; I went to his apartments, he gave me directions to them; I found several articles; I found some pencils and some cocoa in a wooden box; I have kept them ever since. (Produced and deposed to by Mr. Blakey, the pencils as having the maker's name on them, who lives in Cumberland, and serving none but him, and the cocoa having his label on them.)</p>

               <p>I went with the officers to make the search.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things open or were they consealed? - They were not consealed when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Dickens. The wife unlocked the box and gave the things out of the box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the cocoa and paid for it to Mr. Porter the other partner, I bought two quarters of a pound and paid 16 d. for it, and every article that they found in my room, I honestly paid for as ever I did any thing in the world; as for the pencils I bought them of a Jew in November last, and as for the nutmegs Mr. Hodgson was in the house; I met Mr. Porter in Budge row and told him what I wanted; he told me to go and have them; our master's servant was at the door and desired me to walk in. I was taken bad last Saturday three weeks and was obliged to go to bed till Thursday following; I went again to my place the Monday after, and Mr. Porter called me into the counting house and said, he and I had better settle; says he, I don't understand your being off a week; I told him I was ill; then he said, I had better rest then come to do nothing; then says I, we met friends and I hope we shall part friends.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have three partners? - Yes, two besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand from my friend's opening just now, Mr. Knowlys, that you are considerable timber merchants, of course you have a great deal of timber of that sort, and I suppose all the timber that belongs to you are marked in the same way.</p>
               <p>Court. Not all marked A. W.? - No, only T. and L.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How soon is the mark of T. L. put in the timber that comes to you? - It is marked before it comes to us from the ship; there is also the mark of the feet it contains; the timber was put on the river; it was rafted on our wharf with ropes, and stapled down.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have missed a great quantity of timber before this; has it never happened to you that the timber has floated down the river, and you have found the timber again? - Yes, but we always can tell what timber we miss because of the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact have you never missed timber before which has gone away and floated down the river? - We very frequently have missed timber.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never missed timber by the casual floating of the raft? - We have from the bridge and other accidents; that is a common thing in trade; somebody picks it up and they are paid for their trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you an opportunity of knowing what quantity of timber you had on that raft? - This was a quantity of timber marked for a person with A. W. to go away the next morning, it lay under the crane subject to be floated.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the property, and what quantity had you seen? - The whole number of pieces was seen by me the night before on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were a great quantity besides the pieces that were missing floating? - No great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Only four pieces were missing in the morning? - No, only four pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they might have had the accident of floating down the river by the tide? - No, they could not, because the rope was cut and the breast rope was cut, they were evidently cut by an axe, the mark of an axe was plain on the rope.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the other pieces might have had an opportunity of floating from the cutting of these pieces? - They might have taken the whole to besure.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark A. W. is the mark to whom they were consigned, you did not put that mark yourself? - It was either me or my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to my friend, that you had missed timber ever since the 12th of January, and until the 28th of March you knew nothing at all about it? - We never found it till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it happened during that time that you missed a great quantity of your property, between the one date and the other? - No, we had not; I should have observed that there were some other pieces, but I cannot fully ascertain what they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. From the view which you had of the raft the morning after you supposed they had stolen them, you could not ascertain they could be taken any other way than by cutting the rope with the axe? - I could not.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman; I saw the prisoner at the bar in company with Mr. Needs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever employed by him or Needs to tow some timber? - I was by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100053"/>Needs, and that gentleman was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them gave you the directions? - I met them at the place where I took it to, both Mr. Needs and him together; I towed six pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first of all applied to you to tow it? - Needs, and that gentleman was in company with him; I towed it from a wharf that belongs to Reed, King's Arms stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is King's Arms stairs from Messrs. Letts, where these rafts were, from Narrow Wall Limehouse? - About a quarter of a mile. I towed this timber to Chelsea; when I got to Chelsea I saw both Needs and the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you paid for your trouble? - Yes, Needs paid me, Tristram was by.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you ask for your trouble? - I did not ask any see at all; I towed it to Gill and Wilson's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of these pieces of timber since that time? - Yes, I went and looked at them, I went to Mary-le-bone near Fitzroy-square, in a timber yard there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these were a part of the six pieces that you towed up? - I am not sure they are them, but they are marked the same way as those that I did take.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was this? - Five weeks to day since I towed it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Woodcraft, did you happen to know Needs before? - Yes, because I live just on the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. Needs employed you, Needs told you where to take it, Needs paid you; Mr. Woodcraft, did the prisoner during the whole time that he happened to be with Needs seem to have any hand in it at all? did he say any thing at all about it, during the whole time? - He asked me to have something to drink; the prisoner asked me to have some rum and milk.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you asked no see whatever? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been used to be employed by Needs? - No, never before nor since; he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. Needs you know is indicted for this very felony.</p>
               <p>Court. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was shewn some timber afterwards? - I don't understand you; I went into a carpenter's yard to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. And you of yourself had not made any particular observation on them to know them, only by the mark you saw on them? - I cannot pretend to swear they are the same, but they are marked the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did Tristram ask you to drink before or after you had done the job? - It was on the road.</p>
               <p>Court. How were the two marked you saw in the carpenter's yard? - A. W. I did not perceive any other mark; that was a fresh mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the timber which they applied to you to draw? - Yes, I have seen it since up in Fitzroy-square; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100054"/>nine or ten pieces there, I knew but one of them, and that piece of timber lay at my wharf before ever I took the premises, I bought the lease there, I took the premises the 17th of January; all that I know it by there is a cut in the side of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is a person of the name of Needs, do you know any thing of him? - I bought the lease of the premises of him, on the 17th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Needs has been looked after on this occasion? - Yes, I looked after him myself along with the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. He has absconded then? - He is out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You say a person of the name of Williams, or Kemp came with the prisoner? - It was not the prisoner applied to me to draw the timber, it was the man along with him, and gave me a paper where to draw it to, which I have now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before? - Yes, many times I have seen him.</p>

               <p>Q. And you in consequence of that went to the Wooden Bridge? - I did not the first time, the carriage went twice, I did not go with it the second time but the carriage was detained and I went to see what detained it, and I saw the carriage on the crane, I saw the carriage draw the timber from the wharf; Tristram he hired the carriage; he did not know the peoples name, but he described the place, and I told him it was Gill and Willson's wharf to which he agreed, and said, there should be people there before my carriage to load it; the timber was laid down against the wall of the Westminster Infirmary; I saw both loads laid down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of that timber since? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say he did not know where it was to be taken to till you explained it to him; all the business he had to do was to hire the cart? - He described the place by the Wooden Bridge, and I named the name of the wharf.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with this man at the bar? - Yes, he went along with me to take the contents of the timber brought on my premises, ten pieces, and five at another place, both he and Needs went with me, the other man said, this is my captain; he went along with us and I gave him the contents, and he pulled out a calender from his pocket and shewed me the price of timber the week before on the Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose timber was it represented to be Needs or the captains? - Their timber; it was brought there for sale; they had a good deal more they said to bring; I was taken there to become a purchaser if I approved of it; I saw different marks on it and I had suspicions.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Lett has ever seen these pieces of timber? - Yes, he has and challenged them; he challenged two on my premises and two in New Fitzroy-square.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Needs told me that he had sold the timber to Bold three weeks before that for 3 l. per load. On the Thursday or Friday he told me he had sold it for 3 l. 10 s. per load, and when I went there I thought they were all swindlers and shufflers together; accordingly I went to Mr. Climer's and called him up at six o'clock in the morning and gave him information against the timber, and told him I thought it was not honestly come by; Needs took some off his own wharf, and there were seven pieces taken from another wharf, and then he comes to me for fear of being arrested, but as soon as ever I found out I was among a parcel of shufflers I went immediately to Mr. Climer, and Mr. Climer to Mr. Smith, and then they took me to my Lord Mayor; then I was clear on the Saturday concerning all this timber of which I gave information to his Lordship.</p>

               <p>My husband is a shoemaker. On Wednesday morning the 13th of March, about eleven o'clock, I came from market and my husband came to me, I live in White-cross-street, about a mile from Leaden-hall-market; Poll, says he, they are cutting up leather next door; says he, Mrs. Jackson has been in and said so; I went and looked into a place called a hay lost, and I saw two of them cutting up leather; the prisoner was one, but who the other was I cannot tell, they were cutting up the leather into square pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in where they were? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so curious to look into their room? - Mrs. Jackson mentioning it to my husband and he mentioning it to me. I saw them afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100057"/>with some bundles, he went down past my window with a knot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a porter? - I cannot tell; I saw him with a knot and leather on his shoulder going down the court, Plaster-court, it is the court where I live, I live next door to this hay loft; he took the leather and carried it into Playhouse-yard, and put it into his cart, from that he went back again; I went to Arthur's, who had been a constable, and Mr. Foxon was in the place at the time, and I told them I thought there was a man in the court had got some stolen leather, and I went and shewed them where the cart was with the leather, and he stopped till the prisoner came with the rest of the leather, I stopped till he came, the constable then charged him with stealing the leather, and he was taken to Worship-street; I cannot positively swear to the leather.</p>

I pulled out my staff and said, I am an officer, I have an information that you have some stolen property; he said, he was going to take it to his master, Mr. Cox, in Chick-lane, and desired me to go to his master and then I should soon know whether it was stolen or no; I told him I should not go to his master, I should take him to the office in Worship-street and if it was his master's property he might send for him, and his master would come forward. (The leather produced and deposed to by Mr. Dyster having lost three hides, one out of a parcel of eight hides and two of a parcel of twenty two hides, and having seen them complete the night before; I know it by the hammer mark.)</p>
               <p>Court. Can you tell it to be your's by the hammer mark? - I can, one was tanned in Poulton in Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this hammer mark that is the officer's mark? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not more tanners in that district whom the officer marks with the same hammer mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you prove that to be a bit more your's than any other person's in the district? - None had been up from this place I suppose this three months, they only come up now and then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a bone jeweller by trade, and it is very slack; I porter in the morning; I had an order for a gross of diamond scutcheons the Tuesday before this happened; I made them and carried them home, and while I was gone this here parcel was brought to my place, bag and basket, by a knock at the door to know whether there was a porter lived there? my wife was laying in at the time; there was a woman who came to see her, and she asked her to stop and have a drop of caudle, and while she was there this here man came and my wife sent this woman to me, to the Three Mariners at Fore-street, for at the time the East India company's ships sail, Mr. Newbank, in Grub-street, kills for them, and I am a swabber, I wash the hogs down; my wife sent this woman to find me and before I went with her I found they were going to kill on the Thursday following, and I asked the woman to come back to my wife and I gave her 2 s. to take to her, and told her to tell my wife I would come back as soon as I could, when I came home it was too late to carry them that night, and I went and took it in the morning; the woman can tell more about it than I can.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any body left in the house that day excepting yourself? - No, nobody; I left the house about half an hour after, about one, while I went to Church, and when I came home, I returned about five; I left the house safe; I locked the door, I left nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rest of the house fast? - There was a garret window that any body might get in at; all the rest of the house was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the garret window left open? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the house safe when you returned at five o'clock in the afternoon? - To all appearance it was the same as when I left it,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the house again after five o'clock? - I shut the window and made them fast as I thought; I made it fast then for the evening, and I left the house immediately; I think I double locked the street door, but I will not be positive, but I am sure it was locked; it is a spring lock; I cannot be positive whether I turned the key again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house was it light or dark out of doors? - It was quite light; I had just come from Church; I returned home again about half past seven or eight o'clock; as soon as I opened the door there was a great deal of linen all laying in the passage, when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100059"/>saw the linen lay in the passage I was frightened, I stepped back again and pulled the door to back after me; there was no linen laying about the passage when I left the house for I had locked up that linen; seeing this I went to my mistress and informed her what I had seen; she was lower down at the end of the Cross-street, she sent the servant man of the house where she was at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return before your mistress saw the house? - I did; but I did not go in at the first, I stopped at the door till they searched the house; the servant man is not here, he is in Wales now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how the house was when you went in? - I observed the cellar door open, I thought the thieves might be in the cellar, therefore I desired the people to go in because I dare not go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how you found the house when you did go in? - The chests of drawers had been broke open and the wardrobe; the wardrobe and the chests of drawers joined together.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you returned and saw the drawers in this state, had you seen them before? - I had seen them before I went out the first time; it was safe and in a good state then; I locked them up and gave the keys to my mistress before she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all find how the persons had got into the house? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the windows and doors, and so on? - Them that went in did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations yourself? - I could not at all in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. No marks of violence about the house? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>I live in Church-street, No. 3, Islington, near Mrs. Harrison's, it is this side of the Church-yard, Mrs. Harrison's is the other side; I remember the Sunday when Mrs. Harrison's house was said to be robbed; I saw Mrs. Harrison's house the evening of that day; I saw three men come out of the house, this was about seven o'clock; it was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamps near Mrs. Harrison's house? - Yes, they were lighted at that time; they came out of the front door; I was about three yards from them when they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to see the faces of the men? - Yes, and one of the three I knew, the last who came out, I knew his name, I had seen him before a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him well? - I remember seeing him about the street, and at Parr's Head, the publick house facing Mrs. Harrison's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man? - That man, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you full opportunity of seeing his face? - I had; I am sure he is one of the three.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of seeing his face? - By the light of a lamp the lamp is at the corner of Mrs. Harrison's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you saw him coming from the house or saw him come out? - I saw him come out of the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that he is one of the three? - I know he is one of the three.</p>
               <p>Court. Were either of these three men stopped, or did you give any alarm? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100060"/>Q. How soon did the servant maid come home after you saw these men come out? - I don't know; I did not see her come home.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out did they shut the door after them? - Yes, this man pulled the door after him; I thought he put his finger into the key hole and pulled it that way, but I cannot be certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give any account of this matter? - A servant girl who had lived at Mrs. Harrison's before, came over to me; I had told my mistress, and my mistress told that girl, and Mrs. Harrison came over to me the next day about eleven in the morning, and she asked me if I knew any of them that had done it? - I told her I did; I did not mention his name to her then, but I did before I went to Hatton-garden the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that he is the person? - I know he is the man that I saw come last out, I have no doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to know what she saw me in? - A frock brown coat, I think he had a dark brown coat, a darker than the one he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. What hat had the man on? - A round hat, I was coming across the way, but if I had not known him before I could not have sworn to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you challenge him first? - I did, I saw him at Parr's head, he sent for me over, and told me he wanted to speak about this robbery and he wished to go over to Mrs. Harrison's, and I went over with him to Mrs. Harrison's; the prisoner said to her that he was sorry that she should have any suspicion of him, Mrs. Harrison said she did not suspect him nor any body else in particular; then he went back again to the Parr's head, the servant was there at Mrs. Harrison's Mrs. Harrison's servant not Ann Doudle.</p>

               <p>Q. How came she before the magistrate? - I fetched her, because I met with her mother on Sunday evening and on what the mother told me I thought it was proper she should go before the justice as well as the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what passed when she came? - My mistress told her that she was informed that she was with the girl when she saw these men come out of the house, and my mistress said she only desired her to speak the truth and nothing but the truth; and if she saw the man come out she desired her to speak it, if not she did not desire her to speak it; and the girl was very impudent, and I don't think my mistress recollected what she was about, she was confused and very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever tell her in pointed terms what Stone said she said? - No, she did not; she told her them that took a false oath deserved to be hanged.</p>

Williams's Reports, and Capel Loft's Law of Evidence; the Pocket Book was printed in demy, there was 1100 sheets of that in the same shop, I took it away and brought it to my master's shop; it has been in my custody ever since, it is in a clean state. I went afterwards to Mr. Edwards's shop and took the boy with me, about ten minutes after; the boy lives the next door or the next door but one, Edwards came out of the back parlour when the boy came into the shop, he said that is the boy I bought the paper of, the boy did not say any thing, but cried, he did not deny it.</p>

            ; they were at this time printing the Attorney's Pocket Book, Gilbert's Law of Evidence, edited by Capel Loft, and P. Williams's Reports; I live in the house of which the warehouse is apart; I have lived there this twenty-five years. It is the custom of the trade for those persons who are interested in a work to send in their own paper for the law printers to print.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that been the case with respect to the things in charge? - It had.</p>
               <p>Q. If that paper is lost Messrs. Strahan and Woodfall are answerable for it? - They are answerable both for paper and print. In consequence of some information I had from Bennet, I took the boy to the public office in Bow-street; after that he was discharged in the morning, the boy went home, and came back again, and the warehouseman found other things were missing, besides the Attorney's Pocket Book; we missed some of P. Williams's Reports, we did not know any of Loft's Law of Evidence were missing, till we found it in Edward's shop, and then we went and looked, and found that just that quantity was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find that the quantity you discovered at Edwards's shop exactly made up the quantity missing? - No, some of P. Williams's Reports are still missing; but Gilbert's Law of Evidence exactly made up what was missing. I took the boy in consequence of that transaction to Edwards's shop, and Bennet went with me; I told him it was my property, and asked Mr. Edwards how he came by it? he said, he bought it of that boy; I asked him what he gave a pound for it?</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lad deny that assertion of Edwards's? - No, not in the least, the boy began to cry very bitterly, and was very sorry for what he had done; I asked him what could induce him? he said, he wanted to lay by a little money for the Easter holidays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time even subsequent to that deny that he was the boy that brought it and sold it afterwards? - Never, I took the lad again to Bow-street, at six o'clock that same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether his examination was taken in writing or not? - They took some writing of the boy's declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to the boy giving him hopes of favour, if he made such a declaration? - No, except in the morning the warehouseman did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the boy sign that declaration? - He was brought forward to the table but the Court was so full I cannot say that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wilkinson told me if I would confess, they would not hurt me; if not they would send me to Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilkinson. What became of the paper that was at Edwards's shop? - It was taken away; it was work that has never been in trade and could not by any means get from the warehouse, except from our shop.</p>

               <p>I was robbed of my watch the 1st of April 1791, I saw it again on the 6th of March last 1793; I saw it at the Fountain in Shire-lane, Mr. Rymer had it in possession then; he said he bought it of one John Green, and gave four guineas for it; I swear that is my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you sure you was sober enough to know at the time whether you lost it or whether it was picked out of your pocket? - I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you feel it go out of you pocket? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>This watch I had of Mr. Green about three weeks before Christmas; he gave it me to dispose of in a public manner, I advanced a trifle on it, ten and six pence, and six and six pence; after I had it in my possession about a couple of months I told him I could not sell it, if he would give up the money I had let him have, I would give him the watch; but he said it did not suit him to pay it, so I paid him four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe the prisoner gave you this watch, that you might exhibit it in a public raffle? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to shew it to every body who might wish to see it? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a man who bears a better character than Green? - I never heard any body give him a bad one.</p>

The officer is here who took them. (The things produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on Mr. Phillips's house? - I told my brother the window was open, and I discovered a man standing at a little distance from the window; the words that I made use of were, that there was a man standing there, and I thought it proper to knock at the door; my brother asked me if I knew any part of the family, I had no knowledge of any part of the family, my brother attempted to go up to the door, and the door opened at the time, a man came out and pulled the door after him by the knocker of the door; I cannot tell the person of the man, my fright was so great; the man ran down John-street into Charles-street, I did not pursue with my brother, my brother cried stop thief, and I expressed the same words, and returned to Mr. Phillips's door and knocked.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your son's name is Jeremiah as well as your's? - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this key of the wine cellar kept? - It was hanging up with the other on a nail in the shop</p>
               <p>Q. So that any body going into the shop might take the key and have access to the cellar? - Nobody, but myself and son went there.</p>
               <p>Q. She might have got to the cellar, and got brandy for your son without your consent; Did you never hear that she got brandy for your son? - She said at Bow-street, that my son was accessary to her robbing me, and Justice Bond said, that that was worse than the robbery itself.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had she lived with you? - Five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she conducted herself fairly? - I cannot mention any thing, but what is in the indictment, or else I could say a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman or a widow? - When she came to me, she said, she was a married woman, but I find it is no such thing; she had a child by a man she lived with.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time was it affixed to the wall? - It was not; it had been taken off before I went on the premises; it was kept in the house on the back room one pair of stairs, which formerly had been made use of as a kitchen; I had some men at work there, Cook and Godsell, and several more; the two prisoners were employed about this house, one as bricklayer and the other as a bricklayer's labourer, Donnivall was the <rs id="t17930410-62-deflabel341" type="occupation">bricklayer</rs>

               <p>Q. Was any of this lead found? - Yes, I saw it found after I had given the two prisoners in custody of an officer; he told me it would be unnecessary for us to attend because there was not a sitting alderman at that time, and he would let us know; accordingly Mr. Hollis and I went over every room in the building and searched in the cellar, at last Mr. Hollis taking up a shovel, there was a large portion of screened rubbish and a heap of mortar, he takes up the shovel and stuck it into the lead; I then went round and saw him dig a second time and I believe there was six or seven pieces we found in the mortar and screened rubbish.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you able to determine whether that lead constituted any part of the cistern? - Clearly so, because we put it together and matched it, there was as much as weighed five hundred and a half and eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh it at the time? - Yes, instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value? - Five pounds; I think there was at least five hundred pounds weight of it gone besides.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. You say the man instantly pointed at the two prisoners as those that got over the wall the night before? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect them to be dishonest before? - I don't wish to affect the prisoners any thing more than merely to do common justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any grounds for suspicion before? - Yes, by losing property at various times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suspect Donnivall? - I will tell you candidly what my reason was, they never knew my time of coming into the buildings, and I have seen that man several times flipping of something behind some part of the premises.</p>
               <p>Court. You had suspicion of these people from their conduct and your losing property? - I had.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Reece, his back yard looks into this back yard of Mr. Wetherall's; about seven o'clock this evening two men were found in the yard I went in and saw them, I asked them how they came there? the further man, Connor, told me, says he, to tell you the truth I fell asleep, and the other man, Donnivall, gave the same account; I dare say they were with me in the yard near five minutes; I have not the least doubt but they are the men, I have no doubt of either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them again after this transaction? - Mr. Wilson desired me to look at them the next day, and I was very certain they are the two men I saw the preceeding evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. When you went the next morning to see these men how were they dressed? - They were dressed the same as in the evening, Donnivall had on a drab coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire they should be dressed in their long clothes before you could identify them? - No such thing at all.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Reece. On the 19th of March the door bell rang, of course I went to answer the bell, there was a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100079"/>followed me down I asked him if he came from the counting house? he did not make me any reply, in short I let him out of the gateway, he went on the pavement, he did not give me a satisfactory answer I desired him to come back again, it was the man in the blue coat at the bar, Donnivall, there was another within, in the yard, Connor, I went up to him and asked how he came there? and desired him to give an account of himself; he said, he was double locked in by the carpenters in the other court, and that in order to get out they took that convenience by which means they thought they could get out, the other man said but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these are the two men? - I do believe they are I see them there afterwards in the building opposite, where they worked the next morning, the master carpenter and the master bricklayer came to me. I believe they are the two men that were in the yard the night before: I am pretty well positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they attend together that night? - Somewhere about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel Did you go the next morning into Mr. Wilson's yard to identify these men? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How where they dressed? - They had got their coats off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire that they should put on their coats before you could identify them? - The right hand man was desired to put on his coat and it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what coloured clothes all the workmen wear? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the situation of the place where Mr. Wilson is working? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say from their faces you believe them to be the men, and when their dress was produced it likewise corresponded.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel to Wilson. If these people were in a mind to commit a robberry in this house might they not easier get out at the door, that being only a spring lock, than by coming over this Wall? No, it was impossible to get out at the door because the spring lock was double locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Donnivall. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Connor. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Burberry. What was the hour? - Rather after seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Donnivall called eight witnesses, and Connor two who gave them good characters.</p>

On the 21st of march I sent him to attend a lady in Queen-square with a variety of goods, and amongst other things a card of lace which I borrowed of a brother tradesman; he informed me when he returned that he sold goods to the lady to the value of 1 l. 4 s. and three yards of edging in part amongst other goods, of that which I had borrowed; I desired him to take this piece of blown edging to the gentleman whom I borrowed it of, informing him the quantity that they cut off; when he came back, he informed me that they mentioned there was three yards and a half gone of the lace; I asked him how that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100080"/>could be? his answer was that he did not shew the blown to the lady himself, but he sent it up stairs, and she cut it off herself; after that I desired him to return to the lady and tell her that he believed there was a mistake, as there were three yards and a half gone instead of the three yards which she paid for; he went out apparently as going to the lady, and returned bringing me 2 s. 3 d. for the half yard of the blown, saying, at the same time, that the lady was very sorry, and did not mean to hurt me; I was not satisfied with the account, and I went to the lady that evening, I received a note from the lady's maid that the bill came to 1 l. 12 s. I then took the prisoner up stairs and told him I was sure that he had injured me, and insisted on knowing the contents of his box; on his opening his box I found a variety of different goods, my property, as stated in the indictment; immediately as I found these things on him I desired a servant maid to go down stairs and send a lad for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you with absolute certainty speak to these goods? - There is my own private mark on the muslin, and the whole goods are in my line; the prisoner acknowledged before the constable they were my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you any body interested in this business besides yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had this young lad come to you from Mr. Cary's? - He did, I had a very good character with him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he is the youngest of eleven children of parents in the country he has been very decently brought up? - He was, as I understand.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you? - One month; he is sixteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you ever permit this custom that your servants do occasionaly take goods out of your shop and account with you for the value of them? - I do not.</p>

            , the man at the bar, he says you have robbed this coach or this gentleman I will not be positive which, were the words; he called for assistance, and I caught him by the leg; I heard some thing drop to the ground, we secured him, and got his hand fast; I called for a light, and picked up a pistol loaded and cocked. I live about a quarter of a mile from the back of Chelsea College; the prisoner said it was distress that drove him to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Maslin. How came you not to tell me this part of the story? - I was coming down King's Road, and I jumped off my box, I was setting down one passenger there, the person that robbed the coach went forward, and I got up to him, and I got off my box and I seized him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the person you seized? - I have a little doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to jump off your coach? - I had a strong suspicion; if you put me to my oath, I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. How dare you to want to suppress this case in this manner; have you been with him in gaol? - No, I have never seen him till this present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the pistol was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it is a great piece of prevarication, as to the first instance of my being taken. I was taken at a distance off almost a quarter of a mile; no property found, the prosecutor said it was so dark he could not rightly tell a man from a woman; in my commitment it is eight shillings that he lost, now he swears to an half crown piece; and now the coachman first swears to one evidence and afterwards to another; I was taken to the watch-house, and then this man comes up and says that is the man, before that one of the evidence that is come against me says, that he was asked to stop by another; the man then looks at me a second time, why was not that other man as likely to drop the pistol as me.</p>
               <p>Court to Pilkington. Was there any body else apprehended on this charge? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was partly examined; I can tell more, it is as much for the prisoner, as it is against him, alluding to what he has said, there was a person of the name of Hoggs who said the prisoner attempted to rob him on the side of Battle-bridge, so as the prisoner at the bar came by, he said that is the man; and I said let me have your horse and I will follow him, let him go where he will; Mr. Pilkington was present when he was searched.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. If any person for instance had come pretty near you at that time there would have been day light enough to have distinguished the features of his face? - The lights of the square was sufficient for that.</p>

(The stockings deposed to by Mr. Bagshaw having such in the shop, and by the eylet holes.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You said there were only three pair you missed? - The two pair of womens stockings are two of the three pair that I missed; I did not know that I lost any of the small kind.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go to Mr. Heather's? - She sent for me on Sunday evening, and I found her in Covent-garden watch-house, she was full of contrition, when I saw her she voluntarily confessed that she had taken the stockings, and she begged I would be merciful, I promised I would not aggravate the circumstances, and I would be as favourable as possibly I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her before she confessed that you would be favourable to her? - She confessed to me before I said any thing.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor and three more gave her a good character, and observed that she was week in her intellects.</p>

               <p>I am a coach-maker, a journeyman; my master's name is Parker, we had a shop down the Mews, where we work. On the 14th of March, between the hours of ten and eleven, I was at work at that time, and I thought I heard the voice of two people that I knew, which occasioned me to look out, and I see two men come down the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what these men said? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what became of then? - I did not, they came down the court, I rather thought they were at no good; I still kept looking out of window, and I saw them come up again, one stood by the public house door, and one came up again, and I heard something down the Mews, like a wrench when the other man was standing at the public house back door, I saw the other man go down by himself towards this stable, when he came back again, he had something in his hand; I cannot justly say what; they walked from thence from the public house again, to a court there, they stood, and I heard the ring of an iron implement; I saw them come back again, and they stopped at the Three Tuns back door, and there they told over some halfpence, and then they went down the court, and when they came out there again; I went down to give an alarm at the public house, that I thought there were some suspicious persons gone down the court, and Mrs. White's coachman was there, and he came out, and the prisoner and another burst out from the stable. I am sure the prisoner is one that rushed out, there was nobody else there, the other man turned the corner, but the prisoner at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100090"/>the bar ran straight forward, and I ran after him, and never lost sight of him, but took him, and delivered him to the patrole, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q Did you go back with the last witness to the stable? - I went back after he was there; I went in, and I saw the staple laying at the stable door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear a staple missing at the door? - Yes, there was one missing, and that staple I found close by the door, I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you see the hat and shirt? - I saw the hat and shirt, and some other things lay at the horses heels close to the stable door.</p>
               <p>Garnett. I observed this staple on the ground, there was a staple to the door, when I left the stable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>I was servant to the prisoner White. On the 12th of January, Mr. White and I went down the stable and put the horse into the cart, about four o'clock in the afternoon by Mr. White's order, we went directly out to Paddington towards Pinner Chapel; we came to the public house the Swan on the Pinner-road; there Lamb and Hughes joined us, and from there we went towards Harrow, and went through Harrow; and we went into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100092"/>field to a hay rick, and there we laid down for the course of two or three hours, I cannot say which; we came out from there and went to Pinner, and there we helped up one another to the top of the Church, and there we cut the lead, Hughes cut the most of it, and me and White rolled up the best part of it the other man was looking out most of the time; I believe he fetched down one piece; I cannot say whether he fetched down more or not; we brought it from the church, and went and fetched the horse and cart, within one hundred yards of the church, and there the cart was backed, and we put the lead in, and brought it to town, and came to town about ten o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Middleton. Look at the witness? - He is the man that came first with the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Worth. Did you all four come to town together? - At Paddington Hughes left us and went on before the cart on the foot path.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen as you came to town? - No, nothing; I drove the cart, and Mr. White walked and paid the turnpikes, from Paddington to Blenheim Mews, where the horse and cart stands; when we came to Blenheim Mews we took the horse out of the cart and put the horse up there. We took up some geese at Paddington and brought them to town, we drove the three geese from the Pond; we plucked and dressed one for Sunday's dinner, and we left two unplucked.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the lead the next day? - White and I drove the cart down to Baker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you ever been in this court before? - No, only as a witness, that was when I was thirteen years old.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he bring the lead? - In the cart; there was six or seven hundred weight, I cannot say particularly; my brother bought it, I weighed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you ever see the prisoner before in your life? - Yes, several times.</p>

               <p>Court to Smart. Do you know whether the lead fitted? - No, the lead was sold; we could not obtain any lead.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Cox's house? - Mr. Cox lives a good way off in Parker's-lane; the prisoner at the bar is one of the men that was shoving the caravan along; I have known him four or five years, he works sometimes in Drury-lane at Mr. Lucas's and goes with a Jack ass; he does any thing.</p>

               <p>I let ready furnished rooms; the prisoner came to me on Monday the 31st of December last; the man asked me for a ready furnished room; I told him I had got one; he asked if he might see it? I told him I was very particular who I took in; I asked him what he was and where he came from? he said, I might have his character and he should not want the room till the day following, he agreed with me for the room at half a crown per week; he came on Monday night instead of the Tuesday and asked me for the key of the room for he had brought his wife out of the country and he had no lodging for his wife; I let him have the key; after I had let him have the key he brought in several articles, as wood, &amp;c. when his wife came I objected taking her in; if that is your wife, say I to him, I believe her to be a bad woman; says he, she is my wife, I was married three months ago at Cripplegate Church; I did not like to take her in, says he, I have taken the room and possession is nine points of the law, you may enquire my character to-morrow; he paid me exceedingly well till the 27th of February; on the 27th of February I suspected the prisoner having taken something out of the room; I went into the room and found a sheet, blanket and bolster missing, that was in his care; I examined the bed, and found a great quantity of feathers out of it; the bolster that was left had been a very full bolster and almost all the feathers were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the feathers? - They were entirely taken away; the prisoner I had got into custody, at the same time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100099"/>I found his wife had left him; I asked him for the things; he said, I should have all the things presently; he gave me a duplicate of the sheet, and gave me a direction to his wife where she was; I went and fetched her to my wife; then afterwards we took her to the pawnbroker's where the things were, I found feathers, and have got them here.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he brought in some articles, what were they? A little table I believe and some wood.</p>

               <p>I have got the skewer, I got it of the boy, he offered it for sale yesterday afternoon at four o'clock; I asked him how he came by it? he said, a servant gave it him for four shillings he owed him; I said it was not at all likely, you must either tell me how he came by it or go before the justice; when he got into the street there was a boy an acquaintance, and he said that boy picked it up; that boy ran away, I secured him and took him to the justice; we found that it was Lady Burgoyne's.</p>

               <p>Harper. I saw him come into the kitchen between eleven and twelve, as much as I can tell, yesterday, with charcoal and salt, and other articles that we had ordered from his master's; he did not stop above two or three minutes the farthest, I was in the kitchen and my lady and the governess, my lady was writing a bill of fare out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skewer in such a part of the kitchen as he could get at it? - Yes, he put the salt very near where the skewer was hanging on the dresser.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was in Lady Burgoyne's kitchen at past eight o'clock for my master, and I had a sand sack in my basket, and I was in a great hurry, my master told me to make haste home again; I catched up my sand sack in a hurry and put it into my basket, and put it on my shoulder and came home again, and when I had sawed about half a dozen sticks several of these pieces of wood tumbled on this basket, and when I came to take the sack out of this basket these two pieces of a skewer dropped out of them.</p>
               <p>Court to Harper. How long have you lived with lady Burgoyne? - About fourteen months. This boy came almost every day with things since Lady Burgoyne came to town.</p>

On the 28th of March last I suspected Matthew Lowthorp; I saw him after the usual time of leaving work in the laboratory, between the hours of eight and nine, his usual time was eight o'clock, which gave me a suspicion; I walked up the laboratory, and turning myself about I saw a bag laying containing something that I did not know what it was, on an hamper of dirty bottles, I immediately went to this bag and I put my hand on it and I found it contained something very hard, and I immediately went into the shop to one of the journeymen and desired him to see

             if he brought any thing out; I had no sooner spoke these words than I saw the prisoner light a candle, he was in the laboratory, I saw him take this bag containing the bees wax under one arm, and took a lighted candle to go up a one pair of stairs, and at the top of that one pair of stairs, there was a communication to another pair of stairs which belongs to the dwelling house of my master in Old Fish-street.</p>
               <p>Q Was he used to go down that way when he left work? - No, that door was very seldom used on any occasion, that second stair case led to a warehouse, and the dwelling house was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say here is a communication from one house to the other that was by a door way that was broke through? - It was in order for a communication.</p>
               <p>Court. When he got up one pair of stairs, was it there you found him? - I found him with the door partly open that opens into the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There are two houses in Fish-street? - There are.</p>
               <p>Q. And there is a communication to both these houses backward, but they both open into Fish-street? - It is so, there are No. 10 and No. 11, one the private door and the other the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs, what did you do? - I took a broom in my hand and went out into the street by the shop door, then I saw a light over the door, the private door in Old Fish-street, and I steps to that door, and I heard the chain let down, and I heard the bolt go back; then I saw the prisoner with his head partly out to see if the coast was clear; I immediately went up to the prisoner and asked him what he had got in that bag? the prisoner was then in the passage, he was not willing to let me see it, I told him I would see it, I insisted upon seeing what he had,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100104"/>and I got the bag from him and shut the door; then the prisoner takes me fast round the middle and desired me not to say any thing to Mr. Horner as he was a married man, he said, he would give me any thing not to say any thing concerning of the wax, but I told him I would not see my master robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any conversation passed between you what was contained in the bag before that? - No, I got it from him and I took it up to the place near where he took if from and laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise that you would not say any thing about it? - No, I did not; I then took it into the parlour with intent to shew it to Mr. Horner, but I found he was not at home; then I took it from there to the kitchen and let it remain there till my master came home; I opened it to see what was in it, there were seven pieces of bees wax; he desired me not to mention it to Mr Horner; I told him I would not hide it from my master, I would shew it him immediately as he came home, then the prisoner went home to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take him then? - I did not know what was best to do with him; he was taken up on Saturday, after this happened on the Thursday before Good Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to his lodgings? - I did not</p>
               <p>Q At the time you got into the passage, after you saw the prisoner at the door, was any body else with you in the passage? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had you lived with your master at the time this happened? - Six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had not lived perhaps so long? - Yes, he had lived three years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Till you came into the family was there any complaint made of his conduct? - I never heard of any.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me servants do not always agree together. Had not you had repeated quarrels with this man? - We all of us had a few words together, and I had a few words with him, but not to bear any malice, it was concerning some glass that he sold and took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. He would not allow the perquisites that you claimed? - I don't know what perquisites I did claim any more than we wanted the money divided among us, that the glass was sold for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you claim the produce of that glass as a perquisite? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You quarrelled with that man that he would not allow it you, you never thought to tell this gentleman that? - That gentleman never asked me.</p>
               <p>Q Pray how long before you found out this man's dishonesty was this quarrel? - It all happened on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q You was wonderfully acute in finding out the dishonesty of this man? - Why should that make any difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that moment you was determined to spy out whether he was an honest man or not. How came you to put yourself in the way to spy out your master was robbed? - I could not help seeing it.</p>
               <p>Q You told my friend that you suspected him, and therefore you went on purpose to observe him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could have helped seeing, could not you, if you had not been purposely on the watch for this man you would not have seen it? - I was not purposely on the watch for this man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that you went purposely to observe him, and now you say you did not go purposely to observe him? - It was after his usual time of leaving work.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer. As it was after the hours of work you would not have suspected that he was there except you had gone purposely to watch him? - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100105"/>Q. Do you mean to swear that you did not go purposely to watch him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any business in the laboratory? - I had business to put my hat and lay down my knot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the laboratory is the place where you put your hat and your knot? - Sometimes I have put my hat and knot there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us what business you had there? - If you must know, I went back to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went back to make water in your masters laboratory; after this don't tell us where your masters shop is, for we shall not like any thing that comes out of your masters laboratory; then the reason you first gave is not true, for you went there to make water? - Yes, sir, and put my hat and knot down too.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we are to understand you, that putting down your hat and knot is a preface to making water. This young man he acknowledged that he stole the bees wax; for God's sake, he said, don't tell your master; you was examined before the sitting alderman on Saturday? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you mention a single circumstance of that man's clinging round you? - No, I did not, I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. The magistrate he knew nothing at all about this business, he told you to tell your story? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to tell me then that when you was asked to tell your story you did not tell the magistrate he used those expressions which implies guilt so strongly; upon your oath did you mention a word of that before the magistrate? - No, it was not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you must think it was very extraordinary that he should crave mercy of you? - He offered me any sum of money</p>
               <p>Q That you omitted to tell the magistrate also? - It was not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you never thought of detaining this man? - I did think of detaining him, but I did not know whether I had best let him go or detain him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire him to stop? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man there he stayed in his lodgings, to be taken, from Thursday night till Saturday? - Because he thought Mr. Horner would look over it.</p>
               <p>Q. And so he was taken on Saturday in his own lodgings; did not you say before the magistrate that he dropped the bag at the door that goes from the house into the warehouse? - There is a warehouse at the top of these stairs; I swore before the magistrate that he dropped it at the door in Fish-street.</p>
               <p>Q. This man's work is in the laboratory? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. This bees wax is of a nice quality? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of a good quality for making ointments.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of March, Thursday, I was in the prosecutor's shop, between eight and nine in the evening; I heard a noise and I went to the bottom of the stairs, which stairs lead to the warehouse on the same floor with the laboratory and shop; the first word that I heard was

             took the bag up stairs into the parlour, determined to shew it to the prosecutor as soon as he came home, he was followed by the prisoner into the parlour directly, I followed the prisoner likewise into the parlour, the words that I heard the prisoner make use of, to the best of my recollection were, that he begged he would make no noise about it to Mr. Horner, but let it drop, I had said nothing to the prisoner.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100106"/>Q. Had Cox said any thing to him in the parlour before that? - I don't recollect that he did. The wax then was conveyed from the parlour into the kitchen by Thomas Cox; Thomas Cox took out the cakes of wax from the bag while I and the prisoner was present, and the prisoner at that time urged him very much not to mention it to the prosecutor, but let it drop, the prisoner stayed a short time in the kitchen and then went home, he was apprehended afterwards, I was not present, I was present before the magistrate, and he put down in writing what the prisoner said, which I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose property it was? - I cannot swear to the property, we had two kinds of wax in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man had got into ill bread about these perquisites of broken bottles? - There was a quarrel about the broken bottles; I understood that the money was to be devided that the broken bottles fetched; we did quarrel that day.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the man that made up the medicines? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. He had liberty to take the wax from the warehouse? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect your master complaining about the inferior wax having got its way into the ointment? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man was urgent? - He said to Cox, do not talk about such nonsense.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before the magistrate on Saturday? - I was examined by the clerk, but not by the alderman himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the alderman mention any expressions of that sort, that you said the prisoner used to Cox, such as desiring him not to tell his master? - To the best of my recollection I mentioned as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the examination was read over to you, because there I find that it is, that you was at the top of the stairs when you heard this conversation? - I said to the clerk that it was the bottom of the stairs; I cannot swear to the property, I never said that I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My learned friend has been asking you about the perquisite; what do you mean by these perquisites? - When any large quantiy of broken glass is collected together we usually have a share of it; the prisoner at the bar he did not wish to divide the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this glass worth think you? - Some tifle or another.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to take particular notice of this piece of wax? - Being a fine piece, and at that time I found it, it was not heavy enough for what I wanted; I had seen it two or three days before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I lived a servant in this place three years and two months; the first fourteen months I was employed as a workman; I had always the priviledge of making up every article that was wanted in the way of ointments at home, and to take what wax I thought proper for that purpose. On the 27th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went into the cellar to see what ointments were wanting, we wanted green elder ointments, and yellow basilicon; I went to see if we had any good wax in the house, I saw we had some very good, I wanted twenty pounds and twelve pounds; and the next day being Good Friday, it was not in my power to make it in the warehouse that week, for fear it should be made use of in the warehouse, that week, I wished to carry it into the next cellar, and consequently I took it down stairs and opened the latch of the door, and

             rushed in to me and took hold of me, used many infamous words to me, calling me such names as an infamous bitch, and that she had been better than a mother to me, and turning about asked me where the white headed buggar of a husband was? she said, she would take him to the watch-house; I being much frightened I left the room; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is the shop where our servants and apprentices get rid of their money, and sometimes come to the gallows for robbing their masters. Pray how often has it happened to you that you and your office has been invested by people that have come to look after persons offending against the Lottery Act? - Mrs. Parsons had received money of my husband before.</p>
               <p>Q How often had the officers of justice been in your house to take persons offending against the Vagrant Act? - They never were since I was in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. What you locked them out? - I don't know they have ever been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your house so constructed as to prevent the officers from visiting you? - There is a middle door.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell me how I was to get in if I wanted to make insurance? - I don't know any particular manner, there are people at the first door to open the door; they do not report to me nor to my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there are persons stationed at that middle door to let proper persons in? - I should suppose that they let in people that we know without any enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would let in that gentleman Mr. Wood? - I saw Mr. Wood at Bow-street, but I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not persons stationed there to prevent persons from getting in who are likely to inform against you? It is to prevent informations? - I cannot answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Maid servants and apprentices, and unwary people are let in without the least difficulty? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen the conduct of that office? - I am in my parlour always; I do not go below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at Bow-street that you knew at that time they were executing illegal insurances, illegal transactions in your house? - I knew it was illegal transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Foley first of all took hold of Sykes. Upon your oath did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100109"/>Sykes withdraw with you and say we must give them money? - Sykes did say they must have money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not Sykes tell you that they must have money to prevent them from going to goal? - They did not tell me what they came for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Sykes tell you these people must have money, or they must go to the watch-house? - I don't know for I did not know what these people were come upon; I had never seen Foley nor Mattingby before, and Mrs. Parsons was not in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Sykes asked the money of you to prevent them from going to the watch-house? - I know it now, I did not know at the time, I did not know at the time but Sykes was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the gentlemen jump out of the window because he would not be taken</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you give this money, not from the terror of this bludgeon, but to prevent the men from going to the watch-house? - At the time that they had their bludgeons over the men I gave the money to save the men from going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now look at these policies, look at them and tell me what name they have on them first? -

            , he is nephew to the prisoner at the bar; I followed him into Thames-street from the water side, and I went to the head of him and I said, where are you going with this? after we had taken this man to the watch-house we went back again, and we met this man, the prisoner, and another in Thames-street with a plank on their shoulders, one at each end, the two men carrying one plank; Mr. Coopey's man was the first on the road; I asked him where are you going with this? he said, he did not know; says he, I don't know nothing at all about the matter, there is my master at the other end of the plank.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the prisoner hear what the ohter man said? - There is no doubt of it, the plank was about twenty feet long; I went to Mr. Coopey, the prisoner at the bar, at the other end, and said, where have you had this from? he rather hesitated, and at last he said he had it from the water side; I asked him whose it was? he said he did not know; I asked him if it was his property? he said, that somebody had been with him and he had them to cut up, and he was taking them home, I asked who ordered him to take them home; he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Wainwright, mind what you are speaking of, I did not hesitate.</p>
               <p>Wainwright. I asked him if he knew who owned them? he said, he could not tell; then says I, don't you know who employed you? says I, you must drop it and go along with me; I took him to the watch-house and I asked him can you give any good account who these belong to? I asked him if he knew who the person was if he could find him? he did not know; I left him at the watch-house and I went down to the water side again, I and my partner both together, at the water side at the same place, there were two boys pulling the planks on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the plank when you took the prisoner to the watch-house? - I left it in the street, and when I came back again I found it in the same street; his partner's name was Williams, he is not here; I went before the magistrate the next day, and the prisoner was committed, not that day, he was remanded till the day following; then the nephew was ordered for a witness, he was bound over in a ten pound bond to give evedence; I have not seen him here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You asked him whether those deals belonged to him? he said, they did not; he never claimed them; you asked him whether he knew the person that employed him? you said he told you he did not know the man; you know where this man lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him before? - I knew something of him; he lives in East Cheap; he was going in a direction towards his house.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a sawyer? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he was carrying them to cut them up, but he did not know who the property belonged to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you got the plank here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q You say you measured these planks for Messrs.

               <p>Q. Have you seen a deal in the yard? - I have seen several which correspond exactly with the mark; I have seen the one that was taken on the prisoner, it measures seventy five feet; twenty feet long, fifteen inches wide and three inches thick; it is the property of Messrs. Dickenson; I can swear to it from the mark, but it is a mark put on where it comes from, they came from Boston in New England, from New England at least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you had seen some deals on board a ship at Iron Gate? - I had been at the wharf and measured two or three lighters before this lighter came up, but I never measured any from this lighter before it was stole,</p>
               <p>Q. It has no mark of Mr. Dickenson's? - It has not; I cannot swear it is Mr. Dickenson's; I can say on empting the craft there were sixteen missing, but I cannot say that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. When was you on board of this craft? - Not till the next morning after three deals were lost.</p>

I said, good woman is that your home, pointing to the Hole in the Wall, the next door but one to mine, she said it was, and ran after me down to my own door; I said, good woman I am at home, you had better go home yourself and I rung the bell to go into my own house; she hung about me, my breeches pocket being open, and she took the money out of my breeches, and I never perceived it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she rob you? - In the street; it was at my own door after I told her she had better go to the Hole in the Wall; I pushed her from me, and she went away easy enough, I did not miss the money till after I had rung the bell, the person did not come immediately and I put my hand into my breeches pocket as I was standing by the door, and I found my money gone, and she was going across the street.</p>
               <p>Q Did not you at all miss it before this time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you feel her take it? - I did not. She was going from my door across to the other side of the way; I followed her and catched hold of her, says I, what have you done with the money you took out of my pocket? she said, she had not got it; I said, I would call there watch; she immediately dropped the half crowns, and two guineas and a half on the pavement; I both saw it and heard it drop; I stooped down, I picked up a part of it; I picked up a guinea and a half, and three half crowns, and I laid hold of her with the other hand, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100113"/>called the watch; I thought she had dropped it all, and I stopped to look for the remainder; the watch came up, she ran across while I was looking after the money; and he ran across and laid hold of her; there was one guinea I did not pick up then, I picked it up about an hour after; they took her into my shop and I sent for some more watchmen to take her to the watch-house; she was taken to the watch-house in my presence; she begged of me to have pity on her; she said that as we were going to the watch-house, and when we went into the watch-house, the remainder of the money was found on her; I saw her examined there, the remainder was six guineas and a half, I saw it fall from behind her, it fell out from between her handkerchief and cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your money? - About five minutes before I came out of the other house; I counted it in my hand and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found this money on her did you tell the constable exactly what money you had lost? - I did; I could tell one half crown again, it had a small hole on one side of it, but that half crown was not found on her, it was found in the street; I had had that half crown about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you had any friends with you? - At my own house I had some company; I had been in my bar only; I keep the Crown public house; I had drank, but it was before I counted my money.</p>
               <p>Q. This was rather late? - Gentlemen do not go till twelve, and an hour is as little as can be to get ones supper and to come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not in some degree of intoxication at that time? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q In no degree of intoxication. You had been drinking merrily with your friends? - I was as sober as I am this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking? - I was drinking with some gentlemen about an hour perhaps, but it was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink, red port I dare say? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q Pray what did you put on the top of the port wine to keep it steady? - I drank some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - At the same time; the gentlemen ask whether you will not drink with us.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you add to the brandy and water? - Nothing at all; I might drink a little porter with my supper, and that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. This only comes down to seven o'clock what did you take between this and supper time? - Suppose I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you sleep that evening? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What did you refresh yourself with after your sleep? - I had my supper and a little porter.</p>

               <p>Q. If any of your customers had asked you, you would have partook with them? - I should have had no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you sup? - About twelve o'clock; I had very little supper, and then I drank some porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore now I dare say you will not say that you was sober? - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Harrison, on your oath you say you was accosted by this woman; perhaps at that time in the morning you was accosted by others? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q You remember her putting her arms round your waist? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q And you found she had got her hand into your pocket? - I did not find it only by knowing my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You have already sworn that she put her hand into your pocket? - She took my money out of my pocket, and she could not get at my pocket without.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100114"/>Q. Did not you swear so that she put her hand into your pocket? - She must, I think to take the money out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you so swear? - I don't recollect, if I did I wrong understood you.</p>
               <p>Q. I was not asking the question, my lord desired you to give an account of the matter. She had her arms round you; perhaps if you had not had this nap you would have perceived her hand in your pocket? - Perhaps I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. You and I are not coming here to argue? - You say perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it not been that you had been drinking with your customers, in this way you would have perceived her hand in your pocket? - I don't think I should, for I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether you do not think if you had been so attentive as if you had not been drinking at all you might have perceived it? - It could not be, because I really was as sober as ever I was.</p>
               <p>Q Perhaps you had been drinking some drams that morning? - I will not swear I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do undertake to say that you was perfectly sober? - I was perfectly sober at the time.</p>
               <p>Q Though you admit that you might have drank some drams in the morning, was drunk in the evening and yet you was perfectly sober? - I was perfectly sober at that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you had been sober and any body had been taking your money, eight guineas and a half, and three half crowns out of your breeches pocket you would have felt them? - There are dextrous pick-pockets.</p>
               <p>- BUTLER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was present when the prisoner was searched at the watch-house, and I was one that helped to search her; I went to Mr. Harrison's to fetch her to the watch-house; when I came to Mr. Harrison's he gave charge and said she had robbed him of nine guineas and three half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the sum? - I am, on the oath I have taken. We took her to the watch-house and searched her, in searching her we found six guineas and a half concealed behind her neck, underneath her handkerchief, Mr. Harrison said, that was not all the money that he lost, he had picked up some, but it did not make it nine guineas and three half crowns. I searched her myself very particularly to see if I could find the other guinea, I did not find it on her, I found it in the street about an hour after, Mr. Harrison was with me, Mr. Harrison then said that he had found all his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be particular as to the words, nine guineas and three half crowns? do you mean to insist upon it that the charge was that? - That was the manner he described the money to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any other sort of money besides that that you mention? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If a sober man looks at his money just before he goes out is not he likely to be correct? - I should think so.</p>

I ran directly, and Mr. Harrison called out, come over, this woman here has robbed me; the prisoner was there and I saw her fling down the money on the ground out of her hand; I cannot say what money, but I think there were three half crowns picked up and a guinea, and a half guinea; I secured the woman and took her to Mr. Harrison's shop, while he sent for the officer to come, and I went to the watch-house with her; I was by when the money dropped; I heard it fall; I did not touch the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going from Red Lyon-square towards the Borough, along Fleet-street, Mr. Harrison just came up from a turning, a woman came first, and just as I came past he laid hold of me and said I had robbed him; I told him he was very much mistaken, but before he said I robbed him he asked me to have a glass of wine; I told him I was going home, I would not go with him, I had two children to go home to, and I was a widow woman, and was making what haste I could home; he than pulled me along and took me into a shop and sent somebody with me, and then he sent for the constable or somebody and told them to take me to the watch-house, and when I came to the watch-house they pulled my things off roughly; I had before put my money there to secure it, and they took it away from me; I put it there because I had been robbed of some silver one night when I was late out; they asked him if there was any mark he could swear to? he said no.</p>

On the 18th of January the day the Queen's birth day is kept, my son went to the other end of the town, and consequently the counting house was left without any body in it; as I was coming home about four o'clock in the afternoon, coming down Martin's lane, I saw a very suspicious ill looking woman stand talking to somebody at my counting house window; when I came a little further it appeared as if the foot boy was in close conversation with her; he was cleaning the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100116"/>windows, when I came nearer there was nobody there but him and her; in the course of that day we had that silver plated tea pot and it was his particular orders always to carry it into the kitchen closet, instead of which that day he left it in his own closet a place that is not so secure; we dined by candle light and he left his candle at this closet door instead of bringing it in to the side board; the tea pot was missed about an hour or an hour and a half after that, the tea pot was lost in that day; when we went to tea the tea pot was gone, and the callico was gone which laid in the drawing room very near it; neither the tea pot nor cotton furniture is found; this led me to think worse of him than I had done before; I went into his room on the 8th of March, and the first thing I took up was his coat, and I found it rather heavy, and I found a sample of sugar in it; I then went to his box, it appeared as a locked box, and when I came to his box there I found both of my razors with the initials of my name on them, one of them I had missed about nine months and had talked of that loss often in the house, and I believe before him; they have never been out of my possession since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this was it that you missed the razors that you discharged? - I found them on the 8th of March, I think on Friday, and I discharged him the Thursday following; I did not know so bad of him as afterwards; I turned him away on Thursday and I believe the Wednesday following I took him up.</p>
               <p>Mr Steel. Where did you hire this boy? - My wife hired him at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. His friends live at Bath I believe? - I believe at Axminster.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you have many servants? - I have no other in his capacity? I have men work in the sugar house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other servant go away on the day that he was discharged? - A maid servant did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other besides the maid servant and this boy? - We had a girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the boy live on very good terms? - When I found things missing I could not but be uneasy and find fault.</p>
               <p>Q Did this misunderstanding go to any length? in fact did you ever beat him? - I believe I have; sometime after the tea pot was missing my wife ordered him to do something in the house and he was extremely impertinent.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this he gave you warning I believe? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of the time that warning was up did he stay behind that? - I did not take account of his warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy remind you? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q Now on the subject of this in your information before the Lord Mayor the commencement of it says, "That this informant hired the boy and finding the character not right you was determined to get rid of him." Is it not singular you never mentioned that warning before the Lord Mayor? - I thought nothing about it, nor did he I believe.</p>
               <p>Q On the subject of this plated tea pot, did you retain any thing out of his wages? - Not for the tea pot; he is in my debt.</p>
               <p>Q. For what did you retain the guinea out of his wages? - He had always been told that if the tea pot went out of that closet he should pay for it; at the settlement with him my wife says to him Charles, your master has been at a guinea expence or more in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100117"/>attempting to find this tea pot, are you willing to pay for it? he said, he was; and there was 13 s. 4 d. kept back, but he has had that back since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to have it back? - About two days before he was apprehended he took out a summons, that is, the summons is dated two days before, but it came to me the day after he was apprehended, therefore I knew nothing of the summons being taken out at the time he was apprehended; on summoning of me I called upon him to know what he had summoned me for; he said, for what I stopped for the tea pot; I then put my hand in my pocket and gave him a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this box had all the appearance of a locked box; in fact you might as well have told us it was open, for you opened it by going to it. Where these razors never about the house? - One of these razors was taken out of my travelling shaving case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your travelling case locked? - The closet door is locked in which the travelling case is kept.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no duplicates in the box? - I did not look for any.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked into this box on purpose to find what you could of your's; so far as you did look into the box you did not find any pawnbrokers dupplicates there? - I did not find any there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the impression of your mind at this instant is that there was no duplicates? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they were duplicates? - I have no impression one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the razors in his box? - I did, and said nothing about them. The night I discharged him I asked him about the razors, after I had discharged the maid servant I discharged him; I asked him about the razors; he said they were up stairs in his room.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the razors when you found them? - I put them where I found them in his box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steel. You said nothing to him about them when you found them; when did you charge him with taking them? - The night I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to him about them, and he said they were up in his room? - He had come down and wanted to have his livery; I sent him to the drawing room to change his clothes, and in almost a moment I found Charles was gone; I immediately ran up into his room and there I found him without waistcoat or shoes; he had not changed his breeches, and then he had the razors in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you they were up in the room, and when you followed him they were in his hand. Did he appear to be secreting them or bringing them to you? - It struck me that he went up there to get them down in the best manner he could.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your reasons? - As soon as my back was turned he immediately ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a lump of sugar put into the indictment; you are a sugar baker? - I am, and have a good many men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy never remind you that the time of his warning was up, and that he wished to quit your service? - I believe he did a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Q I believe that you had a side board that this boy had access to? - If he had chosen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he access to silver plates which he might have taken away? - They would have been missed in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have conveyed them away if he pleased? - He might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100118"/>Court. Did you miss any silver plate? - None.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steel. He was brought up before my Lord Mayor on the 26th of March. How long did he remain in custody before he was examined the second time? - I cannot tell; I don't know; I don't think quite so much as a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not thirteen days? - I don't know; that is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am asking in point of fact? - I don't know in point of fact; the Lord Mayor would have sent him to sea, but the boy refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not threatened to be sent to Bridewell if he would not go to sea? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was said so? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about his going to sea on his first examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he refused to go to sea, he would rather take his trial? - I never heard him say that he would rather take his trial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of any thing that is laid to my charge.</p>

               <p>Q. When Myers was walking along the footway was the prisoner running or walking? - They were both walking, and a great number of people were coming along at the same time; Spencer then ran up Bow-street where he was taken; there was nothing said by either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner shoved the deceased's arm on one side? - He did, then Myers was taken to a surgeon and from thence to an Hospital.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see who was in the craft? - Yes, the prisoner is one of them; then when I went round I saw one of the same men on the shore standing under an adjoining wharf by the sack of coals; I laid hold of his collar, and I said, you are the person that I have been looking for a long while; pray, says he, Mr. Cooper exeuse me, I was only taking a few for my own burning; I secured him and directly gave a man the charge of the coals; the other man made his escape.</p>

I was not standing near the coals, I was out looking for a Guilford barge, expecting to work on it, and I did not see any, and as I was coming up again this gentleman, Mr. Cooper, catched hold of me and said I had been stealing his coals; with that they had me into custody for ten minutes, and left me in charge of two horse keepers, with that they went and searched all round, and asked for the other man that was with me; I told them I had nobody with me. I have not a soul in the world to speak for me.</p>

               <p>I am the watchman at Aldgate. On Friday the 15th of March last, at ten o'clock at night I saw the prisoner at the bar with a bag at his back, the corner of Shoe maker-row towards Aldgate; when I came up to the corner of Jewry-street he crossed over towards the other corner; I turned my head round towards him, and he ran and I ran after him; he had got as far as the public house, the Three Tuns, I came up to him, I asked him what he had got there? He told me he had got some nails; I asked him where he was going with them? he said he was going into the Minories with them, I asked him whose property they where? he said they were his master's; then says I, you must go along with me; says he, you may go along with me, but I will not go along with you; he then told me they were his own, and I told him I did not think that they were his own, he had told me so many stories; says he, I am going to meet a man at the Two Black Mares in Tower-hill, and then he said he was going to the Minories to one Mr. Bowen's, then at the Black Horse; that made me have a strong suspicion; he then began to pull the bundle away and wanted to chuck it from off his shoulder, but I prevented him, and I brought him and the bag together, as he had, to the constable's house; going to the constable he told me that a man employed him in the Strand, and was to give him a shilling to carry them down to the Black Mares till the man came to him; we afterwards took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I live at No. 7, Jewry-street, Aldgate. The watchman brought the prisoner and bag to me, Friday March 15th, between the hours of ten and eleven; I was eating my supper; says he, Mr. Pinner I have got this man with this parcel; why, sir, says the prisoner at the bar, it is my own property; then I said, I must see what you have got, so I and the watchman went with him to the watch-house and I found a parcel of nails, brass locks, &amp;c. Says I, now my friend where did you come from? says he, I came from nowhere, I am out of place; says I, how came you with these things; says he, I was employed by a man in the Strand to carry them to the Two Black Mares at Tower-hill, and I was to wait there till the man came to me; says I, do not you live in any place; no, says he, I do not, I am just come out of the country, I have no place, I want a place; says I, I am afraid you are telling me lies; says he, I really do not, I never lived in London in my life, I am in lodgings at the present; I want a place. Then I says to him, my friend, I shall take care of you; he says, for God's sake do not; if you will let me go I will give you a guinea. The answer I made was, if you give me five hundred I shall not let you go; with that I took him to the Compter. (The bag produced and the contents deposed to by Vincent.)</p>
               <p>Vincent. The prisoner was a porter to Mr. Vardon and slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Vincent. Do you sell these articles in these quantities in London? - No, never; I never saw such a quantity sold in London since I have been in the shop, which is three years full, I am convinced they are my master's property by the marks on the papers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your master is in a considerable line of business? - Yes, very.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a considerable deal of property of the same sort as you now produce in his shop? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark on each of these is the mark of the quality and quantity what is contained in the papers; there is no other mark but this mark? - We never put any other mark.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner you say was a servant to your master, he had been accustomed to deliver things out of your shop as your master might direct him to do? - Certainly the orders he might receive he was used to do like all the other servants at different times of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was ordered to deliver any things this day you cannot recollect? - I am certain he was not ordered to deliver any such goods that day; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your master has a great many servants? - He has five.</p>
               <p>THOMAS - sworn.</p>
               <p>There are several of the articles with my own mark upon them; they were never sold from the house I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You believe? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Court. Why are you certain? - Because I have examined the books and I never sell such a quantity in London of the nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100122"/>Mr. Knapp. Your master has a deal of business I suppose? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your mark is on the nails; I take it for granted you mark a great deal of other property of your master's? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you put the same mark as you put on these nails to other nails? - Of the same denomination I do.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean to say then is, that from the mark on the nails you know they were of such a quantity and of such a quality? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is no other mark whereby you can ascertain the property? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say none of this property has been sold; how comes it you can ascertain that? - We have a book on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How from your own knowledge do you know in the course of that day that none of these had been delivered out? - They are all entered in a book.</p>
               <p>Q Was you in the warehouse all the course of the day? - I believe I was only during dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time there might be some delivered for what you know? - There are none entered on the book, and there is no cash received for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the elderly gentleman? - I did not; the boy in the shop shewed him many; I was present, the other man purchased four, the prisoner paid for them; they had some difficulty in casting up how much they amounted to, the old gentleman desired the boy to make out a small note with it, I accidently was standing at the door, and this man came out with something under his jacket or coat, which he has on now; I had a suspicion that he had stole something by seeing something underneath his coat, I saw something like a kind of a border of a handkerchief; I saw he walked pretty fast and then began to run; I followed him and took hold of him by the collar, and took from under his coat a dozen of handkerchiefs which I know to be the property of Mr. Hobbs.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was going out you observed this dozen of handkerchiefs? - I did, and they appeared like borders of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. In such a manner that you could hardly be deceived? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought they were the handkerchiefs that the man had bought.</p>
               <p>Lee. The man had those himself, and they were then laying on the counter and he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they walk out together? - No, this person left the other in the shop while the note was drawing out.</p>

I takes hold of her by the cloak directly and said, you have robbed me; and she stretched up her hand to the other woman and gave her something; there was some people in the street, and I called out to the people in the street, and she went along with me into Mr. Gerards, I searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you stop to talk to this woman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. She asked you to go with her? - She did; and then she got hold of e round the middle and took out the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come before you, or behind you, or how? - She came before me and quite lifted her feet from the ground; she got hold of me so fast I thought it was impossible almost she could get hold so fast only with one hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you come out of Mr. Gerards? - I was going to Mr. Gerard's for my uncle to come and have some supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he came up to me there was no soul in the narrow passage? - There was a woman in a red cloak and a tall man, and they spoke together, but what I cannot say, and she said, in the mean time, when I took her into Mr. Gerard's, that she would let me have her cloak to get half a guinea upon at pawn; the prisoner asked me if I would search her? I said, no, I would send for an officer; she desired to be searched by the woman of the house and her mother.</p>

On the 19th of February, about dusk in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into Mr. Crawley's, I recollect him perfectly well, and asked me for one or two pennyworth of liquorice; I am not certain which, I served him, he gave me a half crown piece, not having sufficient change in the till I took the half crown into the counting house to Mr. Crawley; I observed it at the time and I doubted it was not good; he said, it is a good one for we are very careful in what we take; I am perfectly correct in that expression; this was before I took it to my master; I then took it into the counting house and gave it to Mr. Crawley, he having a gentleman with him in the counting house not noticing it immediately he held it in his hand, or at least laid it down on the desk, Mr. Crawley gave me the change, and I delivered the proper change to the prisoner, and Mr. Crawley kept the half crown, this was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to recollect satisfactory whether that was the half crown that you gave to Mr. Crawley or not, and the same you received of the prisoner? - It was. The prisoner went away when I gave him his change; I saw him again in the shop on Friday the 22d about dusk, and I saw him again on Saturday the 23d, I cannot certainly say, but I think somewhere about seven o'clock, candles where then light; I believe he wanted then two pennyworth of tamarinds; Mr. Belcher served him in my presence, he tendered half a crown, then he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he came with half a crown each time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got these pieces of money? - I have got the first and have kept it in my possession ever since; I received it of Mr. Crawley.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you receive it? - Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that was there on the 19th? - I am perfectly sure.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Crawley's, druggist in Bishopsgate-street, he came to our shop on Friday the 22d of February, near dusk, somewhere about six o'clock, and asked for a pennyworth of tamarinds; I served him, he gave me half a crown, I made an observation that it seemed rather suspicious; I being in a hurry I put it into the till, and gave him the change, I made observation enough to know it again; when I had given him his change he went about his business; I saw it again in the morning when the silver was taken out of the till, it was brought to me in the shop by the clerk; I have no doubt but it is the same half crown I took of him; there was no other half crown in the till but that at the time; I have very little doubt.</p>
               <p>Court. Though there had been no other half crown in the till at the morning, might there be not another in the evening after put in or some one taken out? - Not to my knowledge, and I was there all the evening after. I saw the prisoner come on Saturday about the same time, he came for two pennyworth of tamarinds, I served him with them and he pulled out a half crown and tendered to me, which I accused him of being a bad one; the constable has got that; I then accused him of giving me a bad half crown and of taking two before of him of the same stamp; he seemed very agitated in his appearance, and Mr. Crawley was near, and I gave the half crown into his hand and then Mr. Crawley sent for a constable; the constable has got that half crown, Mr. Crawley gave that half crown to the constable as soon as he came; when the constable came he was searched and there was found on him two good shillings and four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had two pennyworth of bad halfpence, and that the constable said before my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>I am a chymist and druggist in Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday, the 19th of February my shopman, Mr. Hopwood, brought an half crown in to me, and I had a person with me, I clapped it down on the desk, I gave him two shillings and six-pence without looking at it, I concluded he knew what money he had taken; about five minutes after when the gentleman was gone I saw it was a bad one; I then went out to him and asked him if he knew he had taken a bad half crown? he said, no; I asked him if the person was gone? he said, yes; I told him to be careful for he would certainly be there again as he had put it off so easy; I gave it to Mr. Hopwood on Saturday, I made a small mark on it before I gave it him; on the Friday morning following which, I believe, was the 22d, my apprentice brought the money out of the till into the counting house, his name is

               <p>Prisoner. I have this to say, I did not design giving them a bad half crown. On Saturday night I was going to my aunt's to inform her that I had a child that was dead, and another ill; going past I was going into this shop for two pennyworth of tamarinds, and got this half crown to pay for the tamarinds; they said I had offered two bad half crowns there before; I told them I never offered a bad half crown to my knowledge; they said I was there yesterday; I said, I am sure I was not here yesterday, because I can prove I was at home all day yesterday, I was not out; the gentleman said I was there in the evening; and I supoenaed the man that works for me to prove that I was not out of my own shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Belcher. Are you sure that man was there with the second half crown as to his person? - I am confident of it; I saw him on Tuesday.</p>
