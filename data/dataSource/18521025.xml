On Sunday evening, 17th Oct., about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I left my house; the two back doors were bolted with two bolts on each door—I let myself out at the front door, which has a spring lock; I am sure I shut it; I pushed it with my hand—I took the key with me, and left no one in the house—I returned in about twenty minutes, and saw a light in my bedroom—I went to Mr. M'Crae, next door, and asked him to come with me—I do not know whether he went in; I stopped in the garden, and he went to the house—I went in about twenty minutes afterwards, and found my clothes lying on the floor of my bedroom, and a drawer broken open, in which I kept the articles I have lost—I had seen them there that day; they belonged to my son in law.</p>

On Sunday evening, 17th Oct., about 20 minutes to 7 o'clock, I was called by Mr. Tutton, of the Anchor Brewery—I followed him to Mrs. Lamb's house—I was told there was some one there, and I put my foot against the front door post, and laid hold of the knocker—some young men laid hold of the door—I heard some one inside unlock the door, and try to get out—I held on, but some person got this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) between the door and the door post—I tried to get it back again—the man that had the poker in his hand said twice, "D—n your eyes, shoot;" and as he said that, the two young men who had hold of the door ran away—they were stronger inside than I was—they wrenched the door open, and pulled the door towards them, and two men rushed out—as they came out, this poker, which was in one of their hands, poked me in the chest—I got one by his coat, and the other by his collar—the first one got away—I held the second one by the collar, till several persons sang out that he was a young man well respected, and a neighbour; and I let him go, and assisted in taking another, who was in the yard—the one I had by the coat, and who got from me, did not get away from the premises—somebody else stopped him, and I helped to take him—the prisoner is the man—I am posi<lb/>tive of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Mulberry Tree, which is near Mrs. Lamb's. On Sunday evening, 2nd Oct., I heard a report, and went to Mrs. Lamb's; it is a cottage with a small garden in front, which is entered by a gate—as soon as I entered the gate, I saw a man open the door from within, with a candle in his hand; he had a very long sharp nose—he closed the door—my husband called to two young men who were passing, to hold the door, so that they could not get out, while he went round to the back—a short time afterwards I saw that the light was out, and in a short time afterwards I saw it again—the door was then opened, and the first person I saw was the prisoner and then another man, and, I fancied, a woman—that was at the time the people were pulling as the door—the prisoner came out first; that was the first time I had seen him—Mr. M'Crae and a roan named Green took him—directly the door opened, they called out, "Shoot, fire!"—the police came, and the prisoner was given into custody—I entered Mrs. Lamb's house, and picked up a gold pin; the house appeared a little disordered, and I saw a large writing desk that had been broken open.</p>

I am entirely innocent, and by a careful investigation of the witnesses it will be fully proved; Ellen Bond stated at the Police-court, on being cross-examined, that the half sovereign now produced might have been the same that she gave to the prisoner in change, and she did not see the prisoner change the one she gave her; she had the two half sovereigns by her a month or upwards, and where she deposited them any person in the house could have changed them, as she never kept her drawers locked, and when her father gave her the two half sovereigns she never examined them, and cannot say whether they were good or bad; Mr. Bond stated the two half sovereigns he gave his daughter were both good; he gave them to her about four or five weeks ago, and his daughter's drawers and boxes were always kept locked, and no one in the house could have any access to them; this statement of Mr. Bond differs entirely with the last witness, his daughter, who stated that her drawers where she kept her money were not locked, and any one in the house could have gained an easy access to them; it is plain and evident that the whole of the case rests upon the evidence of Mr. Bond, and his statement is nothing more than suppo<lb/>sition; it is impossible for him to swear the half sovereign now produced was changed by the prisoner for one of those he gave his daughter four or five weeks back, as he was not in the shop at the time, and saw nothing that transpired between the prisoner and his daughter, and Ellen Bond likewise says she did not see the prisoner change the half sovereign she gave her, but acknowledged at the Police-court that there was a bad half sovereign in the shop in a box where they keep their scales behind the counter, and the other witnesses, Miss Goldsburgh and the policeman, saw nothing of the occurrence; I certainly did not know the half sovereign was a bad one, and should have taken it bad not the witness Ellen Bond offered me another one, while she was examining it on the counter.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 12 Oct., about half past 10 o'clock, the prisoner, the deceased, and I, were in the shop—there was some joking going on between the prisoner and deceased—the deceased began joking the prisoner, and in a playful manner he got up and went towards him as he sat on his seat—he got up and they caught hold of each other by the arms, and straggled and twisted about—the prisoner got into a terrible rage, and told Stannett that unless he sat down he would stick his knife in him—I saw the prisoner take the knife off his seat, and I caught hold of his hand, and told him I would not let his hand loose until such time as he promised to put the knife down—he would not put it down at first, but after a short time he agreed to put it down—he said be would put it down—I believe he did put it down, but I could not swear that he did—I saw him make a thrust at the deceased with the knife—Stannett had before that given him a slight tap on the face as he was loosing his hold—it was immediately afterwards that he stabbed the deceased—he stabbed him at the bottom of the stomach—the deceased staggered back and cried out that the prisoner had done it at last—I accom<lb/>panied him to Mr. Baker'e, a chemist, and then I went off for a surgeon—this was a knife that the prisoner was in the habit of working with—it was a regular shoemaker's knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Friday night, 1st Oct., about ten minutes to 12 o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners Langley and Churchill close to the dead wall of the tailor's shop of St. Pancras Workhouse—they were coming in a direction from the tailor's shop—Churchill was carrying an accordion, and said to me, "Would you like to have a tune this morning?"—Langley was carrying a bundle—they turned into Cambridge-place, and I saw Hasker come up to them from the lower part of the dead wall, and he received the bundle from Langley—they all three went on, and I followed them till I got the assistance of Billinghurst—I then asked Hasker what the bundle contained—he told me a pair of trowsers he had purchased in Camden Town—I asked what part of Camden Town, and they all three immediately ran away, and left me with the bundle—I ran after them, and caught Hasker by the collar—I had a severe struggle with him—he took a large flint stone from his pocket, and struck me on the nose with it—I had a violent struggle with him, and secured him—when I got him to the station I found he was wearing two pairs of new trowsers over an old pair, and the bundle contained two more pairs of the same sort—Mr. Everett and Mr. Day have identified them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Robert Turner, silk mercer, of Ludgate-hill. On 15th Oct., about 5 o'clock, the prisoners came to the shop, and Looney purchased goods to the amount of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid for them—I served them—they left together, and in about three minutes I missed eighty-eight yards of black silk from the counter where I had served them—I had seen the silk within four minutes of the time when they left the shop—I went out and found the prisoners in the Broadway, which is about 200 yards from the shop—they were in the act of turning down a street that leads into Bridge-street—I went to them and requested they would return with me—they held out their hands and said that their change was perfectly correct—they asked me if I would allow them to go and take a glass of wine pre<lb/>vious to returning—I objected, and requested them again to come with me, which they did—as they walked before me, to the beat of my belief they <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> in with two men, and then went on without them—when they got to the shop I left them in charge of a young man, and went for a policeman—I did not tell them why I wanted them to come back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital. I examined Hands on 25th Sept., and found a deep scalp wound on the under part of the left side of his head, dividing all the soft parts—it was about three inches in length, and extended down to the bone—it was then bleeding—in my opinion a stick, if used with force, would cause such a wound—simple wounds of the scalp generally heal readily, but in this case acute pains in the head come on on the fourth day—he was in the Hospital seven days; he is better now—it was a bad wound.</p>

               <p>them both into custody—I afterwards learnt where Coleman was, and sent an officer after him—I had previously sent for Coleman to come to my office to receive his bill, but from the place where Birch stated he was waiting he was gone—I intended to give him in charge—I then sent the officer after him and he took him—I know Coleman's handwriting—he is a connection of mine by marriage—his brother married my daughter, unfortunately—I believe this acceptance to the bill of Coleman and Bottin, Mark-lane, to be Coleman's hand writing—the body of the bill I also believe to be in his writing—I cannot speak as to my belief of the signature of the supposed drawers, Francis Bottin and Co.; that is a disguised hand—I cannot form any opinion or belief upon that—I cannot say whether the endorsement is Coleman's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have seen Coleman write, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; I think I first saw Birch about twelve years ago—he has never brought bills to me before, nor anything of the kind—I have had business transactions with him professionally—I never had any trading trans<lb/>actions with him—I am not in trade—he has never brought any bills to me before—he never sold me any bills, nothing of the kind—I simply knew him professionally, about twelve years ago—for the last five or six years I had not seen him or heard of him, until the day he brought this bill—I never in<lb/>tended to discount this bill; upon his asking 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, I felt satisfied there was something wrong, and I took these steps for the purpose of detecting the wrongdoer—Coleman and I have not had any quarrel whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Birch at the time you gave him into custody, or about that time, that you did not care about him and Gurney, all you wanted was to transport Coleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of ever saying anything of the kind; to the best of my memory I never said so—I cannot say whether I could have said such a thing and forgotten it—I never remember any such conversation—my belief is, I did not say so—I am upon my oath—my im<lb/>pression strongly is, that I never made use of language to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said repeatedly, since the charge was made, that Coleman would be transported, and that at last you should convict him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no feeling about it, except to do my duty—I never said that I would manage to convict him—I have no feeling whatever on the subject, beyond doing my fair duty and giving my evidence as the facts occurred—I could not have said that Coleman would be transported, and I should be glad of it—I never have said so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it ever happened to you to have any other forged bills in your possession, or bills alleged to be forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my recollection; I swear I never had a forged bill in my possession before—when I say that, I mean, of course, as far as my knowledge went—if a bill was passed and paid, I knew nothing of it—I do not know the names of Messrs. Armitage, of Huddersfield—I never heard of their names before in any way—I have no ill feeling whatever towards Coleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not complained that he gave information about your posses<lb/>sion of some brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly complained of the villanous misrepresentations; I have had some brandy warrants in my possession to the value, as far as my memory carries me, of about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold some brandy warrants to Messrs. Hart and Co.—that must have been eight or nine months ago—I never heard that Mr. Sturm and myself were to be indicted for conspiracy for obtaining those brandy warrants—I heard the impudent insinuation indirectly—I did not offer to give a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle the matter. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to put the witness's deposition into his hand, and then to ask him whether he would venture to swear that he had never made the offer referred to.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is he attorney for Messrs. Hooper, the wine merchants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he was not the attorney, but the personal friend—I was invited there by Mr. Hunter about the brandy warrants, and I went there in consequence of the invite—I went there twice—I swear most positively that during those inter<lb/>views with Mr. Brough I never offered money or bills to settle the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you went to Mr. Brough's office, had you heard "the impudent insinuation" that Messrs. Hooper and Son were going to indict you and Mr. Sturm for conspiring to get these brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb/>tainly not; I swear that—the prisoner Coleman did not state, in Mr. Brough's office, that I and Sturm had conspired by fraud to get those warrants; I will swear that—Coleman made no charge at all against me; certainly not of fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your interview with Mr. Brough, will you swear that you never heard at all of any indictment or proceedings against you for fraud of some kind or other, about these brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Brough told me they insinuated it, and he repudiated it most strongly, knowing I could not be guilty of such a thing—that was his statement to me after they were gone—Mr. Brough has known me for forty years, and he made that declaration to me—I have been to Mr. Brough's twenty times—I will explain how I came to go there about these brandy warrants; Mr. Brough requested me to endeavour to get Sturm to remove an attachment that he had lodged against the goods of Hooper and Co.—it had nothing to do with the brandy warrants—I certainly never had any conversation with Mr. Brough about the warrants, or about settling it, or anything of the kind—he applied to me to speak to Sturm to remove the attachment that was lodged against Hooper and Co.'s goods, and stating to me how much he had lost by Coleman, or something to that effect, and I did, in consequence of Mr. Brough's solicitations, do all I could to render service to his friends—I had never sold brandy warrants before, and I should not have had anything to do with those; it was my son-in-law that induced me, unfortunately—no bills alleged to have been stolen have ever been traced into my possession; it is all invention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there is no truth whatever, I suppose, in the suggestion that Louis Napoleon's bills were found in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> How do you mean, found in my possession? my own property, that I gave the money for, and he paid it when due? it is not a fact that two bills alleged to have been stolen from Louis Napoleon were traced to my possession; I swear that most positively; it is all invention—some parties were tried here in reference to those two bills—I was here, and instructed by Louis Napoleon to assist his prosecution—I swear that I was instructed by Louis Napoleon—I was not acting as his attorney; Messrs. Lawford were his attorneys, and Messrs. Bush and Mullens prosecuted for him; but I aided Louis Napoleon, at his request, and was paid for it by his attorney—those two bills had not been negotiated by me—the bill I had of Louis Napoleon's was paid when due—I was a holder of one bill of his for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was regularly paid when due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You unfortunately had a charge made against you some years ago, I believe, but the parties never appeared against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not true; I am not bound to answer whether I was ever charged with any offence, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250040"/>
               <p>I will do so; between forty and fifty years ago I was indicted for perjury; the attempt was to extort money from me; I was tried for it, and, of course acquitted; and I prosecuted the parties, and punished them—no other charge has ever been made against me, without it was behind my back; I do not know what you are talking about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has any other charge been made against you; you seem to answer "No" rather faintly; has any other charge been actually made against you, of fraud, or anything of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have no doubt about it; I mean distinctly to tell you that by "No" I mean no—my Lord, am I to be thus treated; it is really very painful—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CAREWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">thought it would be introducing an inconvenient extension of cross-examination if a general question of this sort were put, without pointing it to something.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides being an attorney, I believe you are a bill-discounter as well; we understand that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, indeed; you understand very wrong, if you have been told that—I have done such a thing occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Wild and Robinson. I know the prisoner Martin—he was in the employ of Messrs. Wild and Robinson—he was errand boy there, and he likewise used to sell goods and put the sales in the book—we had a customer named Troup—Martin would have the opportunity of knowing that Mr. Troup was a customer, and of seeing his handwriting—we were in the habit of furnishing goods to Mr. Troup on orders similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Martin left in June last—on 28th Sept. I saw the prisoner Graves, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I am not quite sure that that was the first time I had seen him that day—about 11 that day this order was presented to me—I believe by his general appear<lb/>ance it was Graves who brought it, but I cannot swear whether it was him or not—I gave the order to Mr. Wild, and he gave the bracelets to the person who brought the order—I am acquainted with Martin's handwriting—both these orders (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are in Martin's handwriting, to my best belief.</p>

Wild and Robinson one year—I kept the day book and approbation book—I wrote in the day book, and Martin wrote in it, and Mr. Wild, and Mr. Robinson also—I do not lock that book up—no one writes in the ledger except me—I keep the approbation book, the ledger, the cash book, and day book—there is only one errand boy there at a time—Martin was there—he and I were very friendly—I never called him clerk, and he never called him-self clerk—I called him by his name—I treated him very friendly—I never had any quarrel with him, that I remember—I had not repeated quarrel with him—in business I sometimes told him not to do this or that, but I did not quarrel—I did not order him about—I can say, on my oath, that Mr. Wild or Mr. Robinson never told me that Martin was to have my place when I left—Martin was once talking about it—I do not know that he was to have my place when I left—he could not, he cannot speak German—I cannot tell whether I was permanently engaged by Messrs. Wild and Robinson when I entered there—I was paid by the week—neither Mr. Wild or Mr. Robinson ever told me that I was engaged there merely to make up the books—I was generally engaged there—I found Martin there when I went—I remained there till he left in June—I was there from Oct. last year—no other person stood between Martin and my employers except myself—there was no other clerk or shopman—before I went there Mr. Robinson kept the ledger—I am a native of Poland; I have been in this country about two years and a half—I had been in various situations before I got to Messrs. Wild and Robinson's</p>

Gossett—they weighed eighty pounds of paper, and took it away—it was part of the paper I bought of the prisoner on 24th Dec.—I think the prisoner called on me the same day, in the evening—he was a great deal excited—he said, "This is a bad job," and he asked me what he should do—I told him he must do the best he could—I told him the police-sergeant and Capt. Gossett had been there and taken the paper—he told me he was going to Mr. Chalmers—I told him he had better not come to my house—he came to me again the next night in a very distressed state, and I requested him to leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years principal clerk of the House of Commons; I have now retired. I am well acquainted with the prisoner—he was messenger there, I think, fifteen years—there is a certain sort of paper supplied to the House of Commons for the use of the short-hand writers—this is some of it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it by the ruling—here is some of a larger size—this is used by the copying clerks—when this was sent to the House of Commons it would he entered to Messrs. Gumey's, but the prisoner would have the care of it—Mr. Pike is clerk of the stationery; but, in bit absence, the prisoner would sign the delivery order, and take charge of the paper—it would not be kept in store any time—it would be kept in Mitchell's room, which adjoins the Committee-office—it would be for the use of Messrs. Gumey's writers, and for the clerks of the Copying-office; but while there, it would be kept in Mitchell's cupboards, but he has complained of want of room—it would not be kept there any time, because he would send word to Messrs. Gumey's office that it was there—I have given directions to the pri<lb/>soner to remove papers—there is a great quantity of waste papers, and it is necessary to remove them, to prevent confusion—he came to me on the morning of the 15th—he seemed rather agitated, and in the course of conver<lb/>sation it came out that he had sold some waste paper, and he remarked that other persons had done the same—I said he had no cause to make himself uneasy on that account—he had had no express directions to sell it; I hail told him to get rid of it, but I did not tell him what to do with it—there is no express authority to sell waste paper—in fact, there are baskets attached to each desk, in which the clerks put their waste paper, and the prisoner would have to empty them, and take it away—on the morning of 15th Oct. the prisoner called on me, and seemed in a very excited state—he made some efforts to speak, but could not get it out—I asked him the cause of his trouble—he informed me it arose out of the sale of waste paper at the House—I remarked, if he knew it was only waste paper, I did not think he need be under such extreme alarm as he seemed to be—he then told me that the man to whom he sold the paper had come to the House of Commons, and he had given him directions to clear a press, which contained waste paper, and, unfortunately, under the waste paper there was a quantity of ruled paper—he certainly con<lb/>veyed to my mind the impression that, having told the man to clear the whole, he did not see that this ruled paper was there—when I heard that there was some ruled paper, I told him that could not come under the description of waste paper, and I desired him to go to Mr. Dyson, my successor, who lives near Slough, and communicate the matter to him—he called on me again on Sunday, the 17th, and I told him that since I saw him I had learned that he had seen the ruled paper at the stationer's, and I said, "Upon discovering that, why did not you immediately withdraw it, and take it back to the House of Commons?"—the words he made use of I do not quite recollect, but the effect of them was that he had not moral courage enough to make known the</p>

               <p>circumstance of the paper to Parkins, the stationer—I do not recollect the words he used; but that it was a painful disclosure, or something that he had not moral courage enough, and I expressed my regret that he had not that courage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Gurney said they were in want of paper, it was always my practice to give an order—when it came in it was received by Mr. Mitchell, but it was never checked, inasmuch as Gumey's knew what I had ordered, and they knew what there was—it was the prisoner's duty to receive it till Gumey's sent for it by their own man—I cannot account for two or three hundred weight of this paper being in that cupboard—I was away at the time—it is my custom to go into the country—it was my duty to summon the members, and various other duties—it would take me half an hour to tell you all my duties—with respect to the stationery, the forms were prepared, and I had to sign them when they were wanted; and I receive some stores, such as sealing wax, and tape, and other things—if Mr. Chalmers wanted things he could have them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Routledge, a cabinet maker, at 71, Brick-lane, St. Luke's. On Wednesday night, 22nd Sept., about half past 12 o'clock, I fastened the doors and windows, before going to bed—the back parlour window was shut and bolted—I got up next morning at a little after 6, and found the woodwork of the shutter of the back parlour window broken off, the corner forced up, so that an entrance was possible from with<lb/>out, and the doors which I had left fastened were all standing open—I missed a coat, two waistcoats, two dresses, and when I went to the drawers I missed a great many other articles—they were all my husband's property—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the properly—the back parlour window looks into a yard which leads to an open court.</p>

On Thursday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sitting at my window and saw a Mrs. Taylor, who is not here, take a bundle into Mrs. Spicer's—in less than half an hour Mrs. Spicer and Mrs. Taylor came down together—they had nothing with them—they went away, and when they returned they both had something under their shawls—they went away again, and I did not see any more of them—in the afternoon, between 2 and 3, Healey came, and went up into Spicer's room—Healey then looked out of the window, and called out, "Ann," to a young woman who came with her—Ann went up into Spicer's room, and she and Healey each took away a bundle from Mrs. Spicer's—they went down the court, and I saw no more of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a toy-dealer, at 15, Little York-street, Whit-more-road, Hoxton. On Sunday evening, 3rd October, I went to the prisoner's; he carries on the business of a firework maker, at 30, Rose and Crown-court, and occupies the whole house—the manufacture is carried on in the first floor back room—there is a shop to the house—I knew John Howes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250055"/>
               <p>one of the deceased lads,—he was in the prisoner's employ—I have seen him come into the shop when I have been there—I cannot say that I have seen him engaged in making fireworks, but I have seen him bringing them down stairs—I got to the prisoner's about a quarter to eight on this evening—I found the prisoner, his wife, and two young girls, in the back parlour, I passed through the shop to go there—the prisoner left the room two or three times while I was there—I heard a loud lumbering noise overhead, and said, "Have not the boys left off work?"—I addressed that generally; the prisoner was in the room—his wife said, "No, they have not yet"—I observed that I did not like Sunday work, I thought no good came of it—the prisoner was present, but did not say anything; he left the room after that, but I cannot say where he went to—the room opens into the passage where there is a staircase leading to the top room—after he left the room I immediately heard a noise as if a person was walking upstairs—he did not remain away many minutes—I am not certain whether he went up two or three times, but after he came down the last time, he said to his wife, "The boys may as well leave off now"—that was about a quarter or half past 8—his wife then left the room, I heard a person go up, and when she came into the room again, she said, Jack had got a few more to finish, and be would stop and finish them—I do not think the prisoner made any reply to that.</p>

I had a daughter in the defendant's service—she left on a Monday, about five weeks ago, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—I do not know the day of the month—on the Wednesday afterwards I went to the defend<lb/>ant's house at Stoke Newington with Margaret Ann Jones—we got there about half past 8, as near as I can guess—we had taken some spirits at Mrs. Jones's house—we were sober; we were not tipsy—Mrs. Jones was sober—we were both alike—there are eight or nine steps up to the door—when we got to the top I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Jones stood at the side—the defendant opened the door, with a parcel in her hand containing a pair of clogs and two coarse aprons, belonging to my daughter—I said to her, "I have come con<lb/>cerning a servant girl you had living with you; I am her mother"—she made me no reply, but <hi rend="italic">heaved</hi> this bundle in my face, pushed Mrs. Jones with the other hand, and then shut the door—she said nothing as she did that—Mrs. Jones had no time to say anything—she was down in the area in a minute—she had not said anything; she only stood at the side, with her back towards the area—there were no rails to protect her from the area—it was a violent push sideways, and the door was shut very violently indeed—I knocked at the door, and said, "For goodness sake come out and see what you have done to my friend; I think you have killed her"—there was no answer; no one came to the door—I ran down two or three steps, jumped into the area, and saw Mrs. Jones there in a pool of blood; about that time help came, and Mrs. Jones was taken to a doctor's—Mr. Keale came out of the next house, and gave me and my daughter in charge, as he said, for breaking windows—I afterwards saw Mrs. Jones in the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newmarket-place, Southgate-road, Kingsland. Between 8 and 9 o'clock on this evening, I was passing Mr. Keale's house, and saw two females on the steps; the door was open, and the first thing I saw was a hand pushing one of the females, who fell over into the area—I was just by the gate, which is, perhaps, three or four yards from the steps—there is a little garden—the push was as though it was done in a hurry—the door was then shut violently, slammed to, and then the other person com<lb/>menced knocking at the door, calling for a light, and saying they had knocked her friend into the area—I borrowed a light from next door, rendered what assistance I could, and went for a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. On Wednesday, 22nd Sept., I was house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The deceased was brought there that evening; she was cold, had got a very small pulse, and looked very pale in the face—she had a wound on the right side of the forehead, a slight injury to the right arm, loss of motion in the lower and upper extremities, and complained of great pain at the back of her neck—the injuries might have been caused by a fall down an area; she died about noon on 26'th—in my judgment the injuries I found on her were the cause of her death—death was caused by rupture of the elastic substance which preserves the bones of the neck, and pressure on the spinal marrow—she was brought in about 11 o'clock at night, her breath smelled of liquor.</p>

I went to answer a lady and gentleman that came, but I heard no bustle in the room while I was gone—I did not attend to the lady and gentleman; they did not</p>

               <p>come in; I only answered them at the door—the room where this occurred was the back parlour, on the ground floor, as you come in at the door—I did not go out to drink during the three minutes—at the time the prisoner put his foot on the deceased's chest she was quite dead—he had neither shoes nor stockings on then—she was lying on the floor, flat on her hack—he said to me, "There is nobody can make you open your mouth; if you say anything we are sure to he transported;" or something of that kind—I have men<lb/>tioned that before to-day—I have been waiting about here for this trial—I have been in the public houses opposite—I did not say there that I wished this man might be hung—I did not say so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you then to be shown it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought if ever he came back again I might stand the same chance as his aunt; I did not wish him to come back again—I do not now wish him to be hanged, and if it was to do any good I would as soon be hung up as him.</p>

Between 1 and 2 o'clock, on Sunday morning, 10th Oct., I was called by a man named Westlake to see the deceased—in consequence of what he said to me, I sent my son to No. 11, Shepherd-street, not being able to dress so quickly as usual from having had a fall and injured my wrists—I followed him—I had known Mrs. Brown, the deceased, half a year previously—I had been called to attend her in May last, for the first time, and I had subsequently been called—when I got to 11, No. Shepherd-street, I saw the deceased in the parlour, lying on the bed—observing some marks on her forehead, I took the old woman aside into the passage—I examined the forehead, and found the marks of a blow on each temple—the one on the left side was slight—that on the right side was more severe, and the skin was slightly abraided—I should say the deceased was between fifty and sixty years of age—when I observed the marks, the prisoner said she had fallen against the sofa—I am confident he said <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the sofa—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday following—I found on the external part of the body various marks of bruises of long standing—a severe bruise on the left hip, extending on to the back, and the two marks before mentioned on the temples—the mark that extended to the back was apparently recent—the old bruises were in various parts, and she had on a plaster—I examined the head; on removing the skull-cap, and the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>; I found a coagulum</p>

               <p>of effused venous blood on each side corresponding with the external bruise—there was effusion of liquid venous blood in the ventricles at the base of the brain, and all through, a general effusion—I saw quite sufficient to account for the death—the cause of death was effusion and extravasation from the rupture of a vessel from concussion of the brain—that was caused by external blows—there is no doubt that a violent blow on each side of the head would cause what I observed—it is impossible to say what time would elapse before a person would die after receiving such a blow—it might be longer or shorter—it does not follow that death would be immediate—it would mainly depend upon the size of the vessel so ruptured—I examined the chest and abdomen—all the vital organs were perfectly healthy throughout, unusually healthy—I examined the contents of the stomach, it contained about from half to three quarters of a pint of fluid, apparently of a natural kind, but there was no appearance of spirit or of any other deleterious substance having been drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effect of concussion of the brain is instantaneous insensibility, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would be a question of degree? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; depending upon the quantity of effusion, and the size of the vessel ruptured; frequently the appearances do not show themselves for some days after concussion, when the vessel ruptured is very small—there may be concussion without the actual rupture of a vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Judging from the blow described, the coagulum you noticed within, and the rupture of the blood vessel, would not the concussion produced by such a blow he almost instantaneous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should fancy that death would be very quick from such severe blows—but very frequently insensibility would not immediately follow even from such blows as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the woman was in the habit of living rather freely, or had been in the course of that day taking a certain amount of spirits and water, and porter at night, would that increase the tendency to receive injury from a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt of it; so that a smaller amount of actual violence would occasion the mischief.</p>

I will never come into bed with you again alive"—I took two constables to the house, and said to the prisoner, "It is necessary that you should come to the station and make that same statement to the inspector"—he said, "Yes; I will go"—on the way to the station he put himself in different postures showing me how she was sitting, and how he lifted her up; that he assisted Mary in getting her into bed—he asked me whether that was not natural enough, and I said, "Yes"—he made a statement to the acting inspector at the station just similar to what he had told me.</p>

On Monday night, 27th Sept, I was at Mr. Myatt's farm with Turner, another constable—I was concealed among some frames watching some onions—I remember the wagon going away from the yard that night; I think it was as near 12 o'clock as possible when it started; I saw it going—I was not near enough to see who the parties were that went with it—I followed it, and saw two persons with it; Smith was one, and I believe Boston to be the other—I had some communication with Mr. Myatt after the wagon had left the yard, in consequence of which I and my brother constable followed the wagon—I saw it in the Kent-road, stopping at the Crown and Anchor—I observed a sack on the shafts—I passed it, and touched it—it was full—the wagon afterwards went on—I fol<lb/>lowed it, and saw the sack several times between the Crown and Anchor and the Green Man toll gate—when I got just by the toll gate a policeman hallooed out that there was a full sack of corn on the ground—I immediately ran to the wagon and saw that the sack which I had seen there about two minutes before, was gone—the policeman that hallooed out was not Turner, but a policeman on duty on that beat—Turner and I were in plain clothes—there was another sack on the shafts about half fall, but the full one was gone—that was standing upright, this one was lying along the shafts—I had not seen the other sack there before; it was not there before, not on the shafts—the policeman on duty went up to Smith and asked him if he had lost a sack of corn—he said no, he had not; he had none—I then went back to Turner, and took the sack into the toll gate—the policeman on the beat had picked it up—I then followed the wagon on to town—I looked into the full sack, and found it contained oats—it was not mixed com, but all oats.</p>

I was on duty in the Old Kent-road, about 1 o'clock on the morning of 28th Sept.—I saw a van horse, about 100 yards on the Kent side of the Green Man toll gate, shy at something lying by the side of the road—I went up to see what it was, and found it was a sack full of something; it was lying at the near side of the road as you go towards the Green Man—it was in the gutter I should call it, but there is no kerb there—it was in such a position as it might be if it had fallen off a cart or wagon; for just about there the middle of the road was being mended with stones, and the carts drew off to the side of the road to avoid them—I saw a market cart and a market wagon in advance—the wagon went on through the toll gate—I saw that the wagon had drawn to the near side of the road to avoid the stones—I went after the wagon and saw Smith—I asked him whether he had dropped a sack of corn—he said no—to the best of my belief Boston was with him—the constables in plain clothes said something to me, and the sack was taken into the toll house—the cart was behind the wagon when I overtook it—the man who was with Smith was with him at the time I asked the question, he must have heard what I said—he was on the hind part of the wagon, and I was at the near side—he was sitting on a projection behind the wagon—he was not more than six yards from me, and I spoke load enough to be heard thirty yards off—he did not speak—I saw his features, and to the best of my belief it was Boston—he was npt asleep—he looked at me, and I looked at him—it was not very light.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 22, Broad-street, Lambeth. The prisoner lodged in the same house on 18th Sept.—on Saturday night, 18th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner went out, and his wife followed him out directly—soon after that he returned, went upstairs, and I heard him say, "The door is locked"—I believe he had some coals with him; I heard him putting them down on the landing—as he was returning downstairs the street door opened; I heard his wife's voice saying, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, is that you?"—he said, "Yes"—she went upstairs—the staircase was dark—while she was unlocking the door, he said, "Why did not you leave the door unlocked?"—she said, in a joking or laughing manner, "What a pity!"—shortly after that they went out together—they were gone about three quarters of an hour, or an hour, which brought it to between 9 and 10—they then came in, went upstairs, and began quarrelling in their own room—I heard the woman call the man a b—y thief, and he said, "You are a b—y wh—"—after that I heard the woman come down, and go out alone—she was out till a few minutes after 12—she went up to her room on her return—in my opinion she was greatly intoxicated—I then heard bad words in their room, which is directly over mine, and then heard a very heavy fall in their room—it is my firm opinion that the prisoner was sober—I heard no screaming after the fall, but heard the man putting on his shoes a few minutes afterwards, and after that he came downstairs—I should say it was dark on the stairs—when he was at the bottom of the stairs, or nearly so, he said, "Halloo, who is this?"—no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250070"/>
               <p>one answered him—(my room is not on the ground floor; he was on the landing, by my room)—he said again, "Who is here?" or, "Who the devil is here?" or words to that effect—he went upstairs again, struck a light, came down again, and said, "Oh, it is you, is it?"—I was in bed—I had not heard anybody come downstairs but himself from the time the woman went up—the words "It is you" were not addressed to me, but to somebody on the stairs—he then called out to me, "Mitchell, are you awake?"—I did not answer him the first time, and he called out again, "Mitchell, are you awake?"—I said, "Yes; what is the matter?"—he said, "My old woman don't appear to have any strength in her limbs"—I said, "Nonsense," or something to that effect—I got out of bed, put my trowsers on, opened my door, and saw the prisoner supporting his wife, with her head over his right arm, and her feet towards my door—I said, "Let us get her upstairs"—I took the candle, and the woman's legs; he took the other part of the body—there is a turn in the staircase, about five or six stairs up; and while he was turning round with the upper portion of the body, I caught a sight of the face, and said, "Good God Almighty, the woman has got no breath in her body!"—I went down stairs, got a drop of cold water, and poured it into her mouth, but it would not go down her throat—from the time I heard the fall down to the time I came out to assist, if she had come down stairs herself, or had fallen downstairs, I should have heard it—I had not been asleep at all—if she had been carried downstairs when he came down, I could not distin<lb/>guish it from his coming down—I afterwards found she was dead—she was the woman I call his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I knocked at the man's door, and asked him to lend me a hand upstairs with my wife; I did not know she was there till I came down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were not asleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went to bed about 11; I had been in bed nearly an hour—I did not answer the first time he spoke to me, because they have been in the habit of quarrelling, and I did not like to interfere—it is a small house—there are only three rooms on each floor—there is a landing on each floor—the landing opposite the prisoner's door is over the staircase, not over my bedroom—I should say a noise on the landing would not appear to sound over my room—I can decidedly say that the fall was in the room—I can say that, by having heard falls when they have been in liquor before, and from the sound of that I draw my calculations that the fall must have been in the room—I did not hear anything like a stumble when he said, "Halloo, what is here?" only a sort of a stop, like a man kicking against something—I am married—my wife was with me in bed—I believe we both agree as to where the noise of the fall was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I knew Mrs. Perry—I saw her go up stairs on Saturday night, 18th September, at a few minutes past 12 o'clock, very much intoxicated—I was following her up the stairs, up to my own door—I heard her go into her own room—I am positive she went in; and then I heard quarrelling and very bad language</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250071"/>
               <p>from both of them, but I did not take notice of it, because I am so used to it—I closed my door just as he called her a b—y w—e—I am positive she was not in bed, but I think he was by the voice—she said, "What did you call me?"—"A b—y w—e," said he, "and worse than a w—e for if I had picked up with a w—e in the street, she could only have taken my money, and left me in the street"—the <hi rend="italic">retally</hi> was, "You are a b—y thief," she repeated that three times, and with that I heard her make a dart, as I supposed, from the fireplace towards the door—she used generally to sit by the fireplace; and with the words "b—y thief," came the heavy fall over our bedroom door—I have known her during the three years which they have lived there—I supposed it was Mr. Perry that fell, because I have heard him fall repeatedly when he was in liquor, and he falls very heavily—the fall sounded to me exactly over the door, in the room—I have not said, to my knowledge, that I thought the deceased was on the landing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "I heard a fall, and thought it was the prisoner; and I thought the deceased was on the landing," that is what you told the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—there was only one fall, and that was in the room—after the fall, I heard the woman say, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, I can't," or, "shan't nurse you;" and from that minute there was a deadly shocking silence—I could not tell who it was that fell, but I thought, by the heaviness of the fall, that it was the man that fell, until I saw the body in the morning, and saw the bruised state of the body—after the fall I heard the prisoner put on his shoes, and come downstairs—when he got towards our door, he appeared to be fumbling or kicking against something, and said, "Who are you?"—I then heard him go upstairs, and heard him strike a match over the fireplace—he brought a light down with him, and complained to her about his being out all the week, and she spending his money—he appeared to be picking her up, and called to my husband, and said, "Mitchell!" but Mitchell did not answer him—he called again, "Mitchell, are you awake?" Mitchell said, "What is the matter, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>?"—he said, "Will you get up, for I think my old woman has not got any use in her limbs"—I did not see her, for I was blindfolded; I had a poultice over my eyes; and I went up<lb/>stairs naked as I was—when the deceased was tipsy, and had dropped off to sleep, she would tumble down, chair and all; we have often heard her tumble down, but not latterly, as she has been very hard at work lately—I cannot say how long it was between the time of the fall and my husband being called up, because the whole occurrence took place in a short time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your deposition read over to you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I believe it was; I put my mark to it—(<hi rend="italic">The deposition being read stated</hi>: "At that moment I thought the deceased was on the landing")—I do not recollect that I said that; I have no idea of it—whether she was on the landing or not, I am positive the fall was in the room; and I am positive she never came downstairs—I cannot say whose the words, "I cannot," or, "I shall not be your nurse," were, because it was in a stifled voice, a kind of half voice—they were the last words before the man came downstairs, but who it was came downstairs, I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was sent for to see the deceased on 19th Sept. between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—I went immediately—I saw the body lying on a bed on the floor—Attlee, the constable, was in the room—she was quite dead, and warm—I found the left side of her face considerably bruised; there were also two lacerated wounds, one on the left side of the nose, and one on the left side of the lower jaw, a bruise on the shin, and one on the elbow—on making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examin<lb/>ation, I discovered marks of extravasation of blood produced by some rupture of a vessel, or vessels, and that concussion of the brain had resulted from some violence, either a blow or a fall—the extravasation was over the left eyebrow, corresponding with the external bruise—I saw marks about the body which were the result of a blow, or fall, I could not say which—con<lb/>cussion of the brain was the cause of death—that would equally have followed if she had fallen downstairs herself, or if she had received a blow by which the fall was occasioned—I am quite unable to distinguish which it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Peter-street, Southwark. Last Saturday night but one, I was drinking at the Grapes public house, in the Mint, with the prisoner Jones—I went there between 9 and 10 o'clock, and remained till the house was shutting up—Jones was there in company the whole time with Winter—I did not see Reardon there—I left the house and went as far as Gravel-lane—I went to a private house with Winter and the other prisoner—there was drinking going on—the prisoner asked me if I would have a glass of anything to drink—I said I did not mind; I took a glass of what I thought was gin—when I had taken it some time, I found myself getting stupified—I thought I had better leave and go home—I went out of the house towards home, Winter and Jones followed me out and joined my company—Reardon was in the house, but I do not know whether she came out or not—I did not see her again till she was taken—I looked at my watch ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I came out, it was then a quarter past 1—I went towards home, and was talking to Winter and Jones;. I missed Winter, and in a minute, or a minute and a half, I received a blow on the side of the head which fetched me to the ground—I saw nobody but the prisoners, but did not see who gave me the blow—I felt a tug at my watch guard; I got up but fell again—I got up again and ran to a policeman—I did not see any one run away; I thought I heard them, but the stuff they gave me and the blow stunned me—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 7, Thomas-street, Wyndham-road, Camberwell. About five weeks before I was before the Magistrate (I do not know the date), I was standing before the door of No. 1, Thomas-street, where Richard Dart, my brother-in-law, lives, when a dead animal came against my face—I stooped down to pick up a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of mortar to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> at James Carver, and instead of hitting him it hit the prisoner, who was standing against Mrs. Good right's window just below No. 1—he came and hit me twice in the head, but I took no notice of that—his daughter came from Mrs. Frewin's, the chandler's shop, and called me names not fit for any gentlemen to hear in Court, and then went to the stall to get a mug of water—my mother heard me <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, and came out to take my part—she caught hold of the prisoner's hand to save me from being knocked about, and he took and knocked her down—he hit her under the left breast twice—I did not take much notice what sort of blows they were—she fainted away, and Mary Ann Dartled her indoors—I went in doors with her; she was lying on the bed, and had fainted away—she complained of the prisoner hitting her in her left side—she was taken to the workhouse next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 9th July, I think it was I was called to attend the deceased; I found her sitting up in a chair in the room, complaining of great pain in her side—I examined the place, and found it very much inflamed, and bruised—my impression was that she had received some direct injury—I asked her if she had received a kick or a blow, but she did not reply—I saw her afterwards, daily—she was removed to the House by the relieving officer, and was under his care when she died—I assisted Mr. King in making a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of her body on the day after her death, which was about five or six weeks after the injury—we found the lungs in a very unhealthy state, the right lung particularly was filled with purulent matter, the kidneys were diseased, the liver having that nutmeg appearance of persons addicted to drink, and also the kidneys—we examined internally, where I saw the external injury, and found an internal abscess of the pectoral muscle of the chest; but the ribs and the <hi rend="italic">periastium</hi> were quite healthy—such an abscess as that might be the effect of external violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us whether you can trace any connection between the blow and the death of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a person so very unhealthy as she was, a blow might excite an abscess of that kind, or it might not; in an unhealthy person it very probably would—the abscess may have been excited by the blow—death was caused by the abscess, and not by the disorder of the viscera, certainly not—I cannot say whether the abscess arose from the blow, or from great derangement of health; but she had no abscess when I saw her on 9th July—it may have arisen from the blow; it was in the same place where I observed the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You found her in a general state of disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was a very unhealthy woman—she gave me the appearance of a person of drunken habits—the abscess might have occurred independent of any blow; that is, looking at her general constitution—she died from the effects of the abscess, from the exhaustion—there was certainly no abscess when I saw her—there was chronic disease of the kidneys, they were not inflamed, and chronic disease of the lungs, but nothing of an active character—I cannot say the abscess was caused by the blow—while I was attending her she had no abscess—there was nothing to cause the abscess, except the violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the parish of Camberwell, and have had considerable experience in my profession. The deceased came under my charge on 13th July—she was suffering from a very extensive abscess on the left side, which was the result of acute inflammation—there was at that time no external appearance of any injury or bruise—I after<lb/>wards assisted at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of her body—there were marks of chronic disease in various parts of her body—if she had received two blows on the left breast on 8th July, that would account for the abscess I found on 13th—there was an external livid mark on 13th; there was a redness—the mark of a bruise would be very quickly absorbed; I think it might have been ab<lb/>sorbed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250077"/>
               <p>in that time—the redness was not what I call inflammation—I attribute her death to the effect produced by the abscess, coupled with general weak<lb/>ness of constitution; the immediate cause was hectic fever, which arose from the abscess, and diarrhoea set in, and vomiting—I attribute the abscess to an injury of some kind inflicted, but an abscess may certainly come on spon<lb/>taneously—there was no connection between the disease of the liver and the abscess—it is not unusual for a person to have an abscess; it happens very frequently—she would be no doubt less likely to recover from the abscess from being an unhealthy subject.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 135). On 13th September last I was on duty at Camberwell station—about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to the house of Mr. Stevens, a victualler, who keeps the Bricklayers' Arms, Camberwell—when I got there, I saw the prisoner outside the house—there were about one hundred and fifty people collected about the house—my attention was drawn to a cut on the back part of the prisoner's head, and the clothes he had on seemed to be bathed in his blood—I spoke to him, and asked him to accompany me to a doctor, to have his wound dressed—he con<lb/>sented, and walked along with me about a dozen yards—when he had got</p>

               <p>that distance, he stooped down and caught hold of me my the small of my legs, and threw me on my back—he then jumped on my chest and bowels three different times—he then threw himself down on my body, put his hand in between my neck and my stock, and would have choked me if it had not been for the clasp of my stock giving way—he then said, "You b—b—, I shall do for you now"—I struggled with him, and got on the top of him—I caught hold of his hands, and he made an effort to bite me—he tried to bite me more than once—I was not able to keep hold of him—I was obliged to let his hands go in consequence, and let him get up; and I got up on my legs—the prisoner was then about four yards from me—he had his hands clenched, and I thought he was coming towards me to strike me in the face or body with his hands—I prepared to defend myself from his blows, when he ran at me with his head—his head was lowered quite low, and he ran his head right in against my privates—he then caught hold of my legs, and pitched me on my back—I fell to the ground, three yards or more from him—when he got hold of me, he rose me right up, and I fell on my back three yards from the place where he stood—while I was upon my back he came towards me, and kicked me in the privates, and in the body; he said, at the same time, "You b—b—, I will do for you now"—I was lying on the ground for several moments before I was able to get up; the prisoner stood just over me while I was lying there—I got on my legs again, and the prisoner knocked me down again with his head, in the same manner as before, but he did not pitch me right away from him as he did before—he struck me again in the same part with his head; and while I was on the ground he kicked me on the right hip—I had a watch in my pocket, and the next kick he gave me (he meant to kick me in the privates, I have no doubt) broke the watch that was in my pocket—at the time he was kicking me he said, "You b—b—, I shall give you another <hi rend="italic">downer</hi>, and you will never rise"—I got on my legs again after some moments—I then drew my truncheon—I heard some party in the crowd say, "Well done, Cannon, give it the b—"—the prisoner on that, strove to get my truncheon away from me several times—I was able to defend myself with my truncheon until other assistance came—another constable, named Thorn, soon afterwards came up the prisoner knocked Thorn down directly—Thorn managed to get on the top of him, and I also got on the top of him, thinking to keep him down, and he kicked me off, and kicked me in the body, and on the right shin—several other constables soon after came up to my assistance—it required six constables and three civilians to hold him, and convey him to the station house—directly I got to the station house I was taken to Mr. Flower, the surgeon of the division—I was confined to my bed for three weeks; I am still under his care; I am suffering pain now—none of the persons who were standing round the public house offered me the least assistance—I asked several of them to do so, but none of them would.</p>

On 19th Oct., about 8 o'clock in the evening, a person came to my shop to buy a pair of spoons—while he was there the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of copper wire—I do not deal in that—he left the shop before the other person—he paid me with a crown-piece, which I after<lb/>wards found to be counterfeit, and placed it in a drawer in my desk by itself—the prisoner came again about 9, and asked for half a dozen teaspoons—they are 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen.—he paid me with a bad crown-piece—I then went round the counter, said that he could not go out, and asked him whether he did not know that that was not the first which had been tendered to us that night—he said he did not—he pulled a paper out of his pocket, and said that was where he had been all that day—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody, and gave the policeman the two crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate female, and occupy the front parlour on the ground floor at 11, White Horse-street, Lambeth. On 22nd Oct., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I met a young man in the Waterloo-road, who went home with me and remained nearly an hour, but did not have connection with me—we quarrelled, and were talking for a long time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250087"/>
               <p>and after that he tried to lock the door, and I said he should not—he did lock it, and then knocked me down, and tore my pocket from me—there was a half sovereign and ninepence-halfpenny in it; he took the con<lb/>tents out, and left the pocket on the table—I would not let him go to the door, and he flew to the window, undid the shutters, and the prisoner came in—the prisoner then knocked me against the table and the bed—my landlady then came down, and rattled at the door, but could not get in—the men then went out at the window, one after the other—the prisoner must have been close against the window, he came in directly the other man opened it—I swear the prisoner is the person who came in—I recognized him among several more.</p>

Smith occupies the front parlour—between 2 and 3 o'clock on this morning, I heard a noise and great bustle—I got up, went to the landing, and found it came from Smith's room—I went down, tried the door, and got no answer, but heard a noise as though the young woman was groaning; and there was a great bustle in the room—I tried to get in, but could not, as the door was locked—I tried several times, and said, if the door was not opened I would push it in—I heard more feet in the room—I heard the window open—I rushed to the street-door; the window and shutters were open, the prisoner was at the window, and another young man, two or three steps off—there was no one else in the street—the prisoner said he was waiting for a young man from No. 13—the other man ran away, and the prisoner followed him, in the direction of his own house—Smith had no dress on, her clothes were torn—she felt in her pocket, and said, "Good God! I have been robbed"—I know the prisoner by sight, he lives at No. 6.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somersetshire, but I am visiting at Hamilton-terrace, St. John's-wood. On 26th Oct., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in Waterloo-road, coming from Waterloo-bridge to Westmin<lb/>ster bridge-road—the prisoner and another female met me, stopped me, and asked where I was going—I said nothing, but walked on—the prisoner said, "Do come and see me"—she was standing before me, and would not allow me to pass—I suppose I walked two or three yards, not more, when a man came behind and pushed me somewhere about the shoulders (I had seen two men just before)—the prisoner at the same time caught hold of me, and another woman came up—the prisoner was endeavouring to unbutton my great coat—the other woman pulled open my coat, and the prisoner put her hand into my waistcoat pocket and took my watch—I am quite sure it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250091"/>
               <p>the prisoner—after I discovered my loss, I said, "You good-for-nothing woman, give me my watch"—I put down my right hand, and felt my watch in her hand—she was endeavouring to pass it to the other woman—I felt the prisoner put her hand in my pocket; I was able to see whose hand it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did you say that you knew she put her hand in your pocket because you felt it; did you tell the Magistrate that it was her that put her hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not tell him it was one of them, and not tell him which I felt it in—I am prepared to say that I saw her put her hand in my pocket, and what is more, I told the officer so—the prisoner had her hand under my great coat, the other woman stepped back—I saw the prisoner in that position, that I believe it washer band that was in my pocket—I consider that the other woman was very much intoxicated, she only pulled my coat open—the prisoner first tried to unbutton my great coat—the other woman came and pulled my coat open—the prisoner let go from below from the button as I kept my hand at the button, and she put her hand in my pocket and took my watch—the other woman was standing by—I caught hold of the prisoner, and would not let her go—I caught the other woman also, but she escaped, and left her shawl behind—I had great difficulty in holding both—the policeman came up immediately—the two men I passed a very few yards before I came to these women, and one came and pushed against me on the right—when the policeman came, these two men came back a little way—they did not come close to us, but a short distance off, to see what was going on—I was sober—I had been out to supper, but I had drank very little—the man pushed me on my right shoulder just before the women came to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you said before, "Two men came up at the time, as soon as I called "Police!" and pushed against me"—is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they did not; that is the clerk's error—they did nothing, they stood at a little distance—the other woman came back—I did not see anything pass from one to the other, but the policeman said, "That is the woman who has your watch," and he pointed to the other woman—he said this woman had passed it—he said that in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner did not say anything at the time—I was very much excited—I could not have held the two women so long as I did if I had not been excited—I felt the watch in the prisoner's hand—the moment after she took the watch, I endeavoured to seize it in her hand—she had not had time to pass it then; but the other woman came up afterwards, and she passed it, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you sure that you felt my hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am perfectly certain it was your hand—you took the watch out of my pocket—I felt it in your hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 106). I was on duty in Waterloo-road, at 2 o'clock that morning—I heard a cry of "Police!"—I went up directly, and found the prosecutor standing by himself, and the prisoner by herself—the prosecutor had not got hold of her—one was standing by the houses, and the other by the side of the pavement—the prosecutor said, "I give this person in custody for robbing me of my watch"—the prisoner said nothing only that she heard the cry of "Police!" and came up—I took her into custody, and as I took her the one that is now at large came up—the prisoner put her hand out, and they grasped each other's hands—the woman that has escaped then ran away—I took the prisoner to the station—I could not prevent their hands grasping—I had the prisoner by the left arm, and she turned and put her right hand out to the other woman—the other woman ran away—I kept the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell the Magistrate, "I heard a cry of 'Police!' I went up, and saw the prosecutor holding a woman?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the woman that has escaped—I had seen him holding a woman before I got up to them—that woman ran away—on her running away, her shawl dropped from her; she went away without it—I went up, and found the prisoner and the prosecutor standing—two men stood about twenty yards' distance when I first went up; but on my taking the prisoner forward, they came up to me, and said, "What is the matter?"—the woman that escaped came up with them when they came to ask what was the matter—the men came about the same time that the woman came and grasped the prisoner's hand—I believe the prosecutor had been drinking—he appeared to be in liquor, but appeared quite conscious of what he was doing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The woman ran away? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The woman came up, together with the men, I am positive—they all three came up at one time, within about a yard of each other—I did not see the watch at all—I am quite sure that the woman who ran away in the first instance was the same who came up with the men—the shawl dropped from the woman six or seven yards from where I was—while I was taking the prisoner away, one of the men came and picked it up—it was impossible for me to make an effort to take the other woman—I must have let the prisoner go, to take the other—I did not call for assistance.</p>
