When they were over, they could put up the sash and get in, and then go out through the door.

The maid got up a little before, and came and called me. We missed a large quantity of plate, to the amount of two or 300 l. worth, which we have not been able to discover since. I missed a pair of leather breeches that hung up in a back room by the kitchen. I did not miss them that morning, they being among other things; but I had had them in my hand the Saturday night before the house was broke. Sir

             and I, went out together from Mr. Freebody's, a public house, the Coach and Horses in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Fanning?</p>
               <p>Kenney. He is gone to sea. We went out a little after eleven at night. We went up and down the Strand, and at last pitched upon this house; I don't know the name of the street; it is within two or three streets of Hungerford-Market. This was on a Sunday night, but it was the Monday morning that the robbery was done. We got in at the area gate; we were disturbed before it was done; I think it was Fanning that broke the window shutter. I ran through a court for fear of the watchman, and had not an opportunity of returning for some time; when I returned it was transacted. It was dark, we could hardly find our way back again. Fanning brought me some of the plate, and handed it over the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Bird at that time?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I did not see him; I believe he was in the street. I had been up towards Redfordbury, and did not see him till all the plate was taken. We carried the plate to the Back-lane, beyond Rag-Fair. We went away all one before the other. When we got there, I saw none but Fanning and

               <p>Q. What share had the prisoners of the money?</p>
               <p>Kenney. They had none, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Graham give for the plate?</p>
               <p>Kenney. He gave 20 l. and 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d. I can't tell which, as Fanning told me. Fanning and I were chiefly together.</p>
               <p>Q. What house were you at when Graham bought the plate?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Fanning told me it was Bird's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. When Graham was sent for, how did you get in at Bird's lodging?</p>
               <p>Kenney. An old woman let us in; Fanning went in directly; Bird was not come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went first down into the area?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I do not know; I did not go down at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window broke before you ran away or after?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I do not know whether it was before or after.</p>
               <p>Note. This evidence contradicted almost all he had swore before the justice.</p>

I went into the shop, and said, Are you a carpenter? No, said he. Then I said, How can it be your saw? He said, he was sent by a carpenter, named Watson. I said, I must see him. Said he, If you don't like it, give it me again. I said, No. I sent my apprentice with him to see for this man, but no such man could be found. When they came back again, I took him before Justice Welch; there the prisoner said his name was Ross. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

I thought he was acquainted with some of my servants, and took but little notice of him. Some little time after I was going into the kitchen, I saw the cook talking to my little girl. He told me, she was telling him a man was gone out with something under his coat. I went into the kitchen, and said, I saw nothing but two boats; the maid said, she had just brought three there. I followed the cook, and saw him stop the prisoner in the passage before he got out into the street; he brought him back; the cook clapt his hand on his coat, and said, Sir, here is the sauce-boat; then he took it out of his pocket.

I was gone into a house; soon after Mr. Mosely came in, and said, You have had your pocket picked. I said, if it was, it is a silk handkerchief. I had not missed it; I felt, and missed it. He said, when you was turning to go into this house, I saw this man take your handkerchief out of your pocket; he had the prisoner and handkerchief with him.

She said, they were not her own, and if I would give her leave, she would go and fetch the woman that sent her, she was near at hand. I suspected them to be Mr. Lloyd's. She sent a little girl for the prisoner, who came before Mr. Lloyd did. I asked her if these were her property? She said, they were. I said, I am afraid not; do you know Mr. Lloyd? She said, Yes. - Do you work for him? - Yes - Are they not his goods? She made no answer. I bid her sit down; Mr. Lloyd came in, and asked her how she came to offer his goods to sale? He told them both he would transport them. The prisoner said the other was ignorant of their being stolen. Then she owned to the taking of them after she had been paid for making them; that she took them off the counter, and brought them away.</p>

               <p>Cha. Eyre, Esq; On Wednesday the 9th of May instant, about six or seven in the evening. my servant called me out, and said one wanted me. There was Mr. Smith shewed me part of a table-spoon, and asked me if I knew it? I said, Yes, it is mine; here is my crest upon it; said he, a woman brought the bowl to me to sell; it appeared to have been fresh broke. I said to my maid, Do you miss a spoon? She said, she washed them up but just now. (The spoon produced in two pieces, and a fellow to it.) The crests agree, they both are my property. The prisoner is a woman that takes the ashes away from gentlemens chambers for the cinders. She used sometimes to assist my servant; I have given her 2 s. a week besides her victuals, for these last two or three months.</p>

            . I live by the side of the Fleet-market, and am a silversmith. The prisoner brought this piece of spoon to me to sell. She first sent another woman in: upon my examining her pretty closely, she said it was not her own, but the property of a person at the door, which was the prisoner. I examined her how she got it; she said, she found it among some cinders. I said, it appeared to be fresh broke. I desired she would pull the other part of it out of her pocket. She stood to it a good while that she found it. Then I asked the other woman where she did business? She said, in the Temple. I said, if you do not go and enquire about, I'll have you committed. Then the prisoner took me to her own room, and took the handle of the spoon up, and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Wil. Knapp. I went with the last witness to the prisoner's room with her, as she had proposed if we would go with her, she would produce the other part. She delivered it into my hand, and I gave it to the constable.</p>

On the 17th of April, 1768, I heard a noise in the passage on that morning, between one and two o'clock, crying out, Looms! Looms! Looms! Broad Looms! Blast your eyes and limbs, get your pistols ready! Get your pistols ready! They were then in the inside of the house in the passage. There is a right-hand door and a left-hand door in the passage; the right-hand door leads to another house; they began breaking that door. One of them said, Blast you, Cox says it is the left-hand door. Cox was a journeyman in my house, and had left the outward door open for them, as I found afterwards; after that he turned evidence against Perrin. They began blasting their eyes and limbs, and called, Open the door! In about a minute they burst my room door open; two of them came in first; they turned the chairs and table up in the room, and got immediately on my bed, one with a pistol, the other with a cutlass. He with the cutlass was by me, the other was by my wife. I saw the glimmer of a light, and said, I would arise. He with the cutlass gave me three blows, one on my back, the other on my shoulder, and the other below my elbow; I was as black as my hat from my shoulder down to my elbow; this was as I raised myself up. The other kept with his pistol to my wife's head. They cried out, D - n them, blow their brains out if they stir. I was made to lie down again. I perceived them go to the drawer, where were four 10 l. bank notes, and one 20 l. thirteen guineas in gold and 17 s. in silver, and a crown in half-pence; they took it all, and seventy guineas worth of ribbon; there were an hundred pieces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300010"/> of it. The next day I went to Sir John Fielding and got a warrant, and took up Perrin. We went to see for the prisoner, but he got off to Dublin, with another man that stands indicted with him. Since that I advertised him, and he was taken at Coventry. I particularly know the prisoner's voice, because he formerly worked for me. He has a very odd voice; I could know it from an hundred people. He went by three names. I went to see if it was the same; I saw it was he, so I said no more. There was a light when they took the things, but they covered me with a pillow. I had heard the prisoner's voice before they came into the room, when they cried, Looms, blast your eyes and limbs! My wife is ill, or she would have been here; Cox is at Coventry now, I imagine.</p>

            . I live next door to Merlin's Cave, in the Spaw Fields, by the water-works. On the 14th of this month, a little after two in the morning, I heard a noise in my house; I opened my room door and peeped over the banmisters of the stairs; I had a gun by me, having been surprized almost every night. I found my two double doors were both wide open; I heard a whispering in my parlour. The first thing I saw was a man come out of my parlour, with this was candle in his hand, endeavouring to come up stairs. I rang the bell for a gentleman that lay above, to come down. He ran down in his shirt. The thieves ran over the bank by the water-works, and turned down towards Bagnigge Wells. I ran down and saw four of them; two went first, and two after them. One of the first had a bundle in his hand, and one of the other two had a bundle. I said to the gentleman, There they are; whip your clothes on, I will pursue them. While he went up to dress himself, I got my gun in my hand, and went behind them all the way to Bunhill-Row. Just by the French pest-house there was a carpenter coming out of his house to go to work, a little before four o'clock. I said, My friend, for God's sake assist me; I have a suspicion of them four men robbing my house. He called to the watch; the watchman ran after them; one made his escape, we took three of them in Bunhill-Row.

There came the father of Freeman, and cried ready to break his heart, and begged his son might be admitted evidence. The boy was asked about a gun; the prosecutor had lost a gun, The boy said, We took it, and I'll go and shew you where it is. Then one of the keepers of Bridewell that was there, took his hand-cuffs off, and took him the back way; we went by the Foundling Hospital, and in the field by my house, under one of the water-pipes, he went on his knees and put his hand under, and brought out the gun, and we brought it to Justice Girdler's (The counterpane, table-cloths and gun produced in court.)</p>

On the 10th of December, at night, my wife heard a noise, and awaked me about two; she said she thought somebody had got into the house; I thought it was the horses in the stable, and we took no notice of it; but coming down in the morning, we found the house was broke open: all was safe when we went to bed. They had broke in at the parlour window; the shutter was broke open, the screw that was to keep the sash down was forced up and bent: my bar was broke, and a box of halfpence taken away. I missed six silver spoons, a pound of tea, a bottle of gin, a red leather trunk, and some table linen. I never got any of my things again but the trunk.

Tudor was at the door all the time; we generally leave one without to watch. We took half a dozen silver spoons, about twenty shilling in halfpence; a pair of tea-tongs, that were not silver; some tea, and some child-bed linen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300013"/> some stockings, from a work basket; a shirt, and this leather trunk.

He said, D - n you, I'll have you by next sessions; after that I was drinking at the end of Fleet-market: who should come in but this Pagget: he said, How do you do, Mr. Underwood? you are wanted: I said, Who wants me? I do, said he: then in came three more: said Pagget, You must go before a magistrate. I said then I would go before Sir

I was had up again on the Wednesday; the prosecutor said this is a villainous rascal, and said to Pearce, You are perjuring yourself, and you want to take this man's life away.

My wife was alarmed by the noise of breaking the beaufet between one and two in the night, in the lower parlour fronting the street, close by the window: we lay, in the back parlour.

On Saturday the 19th of May instant, I kept my door open till pretty near twelve at night; (as my business runs pretty late on Saturday nights) then I bolted and locked my door, and fastened my window shutters; after that my wife and I were sitting by the fire side till between twelve and one: we heard the window light breaking; that was the glass over the door. I then judged my house was going to be attacked; I said to my wife, If my house is attacked, we had better wait till they enter, for may be they may, at another time attack us, when we are not so properly prepared. I proposed to stand it till they entered: we retired from the shop into the parlour; then I heard them picking the glass out of the frame, and it was falling down piece after piece. I pulled off my shoes, and went up stairs and brought down my musket and sword; I had kept my piece loaded sometime; as several houses near me had been broke open lately, I judged they would soon attack me. I put a little fresh powder in the pan, and rubbed the hammer. After watching some time, and hearing pieces of glass still falling, I heard, about one o'clock, a brushing sort of a noise; I judged they were then entering into the house. I said I believed they were then come in. I stood watching, with my parlour door in my hand. I had an inward door to prevent people from coming into the shop; that was double locked. I said, I am sure he is in, for I hear him move backwards and forwards in the passage. I had double locked the passage door. I presented my piece low to hit his legs, not to kill him. I snapped it, but it did not go off; finding that, I pricked him with my sword in his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he got in?</p>
               <p>Andrews. He got in at the fan light over the door. He informed me afterwards they put him in with his feet foremost. My wife had the candle, but, upon my opening the door, I knocked it out of her hand. The prisoner, finding my sword had pricked him, surrendered, and said he would tell me all he knew. I got him in my arms and held him fast. My wife went out at the back door and called murder, thieves! and some neighbours came: Mr. Gosset came to the door, and said, Let me in; and after that came another neighbour: there came in a man, a stranger, that I did not like. As soon as a light came, I heard something fall, which was this snuff-box, (producing one, with tinder in it) which I believe was put in over the door. I asked the prisoner what he would discover, and how long he had been in the gang; he said twelve months, or upwards. I asked him how many there were of the gang; he said fourteen or fifteen; I asked where they resorted; he said upon Salt-petre-bank; I asked him how many were in the gang that attacked my house; he said four besides himself. When Mr. Gosset and Mr. Stockbridge were come in, I asked these questions again, and then he gave the same answers. I thought it necessary to be upon him as soon as ever he was in; had I given him time to have opened the door, the rest might have come in, and been too powerful for me.</p>

When I came home, I found my desk had been forced open. I judged, by a large pair of the scissars which lay by, the screws were forced out of the desk; the lock was still locked. I examined my desk and papers: I found every drawer of papers had been tumbled over, which was, I suppose, to look for bank notes: there were a great many notes of hand, which I found they would not take away. I left in a canvas bag, on the Saturday night, nine or ten guineas, which they took away: there were guineas and half guineas. I-missed forty half-crowns, two crown pieces, two silver dollars, a remarkable medal, a silver pint mug from the kitcken, and four tea-spoons. Cook was missing; he had been my apprentice about two years (he is about eighteen or nineteen years of age): then my two apprentices went in pursuit of him; they brought him home about nine or ten in the morning: there was found upon him eleven half-crowns, and two half-guineas, I believe.</p>

            , facing Sir John's, I found him concealing money in his hat, and putting something in a handkerchief in his breeches. He was sitting facing me, and had an apron on. I moved over to him. I put my hand in his breeches and took out eighteen half-crowns and a dollar, and delivered them to Mr. Gee the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. from Lee. Did you see the money in my hand?</p>
               <p>Hill. No, I did not. I saw your hand in your hat. I only suspected you.</p>

I went down to Birmingham to work, and worked there about three months; business falling off, I was obliged to leave the town; then I went to my aunt; she gave me these things, which she said she had laid up and bequeathed to me, to keep for her sake.

            , came up to me on the 12th of May, about four in the morning, and told me my desk was broke open. I went down, and found my street door open, which I saw fast at eleven o'clock, before I went to bed, and the chain up cross it. I found the lock of my compting-house broke. I missed a 3 l. 12 s. piece a French crown, a Spanish dollar, a Prussian six-dollar, two English crown pieces, and five, six, or seven pounds in loose silver; there might be six or seven half crowns, two or three half moidores, a 6 s. 9 d. or two, and several five-and-three-pences, two four-and-six-pences; here were some half guineas, three three shilling papers of halfpence, a green silk purse; out of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300017"/> closet, in the same room I missed five large silver table-spoons with a crest-upon them, and the letter W on the back of the bowls, two silver tea-spoons, not marked, a little pair of sugar-tongs, and two pair of dog-skin shoes. The prisoner lived servant with me, and had been discharged from me about nine months before that time; he had been at my house the day before, to see his late fellow-servants; they all had a suspicion of him. I dispatched my servants to see for him, one went one way, and the other another; they took him the same day, the 12th of May, with some of the things upon him. I saw him searched; he had one of my pairs of shoes on his feet, and a pair of my metal buckles in his shoes. I asked him what was become of my silver spoons and tongs? He said, they were at the lodgings of a girl that he had kept company with, in Wentworth-street. The constable went there; it is between Whitechapel and Spitalfields; the prisoner went with him. Then we suspected he must have the money or the purse about him; and in his breeches we found 5 l. 2 s. a French crown that I swear to, by having a mark upon it, two English crowns, a Spanish dollar, a Prussian six-dollar, a 3 l. 12 s. a six and nine-pence, a four and six-pence, three thirteen and six-pences, five guineas, three half guineas, two quarter guineas, concealed under his ham, and fifteen shillings and six-pence in silver, loose in his waistcoat pocket. The prisoner owned in the presence of six or seven people, that he took all these things out of my desk. I asked him how he broke the desk open? He said, with a small sugar-chopper that lay in the window; and it appeared to be done by such an instrument. When I went to bed, it lay in the farther window, and in the morning it lay in the window next to the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he got out?</p>
               <p>Walker. He said he went out at the house door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with you?</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner came to me to light a candle that night this house was robbed; it was properly Saturday morning about two o'clock. I cannot say I ever saw him before he came from over the way from Mr. Walker's house, and after that I saw him go in at the door, and heard him fasten it; my place is just opposite the house. When he came out he was in his shirt, and his breeches on. It was much of his size; I do not say he is the man.</p>

            . I was attending the Rotation at Whitechapel, the prosecutor came there, and asked for an officer. I went with him to Mr. Rider's house in Angel-alley, from there he sent one of his own men with me, to shew me where the prisoner was. He was not at his lodging. I went a second time, and saw him in the street, going along, and the servant after him. I ran and laid hold of him, and said, You are my prisoner, and brought him to a public house near Whitechapel church, into a back room. Mr. Walker came. I searched the prisoner, and found a pair of shoes and a pair of metal buckles in them. Mr. Walker asked the prisoner, what he had done with the spoons and the money; he said, he left them in a drawer in his lodging. I went with him to his lodging, and searched all the drawers, but found none; but upon a half-tester bed I found five tablespoons, two tea-spoons, and a pair of tea-tongs, all silver, in a handkerchief. Then I went to the Minories, where he said he had sold a pair of buckles to Mr. Harding; then I came back to the public house. We took the prisoner's shoes off, and opened the right knee of his breeches, after that the left, then the silver and gold sell out in a green purse; I took them up, and laid them on the table before him.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Walker. I got up about four in the morning, and found the street-door open. I went into the compting-house, and found the desk broke open; then I went and called my master; he came down, and found his money was gone. I was present when the money was found upon the prisoner, and heard him say he took it out of Mr. Walker's desk; and that he got in at a window in the coal-cellar.</p>

I was coming from Woodford in Essex, last Sunday was a month; a man overtook me, and we drank a pot of beer together. When night came on, I was wanting a good lodging; a gentleman told me he could help me to a very good one. He took me to the <placeName id="t17700530-31-crimeloc161">Black Boy on Saltpetre-bank</placeName>

The prisoner at the bar was laying in the same bed. Seeing her in bed, I said, I would not go to bed, but I would lay upon the bed. I laid down without pulling off my clothes. I soon felt her hand in my breeches. I removed my money into my coat-pocket, and laid upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you move it?</p>
               <p>Smith. Not as I know of; my money was in a little leather purse, and that in a large one. I felt her hand going to one side. I put my hand in my pocket, and found my money was gone. She was going off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I never slept at all; I was not in the room above half an hour, and I had not laid down above ten minutes before I missed my purse. I laid hold of her when I missed it, and a man came up and sell to beating me about for some time, and in struggling we all fell down stairs together. Then the woman of the house came and beat me with a poker about the head. They turned me out into the street, and I was knocked down once in the street. I begged of a man to let me be in his house, or I did not know but I should have been killed. I went to bed, and there lay till morning. The next morning a man asked me what was the matter? I told him. He said, Could you know the person that took your money? I said, I should. He went into the house, and brought the prisoner out directly. I knew her again. He ransacked her; what he found, I do not know. I was told she had money in her stocking, but I never could know the truth of it; I never saw it since. There was five guineas, a six shilling and nine pence, and a nine shilling piece. There was some silver, but I do not know how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by so much money?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saved it at my labour; it is what I could save out of two years wages; I lived with a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business in London?</p>
               <p>Smith. I came to seek for work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was very sensible and very sober; they behaved very well till after I was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take your money?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; I felt her hand in my fob. When she was before the Justice she said, she knew nothing of me or my money either.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never saw the man in my life till the day I was taken up before the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you sure this is the woman that took your money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300019"/>Prosecutor. I am very sure; the blood that came from me by their beating me was upon her clothes in the morning when she was taken up. I bled very much; I could hardly see out of my eyes.</p>

               <p>Ward. I have known him about two years. He came down the yard in a poor dishabille; he said he had been sick, but I found since he had been in Tothilfields Bridewell. I having a regard for him, I offered to take his clothes out of pawn till he could raise money to pay me again. He helped to put my horses to my carriage sometimes, but very seldom. I was a friend to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge him?</p>
               <p>Ward. I found all his clothes which he had on under the manger, and he was not to be found. I was told he was an acquaintance of Ogilvie's. I went to Tybern, expecting I should see him when Ogilvie was executed; there I met with him. He had none of my things on. I got a constable and charged him; he confessed he had pawned my coat to Mr. Jones, in Westminster. I went there and found it. (Produced and deposed to.) He said he had sold the rest of my things; he owned to every thing but the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mills. I live in Cold Bath Fields, I am a carpenter and broker. The prisoner brought this measure to me last Saturday, between one and two o'clock, in a bag. He asked me if I buy old copper, and took this measure out of his bag. (Produced and deposed to by prosecutor.) I said, this is a very good thing. (I saw the city arms upon it.) He said, I suppose you will give me no more than the price of old copper, 9 d. a pound. I said, Honest friend, how came you by it, it is a regular gallon measure? He said, it was his own property, and I should have it very cheap. I said, I was of opinion it was stole, how long have you had it? He said, he had had it some time, he bought it at Camberwood, (I suppose meaning Camberwell) for four shillings and a pint. I said, I believe it has this day been used, I shall not buy it; I shall send for an officer and charge you. I did, and charged him upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here is E. C. 1764, upon it; I well know it to be mine.</p>

He took me to a public house, and gave me a pennyworth of beer and some bread and cheese. Said he, Carry this to that shop and sell it, and I'll give you a shilling for your trouble. I went in, and that man stopped me, and would not let me go for the man. I am an <rs id="t17700530-33-deflabel174" type="occupation">Irishman</rs>

The prisoner came cross Cheapside, and into Friday-street. I was at his heels. He ran into a warehouse; there I took him by the collar. Mr. Alderman Kirkman's servant said, he saw him pull something from his pocket. We looked about, and found the handkerchief lying on the ground. The mob wanted to duck him *, but I being an officer, said, they should not, and insisted he should be brought to justice.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Alderman Kirkman. I was in our warehouse, making up a parcel, between one and two, as near as I can guess, that day. The prisoner ran down the street, and into the warehouse, and throwed something from his bosom behind the door. I went and looked, and there found the handkerchief. (Producing a silk handkerchief.) This is it.</p>

               <p>I was walking along Cheapside, there might be eight or ten people together; there was a coach and a cart. A person trod upon a dog; he sell a barking. One of the men dropped a handkerchief, I took it up; a man came and said he would have it; I said, No, you shall not; then I went down that place. I was going to Billingsgate to buy some mackrel.</p>

Then I went from there to the Red-Lion, and asked leave to stay there till I could get something to put on. I staid there some time: I begged for a pair of old breeches to put on. I had this pair lent me which I have now on; and in that trim I was forced to go home. I went again the next morning, and desired to have my clothes.

He told me they had taken his keys and every thing. The next day they delivered his keys and his pocket-book. The girls told me his coat was pawned for three shillings, his waistcoat for eighteen-pence, and that all his things were pawned. I was angry with him, and told him he wanted cooling, and I thought he had got one. He was a little in liquor, having been removing some goods in Westminster.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Le Mar; my master was out of town. On the 4th of May, between eight and nine in the evening, there was a knock at the door; I went and opened it; there was the prisoner Bailey and two others. He delivered a letter to me, saying, it was for my master. Before I read the direction they burst in at the door and shut it, and one of them pulled out a dagger and stabbed me in my belly. I know Attaway was one of them. The two prisoners were two of them; but as for the other, I do not know who he was. Every one produced a pistol. They took a cord from a pocket, and tyed my hands behind me,. They took my watch out of my pocket, and took me by my arms down into the kitchen, having their dagger and pistols in their hands. They did my hands, and made me light them a candle; after that they tyed me again more secure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you much hurt with the dagger?</p>
               <p>Morris. I bled a good deal; but was in a condition to go about. They tyed my hands behind me, and brought the rope round my neck, and then round my face, bringing it over my mouth, so that it went through my mouth, and confined it open, and they fastened it behind; then they took me back in a dark place under ground, and bolted me in. In about two minutes time one of them came to see if I was fast. I said, as well as I could speak, I was fast enough, I after some time gnawed the rope in two, which gave my arms liberty. I then thought if I could get a brick out at the top, I might get up into the area, and not stay bleeding there while they were robbing my master's house. I burst open the door; and listened in the passage, to see whether they heard me, thinking if they did, I was a dead man. There is a little sky light. I got hold of a leaden pipe, and got up, and burst the window with my head. In trying to get through, I stuck half in and half out, and could get neither one way nor the other for about three or four minutes, with the ropes about me. At last I got out, and into the stable, and from thence into the coach-house, and out of that into the yard; then I called for help as fast as possible. I went out of the back stable-yard to a public house, and immediately five or six men came. Bailey was taken in the coach-house, and the other jumped into another gentleman's area, and was taken, as I was informed, somewhere in Bedford-row. They had taken the alarm. When I went into my pantry, I found the hinges where the plate was were broke, and the plate all gone. There was a great deal of it; three waiters, two coffee-pots, six candlesticks, one cross-stand, seven saits, seven spoons, two sauce-boats, one soup-plate, five table spoons, one snuffer-pan, three cannisters, a cannister-stand, two mugs, four cups, one little lamp, one cream-jug, all silver. Some of it was found in the coach-house where Bailey was taken, in a green bag which they brought with them. There was only a little girl in the house with me; she was in the kitchen. (The bag and plate produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Morris. I never saw either of them before that night to my knowledge; but I saw them so very plain, having time to look at them when they made me light a candle, that I know them very well.</p>

Then the little man at the bar corded him; then they took him backwards and put him in a back place; I shut myself in the kitchen; they saw me, they had pistols. Two of them went into James's room, that is on the same floor with the kitchen; the other stood with me. They were in the house when the alarm was given; I do not know which way they got out.

            . On the 4th of May I was making candles. I heard murder and thieves called. I was told there were thieves in Mr. Le Mar's house, and they had stabbed the footman. I ran; I found two or three people had hold of Bailey I stepped up to him, and said, Where are your confederates? Said he, They are in the yard, and they are gone over the wall. I went into the coach-house and stables, and then into the yard. I went to go over the wall; there were a great many garden-pots. I did not think it safe to go down. There was a little boy, I let him down; he handed me up this pistol and dagger. Then I was desired to come and take hold of Bailey; I did, and carried him through the coach-house and stable, and brought him into the yard, and sent for Mr. Clay, the high constable, and delivered up the pistol and dagger, that was out of a sheaf. I said to Bailey, How came you to be guilty of this? Said he, I was hired by three gentlemen-like men to go to this house to carry a bag for them, and they said they would pay me; and that one of them had a sweetheart there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dates. I am servant to Mr. Ducham. I heard the alarm the night Mr. Le Mar's house was robbed, after Attaway had got over the wall into my master's garden. Upon calling thieves, we all pursued. I saw him when about half way in the passage. He ran down Bedford-row, and we after him, calling Stop thief! and a soldier got hold of him. I am sure he is the man that I saw in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see him?</p>
               <p>Dates. It was betwixt light and dark.</p>

               <p>I was coming through that yard, I heard thieves called out; I went there to see what was the matter, and they took me. I live in Wapping, and had been to take my leave of a cousin in High Holborn, that was going down into the country. I never said I was hired to carry a bag.</p>
               <p>Attaway's Defence.</p>
               <p>What that man has been saying is as false as God is true. I had been that afternoon to New Bond-street, to enquire after business, and in returning home I met a young woman; we drank a pint of beer together. Parting from her, I was coming through Bedford-row, I heard a noise, calling stop thief! There was a mob; I did not know which side the way the house was on that was robbed. I kept running on, making the best of my way home. (I live in St. Luke's parish.) My way is through Grays-inn. As soon as I came to the top of Bedford-row, people hallooed out, If you do not stop, I'll knock you down. I kept running on. I then turned round, and said, If you mean me, I'll stop and go with you. They came and took me; they searched me, and found nothing in the world about me. I never was in the house, or that passage they speak of.</p>

            . I was then by the rails. I believe Shaw was coming towards me when Stevens fired. Shaw ran with his bowels in his hand to the Angel inn, which was about two hundred yards from us. The two first men ran away; then Stevens came up, and hit me a knock over my left breast, and knocked me down; there I lay till somebody came and took me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any of them make use of any expressions?</p>
               <p>M. Leighbourn. One of them said, It is well done, after the firing; that I believe was Holyoak. Mr. Shaw sent out for me. When I came to him, he said, he was glad to see me alive. A surgeon was fetched; he lived till the Saturday morning at half an hour past three, and then died. I know Holyoak was the person that came up and showed a pistol; and I am sure Stevens is the man that fired the blunderbuss. I am more sure of Stevens than I am of Holyoak.</p>

               <p>Mr. Curtis. I am a surgeon. On the third of May in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock, I was sent for to the Angel at Islington. I found Mr. Shaw lying on the floor in great pain. He told me he had been attacked in the City Road by three men, and one of them had shot him in the belly with a blunderbuss. I opened his clothes to examine his wound; there was a very large portion of his intestines came through the wound, lying loose upon his belly. I desired he might be immediately taken up stairs to bed. I sent for Mr. Hould, another surgeon, to assist me, who came immediately after the deceased was in bed. After a great deal of difficulty we reduced the whole of the intestines into the belly again. We secured the wound with proper bandages. The next morning I went to attend him again; there was Mr. Rogers his master, who had brought Mr. Dickinson, another surgeon. The wound was dressed, and a little above the right hip I extracted a bit of lead, which I have here. In the evening I saw him again; he seemed quite easy; there was a general mortification ran all over the abdomen. He died about half an hour after three one the Saturday morning; the wound most certainly was the cause of his death. I suppose the whole contents of the blunderbuss was lodged in the abdomen. The body was so very much putrified from the mortification, we did not open it.</p>

            . There is no doubt in the world but his death was occasioned by this wound. I was before Justice Welch; Holyoak said there, that he and Hughes were the two people that came up to the deceased first, and demanded his money. This was the Wednesday after the deceased died.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hughes by at the t ime?</p>
               <p>Dickinson. He was: there was a dispute between Stevens and Holyoak, whether the blunderbuss was only fired, or whether the pistol was fired afterwards. Hughes was asked the question, Whether it was the pistol or blunderbuss that shot the man? He said, he could not tell whether the pistol was fired or not; that he knew the blunderbuss was. Stevens said, It was a pistol went off. After that Stevens said, the deceased and he struggled together; and the man having a knife in his hand, they fell upon the ground, and by that fall the piece went off by accident. There was a dispute between Hughes and Stephens, whether the pistol did go off, before the Justice. The deceased said, the two little men came up first, and when he said, He had no money, they said, If you have no money, we don't want your life. It appeared one of them had a pistol, and he went away with it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said before the Justice, how far they were gone when the blunderbuss was fired?</p>
               <p>Dickinson. I don't recollect a word of that; I remember the deceased said, when they two had left him, he with the blunderbuss said, D - n you, I'll tip it you. The deceased told me he had a knife in his hand, and he struck at Stevens with it, in order to defend himself, and he struck the knife into the hole of the blunderbuss. (The knife (a long clasp one) produced, and the blunderbuss produced, and the mark appeared where the knife had struck against it.) The deceased was in his senses as much as I am now. Mr. Rogers his master, and I went together to him. He said, two short men came up first, and he took and shoved them into the road, and a tall one shot him. (Note, Stevens was taller than the other two.) He said, they demanded his money; he said, he would not be robbed, and took out his knife. I observed he was an active stout fellow; I dare say he would have managed all three, had they not had fire arms. He said, if any of these men are taken, I can swear to the blunderbuss, and to the man that shot me very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read. On the 8th of May, about a quarter after ten, I was accidentally at the house called the Yorkshire Stingo. A person said, he apprehended there were three footpads on the road. We immediately determined to go out after them; that was, myself, Mr. Heley, Mr. Roberts and his man, and a boy of mine. In about three hundred yards from the house I met the three prisoners at the bar. I asked them where they were going? They said, they were taking a walk, and told me where they had been; taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300031"/> up a great deal of time in going a little way. I desired a little conversation with them. I drew them to the Yorkshire Stingo. I suspected they had arms. When we came there, I asked them if they had any arms? Stevens said, Yes. He unbuttoned his coat, and delivered this blunderbuss to me. Holyoak unbuttoned his coat, and delivered this pistol. ( Producing one.) Hughes said, he had no arms. He was searched; there was a scabbard of a cutlass dropped from his coat or apron. We asked him, how he came by that? He said, he had found it by the side of the road. I believe Mr. Roberts went out, and near the place brought in a naked cutlass which fitted the scabbard exactly. Upon this we conveyed them to Marybone watch-house, and the next morning to Litchfield-street, to Mr. Welch's, for examination. There they had not been long, before they were charged with another offence; and the circumstance of the arms agreeing with the description we had heard of the arms that murdered the deceased, we imagined these might be the men concerned in it. We traced out where the young woman was to be met with, that was with the man when he was shot. We sent for her; the prisoners were remanded into a back room. Some little time after, a person came into the office, and publickly declared he had overheard some conversation between the prisoners; upon which they were brought in to the bar again. Then Holyoak accused Stevens of being the person who shot the man, meaning Shaw. They entered into an altercation, charging each other with being the person that shot. Holyoak had first said it was Stevens; Stevens said it was Holyoak. Stevens endeavoured to take off the edge of the cruelty by ascribing it to accident. He admitted his blunderbuss had gone off; but said it was owing to a fall which he had in a struggle with the deceased. Then the murder was referred to Hughes, Whether he heard two reports, or not? Hughes made answer, There might have been two reports; but if there were two, they must have been so near each other, that it was impossible for him to distinguish whether there were two or not. The young woman came in after; she seemed to be very much dejected and low-spirited. I observed when the prisoners were brought to the bar, she wrung her hands, and, I think, told pretty near the same she has here. She described two shorter men came up first, and after that Stevens came up and fired. I am sure she was positive as to Stevens, but cannot charge my memory with the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>Stevens's Defence.</p>
               <p>The night this robbery was done I never was out of my lodging from seven till eleven at night, then I went to bed; I have my landlord to prove it. I never had a blunderbuss in my life till the night before I was taken. We were coming along the road towards Paddington; I went into a ditch to ease myself, there I saw it lying with a pistol and cutlass. We thought there might be some bad people about that might use us ill, and we took them to defend ourselves.</p>
               <p>Holyoak's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I know nothing about it. Where I was that day, I cannot recollect. I never suspected to be taken up about it.</p>
               <p>Hughes's Defence.</p>
               <p>The night this murder was committed I went to Islington to see my father. I staid there till nine or a little after, and coming along the New River side, in order to come home with a person, when we were near the City road, we heard several people quarreling at a small distance from the river; we turned down the road, in order to see what was the matter. We had not gone above ten or a dozen steps before we heard a gun fired, upon which we turned round and went home immediately. I have known Stevens about three or four months, and the other I never saw above three or four times in my life before we were taken in custody.</p>

I did not come home till a quarter after ten, then I found him sitting by the fire, with one Mr. Grant with him; I did not know him. He did not go out that night, to my knowledge; but he might for what I know. I went to bed, and he went up to bed at the same time, about eleven.</p>

I had no more conversation with her at all.</p>
               <p>Wil. Fouch. I am servant to Mr. Knight, a chemist, in Nortonsalgate. The two prisoners came to me on the 29th of April, and asked for a quarter of a pound of aqua fortis and a quarter of a pound of arsenic, and I served them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you an account for what they wanted them?</p>
               <p>Fouch. They did not. I asked Robert, what he wanted it for: he told me, he was a farmer. He said, he had broke a bottle of aqua fortis, and came for something to dress his thigh; he was burnt with it. He had some cooling oil which I recommended to him. The bottle was broke within five doors of our shop; I saw it done. I saw him dress his thigh, but I did not see him wash it with the oil. I saw his breeches were all burnt and open. When he spoke for the arsenic, he asked his brother, if that would be enough? he answered, it would. Farriers use arsenic; they cannot carry on their business without it. I asked him, what arsenic he would have? He said, he would have the best. I said, I did not know which was the best; I thought the red was rather the strongest. He said, he would have the white.

This looks to be the same in the earthen pan. (He takes that in the paper in his hand.)

               <p>Q. from jury. Had you ever any conversation with him about this affair?</p>
               <p>Balam. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. Did you know of his coming to town on the 29th of April?</p>
               <p>Balam. No: he was a weekly servant to me, and on a Sunday I have nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. Did he complain to you of being burnt?</p>
               <p>Balam. No, not till before the coroner's jury.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. Did you ever send him to buy aquafortis?</p>
               <p>Balam. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. Did he ever do any business for himself?</p>
               <p>Balam. I don't know that he ever did; he lodged and boarded in the house; he could have no separate trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he charge this arsenick to you?</p>
               <p>Balam. No, he did not. I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Holt. Whether, upon opening her, you found her with child?</p>
               <p>Holt. No, she was not with child.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of a miscarriage?</p>
               <p>Holt. No, there was not. If she had been very young with child, that might not possibly be observed.</p>

On the 28th of April a woman brought the prisoner to me, and desired me to give her a little water for tea; that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300036"/> the first time of my seeing her. She came again the next morning, and fell asleep till half an hour after three; then I went down for a pail of water, and she was gone when I came up again. I had left her about a quarter of an hour; and I was informed she had been gone ten minutes, or better. I thought I had left her asleep. I missed my purse directly; there was only a five-and-three-pence in it, and that was gone: it was in a box that was unlocked. My child told me she had been at my box. She left her dog in the room, by the means of which I found where she lived. When I charged her with stealing my money, she gave me back two shillings of it: she said she was in liquor, and had she been sober she would not have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your purse again?</p>
               <p>S. Curtis. She left that in the room.</p>

               <p>I never took her five-and-three pence; but I gave her two shillings out of charity, fearing she should be turned out into the street. She came and took me up out of my warm bed. I had but one shilling and two sixpences. I said, In the name of God, take them along with you, I know no body in the world but God Almighty and myself.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner come past Wapping Old-stairs, between four and five that morning, the 25th of May. He had something on his shoulder; two men came with him; one had something on his head, between twelve and one. I said, This is the man that went past here in the morning between four and five, with something on his shoulder. I said he has been taking iron rails from somebody's door: he said what business was that of mine; I said I insisted on seeing what he had got: there was these screws. I stopped him, and the prosecutor came and owned them.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Great-Ormond street. On the 10th of May, my partner, named Jenkins, and I, found the prisoner and these goods on his shoulder. We first saw him within about twenty yards of the Foundling Hospital gate; he had them in a hand-basket: he told us he brought them from Oxford-Road, and was going with them to Cold-Bath-fields. When before Justice Girdler, he said he found them in the fields, coming from Tatenham-court road. Mr. Girdler desired I would keep the bundle, and I have had it in custody ever since; there were a kettle and a pair of bellows, two shifts, two shirts, two towels, two aprons, a neckcloth, a tin cannister, and a tin drinking pot. ( Produced and deposed to by prosecutrix ).</p>

            . I was a watchman in Whitecross street. Going up Bowling-alley, about three o'clock that morning, I found the woman's window open. I saw some panes of glass had been broke, and about twenty or thirty yards from the window, I saw this box lying. I took it up, and delivered it to Mr. Clark, the constable of the night: we examined it: there were the things mentioned in the indictment. We could not awake the woman: there was a slim man got in at the window: he awaked her. She came down stairs: we went in: there was a candle stuck to the wood; had it been left alight, it might have set fire to the house.</p>

About the twelfth of March, on a Saturday, Cook and I were together at the Cock alehouse in Old-street, about nine at night; we went from there to Mr. Napper's. I got over the gate, and he stood on the outside. I got two pieces of callicoe, twenty yards each, about a yard wide, from out of a shed, about thirty or forty yards from his house. I came over the same place to Cook; then we went into White-horse court to one Bilson; he was to buy them of us. He went out and fetched Wright and another man; they came to us at the White Lion in Christopher's-alley; then it was about eleven at night. They asked to look at the cloth. They passed for weavers. They measured it. I asked two guineas for it; at last they gave me thirty shillings for it. I never saw them before in my life. I told them, I bought it on board a ship. Wright paid me the money.</p>

Lancaster said to Wright, Will you have part of it? Wright said, he had swapped goods away about three weeks before for shirt cloth, and did not want any. Then Lancaster said, Will you go with me and pass your judgement upon it? They both went out of the house. I did not go to the public house with them; I went to the Cock. As they came back I saw Lancaster had got the cloth tyed up in a handkerchief. He asked me if I would buy some of it; I looked at it, and said, it did not suit me.</p>

We went up stairs; the first room was for company, (it is a public house) there we found nothing. In the next room we came to there were several boxes, several of them were opened; at last we came to a box that was locked; we asked to have that opened; Fox pretended he had not the key. We wrenched it open; in it we found some little bits of cloth which I knew to be my own; the pattern was my own, and had not been exposed; none of that pattern had ever been sold, not being finished; they wanted a fortnight's bleaching. There was another great trunk; they pretended not to have the key of that, and talked of sending out for a key; at last the key was found in a breeches pocket, hanging in a closet joining to the room; we were ten minutes before we could get that. The chest was opened; there we found two pieces of white cotton, with my name at the end; they were not quite clear in the bleaching, nor were they in a marketable condition. We carried Fox and his wife before Sir

She brought down a bundle, which was mine, and a gown, and two pieces of purple colour, in bad condition; this appeared to be made up into a gown. She gave information that Marckle, who kept an alehouse in Chissel-court, had dealt with Hampil; and she said,

             and Jagger had bought all these which we had found, of Hampil. Then Fox and Jagger owned they bought these things of Hampil. ( The cloth produced.) This is cloth never sold, nor never used for the purpose; they had cut it into table-cloths, pillow-biers and sheets. The cloth is very improper for that; they are not white, and they are very nappy, and very improper to be used for any such purpose. We got a warrant to search Marckle's house. We went there, and asked him if he knew one Hampil; he said, he did not. We said, he certainly must know him; he said, No. Have not you bought any cloth of him? No; he had not. We then told him, we had a warrant to search. We went up stairs, and found the door locked; that was opened. There was a line on which a whole piece was hanging, wet and dirty, as it came out of the field, not saleable; it was cotton and linen yarn. Some of the marks were cut off, and some appear on them. Mrs. Fox was an evidence in Essex against Hampil, but against her husband she cannot.</p>

Jagger went up stairs in Fox's house, and shewed me the things; he could not find the key a long time, at last he found it in a breeches pocket of Fox's. Jagger was sent by Sir John with us to shew us the house where he lived. Mr. Williams went up stairs with us; we searched several boxes; some were open, some locked. Some of the drawers were open. Jagger and Fox too, said they could not find the key of a large box. We found white cotton cut out, which Mr. Williams swore to. Then we went from there to Marckle's, and in a back room up stairs, we found a whole piece of white cotton, wet and dirty; he said, he had not bought it. When I first went into his house, I asked him, where the cloth was that he bought; he said, he bought none. He was asked if he knew Hampil; he said, he did not. He would not tell us of any goods till we went up and found them.</p>

I said, I dare say he did. He asked me my reason for thinking so, I said, Did not you know him when he was in the Hanover service? He said, Did you know him then? I said, I did. Then he, said, I do know a little of him, not much. He asked what was the matter; I said he was taken up on suspicion, and it was a pity a man should be hurt if he was accused wrongfully. Then he said, if I can be of service to him, I will go down. Then he went; Sir John examined him. I think he at first said, he had lodged in his house some time, and had never known any harm of him.</p>
