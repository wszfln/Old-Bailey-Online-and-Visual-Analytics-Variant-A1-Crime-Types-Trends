            </rs>. and throwing it into the House of Office. She was indicted a second time on the Coroners Inquest for the same. The Landlady of the House deposed that the Prisoner's Sister brought her to her House and ask'd for a Bed for her, but she had none to spare; however she made a shift to let her lye there that Night: the next Morning the Prisoner enquired for the Vault, which she shewed her, and went out to fetch something she wanted; that when she came back again the Prisoner was not come from the Vault, which made her wonder why she staid so long there, and as she was going to see after her, she met her on the Stairs, when the Prisoner complained that she was sadly Griped and that her Body was coming down, and a little after that it was come down; that she advised her to take half a quartern of Geneva, and went to call her Sister; that when she came back she went up Stairs to her, and perceiving something on the Ground and in the Chamber Pot, she had a suspicion of her, and went down to look in the House of Office, where she saw the Child; that when she came up again she charged the prisoner with it, who owned that it was hers, and that she put it there. Sarah Holiday confirm'd her Landlady and the prisoner's going down to the Vault together, her having half a quarter n of Geneva, and her complaining that her Body was come down again into her Hand: she deposed also that she saw the prisoner go down Stairs with the Chamber-Pot in her Hand, cover'd with her Gown; that it was a pretty lusty Child, and she owned it to be hers. Mrs. Wade, was present at the taking the Child out of the Vault, that they took up the Boards and took it out with a pair of Tongs; that she belived it came before it's time, and saw no Hurt upon it but what might be done by the Tongs. The Midwife was of Opinion that the Child was not at its full time. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that she came 5 Weeks before her Time, and that the Child was still born, that she had provided Linnen for it; that she was ill of a Fever at that time, and had rid the Day before 10 Miles in the Coach-Box, which might occasion her coming before her time. It appeared that the Child was born in the Chamber while the two first Evidences were there, who did not hear it cry, nor know of it's Birth till it was found in the Vault, and that it was not full grown.

             a Dyer in to his Glass. Pritchards House till they came to 30 or 40 piece and then took them away together, and that Joseph Lawrence, who was Mr. Pritchards Servant had stolen great many pieces out of his Masters Warehouse, and particularly that mentioned in the Indictment, and pawned it at the Prisoners; and to prove that he knew the Goods to be stole it was deposed that they where white Goods, and of such a sort that any bad, would have given ready Money within a Shilling of the Value for them; that they were worth 35 s. and pawn'd for 15 s. that when they went to the Prisoners to demand them, his Wife and Servant denyed they had any such, saying they never took in white Goods; but when the Constable produced his Search Warrant and would have gone up Stairs, they said he need not, their Servant should go up, and if there was any such thing should bring it down, that the Prosecutor gave the Prisoner notice to appear at Lawrence's Tryal, but he did not. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded that his Man took in the piece of Shalloon in his absence and enter'd it in the Name of William James, that he had kept it two Years, which he should not have done if he had known it to be stole, but have made the most of it. His Servant deposed that when they came to demand the Goods, he ask'd where William Jones was; they told him in Newzate; that he went up and fetcht the Piece down very readily; but they enquir'd after another piece, which they had not, and offer'd them freely to search: he produced the Book, where it was regularly enter'd, and the Note, in Court, and further deposed that the Prisoner who brought the Goods to pawn told him his Name was William Jones, and that they were his own Goods. It was also deposed that the prosecutor sent to the prisoner to tell him that if he would give so much. Money there should be no prosecution; and that one had been undyed Goods sold by a Hotpresser . That Mr. Chambers found one piece of Goods and sent it to the prosecutor who changed him with 3 pieces, and took 5 l. for the other two pieces and gave a Receipt for the same. The prisoner called several to his Reputation, viz. one of the Justices upon the Bench, who deposed that he was his Neighbour, and that when any brought Goods to the prisoner to pawn, whom he suspected, he used to bring them before him; Others that the prisoner was very careful in taking in pawns, and that he used to send his Servant to enquire after the Truth of what the persons whom he question'd told him; and that once he stopt Goods to the value of 50 l. and Advertised it in the Gazatte, whereby the Owner had them again.

That he heard the Words, where are you going, the Deceased would not tell presently but then said, going Home; it was Moon-Light and about two in the Morning. A Gentleman deposed that as he was going to Bed he heard a great Blow, then two more before he could get to the Window, then he heard more Blows, that he lookt out at the Window and saw the Deceased lye cross the Kennel, and the Prisoner about eight Foot from him, who said, you, would you stab me! get up you Dog or I'll knock your Braius out. That another came up, and they carryed him off; that the Deceased's Sword was upon the Ground drawn, and the Prisoner took it up and broke it. A Watchman deposed that as he was going down Dover Street about two a Clock, he heard a Voice cry Down you Dog, will you stick me? It was like the Prisoner's Voice who stood some way off, and had the Deceased's Sword in his Hand out of the Scabbard and broke; that he help'd to carry the Deceased to the Round-house; who was very loth to go in, and one of his Legs hung out, and the Prisoner threatened that if he would not draw it in he would break it. and abused him as he came along. John Cook deposed that he saw the Deceased that Morning, that he past by him and said Good Watchman, that he was sober and not troublesome. Mr. Westbreek the Surgeon deposed that he went to the Deceased at St. Jame's, and found that he had a large and a small Wound on the Right side of his Head; but perceiving them to be very dangerous he would not depend upon his own Judgement, but got Mr. Green and another to consult what was proper to be done, he was of Opinion to proceed to the Trepan; but't was concluded to try one Medicine first, and then made use of it; he was in Hopes of some Success, and found him sensible tho' Speechless; but he grew worse, and had no Rest; that when Mr. Green's Affairs call'd him out of Town, we had the Advice of Mr. Gheekir now Master of the Company, but could not preserve his Life. When he was dead I was advised to open his Head, which I did, and found on the other side a Contusion and small Fracture in the Scull, and a large quantity of congealed Blood, either of which Wounds were sufficient to kill any Man. Others deposed that they advised the Prisoner not to keep the Deceased (who could not speak) in the Round-House all Night, but carry him to a Surgeon; but the Prisoner replied, him, it will be times enough in the Morning . Others confirm'd the Deceased's being Speechless, the forcing him into the Round-house and his Leg lying out. The Prisoner in his Defence said, That he was Beadle of that Part, and several Robberies having been committed there, it was thought the Watchmen did not do their Duty, therefore he was ordered to walk from 11 to 4 to look after them. That while he was performing his Duty, there came two Men on Horseback with two Women behind them, who look'd like Country People going out of Town, and the Deceased went to pull one of them off the Horse, whereupon he bid him be quiet and let them pass civilly; that he reply'd. you, what's that to me? drew his Sword, ran after him quite cross the way threatning to stick him, upon which be turn'd and knockt him down But he could produce no Body to prove it.
