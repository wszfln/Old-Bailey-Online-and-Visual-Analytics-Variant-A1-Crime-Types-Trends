               <p>Q. Where was it that he struck you? - A. On this cheek, I believe. (Pointing to the right check.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did it stun you? - A.It knocked me down to the ground, but I was sensible; he knocked me down several times after that, and the neighbours cried out shame on him to use a woman so; and he said I was a b-h and a wh-e, and he would serve any b-h of a wh-e, that came to take my part, the same; he went away, and then I went to the Magistrate's; the officer, Mr. Brown, came to me, and said, I have got a warrant against you; I asked him what it was for; and he said,

               <p>Q. And yet he discharged him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went before another Magistrate, did not you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that warrant; had you that warrant to execute on the 15th of November last? - A. On the 15th of November the prisoner came to me for a warrant against Ann Griffiths; the back part of his head was cut very much; Mr. Staples granted a warrant; in consequence of that Ann Griffiths came to a public-house about an hour after, for a warrant against him for beating her; that was about three o'clock; I told her Gowens had got a warrant against her, and she must attend at six o'clock in the evening; I went to her house and she was very much in liquor, so that she could not attend at the office; the next day I went down to Gowens about seven o'clock in the evening, to know why he did not bring the woman down, and she was gone; I overtook her in Ratcliff-highway, and she was then so intoxicated that she was obliged to be led by another woman; she came into the office and had a hearing before Mr. Staples; she said then she had lost a twenty-shilling note; she was very much in liquor then; Mr. Staples asked Gowens whether he meant to hold her to bail for cutting his head; and he said he did not wish to hurt her, as her husband was away from home; and Mr. Staples said, shall I discharge her then, and he said, yes; I heard no more of it till the 9th of December, the day that the indictment was brought to me; I went to see for Gowens that evening, but did not find him; on the 10th, I apprehended Gowens, in company with some other officers, and brought him to the office; he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what he is? - A. He lodges seafaring men; I have known him about a twelvemonth; she is a woman that has frequently been at the office for assaults.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose, Gentlemen, you are satisfied by this time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I have two witnesses who saw the transaction.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was told that one Mr. Brown lived there, a captain of a West-Indiaman, who owed me some money; I knocked at the door, but nobody answered; I lifted up the latch, and went in.</p>
               <p>Lessie. The prisoner did say that he was informed Captain Brown lived there.</p>

               <p>Wellings. I believe the whole of the property to be Mrs. Stringer's, but I cannot positively identify any article but the bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the only bag of that kind upon Mrs. Stringer's premises? - A. No; I suppose there were twenty; we never fell these sort of bags, we always make them up into smaller ones; we never sell them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150008"/>Q.Might not Mr. Stringer, or any person in the house have given away that bag? - A.Not to my knowledge; this bag came with a lot in the Queen Indiaman; I have been twenty-two years in the house, and all that time they have never sold a bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to swear that Mr. and Mrs. Stringer never gave away a bag? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And will you swear that the warehouseman might not have given any of them away? - A. He could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you not applied to get into the place of that man, if he is convicted, or get it for somebody else? - A. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>JOHN WHITMARSH sworn. - I live in Craven-street, in the Strand, and lodge with Mr. Snowden: On the 23d of November, I was robbed about a quarter past five, or I do not think it was so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the day shut in? - A. No, it was not; it was a clear evening; a man came up the <placeName id="t18000115-10-crimeloc51">road, which leads from Battersea-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, whom you saw at that time, the person you had seen on the 23d of November? - A. It struck me very forcibly the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he was the person that robbed you? - A. I really have no doubt at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your watch since? - A. No. He put his pistol into his coat-pocket, on the left side; it was a bath coat with a black velvet collar; his under coat was a dark drab, with a strait cut; it was a frock coat, and no lappels; it was a silver watch, gilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the colour of the horse? - A. It was a bay blood horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. All that you formed your opinion upon was from a view of two or three minutes at the utmost? - A. True.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a round hat on? - A. Yes, and a great coat, open.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was all the opportunity you had of observing him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this man you did not see till nearly a month after? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was he dressed at Bow-street? - A. With the same great coat on, but a different close-bodied coat, and his waistcoat was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all agitated? - A. Not the least; at the time that he was at the side of the carriage there was a man not forty yards off, a gardener:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150010"/>I pursued him afterwards; the road was lined with people.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SNOWDEN sworn. - I live at Fulham: I was going there in my carriage on the 23d of November, about five o'clock in the evening, we were stopped by a single highwayman, who desired the coachman to stop, or he would blow his brains out; the man stopped, and the highwayman immediately put his head into the window on the left side, with a pistol in his left hand; he immediately said, gentlemen, your watches and your money instantly; quick, I have no time to lose; my brother, who was on the other side, said, take your pistol away, I have left my money at home; he is now in Derbyshire; then he took a watch from Mr. Whitmarsh, and put it into his coat-pocket, and still kept the pistol in the chariot; now, says he, gentlemen, your money; Mr. Whitmarsh pulled out a red morocco purse, and gave it him; says he, very well, go off, take your pistol away, we have behaved very handsomely; but before that he said, what, have not you a guinea or two, cannot you give me a guinea or two; then he took the purse, and put it in his inside pocket; well, says he, gentlemen, have not I behaved very much like a gentleman, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see the prisoner at the bar at Bow-street? - A. I was sent for several times to look at men; but I did not see the man. On the 21st of December I was sent for again, and I saw the prisoner and four or five more, in a row; I immediately fixed upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar was the person you had seen on the 23d of November? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all alarmed? - A. To be sure I was; I sat in the carriage in the corner; the sun was setting, it was king of twilight; I had a particular opportunity of observing his features; I have no doubt but the man that I saw at Bow-street was the same man; he had a large hat on, and when I saw him at Bow-street, I immediately remarked that that was not the hat; they fetched another, but I said, that was not the same hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. On the 21st of December, I wish you to recollect, do you mean to swear it was on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the 1st of January? - A. I think not; to the best of my recollection and belief it was the 21st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as far as your memory goes, you are as correct in that, as in any other part of your evidence? - A. Yes; I cannot be very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a month after the robbery happened? - A. Yes, thereabout.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw the prisoner but once at Bow-street? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.And then Mr. Whitmarsh was with you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I keep a coffee-house in Clifford's-inn-passage: I have known the prisoner Franklin three years; he kept a grocer's shop at Ealing when I kept a public house at Brentford; that did not succeed, and then he went into the fish line; I then got him to assist, now and then, the officers; my house is used by Marshalsea-court officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hindes and Baylis being discharged? - A. Yes; I was at the office at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Franklin that day? - A. Yes, I saw him in the morning; between twelve and one o'clock at noon I asked him if he would go with me; and he said, no, he would not, for fear he should be wanted; when I returned at half past four in the evening, I found him at my house; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150011"/>looked at the clock as I passed St. Dunstan's-church; I found him endeavouring to quell a disturbance that Baylis, who had been discharged, was making in my house, because my wife would not serve him; Franklin stopped to drink tea with me and my wife and my sister, and staid till between seven and eight; my wife knew him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he deserved? - A. He always bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner lived first in Ealing? - A. Yes, in both situations.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he turned Marshalsea-court officer? - A. No, Marshalsea-court assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to do with the Marshal-sea-court yourself? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always look at the clock when you go home? - A. I generally cast my eye at the clock, because it is so conspicuous.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you quite sure that you looked at it that particular day, if you look at it every day? - A. No, nothing more particular; I go particularly by the discharge that day; if it had not have been for the discharge, I would not have given my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner used this coffee-house? - A. As long as I have kept it; about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before that? - A. The George, in Brook-street; I kept it near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from when you went to live there? - A. From Brentford; I kept the One Tun.</p>
               <p>Q. The house kept by Shock White? - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep that house? - A. Three years.</p>
               <p>Q. It never occurred to you to have this sort of accident happen, to have people taken out of your house? - A. No, only Hindes; he was a Marshalsea court officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he charged with? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons taken out of your house, at any time, for any crime? - A. No, only some people of a search-night, to take them before the Lord Mayor; there were three or four Marshalsea-court officers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were taken out, and how long ago was it? - A. Five; and they were discharged the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other time at which any other persons have been taken out of the house? - A. Not since I have kept it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he employ himself all the while he was there? - A. In smoaking and drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a pepper and salt coat; I lent him five guineas the Friday week before he was apprehended, to buy him some clothes; a striped swansdown waistcoat I believe it was, with mother-of-pearl buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. He drank tea with you and your wife and sister? - A. Yes, and then went to smoke his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your house is it to Whitechapel? - A. It is a good distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your errand? - A. Nothing particular; curiosity led me to see the discharge. I never had any thing of the kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the charge when Baylis was taken? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else were there during all this time? - I cannot tell their names particularly; there was one person,

               <p>Q. Did White claim any part of the property? - A. No; he neither said or did any thing, but they appeared to be in company together.</p>

               <p>Broadbent's defence. I had been out of an errand for my father in the city, and returned home between eight and nine o'clock; coming down Charlotte-street, near the chapel, I picked up the property, tied up in this handkerchief, (producing one;) I went to the public-house that I use of an evening, and where Mr. White uses; I had mentioned there, that I had found such things, and White said, he thought he could find me a man to buy them of me; I had been with him to a Jew over the water, and he was to come to this house, and we were waiting for him when Mr. Griffiths came in with another officer, and took us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Broadbent, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Griffiths.) Q. Were these things ever advertised from the office? - A. I believe they were in two papers, after the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

             sworn. - My husband is a print-seller, in the Strand; the prisoner came into my service, on the 8th of November, as a <rs id="t18000115-20-deflabel105" type="occupation">servant of all work</rs>

                        targets="t18000115-20-defend204 t18000115-20-deflabel105"/>; in a very few days after she had been with me, I suspected that she was pregnant; I asked her if she really was not with child; I told her I had suspicions; she said, no, she was not with child; this was two days after she had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150018"/>my service; I mentioned it to her several times; at first, she said, she believed she was going into the dropsy, that it was a family complaint, her mother died of it; and the second or third time I mentioned it, she said she was so poorly, she believed she must leave my service: On the 26th of November, I was intending to remove to Bond-street, and she assisted in packing up, till she really could not do it any longer; about seven o'clock in the evening, she appeared very poorly, and while I was gone down stairs, she went into her own room, she said, she believed it was a violent complaint in her bowels; between eight and nine o'clock, I went up to see how she was; I found her in bed; I asked her how she was; she then told me, she was very poorly indeed, and was very sorry she was obliged to go to bed, to leave me in such trouble as I was in then; I asked her if she was well enough just to get up to hold my child, and she said, no, she could not; I asked her then, if I could do any thing for her; she said, no, she was very much obliged to me; I asked her then, if I should send for a doctor; she said, no; I asked her if she would like a drop of any thing mixed with a drop of water; she said, no; I prevailed upon her to take a drop of rum; when she had taken it, she seemed very much in pain; I asked her again, if I had not better send for a doctor, she said, no; I then lost her; I had staid with her, I suppose, about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate any suspicion to her at that time? - A. Yes; I told her, I could not think that those pains could be occasioned by a complaint in the bowels; I told her, I thought they were labour pains; I had had one child myself; she then almost scolded me, and asked me how I could take such a thing in my head, as to suppose she was with child; then I told her, if it was really so, to own the truth, and I would do every thing in my power for her; she then scolded me, and seemed to be quite angry that I should think such a thing of her; I staid with her about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then I left her; before I went to bed, between twelve and one o'clock, I went up again; I told her then, that her master desired I would send for a doctor, to know what was the matter with her; she turned round in the bed, and told me she was as well as ever she was in her life; I told her, I rather thought she was in labour; she said, no, she was as well as ever she was in her life, and thanked me for the rum I had given her; I staid with her about the same time then; the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw her again; I went into her room, and observed that she was in bed, and that the bed was tumbled very much; I asked her how she did, she said, she was a great deal better, and should be well in two or three days; she complained of being very dry; I asked her if she could wait till I made breakfast, and I would send her up a bason of tea; she said, no, she really could not wait till then, she was so dry; I went and made her a little milk and water; I thought that would not do her any harm, I took it up to her; when she took the bason out of my hand, I observed her hand was bloody, her left arm was underneath the cloaths; I asked her what she had been doing; I asked her if she had not miscarried; I told her I was sure she had; she said, I was very stupid, it was not the first time I had taken such a thing in my head; I told her then, she had either miscarried, or delivered herself; but I did not think she had delivered herself, because I thought she could not have done it; she asked me then, if I could be so kind to lend her some clean linen; I said, yes, I would go down and get her what I could get at, for all my linen was packet up; I waited till I warmed it, and then carried it up to her; when I came into the room again, I heard a kind of a strangling noise, it seemed as if it was in the bed; then I went and warmed her a little jacket to put on; I returned again, and heard a noise, seemingly as if it laid on the floor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the noise of the same sort you had heard before? - A. Yes, only more distinct; I asked her if she had not better lie in bed; she said no, she would get up; I asked her what noise that was, but she would not seem to give me any hearing at all; I laced her stays, and she got out of bed; I asked her to move a little on one side; I wanted to see what was making a noise in the corner of the room; she begged me not to trouble myself, but to go down and get my breakfast; I told her I would not leave the room, till I saw what was in the corner; she still begged me to go down stairs to breakfast, and she would clear it away herself; I desired her to move on one side, that I might move the bedstead a little from the wall, that I might get to see what it was; the bed was very near close against the wall; when she found I was going round the foot of the bedstead, she jumped over the bed, and stood before the dirty things in the corner; she would not let me pass to see what was there; I asked her to let me pass her, she said, no, she would take the things away herself; she packed them up altogether, and held them in her hand; she then gave them to me, and then I felt the warmth of a child through an apron; I laid the bundle on the floor; I opened the bundle, and in it was a child; it was a coloured apron, and a little bit of the coloured apron was in the child's mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. In that situation had it any opportunity of breathing, was any part left open for breathing? - A. No, it was completely covered; I took it out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150019"/>of the apron, and put it in her own under coat for warmth; I saw that the child bled very much at the nose and mouth; I ran to the door and screamed for help, the boy came to my assistance; I desired him to go for Mr. Whitfield, a medical gentleman, in Beaufort-buildings; I asked her how she could be so cruel as to kill the child; she said, she did not know she was with child; I asked her why she did not tell me, if she had not any thing of her own for the child, I had plenty of things that I would have lent her; I told her, she certainly had killed her child; she said, no, she never hurt a child in her life; I told her she certainly had; I said, if you had told me of it over night, this child would have been alive.</p>
               <p>Q. The child was still living? - A. Yes; I thought it was dying, which it certainly was; she said had she ever ill used my child; I said, no, she always behaved very well, and she said she was very sorry she had used her own so; the child lived till about ten o'clock in the morning; I observed a seratch in the throat; I said, do take the child, for she never shall see it any more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner always did endeavour to prevent your knowledge of that which you afterwards found out? - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had one child yourself? - A. Yes; only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are not much acquainted, of course, with cases of this sort? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned the scratch in the throat-in the labour pains, might not that have happened? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not about to leave your service within two or three days before this? - A. She was; the Friday before she had applied to me to quit my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon your desire, and your endeavouring to make her stay, that she did stay? - A. Yes, I did, till I got another servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen? - A. On the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You had observed several times appearances that led you to suspect she was with child? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And on the Friday you prevailed upon her, though she was to have left your service, to stay longer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to your child, her conduct was proper? - A. She seemed to be very fond of it, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that she had a sister? - A. She told me that she came from her sister's, or sister-in-law, at Fulham.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you understood since that clothes of every description were provided by her sister at Fulham? - A. The sister brought me some few things to shew me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon in Beausort-buildings, in the Strand: I was sent for to Mr. Random's; I went, and found a young child very saint and almost exhausted.</p>
               <p>Q. From what circumstance did it appear to be so exhausted? - A. At first the cause did not strike me, but I judged it might be from cold; I called for a bason of warm water; warm water was immediately brought me, and I dipped the child in it up to the chin; as soon as I raised the child from the floor, I perceived blood to come from the nose and the mouth, in considerable quantities; Mrs. Random asked me if I thought the child would live; I told Mrs. Random, no, I thought it would not; I thought the child was dying from loss of blood; it was not dead, but breathing very saint; I took the child out of the water, and gave it to Mrs. Random, saying it was of no use to use any efforts to recover it, for it was exhausted, and dying very fast indeed, from loss of blood; it died in a very short time after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the child, to see what injury had been done to it? - A. I did not perceive the injury at that time; the Coroner's inquest fat on the 29th, the next day but one; I then opened the cheeks of the child, and discovered a wound in the tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. With an instrument? - A. Yes, with a dissecting knife.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part of the tongue did this injury appear to have been inflicted? - A. On the left side of the upper part of the tongue, far back in the tongue; it appeared to me to have been done at several times with some instrument that was not very sharp.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By that do you mean that it was notched? - A. Yes, notched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you observe whether the child had been separated from the after-birth? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Not at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had any means been taken to cut the navel-string? - A. None; I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. As you saw this injury to the tongue, to what did you impute the death of this child? - A. I cannot say that the child died from loss of blood occasioned by the wound, unless it could be afcertained how long it had been bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the injury had been given at the time that you were sent for, could it have so exhausted the child? - A. No, certainly not; there was a considerable extravasation of blood under the chin besides, about the throat.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, was the cause that gave rise to that extravasation? - A. Some violent pressing upon the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150020"/>Q. From what you observed, is it your opinion that the child died a natural death, or by violence? - A. By loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that loss of blood occasioned by violence? - A. Certainly; but this I must observe, that possibly in the rude manner of her delivering herself, it is possible she might have grasped the child in the throat.</p>
               <p>Q.Would any natural manner of delivery have occasioned that injury to the tongue? - A. She had a laborious labour, no doubt of it, from the appearance of the child.</p>
               <p>Q. But could that injury upon the tongue have proceeded from that grasp? - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you then, from every observation you have had the opportunity of making, conclude that the child died by a natural or a violent death? - A. A violent death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The woman appeared to have had a very difficult time? - A. Yes; a long labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the profession a considerable time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And attended a great many labours? - A. Yes; for fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell me whether a hemorrhage is not usual where no violence has been practised? - A. Not from the child, from the mother it is very frequent.</p>
               <p>Q. And the blood from the mother may be upon the child? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have perhaps attended deliveries of the same unfortunate nature with the present, of a person attempting to deliver herself? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think spirits given to a woman under these circumstances will increase the pains of labour? - A. It would rather retard the labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course then, when the labour did come on, it would be stronger? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. As the labour is stronger, so in proportion the agonies of the woman will increase? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman in labour, I think you say, may grasp the child? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. A Woman in strong labour is not always possessed of her faculties of reason? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Q. A Woman under those circumstances may have grasped her child unintentionally, and her finger may have got into the mouth, and occasioned a wound by her nail? - A. No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think, if the woman had a strong nail, it might not have happened? - A. From the direction in which the child was born, from the appearance of the child's head, it was impossible; I am certain that the back part of the head must have been at the front of the mother.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it possible that you can ascertain that, without being present at the time? - A. Yes, I am positive of it; from the appearance, the finger might have got into the mouth, but the child must have been nearly born in that direction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A child, I presume, alters its posture as it comes from the body of the mother; does it not struggle to extricate itself? - A. No; the child till after it is born, has no motion whatever; the head turns round after it is completely expelled; sometimes the shoulders will stick in the womb of the mother, and in pulling the child, she might have grasped it in the neck.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You see in the rude manner in which they attempt to deliver themselves, their object is to get rid of the child as quick as possible, and in any manner? - A.Certainly; I consider that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.When the head is born, would it not have been natural for the mother, delivering herself in that rude manner, to grasp the throat? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose, instead of grasping the throat, she had, with a strong nail, put her finger in the mouth? - A. Then she would have wounded the palate, and not the tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear positively that the finger being introduced in the way in which I have stated, might not, in the way in which this woman was delivered, have touched the tongue, as well as the palate? - A. It might, but not like this.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have produced a wound from which the blood might slow? - A. It might, but not like this.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the most learned persons who have wrote upon this subject, have always found great difficulty in ascertaining the cause of death in newborn children? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at this advanced period, so many writers as there have been upon the subject, it has not yet been ascertained? - A. I know of none.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your prosession, you have been led to read books upon the subject? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It may have happened to you to have read some thoughts submitted to the public, by one of the most skilful men, perhaps, that ever wrote, Dr. Hunter? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it the difficulties you entertain yourself, are not removed by Dr. Hunter's work? - A. Dr. Hunter's work respects respiration in still-born children.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you read the work published by him in 1782? - A. I believe I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing certain by which you can come to a conclusion how the child died, or by what means? - A. I said before, that it died from loss of blood; I said that before I saw the tongue; but the subject upon which Dr. Hunter writes, is whether a child had breathed or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind of laceration of the tongue<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150021"/>was this? - A. It was about an inch and a half in length, across the tongue, and a quarter of an inch in depth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Having seen this wound, and supposing it to be done by some instrument, not sharp, was any such instrument found? - A. There were three knives and a pair of scissars brought before the Coroner's Jury, but none of them appeared to be stained with blood; the beadle, I believe, brought them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe more than one wound? - A. Only one, in the tongue, which appeared to have been done at several times; it was cut deeper in some parts than in others.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you distinguish between that which is done by tearing or scratching, and that which is done with an instrument? - A. Yes; because the skin of the tongue was driven into the wound.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surgeon in Boswell-court: On the morning of the delivery of the prisoner, I was sent for by some of the parish-officers, to Mr. Random's house, about three hours after Mr. Whitfield had been there; I examined the child, but found no marks of violence upon the child; it lay in the window-seat; I therefore thought it my duty to enquire whether the child had breathed; I was informed that it had lived some time after Mr. Whitfield first came; I afterwards attended the Coroner's Inquest, and observed the injury; the wound was across the tongue, and seemed to have been done at more times than one, by its irregular depth, and its figure; it appeared to have been done by a blunt instrument of some kind or other; the Coroner hearing this, asked me if I would go with the beadle to the lying-in ward at the work-house, and get her pockets, her trunk, and indeed her bed; I went to the prisoner's bed, and asked her whether she was aware that the child had bled at the nose and mouth, not intimating to her that we had discovered the wound in the tongue; she said, she did not know; and with great presence, and perfect tranquillity of mind, she surrendered up her things, suffered the bed to be examined, and her box opened; we found some articles of clothing, with some instruments which had no marks of blood upon them; (produces three knives, and a pair of scissars;) they were found in the box, I am pretty clear; it was either the box or the pocket, but I believe the box.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this? - A. A day or two after the delivery; the Coroner's Inquest were then waiting for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the effusion of blood have caused the death? - A. The vessels would have retracted after they had shed a certain quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. To what then do you ascribe the cause of the child's death? - A. Not to intentional violent causes; I should think it very possible, though I practise surgery only, and am not qualified to give a decided answer, but I should suppose it did arise from violence, though not from intentional violence; the child's head had suffered very much by compression in the birth; when I saw the child it was dead, and there was no appearance of blood about it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the wound on the under or upper part of the tongue? - A. It was on the upper surface of the tongue.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Stanhope-street, Clare-market; I am apothecary to the overseers of St. Clement Danes: I saw the child the same morning that it died, and I saw it before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend that the injury of the tongue could cause the loss of life? - A. I am not competent to answer that question; but I conceive it was a wound which had arisen from the application of the nails in extreme labour, which no doubt a paroxysm, or derangement of the faculties, might have rendered her incapable of knowing what she did, for the wound was an irregular one; I am no man-midwife, but the circumstance struck me very forcibly at the time of the Coroner's Inquest.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were the other two medical gentlemen present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you still of the same opinion, after having seen the child, and heard the opinions of others? - A. I am of opinion it was done from the difficulty of the labour, and the nails; I examined her nails the following day, and found them remarkably long and sharp.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Crowther.) Q. Might not a compression upon the back part of the skull force out the tongue? - A.Certainly; and a compression on the neck would do that.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. She lived there, I found her there; I asked her whether she had been ill; she said she had been indisposed with a cold, not very ill; I said, I believed she was about to undergo a very minute investigation with respect to making away with a child that she had been delivered of; she denied it, and said she had not been delivered of a child, and went very freely with me to Mr. Dunbar; I waited there, by the order of the church-wardens, to know what was the opinion of Mr. Judson, the surgeon, who was there; the girl was sent home to her mistress, and I was sent, by order of the church-wardens, to wait to know the opinion of another gentleman, Mr. Pearson; and after Mr. Judson and Mr. Pearson were satisfied of her situation, I was ordered to take her to the work-house; I asked her if she knew the situation she was in; I told her both these gentlemen are of opinion you have been delivered of a child, did you tell them so; she said, no, she had not told them; I asked her if she had not been delivered; she said, yes, she had, in her mistress's parlour, the Tuesday before, this was on Thursday the 12th; I asked her if any person was with her; she said, no, it was born dead; I said, how do you know it was born dead; she said she held it some time, and it was dead; I asked her if it was male or female; she said it was a little girl; I asked her where she had put it, if she had wrapped it up in any thing; she said, no, I took her to the work-house; the privy was searched for a matter of two hours, but we could find nothing that night; the next day, Friday, it was searched again, and I saw a female child taken out.</p>
               <p>Court. If you make use of this confession you must take it altogether, unless you can contradict it.</p>

             sworn. - I am warehouse-man to Messrs. Aylwin and Chapman: I received some information from the last witness; I went after the prisoner, and met him between the two warehouses belonging to Mr. Aylwin, with a large stone upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150023"/>his shoulders; I asked him what he had done with the half chest of oil; he said, a man with a white apron on asked him if he was at work at the warehouses, and he said he was; and he told him to carry it to the corner of Billingsgate; he said the person that gave it to him took it from him there, and went into the Gun-tap; I then asked him if he would go and shew me where the half-chest was; he said he did not know, but he believed he could; he went with me to the Gun-tap, and it was there, in the bar; I then asked him to take it back to the warehouse; I said to the person at the bar that it was stolen property, and they made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at all? - A. I think I have seen him on the Quays, but he never worked for us in the warehouse; he was employed by the carpenters for the purpose of carrying these stones; he had to pass by the door of the place where the oil was, but he had no business in there; I had seen twenty-five half-chests put in the day before; they were marked with the letter X, the same as an hour-glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not somebody say to you, when you were taking away the chest from the Gun-tap, what are you going to do with that chest? - A. Yes, but I do not know who it was; there were, I dare say, fifty people in the tap-room; I afterwards went to the Gun-tap again, but there were not above five or six people there, and I could not hear any account of it; I delivered the chest to the constable, and he has had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it you have told us the whole of your story? - A. I may have omitted some trifling thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not point to a person who, he told you, had employed him? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What does C B L mean? - A. It is the mark of a foreign fruit that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call yourself? - A. A <rs id="t18000115-23-viclabel120" type="occupation">warehouse-man</rs>

               <p>Q.There are many other warehouse-men in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they might have some of the same kind? - A. No; it is impossible and improbable; all the fruit that has arrived in this country has been under my care; and I am confident there is none of it in the hands of any other person; all the fruit that comes to London I take an account of, as cooper to the fruit-trade.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you part with any of these barrels? - A. No, it was not sold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to say that all the foreign fruit that has arrived in this country, came to your warehouses? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that no other person in the trade has received this season any fruit with that mark? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this barrel of fruit arrive in this country? - A. A very short time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take an account of fruit that arrives at Liverpool or Bristol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then might not fruit that arrives there find its way to London? - A. It is not at all likely, because at Liverpool they received their fruit much later than we did.</p>

               <p>Q. As you found a deficiency in point of weight in the box, at the time the rings were before him, did you perceive him take any thing? - A. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150025"/>not; I used my utmost endeavour to detect him, and kept my eyes fixed upon him the whole time, and could not perceive that he took one; the constable and two young men immediately came in; the constable was told to search that man, meaning the prisoner; he searched his waistcoat pockets, but I did not think he had searched them sufficiently, for I suspected that if the prisoner had taken the rings, they must have been in his waistcoat pocket, for he was certainly shifting his hands in and out of his waistcoat pocket; he searched his waistcoat pocket a second time, for I was not yet satisfied; and the constable observed that he drew his right hand out of his waistcoat pocket clenched; the prisoner then seemed inclined to make some resistance, upon which I rung our back shop-bell for assistance; several men then came in, and at last the prisoner's hand was opened, I then saw the rings turned out of his hand on the whited-brown paper, which I placed to receive them; there were twenty-four of them, all gold rings; the constable has them; they were sealed up in my presence with my seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - A. He said a great deal, but I cannot recollect what.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the rings afterwards weighed and counted? - A. They were, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the two rings that he had bought? - A. They were wrapped up in a piece of paper, either on the shew-glass or on the counter, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the weight of the rings taken from him, together with those that were sold, and those which remained, constitute the original weight before he came to the shop? - A.Exactly, in weight and number; there were one hundred and eighty-four rings left in the box, the two that he had bought, and twenty-four that were taken from him, made up two hundred and ten; I examined two of the rings that were taken from him, I found upon them the marks which I had put upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those twenty-four rings? - A. Six pounds: then he was secured and taken to the Compter; the next day I examined the other twenty-two rings, and they all had my mark.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was this man a stranger to you? - A. Yes; but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEATHERBOURG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Nunn, bookseller, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I know the prisoner perfectly; I have seen him before; he came to my master's house, as near as I can guess, about a quarter before five, on the Monday before Christmas-day, he brought a boy with him, with some books, and asked Mr. Nunn if he would purchase them, and he said, no; I recollected his person then; he had some time before brought Mr. Marryat's books; I told Mr. Nunn that was the man that had brought Mr. Marryat's books, and said, I would go and take him; I followed him down Wild-street, into a bookseller's shop, where I took him; I told him they were not his property; he said, they were, he had bought them; I sent my master's son, who came down Wild-street with me to Bow-street, for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the books when you stopped him in this shop? - A. Upon the counter, close by him; the officer came and took him to Bow-street, and I took the books, which were delivered to the constable, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn. - I am one of the persons belonging to Bow-street: On Monday the 23d of December, between five and six o'clock, I was fetched to take charge of this man, for stealing some books; he told me the books were his, that he gave twenty-five shillings for them; I then secured him, and took him to Bow-street; I have had them ever since. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>HON. SPENCER PERCIVAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I lost all these books, and this one I can speak positively to, because there is a great deal of my own hand-writing in it; it is the second volume of Burrow; the first witness is my laundress's daughter; there are five volumes of Burrow, and three of Brown's Reports in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing at all to say.</p>

When I had left the old man, I saw the prisoner run past me in the Temple; I ran after him, and he ran up the first court he came to, in the Temple; then a gentleman holloaed out, stop thief, and he bid himself in some chambers; Mr. Davis, that lives with Mr. Mortimer, the gun-maker, in Fleet-street, went after him, and collared him.</p>

Yes; the whole stock of silk handkerchiefs was taken out of the press, the accompting-house desk was forced open, the watches and the cash, which I locked up there the night before, were gone; I then went to the back part of the house, my servants accompanied me, I found the shutter of the door wrenched out, that is the door that opens into the yard, the iron work wrenched from the shutter, a pane of glass taken out of the door, the box which the lock locks into wrenched off, the inner bar which makes fast the folding doors continued across the scullery-door, and at the end of that bar a staple with a hasp goes over, and a pin through the staple, that was taken down and lying upon the floor; lighted matches had been made use of to unfasten that bar to give light, for there were matches lying about; then we proceeded into the yard, and found a piece of supersine cloth, two pieces of fine Yorkshire cloth, two great coats, a boy's great coat, a new pair of boy's shoes, and an iron crow; we then proceeded to the outer door, which communicated with a court that goes into Hayden-yard-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an open public court? - A. Yes; it is called Red-lion-court; the bolt of that door was drawn back, and the staple drawn out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the back part of your premises when you went to bed over night? - A. I saw them all secure, the bar, the windows, the door and all, about eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How do you know there were so many halfpence? - A. I counted them last Christmas but one, and they have remained there ever since, and have been increasing since that time; there was then ten pounds eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Of what value may the whole be? - A. Two hundred and ten pounds, and upwards; they were the joint property of the partnership concern.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you heard any noise in the course of the night? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you drive the hackney-coach, No. 66? - A. Yes; for Mr. Josling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hall and Chapman? - A. Yes, two of the prisoners at the bar; I was hired by them on a Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the officers took you into custody? - A.About four days, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the month it was? - A. No, I do not; I was hired by the prisoner Hall, between twelve and one o'clock at night, in the Minories; Chapman was with him, and another man that is not here, to carry some bundles to the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; I was standing at the corner of Haydon-yard, in the Minories, when he hired me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there at that time? - A. I was watering my horses to go home; Hall said, he wanted a coach to go to the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; I staid till near four o'clock, and then they all three came and ordered me to the top of Crown-street; they had three large bundles which they put into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what they put into the coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any thing of these people in the intermediate time? - A. No; not till they brought the bundles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did either of them give you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150030"/>an account of what goods they had? - A.No; one of them rode upon the box, and the others walked.</p>
               <p>Q.Which of them rode on the box? - A. I am not positive, but I think it was the man that is not here; when I came to the top of Crown-street, they were there; they all three went into a house there; they took the bundles with them into the house, and I thought I saw them take out an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did they take that iron crow? - A. Into the house with them; they did not pay me any thing; I was to follow them into the house, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not? - A. After I had seen the crow I thought they had been doing something wrong, and I did not like to follow them; and I went home directly without being paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with the officers to this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them the same house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were first called in the Minories, by Hall, you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going home; you had no idea of a fare at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you were spoke to and hired by a person at some other part of the town? A. Yes; but that was at Drury-lane House: I had a fare to the Minories; I got there about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. And you staid there till between twelve and one, watering your horses, and waiting for the person that spoke to you at Drury-lane? - A. No; that person wished me a good night there, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea in the world but that it was a common regular thing, till you saw the crow? - A. No; I did not know any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said any thing to the contrary? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you staid there till near four o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Without their giving you any earnest? - A. Yes; one of them took my number.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where they went to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When one rode upon the box and the others walked, you had no suspicion then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said you had a guinea for your fare? - A. No; Hall told me I should have a guinea, when he hired me.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man accosted you in the Minories, told you he would give you a guinea, kept you three hours, and then brought out the bags, and yet you did not suspected any impropriety? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not follow them into the house, but drove home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been promised a guinea for three hours work, before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you suspected something wrong, of course when you went home you told your master this? - A. No, I did not; I told him I had been waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you had lost your fare? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not tell him you had been waiting three hours for three persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you had been carrying an iron crow? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At last you were taken into custody by the officers, and then you accused some other persons? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The officers enquired of you where you had been? - A. Yes, and I told them.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. What did you suppose these people meant to give you a guinea, instead of eighteen-pence, for? - A. They did not tell me for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you had no suspicion at all that there was something going on that was not right? - A. I did not till I saw the crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should they offer you a guinea, then? - A. It was late at night, and rainy; they were dressed in sailor's clothes, and said they had come from on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this man that spoke to you at Drury-lane play-house? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name? - A. No; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never mentioned his name? - A. I believe his name to be Powell, but I do not know; I had seen him several times before.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you seen him before? - A. He was a coachman formerly; and travelled about the country with a horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town does he live in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you met him before? - A. I had met him in the street, and I had seen him at different watering-houses; and I have seen him in the ranks with his coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing all the time you were waiting; you were not watering your horses for an hour and a half? - A. I had been in the public-house, and had my supper.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon were you taken up? - A. On the Sunday night after.</p>
               <p>JOHN READ sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable: I apprehended Salmon, the coachman, on the 3d of November; and in consequence of some information I received from him, I went and took Hall and Chapman in Crown-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150031"/>street; I saw them come out of a house in Crown-street; it was a house belonging to a Mrs. Batt; Sansum laid hold of Hall, and Chapman made his escape as far as Finsbury-square very near, and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you explained the business before Chapman ran away? - A. No; Smith came to my assistance, and we took him to the Compter. I found Mrs. Batt in the house; I searched the house, and found the property that Sansum has to produce; here is a stamp for stamping dollars that I found, and an instrument for casting bullets; that is all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mrs. Batt was taken into custody, was she not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SANSUM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with Salmon to a house in Crown-street, adjoining Sun-street; Read, Tipper, and Smith were with us; he shewed us the house, No. 19, Crown-street; Mrs. Batt's; as I came past the the window, I saw Chapman and Hall talking with Mrs. Batt, in her room; the window was open; I immediately pulled the check-string; we were in a coach; I said, there is Hall, for I knew him very well; I jumped out of the coach, and when I got to the house, they were both got out into the street, and walking towards Finsbury-square; I ran and pursued, and caught hold of them both, one in one hand and the other in the other, by the collar; Chapman got away from me, and Hall I secured; I then brought Hall back to Mrs. Batt's room, where I saw him first; Read and Smith brought back Chapman; I then began to search the apartment where I saw them, and in searching in Batt's work-shop, these things were found; and in the room where I had seen them, we found this ticket and a bit of cloth; I searched Hall, and found the copy of his freedom as a fellowship porter, and his tally, and a watch; I then went up stairs into the garret.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Look at this bit of paper, marked seventeen yards? - A. Yes, that is the ticket; in searching in Batt's work-shop, I found these scattered about; (producing a quantity of cuttings of great coats;) Batt is a chair-maker; and in searching farther, I found this fag-end of some blue cloth, with a ticket upon it, as it is now; (produces it;) in searching further, I found this piece of brown paper with some mark upon it; (produces it;) I also found this centre-bit, this small saw, and this iron crow; this crow I have tried, both ends of the crow, the small end at the outer door, and it just sits the place to wrench off the lock; the mark between the two folding-doors corresponds with the broad end; I afterwards went to search the prisoner Boreham's lodgings; in consequence of information I received from Mrs. Batt, on Wednesday the 6th of November, I asked her for the property that was brought from Mrs. Batt's apartments; and she said she knew nothing of any property; I said I was sure she did; and I, with the assistance of another officer, searched the place; I told her she must go along with us; then she said there were two boxes brought from Batt's apartments; I cannot rightly say whether she said Sunday night or Saturday night; and that they were fetched away by two porters in smock frocks; she said she had an order to deliver them; I asked her where is the order; then she said she had not got it; but that she delivered them to two men; I asked her who they were; she said she did not know who they were; she described them as large boxes, corded up; I then brought her away with me to the Lord Mayor; I searched her, and upon her found half-a-guinea, in this small bag, separate from the rest of her money; I gave her the half-guinea back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know where Batt is? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have taken some pains to find him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe he has absconded on this account? - A. I believe he has.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it to be Hall's lodgings? - A. I made every enquiry that I could; I found his wife living there; on searching the room, I observed upon the dresser a velvet jacket, and in searching it, wrapped up in it, was a check shirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That is just as common a jacket and as common a shirt as any about own, I believe? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Salmon.) Q. Look at that jacket and shirt; did you see such a jacket and shirt the night your coach was hired? - A. Hall had such a jacket as that on; but I cannot say it is the same; and he had a check shirt on, but I cannot say that that is the same.</p>

Yes, a great many bundles; I do not know rightly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150032"/>how many; they were carried up into the workshop, up three pair of stairs; they seemed to be cloth and checks, and I believe there were handkerchiefs.(Mr. Gurney and Mr. Alley contended that the witness was an incompetent witness, and the Court being of the same opinion, her examination did not proceed.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Laycock.) Q.Look at that piece of brown paper? - A.This is part of the paper that one of the pieces of cotton was tied up in that was lost that evening; I know it by the writing upon it; it is the manufacturer's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of cloth with the ticket sewed to it? - A. This is the head-end of one of the pieces that was taken from our shop that night; here is our private mark upon it, E B, in the handwriting of one of my clerks.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at those cutting found by sansum? - A. I have no doubt but these are pieces of coats that I lost, unmade-up. I was present when Sansum tried the crow upon the door, and the marks corresponded with the crow.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the name of the clerk whose handwriting you say that is? - A. Phillip Prouting.</p>

I am an officer of Worship-street: I was in company with Armstrong when he apprehended Jones, in Chiswell-street; after that we found out where he lodged, in Duke's-court, Crown-street; I went there, and waited there, I dare say, an hour and a half, or two hours; the prisoner Elizabeth Jones, otherwise Brockhurst, was there; Armstrong was not; I asked her if Jones was at home; she said, no; I asked her when she expected him home; she said she did not know, for he was in the country; I searched, and took down a picture that was pasted up, and behind that was four duplicates of silk handkerchiefs pawned at different pawnbrokers; and I found a pair of shoes in the apartment which Jones owned to be his.

               <p>Q.(To Laycock.) Had you sold any shoes between the 29th of October and the time that your house was robbed? - A. I had not, except eighteen pair that I had packed myself for Guernsey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to say that your servants had not sold any? - A. If they had I should have received the money; if they were sold, they were sold without my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the sailor and the coal-heaver do any thing? - A. Not a halfpennyworth; the coal-heaver desired. I would drink a pint of beer, and walk out, for he wanted to speak to his brother, that he had not seen these seven or eight years; I was obliged to pay for the beer myself afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any body else there at the time? - A. The servant girl, but no customers.</p>

               <p>Howell's defence. I saw these two sailors get down from the top of the coach; I was standing looking at the coach, and these two sailors asked me where to get something to drink, and they swore and d-d their eyes and limbs that I should go with them, and have something to drink; then Peters took us to a hatter's shop, and bought a hat, and gave me his old one; then he took us to a barber's shop, and he was very drunk, and dropped some money there, under the grate; then we went to a house in Fleet-market, and he called for a pot of egg flip; then he said he wanted something to eat, and we got some steaks; then he went right up Field-lane, into the Castle, and I went away to work; when I came in the evening, Mrs. Gibbons said the man was robbed, and the constable should be sent for; and then I told her I would not stir till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Thomas's defence. When we got to Fleet-market, he asked me to go and drink; I told him I wanted to see my relations in the Hackney-road; I was very much in liquor, and I went with him to the Castle; I thought if I staid much longer, and drank any more, I should not get home, and being in liquor I happened to leave that bundle behind me; I am very innocent of it; when I got off the stage I bid him good-by, and did not want to go with him at all.</p>

               <p>MARY HIGGS sworn. - On the 26th of December, Mrs. Rix was taken ill; I removed the gown into the front room, I had ironed it; between twelve and one o'clock, the same night, the prisoner came to ask for lodgings; I told her she could have a lodging; she said she would go and let her husband know, and they would both come together; I saw nothing of the prisoner till three o'clock in the morning; I had been under the necessity of going to No. 4, and upon returning, I saw the prisoner come out; I asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted a lodging; I told her I had informed her before that she could have one; I asked her what she had got in her apron; she said she had got her child's gown; I pulled down her apron, and saw it was Mrs. Rix's gown; I called the watchman, and gave the gown into the watchman's hands. (The watchman produced the gown, which was deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>

I went in to ask for a lodging. and the prosecutrix was not at home; I told her I was very tired; she said she saw that I got my bread by washing, by my hands being white, just come from the tub; she told me she could get me a great deal of work if I lived that way, and she gave me that gown to wash; I have four children.</p>

No; I neither promised her nor threatened her; she knew that I suspected her; she said, how do you do; I said, you must needs know how I do; I told her husband she had robbed me, and he said, I might do what I liked; I might hang her, or do what I pleased; she told me she was the thief, and the only thief; I asked her how she got into the room; she said, by a false key; I asked her how she opened the little trunk; she said she had a little tea-chest key that opened it; I asked her where it was; she said she had put it down the necessary; I asked her for the key of the room that opened the door; she said, she could not give it me that day; then she took me into a back shed, and took a shovel and a saw, and dug the mould up, and a key appeared; she dug up again, and another appeared; she dug up four keys; I tried one of them, and found it opened one trunk, out of which I had lost these things.</p>

             sworn. - The prosecutor came to my house on Tuesday the 7th, and staid till between six and seven, when the prisoner came in; the prisoner went into the back room, and called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner putting the prosecutor to bed? - A. Yes, I followed them up stairs, and I asked him what he did there; it was a liberty I did not allow; he was then putting Dodson to bed; his cloaths lay upon the ground close by the bed where he got into, and I desired him to get into the other bed; I desired the prisoner to go down stairs; he said he would not go, he would stay there for five minutes; I took both the candles in my hand, and was going to leave him in the dark; but finding he would not come, I left one candle; but before that I had picked up his clothes off the floor, and put them in a chair; and I then had the chain of the watch in my hand; I went down; I had not been down three minutes when I saw the prisoner come down stairs; and he said, you had better give

             some anniseed, but warm it first; I directly thought there was something amiss, and I immediately ran up stairs; he went out to the door with a pipe, as if he was only going to the door; I went up stairs, and saw that the breeches had been moved; I examined the breeches, and found the money and watch and every thing gone; the prisoner did not return.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH JERNO sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Tower Hamlets militia: I found a pen-knife and a pocket-handkerchief upon the prisoner. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Dodson. This is my watch: I am sure I had it when I went up stairs; the knife has the two first letters of my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your watch cost you? - A. About four months ago I gave two pounds seven shillings for it; the chain cost me six shillings and sixpence, and the seal four shillings and sixpence, and the knife one shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking with Dodson at a free and easy club that is held at Mr. Gibson's, he was very drunk, and I took off his clothes, and put him to bed; he desired me to take his watch and other things to take care of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime with which I am charged, I am intirely innocent of; I am consident my word, as a prisoner, will avail but little; but, my Lord, it was regularly signed by the parties who had a right to sign it, and made over to me, and therefore I conceived myself justifiable in converting it to my own use; knowing the sufferings of those, who do commit such crimes, would have deterred me; but these men knew, that if I had not made the property good, it would not have been made good, and they have applied to the Bank to make it good; they have done it, and my life is in danger; I hope, gentlemen, you will take my case into your consideration; and when you have so done, if you are of opinion that I am guilty, I shall contrive to meet my fate with as much resignation as my situation will allow.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any sacks in the cart when he set out? - A. No; Jones brought the sacks, and then I called the watch to my assistance; the watchman was within ten yards of me, and no watchman came to my assistance; I got a constable, and gave charge of Jones; he had a hearing on Monday at Hatton-garden, and because I would not swear positively that he had any property about him, he was discharged; a day or two afterwards the prisoner came, and voluntarily surrendered himself up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, from the appearance of the cart, that there were any grains missing? - A. Yes, there were; he came and said he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise? - A. I told his brother I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what he said. Were the grains in the cart all your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Ever since the 1st of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you buy the grains of? - A.Mr. Tickler.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of grains he received? - A. I know what I must pay for; I am obliged to take all that they bring.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not measured at the time they were delivered to him? - A. No; but I can tell by the look of the cart whether any grains are gone out of the cart or not.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cart is pretty full, the shaking of the cart may throw a little out? - A. Yes; when they have gone a little way over the stones, they sink, and get lower; but if a shovel or a bushel is taken out of the cart, it may be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner delivered himself up voluntarily? - A. Yes; in consequence of my saying I would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know Jones is upon bail now? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You learned that this woman was a married woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you that the person she expected at home, was her husband? - A. No; only that she expected somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not turn out to be the most aukward person in the world; was it not the husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the husband, when you came to enquire for his wife as a woman of the town, threaten to beat your brains out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you talked of the watch, did he not say you should have no watch from that house? - A. No; he insulted me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had done to your wife what you had done to his, would not you have knocked my brains out, if you could have laid hold of me? - (The witness gave no answer.)</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you do not mind these things in Germany? - A. She was in that business.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mind these things in Germany? - A. I cannot give any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the watch upon the table yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And ran away, for fear of this somebody? - A. I did not run away.</p>
               <p>Q. When she told you she expected somebody disagreeable, you brushed off, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Pray how much did you pay for this crim. con. for which many a man has paid five thousand pounds? - </p>

            ; and then my master wrote a check in the name of James-Blackman Snook, and the prisoner took his money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you present at the time the horse was brought to your yard? - A. No; it was brought by a stranger that the ostler at the Maiden-head, in St. Giles's, sent it with.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the horse in the possession of the prisoner? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bishop.) What time was it that your servant delivered the horse to Marsden? - A. On the Sunday about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Hollingsworth. I took the prisoner the very next day, after my master heard of the horse being stopped, somewhere about the beginning of December, at No. 1, Portland-street, he lodged there; when we were coming out, Mr. Langhorne asked him if he remembered receiving the money for a black horse, on the 18th of November; he said he did; Mr. Langhorne then informed him that it was a stolen horse; he said he would give us information where he got the horse, but he must step home to his wife first; then I walked after him, to see that he went to his house, and, instead of going to his house, he ran through the passage, caught hold of the back door, and kept me in the house; I recollected the next house, and got over the wall; by that time he had got out of his own yard to the next premises, over another wall, and was trying to get in at the back part of the house, but the door was fast; I asked him why he ran away, as he told me he could tell the person that he had the horse of; I told him he had better go with me; he said he would if I would let him go over the wall, which I did; and then he gave a spring from me, and went over a number of back premises, and I after him; he then got into the farmer's yard, and when he got there the back door was open, and he went through the house, and I after him; at last he ran into a butcher's shop, and there I took him; I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you mention one word of this before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you bound over by the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story you have told to-day, and yet the Justice did not bind you over to give evidence here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not been talking to any body about it, have you? - A.Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that gentleman, Mr. Gould? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him? - A. No, not to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. During the sessions, in the yard? - A. No; I have never seen Mr. Gould; I saw him in our yard before the Sessions began, and Mr. Gould was in the yard when we came home from apprehending Snook.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about a forty pound reward, if this man is convicted, and that you should have a good part of it? - A.Not to my knowledge; I never took a man in my life before; I did not take him for a forty pound reward; I took him for my master's security.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no conversation with Mr. Gould, about a forty pound reward, that you were to get a good part of? - A. I do not recollect any thing of it; Mr. Gould may come forward, and talk about it, but not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never stole a horse in life; the rest I leave to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked the purse up just by the play-house, and when he said he had lost it, I gave it him directly.</p>

               <p>Q.Who do you mean by the wicked man? - A. The devil. (She is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about this robbery? - A. No; I can speak to a shilling that my godmother, Mrs. Mason, lost; she and I were comparing it, with another, some time ago, that I had in my pocket; the head of the shilling was close to the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. What King's head was upon it? - A. Queen Anne, and it was not round; the edges were plain.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mason. The last witness and I were looking at the shilling, and comparing it with one of her own, for, I dare say, ten minutes; her's was a Queen Anne's shilling, and she was comparing it with mine, and saying it was a much finer one than mine, because mine was so much worn.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden: I apprehended the prisoner on the night of the 11th of December; a little after twelve o'clock at night I was called up; he came home about two; I searched him, and found some money about him; (the gold the Magistrate ordered me to return to him.) (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mason. This Queen Anne's shilling, I am very certain, is mine.</p>
               <p>Carpenter. This is the same Queen Anne's shilling; it is not round, and the head is very close to the edge; this is the shilling that I had, and compared with my godmother's; (Producing it; they are both shewn to the Jury. The prisoner produced four Queen Anne's shillings for the Jury to compare with them.)</p>
               <p>Court. (To Carpenter.) Q. Look at these six shillings, and see which of them is your godmother's? - A. This is it. (Pointing to it.)</p>
               <p>Court. She has certainly picked out the right one.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mason.) Q.Look at these six shillings, and pick out your own? - A.This is it.</p>
               <p>Court. She has picked out the same shilling; I put a mark upon it by which I could know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It depends entirely upon that shilling; you gentlemen are in the habit of trade, of receiving money every day; and you will be able to judge whether she can swear to it or not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a hackney-coachman: On the 31st of October, I drove the coach, No. 66; between twelve and one at night I was hired by the prisoner Hall; I was standing in the Minories; Jones and Chapman were with him; I was hired to go to near the top of Crown-street, Finsbury-square; they told me it was to take some smuggled goods; I went to Crown-street; it was near four o'clock at that time; they took three bundles out of the coach, and I saw a crow taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it, in Crown-street? - A. A person of the name of Batt; they took the bundles into the house, and the crow; then I went away; I afterwards went with the officers to the house, and shewed it to them; two of them were then taken in the house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150050"/>Q. Do you know the three men who were tried on Thursday last? - A. Yes; they came to my house about five in the morning, as nigh as I can recollect; they came, I believe, in a coach; I heard a coach stop at the door; they had several bundles with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them with a crow? - A. I cannot recollect; they left the bundles in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Palmer when you see him? - A. Yes; that is him. (Pointing to the prisoner.) I saw him in the evening of that day, the 1st of November; he came to our house about these things; Jones was with him; Palmer and Jones went up three pair of stairs, where the goods were; I heard Mr. Palmer bid fifteen guineas, that was all that I heard; they staid together about half an hour, as well as I can recollect; the goods remained till the Sunday evening following; there was a promise of half-a-guinea from Palmer to take care of the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that, of your own knowledge? - A. No, my husband told me so; they were then removed to Mrs. Boreham's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. All that you know, with respect to this business, is, that he offered fifteen guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he went away, and there was no agreement made? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not present when the goods were removed afterwards, or any thing done respecting them? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband is not here, is he? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not be very safe to trust to any thing he says, because he is a man of infamous character? - A. He always worked very hard for his living; I have been in prison ten weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you married before your husband was here last time? - A. I have been married twenty-four years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were married to him before he was here? - A. He was here through being very much distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he the same man who was convicted here of coining? - A. He was my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether the last time was for putting the stamp of his Majesty's head upon a dollar? - A. I had nothing to do with that.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the city constables: I went to Mr. Batt's house on Monday, the 4th of November, in Crown-street; I searched the house; in the front room, up one pair of stairs, where I saw Hall and Chapman, I found this piece of paper with a piece of check upon it, and a ticket with some writing upon it; then I went up stairs into Batt's work-shop in the garret, and there I found this head of a piece of cloth with a ticket upon it, and I found an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. The same things you produced upon the last trial, you produce now? - A. Yes; and in the bed-room I found a pocket-book; (produces it;) I went to Mr. Palmer's, on Safforn-hill, and searched his house, but I found nothing there; he was at home; Mr. Smith, Mr. Fearnley, and Mr. Laycock were with me when I was examining Mr. Palmer's papers and drawers; I said to him, you deal largely in this way; no, says he, I do not know; says I, you are one of the first going now; he told me, if he did, he did not do any at home; in coming along in the coach, I think he said, he might have had them, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what? - A. No; I told him that I was well convinced he had had the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you understand him to mean that they had been offered to him, but he had refused them? - A. Yes.</p>

I am a salesmam and slop-seller: I was present at the search of Palmer's house, with the prosecutor and several officers; after we had been in the house some time, one of the officers said, Mr. Palmer, you do a great deal of business in this way, you are almost one of the first; the reply that Palmer made was, that he did business, and seemed to signify in the way that the officer meant; but that he never did it at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Those are the very words, are they? - A. I cannot take upon myself to be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not, if I do, I never do it at home? - A. I cannot say.(The articles produced by Sansum were deposed to by Mr. Laycock.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any other paper in that drawer? - A. No; I had not one note at the time; on the Monday morning it was called for between light and dark, early in the morning, I was in bed.</p>

               <p>- MARSHALL sworn. - Last Friday week, I bought two heifers of Mr. Collins, a salesman; I live in Aldgate High-street; one was a brindled, and the other was a spotted one; I killed one, and sent the other to a field, by Stepney-church; some persons came to see the heifer afterwards, but I was not present; they said, there was a brand in the horn of one of them, but I could see none.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that was driving them? - A. I do not know; but I think, to the best of my knowledge, it was not the prisoner; it was very near eleven o'clock; I have known the prisoner these nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the colour of these two beasts? - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who gave him a good character, and deposed that his father had lately taken a farm for him, at North-hall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not see him cut it off? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. That was not the same day with the linen? - A. No; on the Sunday morning I saw him take a pair of scissars into the back part of the warehouse, about nine o'clock; he returned in a few minutes with something in a blue paper, he brought it into the front warehouse; he then went behind the counter, where I could not see him; and in the space of a few minutes he came from behind that counter, where I could see him; he had the same blue paper as before, likewise a piece of lawn in his hand; Mr. Smith was looking at the same time, and I went with Mr. Smith, and he charged him with it; he said he had nothing more than he ought to have; he then pulled out a small piece of waste paper, and said he had a bit of lawn, that he had bought in Newgate-street, to make his baby some shirts; a person was sent for to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I dare say you took the trouble of enquiring in Newgate-street? - A. No; I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. He continued in the same story from beginning to end; and you never made the least enquiry whether his story was a true one? - A. No.</p>

               <p>- PUGH sworn. - I am a druggist in Old Fish-street: I saw the prisoner at the bar with a hamper, going from towards the Old-Bailey to Giltspur-street; the pole of a hackney-coach that was coming from Snow-hill either run against the prisoner or the hamper, I cannot say which; the prisoner and the hamper both fell together; the prisoner upon getting up as quick as he could, was going off with the hamper; Mr. Strong's man came up to him and struck him violently, and threshed him indeed very severely; he threshed him heartily; he knocked him down, and even struck him when he was down; I conceived the prisoner very ill used, nobody seemed to take his part, and I came forward merely with a view to see the man righted, as I thought; however when I learned the cause, I insisted upon his going after the man, and I took care of the hamper, while he pursued the man.</p>
               <p>Roach. This is the hamper that I lost; (produces it;) I have had it ever since I received it from Mr. Pugh.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of December, about half-past five in the morning, I and my husband were going in a cart to Chertsey-market, from Hounslow; there was some snow on the ground, which gave a great light; just as we got to <placeName id="t18000115-71-crimeloc423">Feltham-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he stop you for? - A. That I cannot say, whether it was to rob us or nor; he was as close at the side of the cart, as close could be; I then struck violently with the whip at the horse, and immediately a voice said, b - t your eyes, shoot the horse, and I saw a pistol immediately pointed at the flank of the horse; a pistol was fired, the horse gave a spring, and we got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the person that stopped you? - A. Yes, by the flash of his pistol; I had a full view of him, I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know him before? - A. No; I saw him again at Bow-street, a few days after; I believe, the Wednesday following; I recollected him again as soon as I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you saw the prisoner at Bow-street, he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, at Bow-street, that you knew he was the man? - A. Yes, I say, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate at Bow-street, did you say that was the man? - A. I said, I believed he was the man, and now I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. The light that you had came from the reflection of the snow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole transaction did not take up half a moment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that from the shortness of the time, and the extreme alarm you were in, you could not say whether he was the man or not, and I tell you, I have your examination in my hand? - A. I know that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But you did not say so at that time? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went out about half-past five, with my wife; as we were riding between Feltham and Feltham-hill, in a trot, all of a sudden, an alarm from the man's voice came, b-t your eyes; I turned round and saw a man pointing a pistol against the side of my wife's head; my wife then struck the horse, and there was a voice, but whether from the same or not, I cannot tell; b-t your eyes, shoot the horse; then the pistol was pointed right for the flank of the horse, and off it went; and when the pistol went off, by the light of the flash I saw the man's face.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing the man's face, so as to speak to him? - A. Yes; I had seen him many times as I was going backwards and forwards to Chertsey-market, he lived just before you come to Chertsey-bridge; I knew him at the time when I saw him at Bow-street, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How far is it from Feltham-hill, to Chertsey-bridge? - A. Four or five miles.</p>
               <p>Q.You were very much alarmed, were you not? - A. I cannot say I was much alarmed, because I rather expected it; the moment the pistol was fired, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before any Magistrate? - A. Yes, Mr. Anderson, at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. But he was not taken by any officer belonging to Mr. Anderson, but by some officer belonging to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. As this man lived at Chertsey-bridge, why did you not seek after the man that day, at Chertsey? - A. I was busy about the market, and wanted to get home to my family.</p>

               <p>Q. Your bed-room is the furthest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if he wished to go out, he could, without going through your room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore he might go out of the house without alarming you when you were asleep? - A. I get very little sleep, that I do not think he could get out without my hearing him.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing particular to six you to the day? - A. No; I always found him in bed when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was so early as half-past six? - A. I was called up by a bargeman that employs me to carry lime through the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. You said you were, just now; do you mean to say you were called up, or not? - A. I cannot say whether I was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only mean to say that you generally found him in bed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What, at half-past six o'clock? - A. Yes; because his head lies close against the window, and I saw his clothes lying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to swear that there was sufficient light for you to discover his cloaths from the bed cloaths? - A. I cannot say, but I saw the breeches upon the floor; my house is on the Middlesex side of the river, and the windows to the south.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 10th of June, did you lose any wine? - A. Yes; there is a permit drawn from my stock, for twenty-six bottles of foreign red wine, not French; and twenty-six bottles of foreign white, not French; making eleven gallons of wine. In<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150068"/>consequence of something that I discovered, I went to the house of a person of the name of Philpot, who lives in Swithin's-lane, a publican; I received from the Lord-Mayor, a bill of parcels, which was produced by Philpot. (It is produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that this man lived with you, were you acquainted that he had any cellar belonging to himself? - A. No; upon examining my books, I applied to the Commissioners of Excise for the purpose of seeing the request note.</p>
               <p>Q. The request note is a previous step, necessary to obtain a permit? - A. Yes, and of which I kept a counter part of those I knew of, in my permit book.</p>
               <p>Q. This man lived in your service for some time; did you know his hand-writing? - A. Clearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and tell me if that is his hand-writing? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have told us that you lost some wine, on the 18th of June last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other knowledge that you lost that wine, but that you have found a permit in your name for that quantity of wine? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not found that permit, you would not have known, that on that day you lost any wine? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say, that upon looking over your books, you found a deficiency of actually fifty-two bottles that day? - A. Upon looking over my excise books, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find an exact deficiency of fifty-two bottles on that day? - A.Between the two stocks, I lost more; the prisoner was a confidential servant, and I left him to the stock entirely.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the prior stocking to the 10th of June? - A. The 31st of May.</p>
               <p>Q.When was the subsequent stocking? - A. The 14th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner not given you a notice to produce your books? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you mean to say, that upon the stocking of the 14th of June, there appears to be a deficiency from the stock of actually eleven gallons of wine? - A. I believe, by examining the book, you will find it so.</p>
               <p>Q. The deficiency appears, upon the excise books, that is, that there was not so much wine in the cellar as the permits would cover? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you never sent out wine without permits? - A. A great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You used wine, of course, for your own family? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, there were no permits for that? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there were these two modes of wine going out of your cellar, which there were no permits to answer for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have heard that it is the practice for one merchant to lend another permits? - A. In the course of fourteen years, I have known but one instance, and that I lent myself, and there will be found a particular entry in the permit book, with respect to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that such a practice has existed among other wine-merchants? - A. I do not know it beyond myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the misfortune to become a bankrupt? - A. A commission was taken out against me, the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, about the 4th of July? - A. I was from home on the 2d of July, on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, after the 4th of July, your business did not go on regularly? - A. I believe it did not stop till after the 5th of July, at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you send out wines without permits, it is in quantities less than two gallons? - A. We are allowed, by the Excise laws to send out none less than fifteen bottles; but if wine is to be sent into the neighbourhood, where it can he carried immediately without pitching it, but then I always keep an account of it in my order book.</p>
               <p>Q. But the Excise don't keep an account of what goes out without permits? - A. No; I believe in that interval, there was not a single bottle sent out without permit, or used in my own family; there is no account of it in my books; there were four bottles for my own drinking.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that account kept by yourself? - A. No, by the clerk; he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. The books are kept by Mr. Grant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the servant that generally fetched the wine from the cellar; was it not a female servant? - A. Not at that time; the prisoner was the person generally employed to fetch up wine.</p>

             use to bring it up? - A. She is here; but I cannot exactly speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had you been making up your books, before you discovered any thing about this deficiency? - A. It was not discovered by my making up my books; it was discovered in consequence of some questions having been asked me an the third meeting before the Commissioners of Bankrupts.</p>
               <p>Q. At that meeting your cellarman was examined as a witness? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not brought there to be a witness? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see him there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he was brought there to be examined as a witness upon some transactions of your's? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150069"/>Q. Have you never said, that if he had not been so brought, you should never have prosecuted him? - A. No; I have said I should never have known of the robbery if he had not been brought there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that you would never have prosecuted him if he had not come there as a witness to prove something with respect to you? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What I am asking you about, is a transaction of a very recent date, and you cannot have forgot it - how long has the prisoner been taken up; I believe, a fortnight yesterday? - A. I believe, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that you should not have prosecuted him if he had not come to Guildhall as a witness? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation on the subject with a Mr. Rule? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said that to Mr. Rule? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said any thing in substance like it? - A. Never; I told Mr. Rule, I should never have discovered the theft, if it had not arose from questions put to him on that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was the examination before the Commissioners, at the third meeting? - A. On the 1st day of this month; and immediately upon the discovery I wrote a petition to the Commissioners of Excise for leave to examine their books, and to examine the request note, and I found out the request notes I had no counterpart of; and in consequence of that, I immediately took my books before the Lord-Mayor, and exhibited them to shew I had no entry of such quantities being sent out.</p>

               <p>Q.Now, with respect to your decrease of stock - does it never happen that there is a decrease by accident, between one stock and another, by accidents of a cask? - A. It is a possible thing, but not a probable thing; but the officers of Excise in general are pretty correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you have never known a deficiency of your stock, which you have believed to have arisen from accident? - A. I have never discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never discovered a deficiency from leakage? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is no such thing as leakage? - A. I do not say that; but I have never discovered it.</p>
               <p>Q.Possibly you may not have enquired into it? - A. I had great confidence in the man I trusted, and therefore I did not look into it.</p>
               <p>Q. May there not, by possibility, be a difference, by wine being bottled in large bottles, than the Excise calculate on? - A. Certainly there may, as far as possibility goes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bottles are not always of the same size - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. The Excise calculate upon a particular sized bottle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore that might produce a decrease in their stocking? - A.Clearly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who generally had the key of your vaults? - A During the day-time they were under the direction of the prisoner; when he went from the house, they were left in the passage, it was his business to leave them, and of course were left in the possession of Mrs. Wigzell, or the servant, or whoever was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner has bought empty pipes, or hogsheads of you? - A. He has, three or four for the time he lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was occasionally sent out to bottle wine for your customers? - A. Now and then I have sent him out to bottle off a pipe of wine.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon that occasion the lees are the perquisite of the bottler? - A. By no means; I consider them the property of the person to whom the wine belongs.</p>

               <p>Q. But in point of fact, do not you know, that the person who has the wine, gives the lees to the bottler? - A. I never knew a single instance of it, and the man that does it is a great simpleton, that is my opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. But, upon these occasions, are the pipes or hogsheads returned to you? - A. I have not a single instance in my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, upon these occasions, whether the bottler purchases the hogsheads? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Does the leakage find its way into bottles? - A. If it does, it must be by intent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe there is a debt now due to the prisoner from your estate? - A. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not, in that very account, a sherry butt? - A. There is not; there were two sherry butts taken away without my knowledge, a thing I never suffered; there is no account of any such thing, but in the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. As to those bottles, they were taken without your leave, though he has given you credit for them? - A. He has, and it is a circumstance that I never allowed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a surveyor of the Excise, Mr. Wigzell's cellar, as a wine-merchant, was within my survey.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any request-note to obtain two gallons of red wine, not French, and two gallons of white wine, not French, on the 10th of June? - A. I have. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. The request-note is necessary to obtain a permit? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150070"/>Q.(To Wigzell.) Look at that request note, and tell me whose hand-writing that is? - A. I have no doubt of it being the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that the usual way in which request-notes are sent? - A. They are written in the same way; but whenever a permit has been drawn for a request-note, it ought to have been drawn from a book kept in my accompting-house, called a permit-book, the counterpart of which remains, the same as with banker's checks: there are two books, one that I keep, in which I keep a counterpart of the permits; I draw the stock sent out, and I keep a counterpart of it from that book; it is the business of the clerk to transcribe the permits that are drawn, for the purpose of knowing what quantity is sent out of my stock, it has so regularly been done and copied by the clerk in the accompting-house, but the name of Philpot mentioned, is not entered by my clerk, but is entered by the prisoner in this book, kept for the purpose of the Excise, without the knowledge of my clerk; after the account has been written up by me, it is in his handwriting; the books are here to shew it, but not in my book, or any of my books. (Produces the books.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This book lay in your accompting-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the entries were made by your clerk; before and after the name of Philpot appears, the subsequent names were written by your clerk? - A. No; I believe they are Gourd's hand-writing, they look very much like it, except the last one; the previous ones are entered by my clerk, and they appear to have been entered up to the 11th of June, but this was permitted on the 10th of June, and was written by the prisoner after the entry, on the 11th of June, and the rest, I believe, are entered by the prisoner, except the last one; the one in question, there is no date placed against the name, and it is entered after the entry of the 11th, the stock was taken on the 14th, and therefore I cannot say when it was entered; it was entered apparently on the 14th. (The permit grounded upon the request-note, produced and read.)</p>
               <p>Beetham. There appears in my book, a decrease in the stock for this permit, of fifty-two bottles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to say that is the exact decrease? - A. No; there are several bottles decrease; of red, seven bottles, and white, fourteen bottles.</p>
               <p>Q.Allowing for this permit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not uncommon to have a decrease? - A. By no means; on the 31st of May, there was a considerable decrease in the stocks.</p>
               <p>Q.In almost every stock, there is a decrease more or less? - A. If they have been bottling, there is sure to be a decrease.</p>
               <p>Q. Not only in Mr. Wigzell's stock, but in every other? - A.Most people's. (The permit read)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you, on the 10th of June, receive two dozen of red wine, not French, and two dozen of white wine, not French? - A. I cannot be punctual to the day, but it was thereabouts, the permit accompanied them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the permit? - A.It is impossible; it may be the permit, but I cannot swear to that; the permit is given to my stocking-office every twelve or fourteen days; I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any bill of parcels with it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill of parcels? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you pay the money to? - A. A porter employed by the prisoner to bring it from his vaults to mine, it amounted to five pounds sixteen shillings; I gave a five guinea check in part.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom is the other eleven shillings due? - A. To the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you taste that wine before you bought it? - A.Under a hair-dresser's shop, in the Minories, on the left-hand side, along with Mr. Close; the prisoner was there, and Mr. Close tasted it; I objected to it as being flat, and he recommended it as being bottoms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Wigzell.) Q. You had no cellar in the Minories? - A. No; I had that cellar, which I understand the prisoner now has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire to have a permit with this wine? - A. He asked a guinea and a half for a dozen; I told him it would be a long while before it would come round, it was flat, and I would not give more than twenty-nine shillings, and if he did not send it regularly by a permit, I would not have it at all; he agreed to take the twenty-nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the permit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By which you found it to be part of Mr. Wigzell's stock? - A. I looked at the permit at the time; I did not know how it was, sending in a permit in another person's name, but there have been many circumstances of lending and borrowing permits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You bought it as bottoms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And should you have got good red wine, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150071"/>were not bottoms, at that price? - A. Three or four and thirty shillings was the price at that time; but I bought it as bottoms.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there has been in the trade a custom of lending and borrowing permits? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you supposed that it was a borrowed permit? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is it usual for a servant, not dealing in wine himself, to borrow a permit of his master? - A. I did not know he was servant to Mr. Wigzell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been at Mr. Wigzell's house? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been a dealer in wine, would not the permit have been in his own name? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw in the cellar, had you reason to suppose he was a dealer in wine? - A. We do not look at people's stock always.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose, from the appearance of the cellar, that he was a dealer in wine? - A.There were a great many bottles of wine; we had no candle; I had not a prospect of the whole extent of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe you were going into a wine-merchant's cellar? - A. It is a true sign, for there was wine to taste.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe you were going to a regular wine-cellar? - A. We went to taste of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe that Gourd was a wine-merchant at the time you dealt with him? - A. He was not recommended to me as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe that he was a merchant? - A. It was recommended to me as bottoms, and I bought it as such.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe you were going into a wine-merchant's cellar? - A. I cannot say any further than as I said before, there was wine there.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ask him who Mr. Wigzell was, whole stock he sent in? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Gourd? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his hand-writing? - A. Yes; I have often seen him write.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lived with Mr. Wigzell about a year and eleven months; I had been in the habit of bottling off wine for several gentlemen, and when I have bottled off wine I have had the cask, and I have had the bottoms, both of white and red, which I have put by; and knowing how to manage them, I have brought them round; not to a proper state, but so as to be sit to drink; I had these bottoms by me, and I spoke to Mr. Close, and told him I had three dozen of each, and he brought Mr. Philpot to me; Mr. Philpot tasted the wine in my cellar, and he and I agreed for the price; I believe there is a witness in Court that has been with me when I have brought home these wines from different places; and, I believe, a witness that tasted the wines in the cask, and was going to recommend me a customer before I bottled it off, but the wine being flat, he could not recommend it to this friend of his, because it was not so good as he could wish it; and I hope and trust the person is in Court now that I sent with it; I 
               <persName id="t18000115-85-person714">drew</persName>
             the permit as usual in the trade, thinking no harm in it; in the course of a few days, Mr. Wigzel was looking over the books, and he saw that in the Excise-book; he said, who is this Philpot; I said, why, Sir, it is a permit that I have borrowed; he said, I shall not stand any such nonsense as that; I told him I would not do so again; and so it passed on till I appeared before the Commissioners at Guildhall; he has done this out of revenge; I hope and trust there are witnesses in Court that can prove that I have bought the casks, and had the bottoms.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wigzell.) Q.Have you never had any conversation with this man about the name of Philpot in your books? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, upon your solemn oath, whether, before the Commission, be had ever told you it was a borrowed permit? - A.Upon my oath he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is what he has said, upon that subject, false? - A. It is false; I never did know that the name of Philpot was in any one of my books, till since the 1st of January.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever known him collect the lees from the wine? - A. I have been with him many times when he has been bottling off wine; I was with him at Mr. Tappenden and Denham's, in Foster-lane, and he had the bottoms, which was always the rule, both for cellarmen and coopers, unless the gentleman objected to it; I never heard any otherwise in all my life; he bottled off two hogsheads for Mr. Curtis, at Homerton, when I was with him, and he had the lees there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any other instance? - A. Yes; Mr. Giles, at the west end of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. From the lees, or the bottoms, was it in his power to collect wine? - A. Yes; by keeping them a certain time, bottling them off, well corking them, and letting them be of a proper age, they will come round.</p>
               <p>Q. In what length of time can it be made saleable? - A. Sometimes four or five, or six months; and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the greatest distance of time in which it will come round? - A. It may be six months.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it that he put this wine after it had been given to him? - A. I heard that he had put it in Mr. Wigzell's cellar, in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since he took the cellar in the Minories - will you swear that he had that cellar even six months ago? - A. I cannot undertake to say.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear that he had it so long as four months ago? - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you work for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live at that time that you worked for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live at that time that you worked for him? - A. At Squire Plumer's, in Fen-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help him to convey away those bottoms? - A.No.</p>
               <p>HENRY HARAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was employed by Mr. Gourd to carry out some wine, and wash some bottles; I carried some wine to Mr. Philpot's, in the month of June last; to the best of my recollection it was four dozen, it was packed up; I carried it from Mr. Gourd's cellar in the Minories, it was under a wax-chandler's shop, to Mr. Philpot's, and he gave me a draft for five-guineas, and said he would settle with Mr. Gourd for the remainder.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the habit of buying bottles for him? - A. He employed me three or four days in washing bottles and collecting bottles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You took this from Gourd's cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where it came from before you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- BRIDGES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you subpoenaed by the defendant? - A. No; but I thought this man an injured man, and I came to hear the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if it is customary, when a cellarman is sent to bottle off wine, that the lees are given to him? - A.I believe they are very frequently given.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in the power of the person to whom these lees are so given to collect wine from them? - A. Certainly it is, in considerable quantities.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of June-last, was twenty-nine shillings a dozen a fair price for wine? - A. For bottoms I think it was a fair price; it certainly would not have been a fair price for very good wine.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it in the power of any person to get wine from bottoms? - A. Yes; they are always put into a bag to drain the wine from it; I have known the prisoner these twelve or thirteen years, during all that time I never heard a syllable against him since I was born; I have known him trusted with ten thousand pounds at a time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any entry of that circumstance in your permit-book? - A. No, I did not; in consequence of an application to the Excise, a counterpart of the permit was granted, by the permission of the Commissioners.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing you saw at the Excise-office, did you make enquiry after a person of the name of Stratford, at Littleton, in Middlesex? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to the Lord-Mayor: I was attending during the examination of the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor; none of the examinations were taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Wigzell.) Q. Did you charge the prisoner with taking the wine in question? - A. I did; to the best of my recollection, the prisoner first stated that he had received an order from a carrier in Holborn for a dozen, and if the wine was very good, two dozen; if my recollection serves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150074"/>me right, he said he had received a letter from his sister, at Chertsey, respecting this order; but that he did not know what charges were to be brought against him, or he would have produced his witnesses, or to that effect; the Lord-Mayor said, that in consideration of that, he would allow him from the Wednesday to the Friday to produce his witnesses; in consequence of which, he was remanded till the Friday; I attended again on Friday, his sister then appeared; two letters were produced in the presence of the prisoner; the letters, I believe, were given up to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I asked you if there was any trace in your permit, of this transaction, on the 5th of July, in your permit-book? - A. No, nor in my vault-book; the permit-book is a counterpart of request-notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There is no trace in any book that you have of these goods going out of your stock? - A. None, except the book belonging to the Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, if there had been any permit of that kind, it would have appeared in that book? - A. It ought to have done; it does appear in the Excise-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing him to have had any dealing of his own, it would not have appeared in your books? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. You left your house on the 2d of July? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before the 2d of July had you the opportunity of taking your stock? - A. I had every week that I chose to do it; but I placed that confidence in the prisoner, that I did not think it necessary.</p>
               <p>Q.You had no means, within your own power, of knowing what wine was in the cellar, except the Excise-book? - A. Not at that moment; I had placed that confidence in the prisoner that I thought all would be right.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? - A.From Michaelmas, 1797, to the 5th of July, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q.During that time, had you and the prisoner any dealings in the wine trade as between you and him? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no dealing at all between you? - A. I believe he had one or two dozen of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly certain that there was no transaction between you with respect to wine? - A. I do not recall to my recollection one single circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no account standing between you, debtor and creditor, at the time you left your house? - A. I settled with him in full on the 13th of June, or the 15th, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no accounts at all out-standing, between you, after that time? - A. I owed some little for wages, and some trifle.</p>
               <p>Q. A pound or two? - A.It must be more I should concieve.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in July? - A. The 2d of July.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it you took the prisoner before the Lord-Mayor? - A. I think he was apprehended on the 6th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from July till the 6th of January, no charge was made against the prisoner? - A. I did not know of it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to take your stock upon your return to your house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the only mode of ascertaining the quantity of wine you had, was from the Excise-books? - A.Clearly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, for the accuracy of the accounts, you must depend upon the Excise-books, and not your own? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations had taken place before the Commissioners? - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the third adjourned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the third? - A. The 1st of January.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was taken up on the 6th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner examined as a witness before the Commissioners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined by the Solicitor before he went before the Commissioners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor examined at all? - A. Not to my knowledge; he was not publicly examined by the Commissioners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being examined in point of fact? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you have not heard, from any one person, that the prisoner at the bar was called upon before the Commissioners on behalf of any creditor? - A. I wish to know whether I am to give evidence of what I know myself, or what any body may have told me, God knows who.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not examined before the Commissioners? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that he was examined before the Commissioners? - A. I have heard it, but not to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him there, did not you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect why your examination was put off? - A. In consequence of some questions put to me respecting my stock, a question was put to me which staggered me most astonishingly; one of the creditors supposed I had embezzled some of my stock, but conscious of the inability of such an act, I was astonished; I then presented the whole of my books, and accounts, and every atom of paper that I had had during the time I had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150075"/>business, and desired them to select such books as they thought necessary to the examination; when I came before them, one of the questions put to me was with respect to my stock, and my permit-book was asked for, which had not been selected, and I could not answer the question for want of that book; the Commissioners thought it necessary to see the original book, and therefore they deemed it necessary that the meeting should be adjourned, at my request, at the request of the assignees, and at the request of the creditors.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that account alone was the examination put off? - A. I conceive that I am not bound to answer that question; it can have nothing to do with the present question; but if my feelings have been suppressed in the first instance, I now feel it my duty to say all that did pass: the prisoner came forward with a charge, base in the extreme; he charged me with secreting estates that I had at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the third meeting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Was that a suggestion at the last examination, or before? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have described to the Gentlemen of the Jury, the conversation as relative to your stock; now you are going to describe something the prisoner was base enough to state, respecting your house at Greenwich, that was at the third examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that the prisoner stated any thing before the Commissioners? - A. I said, that this thing was brought before the Commissioners, I did not say it was by the prisoner, but as presented from him, and delivered by somebody else, as I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a charge originating from the prisoner, and coming through the mouth of another person exhibited against you? - A. It was a charge exhibited against me, by a counsel that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. These are the instructions that you understood were conveyed by the counsel? - A. It was a thing that I could not have supposed could have come against me.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed it to have its origin from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the charge this, that you had not given an account of an estate that you had at Greenwich to the Commissioners? - A. That was the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an estate at Greenwich, previous to your bankruptcy? - A. I had, about twelve or thirteen years ago, which was stated in my accounts, it was sold, and was in my books of accounts regularly entered at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received any rents from that estate yourself? - A. Not latterly; the houses have been pulled down, and I sold them to Greenwich-Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q.In whose possession was that land? - A. Greenwich-Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner ever received any rent for you of that estate? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. No receipts were ever wrote by you, on his giving you an account of money received as rents? - A. Certainly not from that estate.</p>
               <p>Q. Not from that particular estate-had you any house at Greenwich? - A. I had a house at Greenwich, for which I paid twenty pounds a year, and I let it for twenty pounds a year; and the lease upon which I let it was out, and I stated it in my accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stated it to the Commissioners before you were examined to it by Counsel? - A. I had stated it in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stated it by word of mouth? - A. I had not, but it was in my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the rent been received of that house by the prisoner at the bar for you? - A. It certainly had.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that being conveyed to the Commissioners, through the medium of a Counsel, and as you suppose, originating with the prisoner-this took place on the 1st of January? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then on the 6th, and not till the 6th, you apprehended the prisoner? - A. It was not till after the 1st, that I knew of this circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. This explanation took place on the 1st of January? - A. The prisoner at the bar tempted Mrs. Wigzell, but she was inflexible.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you any thing about Mrs. Wigzell?</p>
               <p>Court. He has a right to explain any thing you ask him about. - A. I was totally unconscious that any decrease could have happened, and I was so well assured, that Mrs. Wigzell's conduct was such that she could not have suffered such a thing; she told me to enquire, and I examined my permit-book, to see if I had been correct in my former examination; I found I was correct, it made me very unhappy; I could not be easy, that such a question should be put to me without knowing upon what ground, not being able to discover any thing in my books incorrect; it led me to examine the books kept by the Excise, and which ought to be an accurate transcript of the book which I had; I acquainted my assignees of the circumstance, and under their direction, as well as my own inclination, I investigated the business, and acted under their direction throughout the whole business.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons employed by you, in your wine trade, besides the prisoner? - A. I had a clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. And other persons employed in your cellar? - A. There was a man employed by the prisoner, but he had no business in the cellar; he was employed to wash the bottles, as I understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150076"/>Q. Supposing he sold a pipe of wine, and were to bottle it at the person's house, was it the course of his employment, that he should go with the wine, and bottle it in the gentleman's house? - A.Whenever I sent him; but no circumstance of that kind took place from the 2d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away on the 2d of July? - A. I did, on Tuesday the 2d.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long were you absent? - A.Till the Sunday following; I went away again on that day.</p>
               <p>Q.During that time, will you take upon yourself to swear, whether any wine was bottled? - A. I can only say from my books; I had no person in my service capable of executing the order, besides himself; I left the vaults in his care, and the clerk in the accompting-house, to write any thing that he might direct him to write.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether you know of any perquisites the cellarmen have, when they bottle wine at customer's houses? - A. Never; if gentlemen chuse to give them, that is another thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How-long have you been in the trade? - A.Fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of the perquisites of cellarmen at a customer's house? - A. Never farther than any gratuity of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you never heard of any perquisites, except money? - A. No, and those that do, I should think very wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never heard of any bottoms of casks as the perquisites of cellarmen? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You would be quite surprized then, at any gentleman who had been as long in the trade as you have, swearing that there were such perquisites? - A. I am not accountable for what others may know.</p>
               <p>Q. You would be surprized then? - A. I am not surprized at any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever permitted the prisoner to sell any wine upon his own account? - A. To the best of my recollection I never have.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever suffered him to have a permit for his own purpose? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of such a thing as borrowing a permit? - A. I certainly have, but not between the prisoner and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in Court during the whole of the trial last night? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard many gentlemen examined of the wine trade? - A. I did, but I did not know them II.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you still hold it as your opinion, in the course of the wine trade, that you never heard of such a thing as a perquisite of the bottoms of casks, upon being bottled off in a person's own house? - A.Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The 13th of June was the last settlement you had with the prisoner, for wages? - A. There, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, when he was discharged from you, something remained due to him from that time, till the time he was discharged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that, and that only, was what you were indebted to him? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he discharged from your service? - A. The 6th of July; the place was not open for business after that time; it was closed by Mr. Harris, who is my particular friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he, to your recollection, ever dealt with you for wine? - A. I have not the recollection that he ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever communicate to you, any thing respecting this transaction, with which you charged him on the 5th of July? - A. Never.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you find it upon the file of 1794, or 1799? - A. The file of 1799.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was clerk to Mr. Wigzell; I have frequently seen the prisoner write.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that; is that the prisoner's handwriting? (shewing him the request note;) - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it appear to be written upon? - A. The back of a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way in which request notes are usually written? - A. No; they are written from the permit-book, a book that is kept in Mr. Wigzell's accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your course to keep a check opposite the request note in the book? - A. Yes; in the same way as a banker's check-book.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not written in such a way? - A. No, it is not; it is written upon the back of a letter.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Beetham.) When was that request note delivered to you, in order to form a permit? - A. It was not delivered to me; I took it off the file.</p>
               <p>Q. The request-note is necessary to have a permit-note agreeable to the contents of that request-note? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you grant a permit, do you keep the counterpart of that permit in the office? - A. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the permit, which was granted in consequence of that request-note, been returned to the office? - A. It has not; it does not appear in our books.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150077"/>Court. Q. Have you all your permits returned by the trader? - A. No; if the trader draws for a permit, and the goods do not go out, it is returned back in such a time; we gave them an hour perhaps to be out of their stock, which was the same in this, and then we accept it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. This was not returned at all? - A. It does not appear by our books that it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Have you the counterpart of the permit granted upon that request-note? - A. I have. (Produces it.)(The request-note and counterpart of the permit read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a deficiency in the stock of Wigzell, equal to that quantity of wine sent out? - A. It appears after the balance of the stock, on the 18th of July, deficient seventeen bottles of red, and twenty-six of white, more than is permitted out from the 2d of July to the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you right, that there would be two dozen of red, and two dozen of white, deficient, besides seventeen bottles of red and twenty-six of white? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Mr. Wigzell stated that the prisoner was discharged on the 6th of July?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Certainly he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. If a person chuses to remove from his cellar a dozen of wine at a time, he may, without a permit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the wine trade, a person not being able to carry out a permit within the time, returns it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a dozen of wine was sent out by the master's order, or by the mistress, it might be delivered without a permit at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A permit specifies a particular time when the wine should be sent out; and if it is not used, sent back again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Sometimes, by some accident or other, when it is not used, it does not find its way back? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.If the permit which you grant is not returned to you, I believe the tradsman is charged with so much? - A. Yes; if there appears an increase, it is forfeited.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any irregularity in the permit between those two stockings? - A. There does not appear to be any by our books.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before that? - A. I cannot tell; I heard of some going out.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of it? - A. It was about the time that Mr. Wigzell left his home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after? - A. I believe it was after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after? - A. It might be the same day, or the next; it did not concern me.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was it? - A. I cannot tell indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was all red wine, or red and white, you cannot tell? - A.Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear it removed out? - A. No, I did not; I heard that he had some.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard it from whom? - A. I might hear my mistress speak of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not hear your mistress speak of it? - A. I did hear my mistress speak of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear whether it went in a cart, or upon a man's shoulders? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was spirits, or porter, or what? - A. I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Cheese, perhaps? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think it was? - A.Either spirits or wine.</p>
               <p>Q.But what the quantity was, or what the quality, you are perfectly blind and deaf? - A. It is not likely I should know.</p>
               <p>Q. But your mistress told you of it? - A. My mistress said she thought it was very wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wigzell was not at home? - A. No; and he was very angry with Mr. Lee for having it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know to whose house Mr. Wigzell went? - A. No; but I believe, upon my oath, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not go to Mr. Lee, I dare say? - A. I cannot tell; Mr. Lee was his attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went to his house or not? - A. It is natural to suppose he did.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the keys kept generally? - A. In the drawing-room with my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wigzell did not trust any body else to go into the vaults but you? - A. No person went without me, after the vaults were shut.</p>
               <p>Q. As the wine went to Mr. Lee's, after Mr. Wigzell left the house, who was kind enough to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150078"/>go into the cellar to send out this wine? - A. This was before the cellarman was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q.And Mrs. Wigzell knew of it? - A.She knew of it after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lee was Mr. Wigzell's attorney, and particular friend? - A. I do not know; he was his attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Lee was the clerk under the commission of bankruptcy? - A. I believe he had the commission.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Then at the time Mr. Lee had the wine, the prisoner was not discharged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore the cellar, till the 6th, was under his charge? - A. The vaults were closed on the 5th, and he was discharged; and this happened before the vaults were closed.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to make that entry? - A. It was an entry deficient, and as there was nobody in the accompting-house to do it, I entered it; I entered it, finding that there had been an omission.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Does the quantity correspond with the request-note? - A. It does, and I see it appears in the Excise-books Shadford.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any difference, but in the name? - A. No; this is undoubtedly the request note for this permit; it had been omitted in the merchant's book, and therefore I entered it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Grant.) Q. You were clerk to Mr. Wigzell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard that the prisoner was the cellarman of Mr. Wigzell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any account that there was between the prisoner and Mr. Wigzell? - A. I have heard that there was a small account; but I do not know what it was nor from what time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any wine lent by your master to the prisoner at any time? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had reference, of course, to the order-books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think, if you could see the order-books, you could be more correct? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the order-books here? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.Are there any other things that the prisoner has bought of your master? - A. I believe there was a dozen or two of porter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BRYDGES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a wine-merchant in Water-lane, Thames-street: I know very little of the prisoner; I was a considerable creditor of Mr. Wigzell.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the wine trade, where a person orders wine of a wine-merchant, and bottles it at home, have you ever heard of a perquisite to the person who bottles it? - A. It is a very common thing to the person bottling it, for taking care of it, and seeing that there is none of it lost; it is very commonly done.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a considerable creditor of Mr. Wigzell? - A. A creditor of seven hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the last examination of Mr. Wigzell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the account given by Mr. Wigzell of an estate that he had at Greenwich? - A. I remember some questions being put to Mr. Wigzell respecting houses that he had there, and he answered that he had none; that was one answer he gave; he afterwards corrected it a little, and to the best of my recollection said, he never had houses there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I believe that examination was taken in writing? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It must necessarily be taken in writing.</p>
               <p>- BARTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a wine-merchant in Mark-lane: I have known the prisoner about thirteen years; he lived in our service about eight years; and has left our service about five; while he was with us we never had reason to suspect his honesty; nor I have ever heard any thing touching his dishonestly till the present occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether in the course of the trade, you have not heard the cellarman claiming as a perquisite, the bottoms of casks when pipes are bottled at their own houses? - A.Certainly I have frequently; it is pretty notorious in the trade.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CROWSIE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live at No. 62, Greenfield-street, Whitechapel, merchant's agent, and master-porter: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150079"/>enter merchant's wines, and clear them at the Custom-house: I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen years; I have known the prisoner all the time he lived with Messrs.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner was taken up by a warrant: from the Lord-Mayor: I went with Mr. Wigzell with a search-warrant to the prisoner's cellar under a hair-dresser's shop in the Minories; at the first entrance into the cellar the first thing Mr. Wigzell saw was a trett stuck in the cask; (producing it;) it was produced before the Lord Mayor in the presence of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. So this was stuck fast in the cask in the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity of soap was there? - A. There might have been from six to seven hundred weight; it was all in a fluid state, and remained in a fluid state for a day or two afterwards, till it was fit to cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you much hurt? - A. So much that, I could not put on my close bodied coat for three or four days, from the number of bruises that I had received in my arm; I was obliged to survey in a great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not disturb them at that time? - A.We did not; in consequence of seeing there were four of them, besides the lad, and only us two, we went for assistance; I requested Wakely to continue on the spot, while I went to a public-house to get the assistance of some soldiers that were quartered there; I was gone, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; I returned without assistance, and on my way back, I observed a cart coming out of the soap-house into a lane that led on to the Forest; I let them pass me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to Kiernan's house? - A.Rather more than a quarter of a mile, perhaps the third of a mile; I followed it, and it went into Kiernan's yard, it was four hours and a half after that before I found Wakely; I was about Kiernan's house all that time, watching till between four and five o'clock in the morning; I had no soldiers, I could not get any assistance; Wakely and I then went to Kiernan's house, Kiernan came out, and requested to know what authority we had got; we told him what we were come for, and we were certain the soap was there; I told him I had seen it deposited there in the night; he abused us very much in language; he then took up a pitch-fork, and threatened us with immediate destruction unless we desisted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. It is needless to ask you if he knew you were an officer, as you knew him? - A. Yes, he knew I was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How near might you, or Wakely, be to him when he took the pitch-forth? - A. About a yard; in consequence of that, we withdrew from the yard to the common side-gate, and when we had continued there a minute or two, we thought it most prudent for one of us to go to another public-house to get assistance; I went to two public-houses, and returned in, I suppose, about twenty minutes; I sent two soldiers that I met with to go to the spot, and they went without me; I went further on; when I returned, Wakely had got possession of the soap, he was coming to Ramford with the soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If I understand you right, you have been acquainted with the prisoner? - A. I know him, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the soap-house at seven o'clock in the evening to survey it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you did not stay there till the soap was carried away? - A. I did not conceive it was my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the copper before you went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That is giving an opportunity to a man to take it away? - A. It could not be done while the soap is in a state of operation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have not been in the habit of dining with him, and riding his house? - A. I never dined with him in my life; I once had his horse when the waters were out.</p>
               <p>Q. You have drank his wine, have not you? - A.Never but once, and that was the first time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two women there at this time? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Kiernan did not attempt to do any thing to you till after you had setched more assistance? - A. He held the pitch-fork up, and threatened us.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not strike you? - A. I rather think Kiernan did make a stab at Wakely's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You were close to Wakely all the time? - A. Yes.(Mr. Alley addressed the Jury in behalf of the defendant.)</p>

            , William Chubb, and another; when they came up, we perceived that they had got kegs upon the horses. containing about seven gailons and a half, or three quarters, they are called ankers; I suppose there might he about twenty-five of thirty horses.</p>
               <p>Q.Were there as many men as horses? - A. I believe there were; they came over from Guernsey in slings, and so they sling them across, the horses' backs; we came out of the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a commissioned officer of Excise? - A. I am, and the men that were acting in my assistance; we told them we should seize them in the King's name; but seeing so many of them, I thought it imprudent to seize the horses, and I told them to cut the kegs off as fast as they could, and go about their business; we got them into the hedge to the number of fifty or sixty, or thereabouts; and then there was a man came up from Tar-point, on horseback, who said to the smugglers, you ought to be d-d to suffer them to be taken by four men when you are so many; he told them to bring the horses back, and load them again: the smugglers began to be very resolute, and said, we could not expect to have the whole, and desired us to take half; I told them I would do no such thing. I would have the whole, or else I would luse my life; we had put the broad arrow upon most of them, some with chalk, and some with my knife, and the rest of the people also; I told them the hazard they were running in breaking the law, and wresting them from us; they d-d the law, and said they did not care any thing for the law, they would have a law of their own, or else another law, or to that purpose; then they began to be very abrupt, and beat us with sticks, and whips; while we were running after some of them, the rest would go to the heap and take some more, and so they did several times; they were joined by a vast number of people in sailors' clothes, which we supposed were the boat-men that were to carry these casks over the river; they beat me very much, and knocked me down, till I was senseless; they beat me all over the body, arms, and every where.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the man at the bar, have you any recollection of his being there? - A. I do not recollect him; they got the goods from us; when I got up, there were about a dozen or thirteen remaining of all the kegs, we were unable to resist any more; one of the sailors said, you shall have six. and if you are not content with that six, we will take them, and murder you afterwards; they put six on one side for us, and took all the rest; they consisted of brandy, and rum, and gin; after they had said we should have but six, one man said we should have but five, and they took one away, and threw it over the hedge, we found it afterwards; I was present when the prisoner was taken, about five o'clock the next morning, about a mile and a quarter from the spot, he was in Tarpoint town; I took him up upon the information of another man; he was standing in the street, holding a horse by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sort of saddle, or furniture, that horse had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. If this prisoner had been one of the persons who used violent expressions you would have known him again? - A. I do not know but I might; I thought, when I saw him the next day, that I had seen him amongst the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that this affair happened? - A.About twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark, perhaps? - A. It was not very dark, there was a moon in the sky.</p>
               <p>Q. And, perhaps, some clouds in the sky? - A. Yes; it was a cloudy moon.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt in your mind that that is the man? - A. I have no doubt of it; I saw him with the blood running down his face.</p>
