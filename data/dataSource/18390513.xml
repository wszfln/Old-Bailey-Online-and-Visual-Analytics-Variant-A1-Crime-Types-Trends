                  </hi>. I live at Hackney. On the 16th of March I had some washing clothes in a cart, opposite a door in Caroline-place, Guildford-street—I went into the house, leaving the cart for not above three minutes, I received information, went with a policeman, and saw the two prisoners in Gray's Inn-lane—the policeman took them, and at the station-house these pinafores, which had been taken from my cart, were produced.</p>

I was at my window on the 16th of March, and saw the cart at No. 4, and Harrington behind the cart, taking something out of a box in the cart, which she put into her apron—Heaney was standing still on the pavement, six or seven yards off, near enough to see what she did—Harrington went to her when she had got the things—they went round the corner, into Mecklenburgh-square—it was six or seven o'clock—they were stopped about twenty minutes' walk from the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in John-street, Edgeware-road. About a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning of the 18th of April, I heard an alarm of "stop thief," and the prisoner was pointed out to me about three rods from my shop—he ran, I pursued, and saw him stopped, and 3 pieces of bacon found on him—they had been inside my shop window, which was open, about half a minute before.</p>

About seven o'clock, in the evening of the 22nd of April, I was passing Mr. Balch's shop, and saw the three prisoners and three young men standing round the window, and one of them, who is not in custody, was cutting the window with a glazier's diamond—the prisoners were all standing still by the window—Lingford stood next to the young man who was cutting the window, and Stokes was standing on the other side—I stopped to see what they were doing—the man not in custody shoved the piece of glass in, and they all ran away—I went away also, and went home—I was sent out again directly after to Mr. Balch's shop, and when I got there I saw them all six standing around the window—I went into the shop to ask about some-thing—I did not tell Mr. Balch of it—I was not there above two or there minutes—when I came oat they were still there—I said nothing about it to the people in the shop—I went home and told my mother, Jane Bowman, and she and I directly returned to the shop—the prisoners were all there still—I waited outside the shop—my mother went in—she came out again, and we both went away—the prisoners were there then, and the three not in custody also—it was about eight o'clock—I was not there when Jones came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Langham Christie, of Cumberland-street, St. Marylebone. On the 19th of April, at half-past twelve o'clock at noon, I was in the pantry, and heard the street-door bell ring—I went up to answer it—the door leading to the area, I believe, at that time, was left open to dry the passage, which had been just cleaned—I shut the pantry door, but did not lock it—it is a common latch—when I got to the door there was a person there with a newspaper—I took it up to the drawing-room—mistress sent me into the dining-room with it, and I went, down to the pantry, in less than five minutes—when I got to the top of the stairs I saw the pantry door wide open, and the prisoner in the pantry—I called out, and asked him what he wanted there—when I got to the bottom of the stairs he asked if I wanted any black lead—(he had a parcel, of black lead in his left hand, and a blue bag in his other hand)—I said, "No—where do you come from?"—he made no answer, I felt the bag, and heard something rattle—I looked at the tray, and missed some plate—I said, "You have been stealing the plate"—he put his hand into the bag to pull it out—I said, "No, I will take care of that"—he begged of me to let him go—I sent for my master, who came directly, and went for a policeman himself—I kept the prisoner in one hand, and the bag, in the other—the bag was examined at the station-house, and contained two silver dessert forks, a table-spoon, and two papers of black lead—they were my master's forks, and had been on the tray, which I had just set ready for lunch—there was a silver salt-spoon, which he had not touched.</p>

I occupy the whole house—the prisoner was my shopman for five weeks—on Thursday, the 28th of March, I missed one £100 bank-note from my cash-box—I gave him into custody on the Mon<lb/>day fortnight afterwards—I had received, on the 19th of February, four £100 notes, and three £50 notes from the Bank of England—my cash-box was in my desk at the end of the shop—I believe I left the keys in that desk, when I was attending the counter—I missed two £100 notes on Saturday the 30th, the day after Good Friday—after searching for them, the prisoner came and searched a drawer, and said, "Here is one;" and delivered me a £100 note, No. 98, 046—No. 93, 045 was still mining—after I had traced it, he was charged with taking it, by the gentleman who was brought to the shop—I did not charge him with it myself—he denied taking any thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Foley-street, Marylebone, and am a carpenter. On the 9th of April I went to Sir Claude Scott's banking-house—I had two cheques—I had one of them changed for gold—the prisoner Walls stood at my left hand in the banking-house, and a person was with him, I cannot say who—I went to Crawford-street—when there I missed a cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Marylebone Bank—I went to the Bank the moment I missed it, to stop the payment, but the cheque was there, and had been paid—I took an officer, and went to Enfield, where I found the prisoners, about twelve o'clock—I had seen the cheque safe about a quarter past two o'clock, when I missed it about three o'clock—when the prisoners were taken Walls produced some money—he counted some gold from one hand to the other—the landlord was in the parlour, and a great many other persons came in—I gave Walls into custody the moment I saw him, but he got away from the policeman.</p>

In November last I was a letter-carrier in the General Post-office, for the St. Giles's district—I am now in a gentleman's service—I know the prisoner but never knew him employed in the Post-office—I met him in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury, on the 25th of October—he came to me with an order purporting to be signed "Woolley, Marshall, and Co.," which I afterwards destroyed—it was an order to deliver to the bearer any letters which might be directed to them—I delivered him one charged 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the portage of Which I duly received from Woolley and Marshall—I saw him again on the 2nd of November and a like transaction took place—on the 9th of November he the again in Charlotte-street, and asked if there Were any letters directed to Woolley and Marshall—I Said I had one, and gave him a treble letter charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I used to receive the postage from Woolley and Marshall once a-week, on Saturdays—this was Friday—I called on Saturday at Woolley and Marshall's, and I did not get the money for the letter—they said they had never received such a letter, in consequence of which I made a communication to the post-office—I never saw the prisoner again till the 12th of April, when he was in custody—when I delivered him the letter I told him I was obliged to be very careful who I delivered letters to, as there had been a person going about with forged orders from different firms, and obtaining letters from different carriers he said he hoped the person would soon be taken and brought to justice—I was discharged for delivering him this letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Harmondsworth, in Middlesex. On Monday the 6th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at Night, I went into the King's Arms public-house at Longford, kept by. William Godfrey—I went into the tap-room with him, and saw Stanley sitting behind the door, and the two female prisoners—I was sober—after a short time I had occasion to go into the yard, and while there the two women came up, one on one side, and one on the other—what they said I don't recollect, but I pushed them away, and one of them said, "Let me—old gentleman"—I said, "I don't want you"—she directly put her hands round me, and began to feel about my person, and before I could button up, the other put her arm round my neck, and said, "I will kiss you," and then we all went down together—I fell under them, and one of them directly said, "Stanley, Stanley!"—I could not call out, because that woman laid across my chest—she threw her body across my chest—somebody came and fell on my legs—I expect it was Stanley—I then felt somebody's hands in my pocket—I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 5 sovereigns, and a country 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a red purse in my fob pocket—I felt a hand in my fob pocket, and they tore the button off that it was buttoned with—I am sure I had that money in my fob before I went into the yard—I could feel it outside—I hung to their clothes, and when they got up it pulled me up, and I saw Stanley standing close behind them—whether he pushed</p>

               <p>them or not, I cannot say, but I was pushed down again, and they all three ran away—I directly returned <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the house—I saw the two women turn to the left hand, and Stanley to the right, out of the yard into the high road—I missed my money as soon as I got up—I held my breeches up as well as I could, and ran to the house, and complained of losing my money directly to the company in the house.</p>

               <p>said that—it Vas while they were attacking roe—the ostler was just by the side—just as he went away they came up to me—I was doing up my clothes, and I pushed them away—directly he was gone they seized me round the waist and threw me down—he went down the yard to go round into the house, I suppose, but I did not notice—I had no conversation with them before they attacked me—the women were standing within a yard of me when the ostler came by—I was saying I did not want any thing to do with them—I said so because they took liberties with me in their discourse—I do not think the ostler saw them take liberties, because when they saw him they drew back a little—they behaved impudently to me, asked if I wanted a woman, and so on—that was when I was behind the wagon—they were saying something to me when the ostler came by, but I did not take notice what—I was robbed thirty years ago, when I had my pocket picked at the top of Ludgate-hill—I never said I lost my watch and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—my son did not find a watch in a dunghill—he found a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country note in a dunghill, and I put it into my purse to take to Uxbridge, to see what country note it was—it was in my purse when I was robbed—I had had it for a month—it was found perhaps two months ago—it was quite dirty, and stained with the dung.</p>

               <p>his hand, but I could not get a glimpse of it, for before it was well down, his hand and handkerchief was up at my eyes and nose, he crammed it into my mouth, and broke out one of my teeth—I could not see, as the hand<lb/>kerchief was over my eyes, and partly down my mouth—I tried to call out, but could not get the least breath, or utter a word—by some means he fixed my arms, so that I could only get the use of my fingers—he still kept me in that position, my eyes blinded, and my mouth stopped—he took hold of my throat, and kept forcing me away from the counter, towards a back-kitchen, or wash-house, which is twelve feet from the counter on the same floor, but quite behind the house, away from the front-door—he got me eleven feet from where the attack began, against a door, which leads down to a kitchen below stairs—I had the presence of mind, being obliged to struggle for life, for I could not breathe, to kick against the kitchen-door, which leads down stairs, as I knew my niece was down there—I kicked against the door three times in my last struggle—he said, "It's no use, it's no use, if you make the least resistance or alarm, it shall be the worse for you"—he then griped my throat with more violence, so that I lost my breath and my senses—I lost all consciousness altogether—when I came to myself, I was lying with my hind-part in the wash-house, and my head in the shop, and the witnesses about me.</p>

               <p>was well aware his niece was living with him, and called to her, and at the same time stamped on the floor—this I did while I was wiping the spittle from his mouth, as he was foaming—I was raising him up, and at that time the candle went out, the door was burst open, and Etheridge ran up exclaiming, "What is the matter? who are you?"—I turned round and replied, "Why, it's me"—he said, "Who are you?"—I said, "Why, Jones, you know me very well"—he said, "Is that you, Jones? what is the mat<lb/>ter?"—I said, "Why, Mr. Harley is in a fit"—the witness took hold of one arm, while I did the other—the prosecutor being raised on his legs, looked wildly round for some seconds—there were not less than twenty or thirty people in the shop—he walked into the side-parlour with assistance—he was not carried in in a state of insensibility—we seated him in a chair, and after the lapse of about ten minutes, to my surprise he accused me of having ill-treated him—among those who came into the shop was the, policeman, who took me into custody—I requested him, in presence of several in the shop, to examine the prosecutor's neck, which he did, but could not perceive the least mark or sign of violence—had I used the force by driving my knuckles into his throat, as he stated, surely some marks would have been left, but there were none—one of the persons in the shop said,"Here is half-a-crown on the counter," and Mr. Newell, who was present, inquired of the prosecutor what had become of the sovereign which he had stated in the presence of several I had laid down on the counter—he replied he had not got the sovereign—he searched his pockets, but could not find any sovereign—a general search was made by a dozen persons in and about the shop, but the sovereign was not to be found—now, full twenty minutes had elapsed before this search, during which time the shop had been full of persons going in and out, any one of whom might easily have taken the sovereign—somebody present insinuated that perhaps I had taken the sovereign up again—I requested the policeman to search me—he said if I wished it he would—he did so, assisted by another policeman who had arrived, but they found no money on me, the sovereign in question being the only coin I had left home with, and that was brought to pay my rent—the prosecutor had called at my house on Monday morning for the rent, and my wife had told him I would call on Tuesday evening and pay him—he was well aware I was coming—the graze on the forehead I can only account for by the fall, but the blood from his lips was occasioned by his biting them, when on the ground—I deny any blood coming from his nose—they also state he was carried in a state of insensibility from where they first saw him to the little room—this is wrong—he walked merely by the assistance of myself and Etheridge, having hold of an arm each—as to the hammer, I solemnly declare I know nothing whatever about it—it does not belong to me, and never was in my possession—had it belonged to me I had the opportunity of putting it away, as I was not given in charge for at least a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, during which time the door remained open for anybody to enter or go out—I could have gone away entirely if inclined, but relying on my innocence I certainly rendered all die assistance I could to the prosecutor—I solemnly declare I never used the least violence to him—I am utterly at a loss to account for his statement to-day, which is untrue.</p>

Bryan was brought there about four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of April—I examined him, and found a wound in his back between the two shoul<lb/>ders, such as the knife produced would have made—it was about half an inch deep, and three-quarters of an inch wide—it appeared to have been bleeding, but was not then—he remained there till the following Saturday—the wound was then considered sufficiently well to discharge him—it was not dangerous at any time—it was about an inch from the spine.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Bryan and a soldier had quarrelled in his room; that he tried to separate them, upon which they both struck him, and he left the house to fetch Mrs. Griffith, who desired him to leave the house, which he did, taking his knife; and on returning for his handkerchief, Griffith struck him; he was forced out of the house, when they all attacked him, but he could not tell how the prosecutor got wounded.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New Gravel-lane. On the Saturday night in question I was at the Ship and Unicorn—there was a ball there—the prisoner was there, and a young man with her, and the prosecutrix was there—I left about a quarter to twelve o'clock—the prisoner and her young man went first, and the prosecutrix came out after them—I saw her go up to the young man, and make a strike at him, outside the door of the Ship and Unicorn, and say to him, "You have struck me on the breast"—this was close to the Ship and Uni<lb/>corn—the prisoner said, "Don't strike him, Sally, he is too drunk"——I did not hear any more—I went into the Ship and Unicorn again, and fetched Ware's young man (a sailor) out, and another followed—I went with them to New-court—we got there in about two minutes—there are about four houses between the Ship and Unicorn and New-court—when I got to New-court I saw the prisoner standing at the door, and the young man</p>

               <p>just inside—Ware was there, and I saw her going to strike the young man over the prisoner's shoulder—the young man did not do any thing then—I saw the prisoner strike Ware with a candlestick on the left forehead—the candlestick was a lightish colour, it looked like tin—Ware fell and got up again, and then they fought—every time she hit Ware she fell on the back of her head—after that she fought her with her fist—there was only one blow with the candlestick—I observed her left forehead bleeding a little, and afterwards it bled a great deal, in the same place—it poured out—it all burst out together, and I took her up—she did not say any thing, she could not speak—Ware did not strike Ashton at all before she was struck with the candlestick—I helped to take Ware home, and Winter helped me—I met a policeman, as we went along—I had not been drinking much—I knew what was going on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see all that took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was sober, more sober than Ware—I saw the prisoner and the young man from first to last after I got into New-court—the young man was standing inside the door, and did not come out at all—she was outside on the threshold of the door—he was standing by her or behind her—be was be<lb/>hind her when Ware came up, and she tried to strike at him over her shoulder—I should say she fell four times—it was a regular fight—Ware could not strike Ashton—she tried to do so, but could not—she stood up to fight, but directly she stood up, she was struck down again—it was about a quarter to twelve o'clock when I came out of the Ship and Uni<lb/>corn—that was the time I went to New-court, to show Ware's young man where she was—as soon as I came out of the Ship and Unicorn I heard her voice up the court, hallooing out—I took her young man to her, and an<lb/>other followed—I did not notice whether he spoke to Ware—she did not say any thing to him—he wanted to drag the prisoner's young man out of the house, for striking Ware in the morning—he tried to push Ashton aside, to get into the house, but the prisoner's young man pushed the door to—he pushed it open again—I do not know whether he succeeded in get<lb/>ting him out—I was looking at them fighting—I was standing there about a quarter of an hour, and saw all this going on—they both fell down in the corner, and I went to help them up; but one woman told me not to touch them, but let them fight it out—they fought with their fists—they moved about from the spot—I was there during all the scuffle, and when it was over I helped to take Ware away, and her young man went home with her—he is now gone to sea—the other two young men both came up together, and both tried to get Ashton's man out of the house. Ashton and Ware were fighting at that time—it was before the scuffle that the door was closed against them, and they tried to get the young man out—I did not notice whether they got into the house—I was looking at the women who were fighting at that time; and there was such a crowd—they were trying to get into the house both before and after Ware was struck with the candlestick, I believe—when I fetched them down there was the young man inside—Ashton stood against the door, and her young man behind her—the two young men made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> to get at him—this made Ashton come out with the candlestick; she said, "I will fight you now, <hi rend="italic">Sally,</hi> fair—come on, <hi rend="italic">Sally,</hi> I will fight you fair"—that was after she had hit her with the candlestick—I did not see them scuffling without the candlestick at first—it was after she hit her with the candlestick—she struck her with the candlestick first—she had the candlestick in her hand when I first came</p>

               <p>up, after going to fetch her young man—Ashton and her young man went out of the public-house at a quarter before twelve o'clock—then Ware and I went out—I saw Ware running after Ashton and her young man—they stopped by a gate just outside the Ship and Unicorn—the young men did not try to get into the house—they tried to get Ashton's man out—I did not notice whe<lb/>ther they stepped over the threshold—I heard Ware say she would mark Ashton's young man—she did not say, "I will have my revenge out of your young man or you,"nor any thing of the kind—she said, "I will not fight any more, I am too drunk,"when she was on the ground the last time—I was there when the young man tried to get the door open.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New Gravel-lane, and am in the same way of life as the last witness—I was at the Ship and Unicorn in company with Ware—I saw Ashton at the other end of the room and a young man with her—I left at about a quarter before twelve o'clock, and went into New-court—I saw the prisoner and prosecutrix there having a few words, and the prisoner struck her—there was a young man with the prisoner—Ware tried to hit the' young man over the prisoner's shoulder—Ware fell down by the prisoner pushing her—she fell on the back part of her head, and the prisoner fell on her—Ware got up again, and the prisoner had something bright in her hand, which she struck her with on her head—it appeared to be a candlestick—she had not got it in her hand when she pushed her—she got it from the door, as she stood by the threshold—it appeared to me that somebody gave it to her, for she never stooped—the blow hit Ware on the left temple—it bled a little at first; but all at once afterwards it came out with a very great gush, and we led her home—they had a few words after that blow, and scuffled again, and she fell again, and each time she fell, she fell right on her back—she was sensible when we were leading her home, but not after we got her home, in about five minutes—she said nothing, but "Oh," as we led her home.</p>

               <p>was never said—I heard Ware say, "I won't fight any more, I am too drunk"—I. saw her fall—she fell from the blows—the court is a kind of little square—Ashton's house is in the square—Ware fell on the back of her head near the door—I was in St. Thomas's Hospital about two years ago, and was turned out because I was saucy—it was not for stealing the patients' food or things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior dresser to Mr. Luke, of the London Hospital, and acted as house-surgeon on the 6th of April. The prosecutrix was 'brought there at one o'clock at"night—I found a wound about two inches long on the left side of the forehead—the skull was frac<lb/>tured to the extent of the external wound—I could not ascertain whether it was fractured further, as it would only enlarge the wound, and be of no use in the treatment, it would have increased the danger—in my opinion the wound was inflicted by an instrument—the sharp end of a candlestick, if struck with a severe blow, would produce such a wound—she remained in the hospital more than four weeks, which was necessary—she was not out of danger for a fortnight, or nearly three weeks—she conducted herself quietly and properly, and never used bad language there.</p>

On the 6th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I had just finished supper, when I heard a noise under my win<lb/>dow, next door to me, at No. 4, where Ashton lives—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix under my window—the prosecu<lb/>trix's head was down in a kind of stooping manner—they were both fight<lb/>ing—I heard Ashton say a great many times, "Let go of my hair"—they parted after a full minute, and the prosecutrix followed Ashton to her own door again—I heard very ill language from Ware—she said, "Come on"—using language I should not like to express, and put herself in an atti<lb/>tude of fighting—they were fighting under my window when I first saw them—Ashton came to her where she stood in an attitude for fighting, and struck her—she fell against my feet at my door on the stones—by the time she got up again, some sailor-man said, "<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi> Heels, what are you about? you are too drunk for fighting"—(that is her mother's name, and the name she always goes by)—I heard Ware say, "Come on, you b—cow"—I believe she was very much in liquor—I saw them standing in a fighting attitude three times—I saw blows pass between them—I did not see the first blow struck—I saw Ware fall and get up again—I saw she had a cut on her head, and suppose it could come from nothing but what I saw on the fastening of my shutter—when she fell on the back of her head, the blood went on my shoe—I am perfectly certain Ashton had no<lb/>thing in her hand at the time—I could see by the gas light she had no in<lb/>strument, or any thing—Ware said, "I can fight no more, I am too drunk, for my head is cut"—I produce this shutter fastening—I took it from my window next morning—her head came quite in the direction of it, and it was rather clotted with blood when I saw it, when I got up on Sunday morning, I wiped the blood off it, and likewise off my window-ledge—there was also blood on my own door—it was a stand-up fight, as much as they could stand, but she was so much in liquor she could not stand up—I never had any quarrel with Ware.</p>

I am a widow, and live at No. 8, New-court On the 6th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I heard a noise, and opened my door—I saw the prosecutrix, and two men knocking at Mary Smith's door, No. 4—they said if the door was not opened, they would break it open, and accordingly they did—the two men and the prosecutrix went in, and made a piece of work with Ashton—I did not see Ashton at the door the prosecutrix and the two men went in—I saw Ashton come to the door afterwards—the prosecutrix said if she came out she would beat her—Ashton said nothing, but went in-doors, and told them to go away, for she would not come out at all—the prosecutrix used very low language indeed—the prosecutrix hit the first blow—that was after Ashton told her to go away—they both came out, and both fought like two men—I saw them fall twice on the grating, about a yard and a half from the house—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Elizabeth Oldham, a grocer in Hackney-road.

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, the 11th of April, I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner—I asked her if she had got any money—she said, "No, not a farthing"—I said, "Turn out your pocket"—she said, "I have not any"—I said, "Be cautious, I shall have you searched"—she made no answer—I sent her to the station-house while I went on other business—when I returned I had her searched—the sergeant produced to me a parcel of rags tied round with string—I cut it open, and found seven sovereigns and thirteen half-crowns in it—I said, "How is it you have got so rich all at once?"—"Oh," she said, "I picked it up in the park."</p>

                  </hi>. I am about fifteen years old, and work for my father, but at the time in question I worked for Mr. Goodson, a dust contractor, at Hackney-wick, where my father lives. On Saturday, the 20th of April, about half-past one o'clock, I went to the Three Mariners, to call William Terry to come to work—he worked with me—I did not find him when I first went—he came in about five minutes afterwards—when I first went in I saw Denby and Gazeley—then Shaw came in, and then my mate Terry—I saw Rock sitting by the window, and his bundle by his side—I saw him asleep, and saw Denby get up and take his bundle across the room—I saw Gazeley and Terry go up to him—Shaw did not go near him—I saw Denby, and Gazeley, and Terry, each take something, but not Shaw, that I saw—Denby put what he took under his frock-coat—it was some<lb/>thing like a handkerchief or shawl—I staid there about five minutes—Denby came back while I was there, and I saw him take something out, but I do not know what he did with it—I went away with Terry to work—I did not see him have any thing when we got into the yard to work—they all went out, but none of them said any thing to me—I have known them all by sight for a long time—I did not tell any body—I was frightened—I was not taken to the station-house—the policemen did not take us—they asked if I knew any thing about it—I did not like to tell them, as I was frightened, and they said, "Oh, we must take you," but my father said, "You had better not, you shall have him when you want him"—I went to the station-house to see Terry, to see what they did with him, and to tell his father—I was not taken on Saturday night—I went to the justice on Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Cambridge public-house, in Whitechapel-road. Mayfield was in my service about two years—on Wednesday the 8th of May, Thomas Christmas, who was at work in my cellar, made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went to the cellar—I had my attention directed to a rafter, where I found seven shillings and a half-crown—I was obliged to get on the top of a barrel to reach it—I took it down, Christmas marked it in my presence, and it was replaced in the same position—I communicated with Rutt, the inspector, and showed him the money after the house was shut up that night, and then I found a shilling added to the money—on the following morning, about nine o'clock, I went to the rafter, and all the money was then gone—I took 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, two crown-pieces, some half-crowns, and shillings, to Rutt—he marked them on the head, and I on the other side—I then took them back to my house, and placed them in the till, part that day and part the next day—this was on Thursday the 9th—on Friday I found one shilling in the same place—it was one that Rutt and I had marked—the prisoner had access to the cellar, and nobody but him—he went down to tap beer and so on—I left the shilling there—I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on the Saturday, and put into the till—on the Monday morning I looked into the cellar, and found the shilling gone, and no silver there—I looked again in the even<lb/>ing, and found two half-crowns and one shilling—one of the half-crowns and one shilling was marked—on the Tuesday I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and put into the till—I went to the rafter on Tuesday night, and found three shillings more, and a sovereign, besides the two half-crowns and the shilling.</p>

On the 16th of May I saw Mr. Crane's gig in Gracechurch-street about four o'clock—I was at my second-floor window—he drove up right opposite my house, and went into a shop—presently the prisoner came round behind the gig, looked into it, seized the cape by the corner, pulled it gently down, and ran off with it—I opened the window, and called out "Stop him"—he threw it down, and the policeman immediately seized him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the family of Mr. Newel, of Cockspur-street. On the 2nd of May I was in the Court of Requests, in Castle-street. I did not notice any person round me but the prisoner, who was close behind me—I felt my gown pulled several times—I looked round, and saw the prisoner several times behind me, but it did not strike me what he was doing, till Mr. Groom asked me if I had not lost something—I then put my hand into my pocket, and found that I had lost a half-crown, 2 sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, and some halfpence, which had been loose in my pocket—I had a handkerchief in the same pocket, but that was left—I am quite certain I had my money safe when I first went into the Court—I saw the whole of my money again the next day—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—here is one sixpence rather bent, which I know to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. Martin-in-the-Fields—I was attending the Court of Requests on the 2nd of May, about four o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of the prosecutrix, <hi rend="italic">hitching</hi> her gown up gently—he at last got it up, and I observed him very busy with the pocket—he drew his hand out, and dropped a fourpenny-piece—a witness who is here picked it up—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—I ran up and seized him with some money in his hand—he struggled, and thrust his hand into his pocket—I asked the prosecutrix if she had had her pocket picked—she felt, and said "Lord bless me, yes! every thing I had is taken out"—I immediately tried to get the prisoner's hand out of his pocket, but he dropped the money in the pocket, and in the pocket I found one half-crown, two sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, and five farthings.</p>

I have deceived you about it all this time, but I hope you will pardon me, as it was done without any meaning of cheating you in any way whatever, for what I owe you I will pay you by so much per week or month, for I have got into debt without my wife's knowledge—she knows not that I am in debt to you, and that is the cause of my doing what I have done.

I called for the said parcel, by the desire of the man who gave it to me, three times, and was refused it by the woman who keeps the coffee-house. I persevered, according to my employer's orders, and ultimately was taken into custody by a police constable. If I had come by the said property by my own act of burglary, I should have taken it to my parents' residence in Cow-cross-street, within three hun<lb/>dred yards of the said coffee-shop; but I obeyed the mandates of the man who employed me, also would I not have brought it to my poor parents, on Saturday morning, the time of the robbery? My Lord, I was deprived of the clothes I had on then, and furnished with my present garb. My parents had purchased my said clothes from a master tailor on Clerken<lb/>well-green, in September last, and the police constable satisfied his inquiry on that point."</p>

On Sunday night, the 14th of April, I saw Spright in company with the prosecutor, about half-past nine o'clock, at the Friend in Need, Pancras-road—both the prisoners were drinking with him—I saw them cross the road twice during the night to the house where the prisoners live—Spright had hold of his arm—they were in that house some time, and about two o'clock in the morning there was a cry of murder there—I went in, and an old man said he had been robbed of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took some parties in charge there whom he accused—it was not the prosecutor—I went back to search for the old man's purse and met the prosecutor coming out of the house—he said he had been robbed of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had been drinking, but could talk and walk very well—he asked me to direct him to Compton-place—I did so—he said he would attend at the police-station in the morning—I met Spright a week after the robbery in Pancras-road, and told her I wanted her—she said Crew knew as much of it as her—I found some money on her—the bag has never been found.</p>

On the 15th of April I was in Alton-street, Pancras-road—the landlord of the Brewers' Arms called me, and said two females and a man were drunk in his house—I told him to turn them out—he did so—Spright was one—she had a bundle, which fell and came open—I took her and Crew to the station-house—I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them in gold and silver—knowing them to be prostitutes I suspected it was not right, and took them before the magistrate—they were liberated, and the property detained—a few days afterwards information of this robbery was given at the station-house—when before the Magistrate Spright said she found the money on Monday morning in Brewer-street, and that Crew was with her at the time—she said so in Crew's presence—that she picked it up in Brewer-street on Monday morning—this examination is signed by the Magistrate—I know his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner Spright says, 'We both found it on Monday morning, and I picked it up' Crew says, 'I was with her at the time she picked it up.'"</p>

On Wednesday night, the 24th of April, I went out to get some wood, after the clock had struck eight—my room is the first floor front—I latched the street-door, and fastened my room-door with a catch-latch, which could not be opened without a key or force—the street-door could be opened outside—I returned within ten minutes, and found the street-door open—when I went up stairs, I could not get into my room, as somebody inside resisted against me—I asked who was there—nobody answered—I said, "For God's sake, who is in my place?" and a voice answered, "It is only me"—I screamed out, "Murder"—a man opened the door, and ran down stairs—I had closed the street-door after me when I came in—I went down after the man, find found him behind the street-door, trying to open it—I opened it myself, got on the step, and screamed "Murder"—he up with his fist and knocked me from the door into the road, and came out of the house—I got up and followed him, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Burgess—the prisoner is the man—when I came up I told Burgess to hold him, for I had found him in my place, and I would send for an officer—he held him, and an officer came—he offered to go back to the house with me, by myself, to let me see he had taken nothing, but I would not agree to that—the officer went back with me—I found a gown, which I had been making, taken off a chair-back where I had left it, and spread open on the floor, and two pairs of stockings, two caps, a handkerchief, and some pieces of linen, all lying on the gown-piece—I had left them all on a chair behind the door—there were two shawls on a round table, with a collar and handkerchief—I found them removed to a chair, and rolled up together—there was a petticoat, a table-cloth, and apron removed from their places—I gave them to the officer—I lost nothing—I am sure the prisoner is the man—T never lost sight of him—it was a beautiful moonlight night—there was nobody running in the street but him.</p>

What do you want with me?"—I said, "I don't know yet"—the prosecu<lb/>trix came up and said, "He has robbed me"—in the mean time the officer came up—the prisoner said, "I was only making water"—the policeman took him—it was a moonlight night—several people came up at the time, but not in the direction of Stable-yard-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, living at Lewisham. In April the prisoner was employed to buy marble for me—he had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, and I perceive it was bought in his own name—I believe he met with a friend of his father's, and the marble was purchased for me—he was in my employ till last October, at different periods—he had a quantity of marble at my former residence, delivered to him to manufacture at his leisure, the other was removed to my new building—Subsequent to the purchase of this marble, I employed him in October to put in some sills, and a builder was mentioning to me about the prisoner wishing him to take two marble chimney pieces in payment of a debt—this awakened my suspicions—I counted the marble that the prisoner had brought, and found but a small portion left—I made inquiries, and ray suspicions were so excited that I returned home, and asked my men whether the prisoner had had any marble away, and they told me yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you lost any marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot say how much, be<lb/>cause it was all intrusted to the prisoner—it is not here—I am deficient altogether, about fifteen feet—it is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was on my own premises—no one had the care of it—I do not know when I saw it last safe—I had no idea of any thing of the kind, I am not looking over my premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told all you know on the subject of this marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as regards my acquaintance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130162"/>
               <p>with it—as far as it can be ascertained, there is a deficiency of six or seven feet—I know of no circumstances except the witness's evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you know of no circumstance causing this prosecu<lb/>tion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as what has grown out of it—as far as asking him to de<lb/>liver up the marble that was delivered to him—I never came to make any charge, nothing but a civil charge for him to return property intrusted to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you now mean to tell my lord that you have told the circum<lb/>stances out of which this prosecution has arisen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because these three pieces were taken away without my consent—Mr. Duboice was in<lb/>trusted with some marble, and the rest was at my premises—he had no right to take it away—this was imposed on me by the Magistrate—I made inquiry of my men whether Mr. Duboice had removed any marble, to their knowledge—"Yes," a man said, "I helped him to take it away."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told all the circumstances that provoked this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing to provoke it—I have come here, which was the furthest off ray thoughts, but when a man had robbed me of my property—when I called for him to account for the marble he had supplied Captain Pidding—I have been dragged into this prosecution, as I stated before, and I am entitled to a patient hearing—I find I am deficient, and other circumstances are connected with this that will speak for them<lb/>selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Once more, I ask you, yes or no, have you told all the circum<lb/>stances out of which this has arisen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot comprehend, for the life of me, what you mean, because there are many circumstances con<lb/>nected with it—I know of no other circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner ever summon you for a sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did—I am very glad you brought that forward—he said I owed it him—I was summoned about a fortnight ago, I think—I received a summons from the Justices to appear before them—the summons was returnable last Tuesday fortnight, and I attended to it—I did not go on the Monday and charge the prisoner with felony—I had no idea that I had a felony against him—I am very sorry that it amounted to it—when I was before the Justices at the Court of Requests, I did not deny what the prisoner chal<lb/>lenged me with—I said he had to account to me for these chimney<lb/>pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Justices disbelieve that, and make an order upon you to pay the sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was bound to give him a written notice of the particulars of the set-off, and that I had not furnished him with—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. very readily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this set-off that you have spoken of what he is now indicted for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not—nothing of the kind, certainly not, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 25th of April, last year, was the prisoner at work for you at some houses of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears he was—I had supplied him with marble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you authorised him to purchase marble on your account, as he was in the trade, and you could save by his doing so 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a matter I deny—he was intrusted to go to buy it in his own name and mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say that a part of your complaint was that he pur<lb/>chased it in his own name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not consider that a complaint—here is the bill—it is at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130163"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did yon not know, that unless he went as a person in the trade, you would have had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had bought, by Mr. Tranter, some at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is not a discount of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot—there is none at all—I can go and buy as well as any man—I asked the prisoner to take some marble at my place to work into chimney-pieces—I cannot say how much, but this stolen, was on ray premises from April to October—I believe it was in May I trusted the prisoner with marble—I cannot say how long he continued to work on the houses—he did not work the whole time till the fall of the year 1838—I think he did not work till the fall of the year—he did not work till the autumn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in the autumn, say you thought the days were getting too short, and you could not get work enough out of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—that was in the fall of 1838—I knew of nothing that I owed him—he had received every shilling, but I was summoned—I had no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, on the 26th of January, send a man to the, prisoner to tell him you had determined to begin the work again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe I did—I desired him to send me by that man the saw-tackle—he refused to send it, unless I sent a written order—I sent it and got it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having sent to him for this, did you go without settling accounts with him, and employ another man on his unfinished work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did do so, because I wanted to expedite the work—on the 30th of April the pri<lb/>soner summoned me to the Court of Requests for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was a dis<lb/>puted account—he summoned me for work—it was his own saw-tackle—it was not the prisoner's work I set another man on, it was mine—I cannot say what day I had to appear to the summons—I sent to him repeatedly to bring up the marble that I had intrusted him with, but I had no know<lb/>ledge of any being stolen, and then I heard he had sold some chimney<lb/>pieces, and that led me to suspect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say any thing of what you now charge him with till the 6th of May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, I had no idea of it—this I charge him with taking, was in October, the last time he was in my employ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates say to you, "This is a most extraordinary charge; it never would have been preferred, if he had not summoned you to the Court of Requests?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of it, but I admit, for the sake of saving time, that they said what you say—but I believe they did not say any thing of the kind—I did not get a search warrant, and search his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you search his premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For what?—he had no stolen property that I knew of—I did not search his premises—I did not go to search them—I went to demand property—I went into the premises—I do not call that searching, to demand the property intrusted to his care—I went to his back-yard—he was there—I passed through the house—I saw him—I did not go any where but to the back-yard—I did not go up stairs—I did not go into the loft—I asked for marble, that was the very thing that I went for—he told me the marble he had was what I had in<lb/>trusted him with, but I owed him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on it; and if I gave him that, I should have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the marble you indicted him for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we have not found it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give a sovereign and did his wife give you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She did—I said, "This it off the bill, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130164"/>
               <p>suppose you mean?" and demanded the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back, and the sovereign was returned—I had a man before the Magistrates, to measure the marble that the prisoner worked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you offer to bribe this man with money after you made the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> God forbid—I have lived too long in the world—sooner than do a thing of that kind, I would suffer death—I certainly did not offer him money—it is the last thing I should have thought of—if I was on a dying bed, I did not—I swear I did not—I did not offer him money.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A man was here produced to the witness.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this man—did you offer him money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I deny it most solemnly—I never pulled my purse out to him—Oh, shocking!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he refuse to accept the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really this is a most affect<lb/>ing thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he refuse to accept it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My good sir, it is a thing I am a total stranger to—the constable asked if I was not going to give them some<lb/>thing to drink—I pulled out two shillings, and gave them to the witness Soard, to get drink—I believe the measurement was made—I only saw part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there found in a shed, among a parcel of rough work, some pieces of marble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did these pieces, when taken with the marble measured, amount to all the marble you had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was five or six feet short, accord<lb/>ing to my man's measurement—it was taken down by three parties—I have no recollection of saying, when the pieces were found in the rubbish heap, that I never saw a man have such an acute memory in my life—I did not proceed to take the dimensions—the prisoner did not ask me to call over the dimensions in his presence—I left it to them—after this the prisoner gave me notice to produce the bill of parcels—I had not got it till I went up to Westminster to get it—the second hearing might take place on the 13th, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates threaten to turn you out of the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Me out! Oh, no, nothing of the kind—I cannot swear it—it might have been done without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrates say that, as you had chosen to swear, they must hold the prisoner to bail, to appear, if required, but they would not send him to prison on your evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps they did do that—yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to George Grubb that you would not mind 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you could get the better of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—that is a villanous principle, come from where it will—I have been <hi rend="italic">lugged</hi> into this thing contrary to my wishes—I would rather have given 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than it should have occurred—I did not say to the constable, "Dear me, I never thought it would have come to this—I wish Duboice had begged my pardon, I would have dropped it—if he had said the marble had been taken, it would have amounted to a civil action"—I never said I never saw so acute a man—the constable did not say he would have acted as Duboice had acted, for be was satisfied he was an innocent man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say "Oh dear, I am so bad I cannot stand any longer?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I might, or I might not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Attree, and live in New-street, New Kent-road. The prisoner lived almost opposite me, in the front room down stairs—Mary Castle lived with him, and passed as his wife—she went by the name of Mrs. Lovett—the prisoner is a coster<lb/>monger, and she went out with cat's meat—on the 14th of March, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, at needle<lb/>work, and saw Mrs. Lovett come up the street with her dog's-meat barrow from her work—I saw her go into her own passage, and directly I heard the prisoner ask a woman if she would meet him at seven o'clock—I am sure it was his voice, I have known him ever since he was a little boy—I cannot tell who he addressed—it was a woman in the house, but I could not hear the woman reply—I heard Mrs. Lovett say to him, "Can't I meet you at seven o'clock? I think I am the fittest person to meet you"—the prisoner made use of very bad expressions, and said, "No"—he ran down stairs—I cannot say whether Mrs. Lovett caught hold of him, but I heard her say to him, "Stop, I want to speak to you"—the prisoner answered, "I don't want to speak to you, nor neither will I be with you"—I then heard a struggle ensue, and in about a minute I heard Mrs. Lovett call out, "Help, help, for God's sake, for he has kicked my eye out;" and then she said, "Oh, help, pray open my eye"—I went opposite the door, and looked into the passage, with other neighbours, and saw her down on the floor, and the prisoner standing over her in the passage down stairs, but not ill-treating her—he was trying to get loose from her, but she was holding him by the coat, and in the struggle to get away from her, he pulled her up on her feet—they struggled till he came to the door, and then he pulled himself out of her band, and went up the street as fast as he could go—I saw no more of him—I saw no blows struck by either of them—when he was gone Mrs. Lovett would have fallen, but I caught her in my arms, took her into the room, and sat her down on a chair—her eye was very much swollen and closed, and the lower part of her face, on the left side, very much bruised—there was a little blood, but that proceeded from her mouth and nose—I washed her face and eye, but it was impossible to open her eye—she appeared perfectly sober, but they were both very much ad<lb/>dicted to drinking—he appeared very sober—they were very bad friends, on account of a woman she had taken in out of compassion—I did not attend the deceased further than going and asking how she did—Dean, who came to lodge in the house about a fortnight afterwards, attended her—the surgeon was not called in for some time—I frequently saw her—she kept her bed—she was not able to get up the next day, and she was scarcely able to get up on Saturday—the prisoner did not come back again—I saw him at Union-hall on the Monday when she got a warrant for him, and they went to Union-hall on the Thursday following—I had seen him go down the street in the mean time, but not into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to see Mrs. Lovett on the 25th of March, about a fortnight after the transaction—I found her suffering under erysipelas, chiefly about the face and head—the face was very much distended, and swollen dreadfully—she was unable to see from the erysipelas—there was a bruise about the eye—my attention was called to the right eye, but the bruise had then ceased to make any appearance, in consequence of the enlarged state of the head from the erysipelas—I applied all the remedies I conceived to be necessary, poultices, fomentation, and such things, and she became convalescent, I almost thought; but four or five days afterwards another attack of erysipelas came on on the right arm, and then on her left leg, where there had been evidently a very violent blow given—in the left ancle—these symptoms continued increasing, sometimes disappearing and forming again, till at last it brought on an affection of the brain, of which she died—the leg became gangrenous—it brought on an effusion on the brain—there was gangrene, independent of an abscess, just below the tumour formed on the ancle—she died on the 80th of April—I opened the body—the brain was extremely congested and inflamed, and a great quantity of water effused on the brain—that was the immediate cause of death—that was the result of irritation from erysipelas—the erysipelas was no doubt caused by the injuries inflicted—there was severe injury on the face, on one shoulder and on one leg bruises or contusions—I should say all of them together were the cause, none of them in particular causing it—under a constitution like hers, erysipelas would be likely to follow injury—the erysipelas I first discovered was on the face—I saw the injury on the leg at that time, but under all attacks of erysipelas the face is the part first affected—I should think erysipelas would not arise from her drunken habits independent of the injury, but it is possible—I could not tell how long the injury on the leg had existed—I should judge from the appear<lb/>ances that the erysipelas had existed about four or five days, certainly not longer—I think naturally she was a very healthy woman, but from drunken habits her constitution was broken down—I should say erysipelas would be four or five days, or a week, coming on after the injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the injuries were sustained on the 14th of March, can you be certain they were the cause of the erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt in my own mind that the erysipelas was the result of the injury, not the least—I speak of the appearances of erysipelas in all parts of the body, all arising from the external injury—when it once begins it travels about from place to place—it very frequently arises without any external injury——drunken habits would no doubt cause it, but there being external injury, I have no doubt that was the cause—had she been more temperate those injuries would have produced any thing but erysipelas—they would have produced a sort of healthy inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I should not think it was a very recent wound—it was muchl onger than a fortnight—I should think it was not so recent as the wound on the head—the one on the ancle was the most serious part of the injury—it had penetrated through the whole of the joint, which must have produced very great irritation in the system—erysipelas would be most likely to attack the part which had been previously injured—that wound itself would not have produced erysipelas, it must have been the result of more recent in<lb/>jury—the erysipelas first commenced in the head—erysipelas in the leg did not make its appearance for two or three weeks after I saw her—the wound in the leg could not have caused the erysipelas in the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, Newington-causeway. On Wednesday last I went to Mitcham to see a friend—it was the day of Dorking-races—I left Mitcham between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and was the worse for liquor—I went into an inn at Mitcham—I had three sovereigns in my purse when I went into the house—I had received them from my friend—I could not find a coach at the inn—I waited there about a quarter of an hour, and had a glass of brandy-and-water—I changed a sovereign to pay for it, and received 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in change, which consisted of half-crowns and shillings—I put them into the other end of my purse—I also had one shilling in my pocket, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—not finding a coach, I walked on towards Tooting, and between Mitcham and Tooting I heard a glass coach come by—I then took my purse out of my pocket and put it into my stocking—when the coach came up I asked the man if he could convey me to London—he said yes—it was the prisoner Clarke—he got down and let me inside the coach—there was somebody rather shorter than himself on the box, who I cannot recollect—I found a little girl and boy inside—the little girl was very anxious indeed to get home—after getting a little way the horse would not go on—we got out and walked a little way, as Clarke asked me—I walked a very little way, being very ill and very sick, I was obliged to get in again, and the children got in again soon alter—soon after a man came and took the children away—they said they must have some other conveyance to get them home—I do not know where this was—they left me in the coach, and I went to sleep—I was awoke by Clarke asking me if I was cold—I said, yes, I was very cold—he covered me over with a great coat—I do not think he stopped long inside, but I slept so soundly I do not know—I went to sleep again directly—I cannot say when I awoke again, but I was sick and vomiting, and he opened the coach-door—at Vauxhall-bridge he came to the door, and told me I must get out, which I did, and asked him where I was—he said, "At Vauxhall-bridge"—he wished me good morning—he did not ask me for any money for the ride—I went on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Long-lane, Ber<lb/>mondsey—my workshop is in the rear of my house. The prisoner was a turner in my employ, and had the keys to open my premises, at five o'clock in the morning—on the 29th of April I missed about fifteen rosewood veneers—I sent for the prisoner, told him he was aware I had been robbed for a length of time, and my suspicions fell on him—he denied it—I after<lb/>wards got a constable, and went to the prisoner's lodging, in Baalzephon-street—the prisoner was there—I then mentioned to him the name of Mr. Tilley, who had charged him with taking some veneers, and I desired the prisoner to come to my parlour, that he might see Tilley—he came and saw him, and Tilley charged him with taking six veneers—the prisoner said, "Tilley, don't be so hard, it is only five I have taken"—I then begged the prisoner to tell who his accomplices were—he denied, with great violence, that he had any accomplices.</p>

               <p>out-house, and the rest were falling—they had been thrown over a wall—I watched, and saw the prisoner come from that direction, and go up a gar<lb/>den belonging to a Mr. Smith—he gathered them up, and then looked about—he saw me and my wife at the window—he dropped them, and went out of the garden—I then drew down the blinds of my window, and watched—he came again, looked up, and saw no one—he then gathered up the veneers, and put them over a wall leading to his own lodging.</p>

I went on the 29th of April to the prisoner's lodgings, with Mr. Fear, and brought the prisoner to his house—the prosecutor said, "Now, Harrison, here are you and Mr. Tilley, face to face; I want to know who is the receiver?"—the prisoner said, "I really cannot tell you; what I took I took myself "—I took the prisoner to the station—his lodging was not searched.</p>
