                  </hi> (33, <hi rend="italic">City Sergeant</hi>). At 9 a.m. on April 6th I examined the outer door at the back of 18, Aldgate High Street—the door of the room had apparently been secured with two screw-eyes and a padlock; one was screwed through a piece of beading into the door<lb/>post, and the other into the door; the padlock passed through the two eyes—the screw-eye which had been fixed to the doorpost had been drawn out, and this piece of beading had been split—the lock of the door was unlocked—if the owner locked it when he went away, someone must have unlocked it, or else the bolt would have still been shot—nothing was disturbed in the place—the door was about 18in. open—at the station the prisoner said, "I only went there to beg"—two keys and some memo<lb/>randa were found on him—neither of the keys fitted the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk agent, of 19 and 20, Gutter Lane, first floor—on the evening of March 26th I was in my office; a boy ran in and said something—I ran downstairs and saw Mr. Coley's place below was in darkness—that was the ground floor—the door was open, and by the light outside I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the warehouse with this piece of string—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I am waiting for James"—I asked him again, and he made the same reply—I said, "Where is Mr. James?"—he said, "Upstairs"—my boy went for a constable, and returned with one, and the prisoner got out on the door-step and made come remark about James—the constable said, "Before you go away I want to know something more about you," and took him back into the warehouse—farther assistance came, and we searched the place, but could not find anyone else—the constable asked him again—he said that he had been drinking, and he supposed he most have wandered into the place—he showed no signs of drink; he was perfectly sober—there is no one named James—he said, "Those who have broken into the place must have got away."</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior Registrar of the West<lb/>minster County Court—under Sec. 28, County Courts Act, 1888, I pro<lb/>duce certified extracts from the County Court books, showing proceedings against the defendant John Martin Gurrin, signed by my colleague, Charles Ernest Cuff—I find a judgment in the Queen's Bench Division of July 24th, 1896, in favour of the Bell Punch Printing Company, Limited, against John Gurrin, trading as Abbott &amp; Co., for £29—on March 22nd, 1900, the defendant was brought in custody to me by the bailiff, Loote Jeffery, when this affidavit was put before me, partially prepared on a printed form supplied at the County Court—the names of the plaintiff and defendant were filled in, and the affidavit commenced "John Gurrin, of 79, New Oxford Street"—I struck out the words "County Court, holden at Westminster," and put in "said Court," so, that it reads. "Under the Debtors' Act an order was made, in pursuance of order of the said Court"—the amount was £10 14s. 4d.—the second paragraph consists of two alternate clauses, one containing the words, "I was adjudi<lb/>cated bankrupt," the other, "A receiving order was made"—the date of March 16th, 1900, had been tilled in in both—I called the defendant's attention to it, and asked him whether it was an adjudication or a receiving order—he made some remark about a petition; then I asked him, "Was it an adjudication?" and understood him to answer in the affirmative, and struck out "Receiving order"—I then asked him in what Court the proceedings were, that having been left blank—he said, "In the London Bankruptcy Court"—I asked him the date it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>—he said it had not yet appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>—I struck out that clause—I initialled all the alterations, swore him to the affidavit, and discharged him from custody—this signature was on the affidavit, and the jurat had been filled in—I can only see his writing and my own—the affidavit is made in pursuance of the County Court Rules 30 and 31,1889, Order 25—a judgment summons against the defendant, dated December 31st, 1896, was heard on January 26th, 1897—it was an instalment order of £1 a month—six instalments had been paid on committal orders, and this, the seventh order, was taken out on January 19th, 1900, and was heard on February 6th, and made for 12 days, the order being sus<lb/>pended till March 1st—the balance in arrear was £10 10s. 10d., and 3s. 6d. the costs of the summons.</p>

I live at 12, Faith Street, Bethnal Green—I am a traveller—I was in my room on a Jewish holiday in April, with my friend Morris Taylor, about noon—a gang of boys, 18 to 20 years old, attacked the house, and bottles and stones began to <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> through the window—one bottle struck my friend in the face—I have a room downstairs, and another upstairs—I rushed out to catch one of the boys—Taylor followed me—I suddenly felt a shot in my back—Simonson was in the street near my door—the street is narrow—I saw a pistol in his hand—it made a hole in my overcoat, and in my back I have a wound—I tried to catch him, but he disappeared in his own house, No. 5, which is opposite—I heard him call out; I could not understand his English, but</p>

               <p>he seemed from his gestures to be exciting the boys to attack me—we had a dispute eight days before this; he said that one of my children broke a window in his house—I was seen by the doctor immediately after<lb/>wards at the Police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I come from Bloder, in Poland—I have not been in prison there, nor in Siberia—I see nothing bad in the streets—the pri<lb/>soner excites the boys against the Jews—my house is not a brothel—the prisoner keeps a brothel, and was summoned for it—I have four children—I have two rooms—no young woman is living there—the prisoner lives opposite—he did not come to me in the street and say, "I think it is scandalous of you to keep a brothel in your house, which is exactly oppo<lb/>site mine"—I did not reply, "I shall do as I like; I am a Siberian; I do as I like out there; I shall do as I like here; I have been there 20 years; if you do not keep your jaw in I will send you to Stratford" (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the cemetery.</hi>)—I work in the summer on lemonade, and in the winter for Mr. Cohen, 62, Leman Street—I received £2 from the guardians to help me to travel with goods to sell—I am a pedlar—I travel to sell—I have bills at home from where I bought goods—I would have worked longer for Mr. Cohen, but he sold out in the holidays, about September—there was a crowd of about 30 people—they did not shout, "Dirty brothel-keeper"—the prisoner pays the boys a shilling to throw bottles—Mr. Taylor is a friend of my wife's—he is a tailor—we talk Yiddish—Barcovitch is a presser—I only knew him at the accident, when he was standing with another man, and asked if I was shot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookmaker, of 207, Stanhope Street, Hampstead, Road—some of my operations are in the street—on the Lincolnshire Handi<lb/>cap this year I had a bet with Mrs. Sadler, the prisoner's wife—she backed Lackford both ways, to win and a place—she handed me a slip—two slips were handed me—on the first I paid her 6s. 6d. on March 27th for the race run on the 26th—I kept the slip in my house, having paid the money, and everything was satisfactory—on the 28th I showed the prisoner the slip—he snatched it from my hand—it has my figures on it—I have not seen it since—I retained this other slip, which was produced before the Magis<lb/>trates—5s. 3d. was due to Mrs. Sadler, but I gave her 6s. 6d. about 12.50p.m. on the 27th—within a minute the prisoner came up to me in Warren Street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190104220025"/>
               <p>Tottenham Court Road, with another man—I knew prisoner by sight, because he had asked me for money on other occasions—he said, "I want 30 f—shillings off you"—I thought he was joking, laughed at him, and said, "What for?"—he said, "Well, you know what for; it was a bet my <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> gave you yesterday"—I said, "I have just settled with your <hi rend="italic">missis,</hi> and everything is satisfactory"—his <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> stepped forward and said, "Don't take any notice of the b—madman," and she said to him, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself; let the man get on with his busi<lb/>ness"—she came to pull him away, because he was threatening me—he said if I did not pay him the money he would have my f—guts out—his wife advised me to walk away, and I was about to do so when he told her that if she did not get out of the way he would dig her in the f—eye—I walked away—the prisoner, with the other man, followed me for about an hour—I told the prisoner that I could produce the slip the following day—the men went away, saying they would have the money the next day at all costs—the next day, the 28th, I was in Warren Street about the same time—the prisoner came with the other man—there were three others within a distance of 20 yards—the prisoner got in a fighting attitude in front of me, and said, "My f—money!"—I was a few yards down a mews—I told him I would come up and arrange with him—when I got to the top the other three men were there—I said to the prisoner, "You have no occasion to cause all this trouble, and do what you have done; I knew you were wrong yesterday; here's the slip,' and I produced the slip Mrs. Sadler had given me—he snatched it at once—he had another slip in his right hand, and he said, "<hi rend="italic">That</hi> is my f——bet"—the entry on the slip he snatched was, "1s. each way Lackford, any to come, 1s. on St. Bernard II.," at the bottom, "Stakes, Poor Scholar"—that means 1s. win, 1s. place, odds starting price, fourth odds a place, and 1s. to win St. Bernard II.—that won at 9 to 4—if 1s. has to come off the top of the paper it goes on to the bottom—the 1s. has to be invested on another horse lower down—if Lackford did not run, the 1s. would go on the next horse—if Lackford got a place the same condition would arise—if the Stakes were still in hand, and St. Bernard II. won, the 1s. would go on Poor Scholar—Poor Scholar lost—the result was, Mrs. Sadler was entitled to 5s. 3d.—I had not made the bets recorded on the seoond slip—I said, "I have never seen that slip in my life; that has nothing to do with me"—one of the men with him said, "Don't b—well argue with him; let's take it off him"—I said, "You must not take any money off me"—Sadler said if he did not get the money he would chew my "f—nose off"—a soldier in plain clothes came up—Sadler said, "You have no reason to bring these people to us; this is what you have done for us, is it? We don't mind the f—police"—one of the other men used a slang term about going round the corner, thinking he saw a police officer, but the man stood against the railings and watched—I was very frightened—I had a good bit of money in my pocket at the time they threatened to upset me and take the money from me—I said, "You had better go round the corner, and I will come round and arrange with you"—the four men went round the corner; then one came back and said, "How long are you going to keep us b—well waiting round there?"—being frightened,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190104220026"/>
               <p>I went round the corner with him—they got round me again—Sadler made a punch at me, but one of the others prevented his striking me—I got so frightened that I said, "I will settle the money"—I offered 24s., which, with the 6s. 6d. I had paid, would make the 30s. 6d. they had claimed at first—they afterwards claimed 32s. 6d.—the prisoner said, "If you offer me that, I will smack it in your f—eye"—I was very frightened, and went into the Goat and Compasses public-house out of the way, at the corner of Euston Road and Fitzroy Street, near where we were standing—one of the men came in, and Sadler after him, with his wife—Sadler had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with the landlord, then said to me, "My money, or up you go"—he made a rush at me, and cleared everything in front of him—the soldier came between, and prevented his striking me—I got into a corner—he made another punch at me, the door went open, I fell through, and ran away—the other three men were there upsetting the place—I went to the Police-station, and afterwards laid an information before Mr. Denman, the Magistrate, upon which a warrant was granted for Sadler's arrest—this slip "B" is the slip I took—it records 2s. to win on loser, Jeunesse Dore, stakes on Forfarshire, and is signed I could not say what—I never saw it before—(<hi rend="italic">The signature appeared to be "Ham<lb/>mott"</hi>)—that was a losing bet with Mrs. Sadler—it means 1s. was lost on Jeunesse Dore—two slips were handed to me—I took that one to the Police-court to show it was not the one—the slip snatched from me had Sadler on it, I am certain—I had never seen slip "A" till I saw it at the Police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not touch me, because I got away too <hi rend="italic">quick,</hi> but he was in a fighting attitude for two hours on the two days—I am always frightened at bad language—I said at the Police-court that I was trembling like a leaf—I was not so frightened the first day, because I thought when they produced the slip they would know I was correct—a police-station is within a quarter or half-mile from Warren Street—I often see police about there—I did not go to the police—I was examined before the Magistrate twice—I said, "I know nothing of the prisoner, except by sight, and the prisoner said, 'I want 32s. 6d. off you'; I said, 'What for?'—he said, "For the bet my <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> gave you yesterday'; I said, 'I paid your <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> 6s. 6d.'"—that is right—I said one bet was given me by Mrs. Sadler—everybody in the neighbourhood knows them—I knew their names—he has demanded money from me on other occasions—I know him to be what he is, and should give him half a sovereign to get rid of him at any time—I have known him for 18 years—my father kept a house in Warren Street about 18 years ago—Mr. Sadler and his wife lived within a few houses round the corner at that time—I did not know their names then—they went away for 16 years, and I saw no more of them till about two years ago—I have been betting in the street between seven and eight years—I have refused bets—I refused one from a shop-boy—from 1 to 2 o'clock in the day is my busiest time—the police run me in sometimes—I have been charged three times with creating an obstruction by betting in the street—I pay the £5 fine, and go on again next day—I never "worked the clubs"—I knew the Camden Town Club—I do not know how long it has not existed—I am married, and study my borne—I was only in it once—that was when I was on my way home,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190104220027"/>
               <p>and the prisoner forced his company on me, and took me into the club—he then demanded half a sovereign—that was about eight in the evening, about 18 mouths ago—I gave him 10s.—I have been to the Thalma Square Club once, four or five months ago—I went with several people—I stopped about half an hour—the prisoner there demanded 15s. off me—I gave it to him—he lost it, and punched the man in the eye for beating him at faro—everybody in my business is afraid of the prisoner—I dare not refuse his wife's bet—on eight or nine other occasions the prisoner has taken money from me—10 or 12 weeks ago I gave him a sovereign—if slip "A" had been right it works out at 32s. 6d.—I merely answered the questions before the Magistrate—Mr. Arthur Newton represented me—I could not give the whole story—I had a revolver in my pocket the second day to frighten the prisoner—I did not say in the public-house, "I will blow your b—brains out"—it was impossible to see the revolver, because of the counter—I said, "Stand back; you are not going to turn me out"—the revolver was not loaded—I ran away to avoid taking out the revolver—I did not mention the revolver at the Police-court—I heard the soldier say in the Court that he saw me with something that looked like a pipe—there is a barracks near—I had seen the soldier several times—I was not on speaking terms—he may have spoken—I knew before March 28th that his name was Ibbs, and that he was a sergeant-major instructor—he came to the Police-court in uniform—the men would not allow me to get away—they went, round the corner from the police—I went round the corner to save myself trouble as well as them from the police—I signed "Richard Cox" to my deposition because I am known by that name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Arthur Magnus, a commission agent, of 67, Stanley Street, Liverpool—his telegraphic address is "Magnus, Liverpool"—our condition as to telegraphic bets is up to £5 up to the time the race is to be run—I received from Arthur Thompson, 325A, King's Road, Chelsea, a deposit of £10—he could send any sum he pleased—he assumed the name of Tar—this telegram, No. 3, reads, "Perch, Edwardine, Tar"—that means "Put me £5 on Edwardine to win"—No. 5 is "Perch, Chirpy, Tar," and No. 6 is "Perch, Hobnob, Tar"—those were horses running in the 2 o'clock race—telegram No. 3 is signed 2.35, and I should receive it about 10 minutes afterwards—Edwardine won on February 22nd, which resulted in a loss of £30—the telegram would take half an hour to get from Regent Street to Liverpool—I sent £25 in notes, and two sovereigns, and a postal order in a registered letter—he had lost £2 on a previous bet—Chirpy won on February 27th, which was a loss of £25 to us—I thought there was a mistake, as 48 minutes was a long time in comparison with a telegram which we had before, and I requested that the time should be repeated—I wrote to Thompson the same night, and have a copy here—(<hi rend="italic">Dated February 27th, declining to execute farther commissions pending inquiry</hi>.)—I got another telegram on the 28th for Model, and wired to Thompson that no commissions would be executed for him—I got no reply—it takes a few days to get the answers—I wrote again on March 1st, "I wrote you last evening no further com<lb/>missions would be executed for you; nothing was done for you"—I re<lb/>ceived</p>

               <p>no reply—there is more than £10 in our hands, and we have had no claim for it—the telegram of the 28th means, "Put me £5 on Hobnob to win"—Hobnob had won, and we should have lost £50.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Berkley Street, Somers Town, and am an assistant to Mr. Robert Bryden, a certified bailiff—on Thursday, April 4th, I went with Mr. Bryden to 61, Burton Crescent—we got there about 2.30 or 2.45—a Mr. Hughes was with us—we found Mr. Sewell, the assistant bailiff of the Clerkenwell County Court, there—we started moving the goods from the front room—the prisoner came in with a friend named Batchelor—they made a disturbance—the prisoner used bad language, and they were asked to leave the room—Batchelor did so; he had to be pushed out at the door—I did not do it, somebody else did—the prisoner stayed in the room—he had a stick in his hand, and tried to hit Sewell on the head with it—I was taking the things out of the room then—the prisoner said, "I will blow you all b—well up before I am done"—he then got some white powder; I do not know where from—he put it on the floor in a lump in the middle of the room—he then took a bottle out of a box, without a lid, which was in the room—I had not put the bottle there—the box was full of bottles—I was taking the goods</p>

               <p>out into the passage, and when I came back he was opening the bottle—he was in a stooping position, and was going to pour the contents of the bottle on to the powder—I rushed across the room to try and save other people's lives from being in danger—there were 15 people in the house—I was about 2ft. away from him when' he said, "Take that, you b—; I wish I could give you more," and threw some of the contents at me—he had poured a little of the liquid on to the floor—my clothes were burnt (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—both my hands were burnt; they are better now—when he threw the stuff at me I was not struggling with him—I had not quite reached him—immediately the stuff was thrown I seized him by the throat with my finger and thumb, and took the bottle out of his right hand with my left—he then fell on the floor—he dragged hold of my coat, trying to pull me with him—I managed to keep away from him—one of the lodgers brought me some oil, which I rubbed over my hands—I was taken to Dr. McDonald by a policeman—I felt just as if I was on fire—my leg was burnt through my trousers; it has healed now—I gave the prisoner into custody—he was slightly muddled; he was not exactly drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went there to assist Mr. Bryden to execute a warrant—I told the Magistrate that the prisoner came in with a big stick—the depositions were not read over to me, that I know of—I told the Magis<lb/>trate that the prisoner said, "Take that, you b—; I wish I could give you more"—I said, "I rushed to him and tried to take the bottle from him; he then threw the contents of the bottle all over my clothes and my hands"—that is not a different story from what I am telling now—I did not see what occurred when the prisoner poured the acid over the white powder—I noticed when I got hold of him that the room was all full of smoke—he only poured about two drops on to the powder before he threw it over me—when he began pouring the stuff out of the bottle I thought the place would be blown up—I got hold of the neck of the bottle, and he had the butt—it was not while trying to get the bottle from him that the acid came over me—my hands were drenched when I got him by the throat—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the bottle—I cannot say how much there was in it—he did not upset any of it after I caught hold of the neck, because I held it up—before it occurred he did not say if we packed the bottles in the way they were done we should cause a blow up—he did not say, "For God's sake, what are you doing, handling the bottles like that"—I did say before the Magistrate that I would not swear that the prisoner did not say that—I will swear now that he did not—I have considered what he said since—I have not talked the matter over with anyone since—I was slightly confused at the Court, being in such pain.</p>

               <p>a judicial order to give possession—I went to 61, Barton Crescent, on April 3rd, and again on the 4th, about 1.30—I did not see the prisoner—I saw Mrs. Murray and told her I was going to carry out the execution; the warrant was one for distress as well as ejectment—I went into both rooms—in the front room there were a large number of medical bottles; I collected them with one of my fellow workers—I have had 12 years' ex<lb/>perience in a chemist's shop, and I said that we should have to be very careful with them, and I would pack them myself—I packed them, partly in some drawers which we took out of a table and partly in some trays—this bottle was packed in a large drawer, and was surrounded with 40 or 50 other bottles of all colours, but very few blue ones—I knew they contained acid—I think there were five drawers altogether, and we placed them on one side near a window on the floor, side by side—I was going to have them put on the tail part of the van—I remember Mr. Bryden and the last witness coming in about 2.30—I first saw the prisoner sometime after three—he came in with a man called Batchelor, who made himself very offensive—I asked him if his name was Mr. Banks; he said, "No;" and I said, "Well, we have a troublesome job here, and we don't want to be troubled with you," and we put him outside—the prisoner had a tremendous great stick in his hand—his behaviour was like a mad man's—he used very offensive words, and would not submit to having the things taken out—I said he would have to submit to it—he was going to strike me with the stick when Mr. Bryden, I think, wrenched it out of his hand and put it on one side—Mrs. Murray came and pre<lb/>vailed upon the prisoner to be quiet—he remained in the room quietly for about 20 minutes, then he started again, and said, after some bad words, "I will kill the lot of you; I will blow the place up and set fire to it"—Hughes and Ridgewell were taking things out—I was handing them to them, and I smelt something very unpleasant—I turned round and said to Ridgewell, "He means doing it"—I saw some powder on the floor, and some black fluid mixed with it—I did not exactly see the prisoner's position—the fluid set the powder on fire—the powder was about 12in. by 8in. on the floor, and the flames about 4in. high—I stamped them out, and Ridgewell went to try to get the bottle from the prisoner's hands—I heard them scuffling, but did not see them, because I was trying to put the fire out—I did not see any fluid coming from the bottle—I turned round and saw Ridgewell, who appeared to be in great agony—the prisoner said, "I am sorry I was not more successful"—a man brought a bottle of oil—a constable came in and took the prisoner out of the place—I stopped behind to execute the warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know if I used the word "kill" before the Magistrate; I said "annihilate"—the prisoner said he would kill the whole lot of us—I did not see him pour the acid over the powder; it was the smell which attracted my attention—the flames must have been created before Ridge well rushed at the prisoner—I did not see Ridgewell go to the prisoner before I tried to put the flames out—I did not know that the prisoner got any of the acid over himself—I know now that he did.</p>

She is very young; if you intend to marry her, then you will have to show me that you are a single man; somebody told me you are a married man"—he said, "I am a single man; I have not married before"—I did not want him to take out my girl any more—I said, "As soon as you will show me some papers which will convince me that you are a single man then I will allow you to take her out"—he said, "All right, let the girl be with you in your house, and as soon as I get the papers I will marry her"—I heard him tell my daughter that he was a</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. Edinburgh, and Divisional Surgeon of Police—I live at Salisbury House, Ilford—on March 18th I was called to the defendant's residence by a telegram from the police—I saw the deceased there; he was about six months old—he had been dead some hours, as <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had set in—on March 20th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; he had died of acute pneumonia—both the lower lobes of the lungs had been inflamed, and were red and solid—I should say pneumonia had existed four or five days—whooping cough began a month before that—there was no bronchitis in the lungs—if there had been medical attendance in the early part of the illness, I think the child's</p>

               <p>sufferings would have been alleviated; I think its life could have been prolonged, and, perhaps, saved altogether—the pain could have been alle<lb/>viated by giving it some drugs, which would have reduced the inflamma<lb/>tion—it had not had any medical attendance or any medicine at all—during the whooping cough stage medical attendance would have assisted it—I have had several children about this age lately whom I have saved; one or two died, but some of them lived—there has been an epidemic in Ilford just lately—if I had been called in when it was suffering from pneumonia, I should have given it some acid tanilade and some anti<lb/>febrine drugs, which would lessen its sufferings—it must have been in such a condition that any ordinary parents must have seen its condition—considering it had been ill a month, it was fairly nourished—there was no deformity, and no signs of any external injury.</p>

I am Coroner for the Metropolitan district of the County of Essex—I live at Loughton, and am a medical man—I held an inquest on the deceased child on March 19th and 22nd—the prisoners gave evidence—their evidence was taken down in writing, read over to them and signed by both of them—they were cautioned—their statements were voluntary—(<hi rend="italic">The evidence of Alice Welsh was that the deceased was her son, aged six months; that he had been suffering from whooping cough; that after he had had it a fortnight, she sent for an elder of the Churchy and had him prayed over; that he got worse and worse, and died on the 18th. Henry Welsh said that he was the deceased's father; that he knew he had whooping cough, and thought it had bronchitis as well; that an elder was called in to pray over the child; that he thought it had a poor chance with both complaints, but that he did not call in a doctor, as it was against his religious belief, and that he took every care of his children with that exception.</hi>

               <p>Avenue, Barking—I have known Henry Welsh about 27 years all his married life and before he was married—he has always been the most kind father I have ever known—I attended his child to administer the Word of God—I am an elder—I anointed the child with oil in the name of the Lord on March 3rd, 12th, and 17th—it had every attention; it was kept in one room and wrapped in flannel—we do not take the course we do because we are headstrong or self-willed, but simply to obey the Word of God, and we have proved some great successes, God healing the sick—we believe it right to trust in God solely—we allow that the science of men is a splendid institution for those who require it. The male prisoner appeared to be aware that the child was very ill—he asked for a special prayer meeting on that account—prior to that the child had been in fits—I believe after the special meeting the child had no more fits—I have attended cases where a doctor has been, and where I have seen far greater pain than this child suffered—I believe God eased the pain.</p>

This (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a plan of the Victoria Dock—it is reasonably correct—here is No. 19 shed and the fence, and beyond that there is waste ground—on April 10th the <hi rend="italic">Strath Don</hi> sailing ship was unloading at 19 shed—the <hi rend="italic">Mandelay,</hi> which was about 100 yards off, had discharged some passengers' luggage into that shed the day before, and it was there—I have known King a number of years—he was employed on the <hi rend="italic">Strath Don</hi> that day—they ceased work about 2 o'clock that day, Wednesday, and I saw King come ashore and go to the pay-table inside the dock—they had not finished unloading, but the men knocked off, and the <hi rend="italic">Strath Don</hi> did not work any more that day.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Edward's late employers gave him a good character—when arrested he had a slight discoloration of his left eye, but it was dying away—it looked as if he had had a blow there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate: Michael says:</hi> "I am not guilty. I reserve my defence. I did not touch the man, and my brother did not rob him." <hi rend="italic">Edward says:</hi> "I am not guilty in stealing the purse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners, in their defence, on oath, severally said this was a quarrel and a free fight, and that they were only defending themselves, and did not rob the prosecutor</hi>.</p>

Lewis, 162, Old Montague Street, one showing a deposit on March 4th, 1901, of £10; in the other a deposit on March 4th, 1901, of £50, both witnessed by Dora Kambish, the prisoner's daughter—on March 27th, just as the pri<lb/>soners were going into Court, Kambish said to me, "Please, sir, one minute; on the day I went to Mr. Leon, in the morning, Lewis brought me a sample, and asked me to find a buyer; I went to Mr. Leon, and on the following Sunday I went to Lewis's shop with my son and a barrow, and we toot all those hides you have got to Mr. Leon"—turning to Lewis, he said, "You know that is the truth"—he said that in English.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Webb, a platelayer, of 3, Chandler Street, Battersea—the prisoners occupied two rooms in my house till last June—when they first came they had two children, Frederick, about four or five, and Ruby, about two or three—about April or the early part of May, the female prisoner went away to be confined; she returned with a baby which was afterward scalled Dorothy—she was a nice, plump, healthy looking baby, small but plump—the prisoners left in June—the baby seemed to be getting on nioely then—the man was at work all day some<lb/>times—the woman never did any work—the children were left alone day after day—sometimes the woman went out between 9 and 10 a.m., and would not return till between 5 and 6 p.m., and they have been left alone all day crying with no one to feed them—I used to give them food to stop their crying—when the woman returned she always appeared <hi rend="italic">muddly</hi> with drink—the man was often in drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Horace Smith, of 58, Steward's Road, Battersea—the prisoners came to my house in June, and occupied two rooms on the top floor at 6s. a week—they brought three children with them, Frederick, Ruby, and the baby, Dorothy—I thought Dorothy was in fairly good condition—she was not a large child, and not over fat—she appeared healthy—about two weeks after they came the mother lost her breast milk, and she said she would bring it up on the bottle and some patent foods—I noticed that the child was gradually wasting—I advised the mother to go to a doctor—she said she would do so, or take it to the hospital—I advised her to see a doctor about six weeks after that—she said she had not been, and I advised her to go to the parish, and they would supply her with food free—she said she would do so—I did not see the baby for some time; when I did see it she was getting worse than ever, and I insisted upon her taking it somewhere, and she took it to St. Thomas's Hospital—she only took it there once—no doctor ever came to see it till Dr. Kempster came—the other children were always hungry, and I fed them—when my own children threw away their food the poor little ones would pick it up and eat it ravenously—my children would throw away pieces of bread and butter, cold potatoes, or the scrapings off the plates—on April 4th I went into the prisoners' rooms—the baby was dying—it had not been Washed—I had spoken to the female prisoner about the condition of the children, and when I did she always washed them—I saw her and the two elder children every day—the husband was in a position to see their condition; he lived in the house—he went to work sometimes, and sometimes his wife would be calling him to get out of bed—sometimes he would not go to work—he came home at nights—I have seen him drunk on pay days; nearly every week—he never brought his money home—the woman had to go to the bar to fetch it—I have said to him, "If you earn money, as I have heard you do, more than you give to the <hi rend="italic">missus,</hi> I shall go to the relieving officer and ask him to make you bring it home and give it to me for the children"—sometimes he has answered me, and sometimes be has simply laughed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not remember if I have said before that I told the prisoner I would go to the relieving officer—the woman never beat her children; there was never a bruise on them—apart from the children being dirty, there was nothing to show that the prisoners did not love them—the woman has borrowed money from me, to buy food and give it to the children—she said she could not afford to take the baby to the doctor, but she would 'take it to the hospital—she told me she fed the child according to the directions which the doctor gave her at the hospital, but I found she did not do so—she went to the hospital six weeks before the child's death—it was about 10 months old when it died—I never went into the prisoners' bedroom, or saw the bed—I have seen things that could be remedied, but I have not seen filth there—the children were dirty; they could not have got so dirty by simply playing about—the baby</p>

               <p>would have a halfpenny-worth of milk to last it all night sometimes; the children had water or tea sometimes—the male prisoner told me he went out to get some condensed milk for the children; I do not know if he did—the prisoners never prevented me or my husband from seeing the children as often as we pleased—three or four days before the baby's death the woman brought It in her arms; it was moaning, and my husband asked her to let him see it—she showed it to him, and he was horrified.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On that day I lent her 6d., to get some food for the children—she said her husband was going to get her some money, and she went out, and returned, crying, with only 4d.—he came in shortly afterwards, and I heard them having words—she said he had smacked her face.</p>

                  </hi>. The last witness is my wife; I am a plumber—the prisoners came to my house last June with three children—I saw Dorothy the same night that they came; she did not seem to be a large baby, but she was healthy—I did not see her again for a couple of months; then it looked very bad and thin—I told the mother I thought she ought to get medical advice about it—she said she would do so—the other chil<lb/>dren appeared to be neglected—the parents appeared to give way to drink—then Inspector Thwaites came—I think he saw one of the prisoners—I was out at the time—after he had been the children seemed to be a little better looked after—the improvement lasted about two or three months; then I noticed that the parents got dilatory again; they seemed to be going back to their previous habits—I remember the female prisoner bringing the baby in on April 3rd—it was nothing but skin and bone; it appeared to me to be dying—I said to her, "If I were a woman I should take the child out of your arms and give you a good hiding"—I do not know what she said—I wrote to Inspector Ross—he came next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard the male prisoner say, that when he was the worse for drink it was through his mates, who gave him drink—I only saw Dorothy three times—it did not occur to me that the female prisoner was a woman of weak intellect—her conversation was what I should expect from a woman in her class of life—the male prisoner was out of work about October—when he was employed he would sometimes be on night work and sometimes at day work—he was working for the Projectile Company—I leave for work about six in the summer and 7.30 or eight in the winter, and return home about 7.30 or 8 p.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the N.S.P.C.C.—on April 4th I went to see the prisoners and their children at 9 a.m.—I only saw the woman and the children—Frederick and Ruby were poorly nourished, and very dirty and verminous—their clothing was ragged, insufficient, and verminous; their bodies were dirty and bitten by vermin—Dorothy was lying on a bed in the front room, which was in a filthy state; it was saturated with urine and excrement, and very foul-smelling; she appeared to be a mere skeleton—her nightgown and diaper were saturated with urine and excrement, and her buttocks and thighs were very much inflamed and red and raw as far as the napkin went—she was moaning, and appeared to me to be almost in a dying condition—I called the woman's attention to the child's condition—she said, "I do the best I can for my children; Dorothy has been delicate from birth; she is only a seven months' child, and weighed 5 1/2 lb. when born. I have not taken her to a doctor, but I took her to St. Thomas's Hospital five weeks ago, and I fed her as directed by the doctor. I did not have a card or a letter, so I did not take her again. I have not the means to pay for a doctor, as my husband is only earning very little money, some weeks 20s., others 13s. and 11s. and 12s.; I had 11s. last week. I will apply to the relieving officer, and get the parish doctor to see Dorothy to-day; I went yesterday, but I was too late"—I then left, and called Dr. Kempster, who attended at 10 a.m. and examined the children—I returned with him—Dorothy was then in the kitchen, lying on a temporary bed; the room was in the same condition as it was when I first saw it. I had been there on November 24th, and saw both the prisoners—they were then both very much the worse for drink—the children were lying on the bed in the front room in a filthy condition—I did not see them between November 24th and April 4th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found no sores on the other children—Ruby did not look very well; she looked well in the face, but she had the appearance of having been shut up in the foul air for some time—her face was pale and bloated—a great many children get emaciated from being given wrong food—I cannot say whether this child had been delicate from its birth—if a child's napkins are not changed often enough, that will cause sores.</p>

               <p>School Board—I went to the prisoner's house with Inspector Ross on April 4th—I saw the children in the back room—Frederick's head was verminous, the glands of the neck being enlarged, showing a chronic verminous condition—the body was vermin-bitten, filthily dirty, and foul<lb/>smelling; his clothing was verminous, very old, ragged, and filthy; his under-clothing consisted of a portion of an old knitted vest, which had huge lice on it—he appeared to be ill—I examined Eleanor, aged three years—her head was verminous and dirty, and she was practically in the same condition as Frederick—Dorothy was very thin and emaciated—she weighed 6 1/2 lb., including a napkin and an apron; if she was 11 months old she should have weighed 17 1/2 lb.—I was told she was 12 months old, so she should have been 18lb.—the buttocks were red and raw, and wher<lb/>ever the napkin touched she appeared to be scalded and the skin to be loosened—she was moaning, and appeared to be in pain and almost dying—her head was dirty, her body was vermin-bitten and dirty, her belly was distended—the napkin was saturated and dirty—I sent for further medical assistance—in the front room there was only an old bedstead; the bedding consisted of a straw mattress, which was filthily dim and very foul-smelling—the floor of the room was begrimed with dirt—the other room was not so dirty—there was a little box by the side of the fireplace, on which Dorothy was lying when I arrived—the mother was feeding the child from a dirty feeding-bottle with sour milk—the tube itself would turn the milk—on the 9th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, assisted by Dr. Nobbs—the child died from exhaustion, due to the non-assimilation of food; either from improper or insufficient feeding—I was of opinion that it was rather insufficient than improper—if it had been improper there would have been signs in the bowels—with the exception of a slight enlargement of the mesenteric glands, I found no disease whatever—the mesenteric glands could not have caused the wasting—the child was weakly, and would be very likely to suffer from dyspepsia—the condition of the room alone and their dirty state would be likely to cause the children unnecessary suffering and injury to their health—Dorothy being left alone on a bed like this one was would cause her unnecessary suffering—the health of the elder chil<lb/>dren was affected at the time—they are very pasty; they will recover with care—Dorothy was certainly in want of medical aid for some con<lb/>siderable time; it was obvious to anybody.</p>
