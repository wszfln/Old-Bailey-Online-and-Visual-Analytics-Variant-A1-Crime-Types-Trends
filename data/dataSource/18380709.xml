                  </hi>. I live in John-street, and am foreman to Mr. Jona<lb/>than Riches, a builder in Titchbourne-street. Some lead was missed—the prisoner was in my master's employ—on the 21st of June, I was placed in the office to watch—I could see the shop—I saw the prisoner—he cut up some lead, beat it up, and took some in his bosom, and some he put under a bag in the shed and secreted it under the stairs—when the time canto for them to go to dinner he left to go to his dinner, and was taken with twenty<lb/>six pounds of lead on him—the lead that was put under the stairs was removed somehow or another.</p>

               <p>"My Lord—It was not until yesterday that I knew, beyond all doubt, that the person who called at No. 4, Agar-street, Strand, upon two occa<lb/>sions, and branded me as a liar and a coward, threatening to horse whip me, and break all the bones in my body, was your lordship, under the assumed name of that despicable fellow, Lord Marcus Hill. Without further alluding to the generous and honourable feeling such conduct de<lb/>notes, I will at once acknowledge that, compared to the conduct pursued towards me by yonr father and uncles, it is meritorious in the extreme;—for you only seek to exterminate me by a sudden and positive death, and not to torture and rack me by cruelties unparalleled in the history of aris<lb/>tocratic villanies. In order to show your lordship that your threats cannot intimidate me, whatever effect they may have bad upon the weak parties whose agencies I had employed to dispose of my pamphlets, I beg to inform your lordship that I shall shortly open a shop, where I sahll in person superintend the sale of my pamphlets; when the spot is decided upon, your lordship shall have the earliest intimation of it; when the world shall see who has the most courage—your lordship in attempting to carry your threats into execution, or I in resisting them. But should your lordship-thirst for immediate revenge, your wishes can be gratified. If your lordship will send a line to the above address, appointing a place and hour where and when, I shall be happy to attend your lordship's com<lb/>mands. The enclosed handbills will convey to your lordship something of my intention, the completion of which has only been delayed by the difficulty I have experienced in finding an eligible public situation for vending the pamphlets. In conclusion, I reiterate what, upon every occasion I have alluded to in my communication with your father, viz. that I seek but for justice; and until I have it I will pursue every legal means within the compass of my ability to attain it.</p>

                  </hi>. About eighteen months ago I went into the service of the defendant Teuten—he is a printer—I remember his going to live at No. 59, Union-street, Borough—before that, he lived in Drury-lane—I know the defendant Reitterhoffer—I first saw him at Mr. Teuton's printing-office in Drury-lane—I know this large placards—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at it</hi>)—that was printed at Teuten's office, 59, Union-street, Borough—Reitterhoffer is not a printer—his name is to this as the printer of it—these two a placards were also printed at 59, Union-street—(<hi rend="italic">one of these was headed "Sketch High Life," &amp;c., and the other, a smaller edition of the same</hi>.)—Reitterhoffer was present when both those placards were printed—he brought a copy in the first instance, and when he first brought it, Teuten objected to print it—Reitterhoffer then altered it to its present form—it was then printed by Teuten's workmen—I do not recollect what the alteration was—at the latter end of May this year, Teuten and myself were, walking toge<lb/>ther—asked me if I could get him some men to carry boards—I told him I could, and I got him four—he asked me to get him six—I heard Teuton, tell the men they were to exhibit the placards in Belgrave-square, to and from the Horse Guards, Hanover-square, and in Regent-street, and May Fair—Teuten appointed the men to meet at his house on the Monday morning, to meet Reitterhoffer—Teuten afterwards told me that Reitter<lb/>hoffer had met the men at ten o'clock in the morning—he told me they were to be paid half-a-crown a day each—Reitterhoffer was to advance the money to Teuten to pay them—the defendant Bryan was one of the men—he was taken into custody the first day he went out—Teuten told me that Reitterhoffer watched the board men—he said Reitterhoffer was in Hanover-square watching them—Teuten told me the man was taken into custody on account of carrying the board, and that the board was to be detained at the office, and they were to apply by counsel to the Magistrate to get the board—Teuten told me so—there was general conversation in Teuten's office amongst the men about the placards—in Teuten's pre<lb/>sence and in his absence—he was present at times—Teuten told me that Reitterhoffer expected 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by these placards, the property that the Mar<lb/>quis of Downshire robbed him of by a will—I have frequently seen Teuten and Reitterhoffer together—I have heard Reitterhoffer say he expected the 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would not let the family rest until he obtained it—I am sure I heard Reitterhoffer say that—I have heard him say it several times—Teuten was present when I have heard him say so—I will swear that—he was present several times when Reitterhoffer said that—it was the general conversation—several other persons were present in the office—the work<lb/>men—it was the common talk among them—I remember hearing that the boards were taken and broken—after that I heard Reitterhoffer say he felt quite indignant at the boards being broken, and said the Downshire family were a set of d—d thieves, and he would not mind pistolling of them.</p>

The defendant Fagnoit applied to me about taking the shop, I think, on the 3rd of Match—it was the commencement of March—he gave me a reference to some per<lb/>son in Shoe-lane, and to Mr. Teuten, Union-street, Borough—I called there and saw Mr. Teuten, some men and boys—he gave me information as to Fagnoit, which I thought at the time satisfactory—I inquired of him as to Fagnoit's respectability, and asked if there was any probability he wanted my shop for obscene prints, or any thing of that kind—he said no; that he thought he wanted to publish some respectable works, and that he had taken money from him, for works he had printed before, to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he thought I should have no difficulty in getting my money, and that he was a respectable man—I then let Fagnoit the shop—I reside next door myself—a few days afterwards I saw this placard, "A faux-pas," in the window—I went immediately I saw it, and saw him—I complained respecting the placard, and told him I considered I had been taken in—he said it should be discontinued as soon as possible; there was some other work he was about bringing out, and that should be discontinued—hesaid the work did not contain any obscene language—he told me it was con<lb/>cerning some transaction with the Downshire family, by Reitterhoffer—I told him I considered it a scandalous publication—I mean the placard—he said they were willing to abide the result of it, and, in fact, they wished to have a prosecution against them—I was not satisfied, and gave Fagnoit notice to quit my premises at the earliest opportunity—he went before his time—I only had him as a monthly tenant—he talked about following it up by other works, and mentioned the Secret History of the Court of England—he said it was a publication that would take well, and he wanted to continue the sale of the work—he did not pay the month's rent because I had given him notice to quit—he said' he had gone to the expense of ad<lb/>vertising</p>

               <p>that work—the defendant Teuten afterwards called upon me, and wanted to take the shop—I did not let it to him—I gave him as a reason that I had somebody else about it—he called several times, still seeing the bill in the window of the shop to let.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you who he wanted the shop for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the last is terview I understood him to say he was applying for Reitterhoffer—he mentioned him, but very slightly—he mentioned the name, and I under stood be wanted it for him; and as an inducement for me to let it, he offered to pay a month's rent in advance, and afterwards two months', or the whole twelvemonth—I think he told me who Reitterhoffer was—he said he had been in the service of the Downshire family, and had written this work, "The Faux-pas of the Downshire Family"—he did not tell me how long he had known Reitterhoffer, or why he interested himself about him—he did not say he was a friend of his—he applied several times about taking the shop, and said he applied for a friend—he afterwards named that friend as Reitterhoffer—I think I have seen Reitterhoffer—it is some years since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 107.) I have known Fagnoit six or seven months, or it may be eight months—I know the shop No. 4, Agar-street, Strand—I do not know who kept it, but I have seen Fagnoit in it—I saw another stout man behind the counter—I know Teuten very well—I have seen him at the shop—the stout man was neither of them—I had some conversation with Fagnoit at the shop in March last—I think he mentioned about the secret history of the Court of England, and said, the Queen's Attorney-General would take up the case, and prosecute the whole of the party, but he had nothing to do with it; but there was another think coming out respecting the Downshire family, and asked me if I knew a person named Reitterhoffer—I said I did not—he said, "You certainly must know him, he is a noted gambler"—I said I had heard of such per<lb/>son—he said, the Marquis of Downshire's being a very respectable family no doubt would settle the affair respecting the pamphlet that was coming out—he said the parties expected a very large sum of money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fagnoit's Defence</hi>. About March, 1856 or 1837, I was applied to by the defendant Teuten, to know whether I would publish work he was about to print—that work I acknowledge I was the publisher of—it was entitled "The Downshire Family"—I have several copies it—it was my intention to produce them at the trial, but they are not here—I believe it was about the month of</p>

               <p>April or May in the same year, that I was introduced to the defendant Reitterhoffer—I made arrangements with him to publish the work, and received twelve dozen of the "Downshire," and publicly exposed them in the window of my shop, in Holborn—I attached to them the name of Franklin, as I did to several other works—my motive was, on account of being greatly in debt, and I did not wish to be harassed for money which it was out of my power to pay—previous to that period I printed by the name of Ward, and as soon as my proper name was found out, I was obliged to go by the name of Franklin—I now go by my proper name—about July or August I was indicted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice, on smost scandalous and unfounded charge, and so convinced were they of its being unfounded, that they abandoned the prosecution against me—I gave up my shop at that period, and removed to my preaent resedence, No. 19, New-street-square, where I have been residing ever since—the next shop I took was of Mr. Ricketts, No. 4, Agar-street, Strand, where I assumed the trade of bookseller for about a fortnight, in conjunction with Miller, one of the witnesses here to-day, who received half the profits of that establishment; and from that period up to last May, I had nothing at all to do with Reitterhoffer, Teuten, or any other person, directly or indirectly, or with any works brought forward against the Down—shire family, nor have I seen Reitterhoffer or Teuten but once or twice, nor was I ever there when these bills were printed—on the day in question, the 11th of March, I was called on by Teuten, who asked if I could get aim two men—I replied I did not kpow—he said, "As you are poor, and much in want of a shilling, you may as well earn it as any one else"—I went out and got two board-men—he went into a public-house to have some beer, got some paste, and pasted the bills on the board himself—he gave me the bag to hold—when apprehended I was in company with Teuton, and that was the way the bag came into my possession—in fact I received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. along with Daly, who is here, and the other man, at the same time—with respect to the letter I sent, I considered I was in duty bound (although a great many remarks have been made about it) to send the letter on account of what Mr. Dyer, the Magistrate, alluded to—it was quite unknown to me that any thing of the kind was being carried on between Reitterhoffer and Teuten, but when I understood there was another work coming out, I sent for the Marquis of Downshire's solicitor—or any<lb/>body, to come to me at Tothill-fields-prison—a Mr. Thompson, I believe, came—he asked me how I could suppress it—I said by his assistance in apprehending Reitterhoffer, and that is all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Daly's Defence</hi>. This gentleman, Mr. Teuten, employed me, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to take the board out from about one o'clock till five, and told me to go about George-street and Hanover-square, and that direction; and when I came round towards George-street, a gentleman came up to me, and asked me for the board—I told him, if he would give me his name and address I would give it to him—I was paid for carrying it—he said he wanted the board, and he took from me—I said, if I was doing wrong I was sorry—I did not want to go away, and I stopped till the policeman came—the policeman asked me who employed me—I could not tell the names—"Would you know the men who employed you?" says he—I said "Yes," and I saw them standing at the corner of George-street—I described their dress to him—he said, "Are those them?"—I said, "I think they are; go nearer, and I shall know better"—we walked towards them, and they ran away, and we after them</p>

                  </hi>. I am serjeant of the 12th Lancers. I knew the deceased James Hamilton—he had no other Christian name, that I know of—he was also a sergeant in the 12th Lancers—the prisoner was a private in the same regiment—on Thursday, the 21st of June, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I received an order from Troop Sergeant-Major Murphy—in consequence of that I went in search of the prisoner Rickey—I went to Hampton Court Palace—the regiment was quartered at Hampton Court Barracks—that was where he ought to be if he was in to place—on that day he was stable sentry, and ought to have been at the barracks—I found him at the palace, within the quadrangle—when I first saw him he was standing at the entrance gate of the palace, going into the barrack yard—the deceased Hamilton joined me in the square—that was not before I saw Rickey—when Hamilton joined me we went towards where I saw Rickey—he did not stay till we came up to him, but went away—he went in the direction of Sir Horace Seymour's apartments—that is within the palace, up one of the passages—Sir Horace Seymour has</p>

               <p>apartments in the palace—we then went into the archway leading to Mrs. Wright's apartments, which are in the same passage as Sir Horace Sey<lb/>mour's—I saw Rickey again after we got into the passage—he was stand<lb/>ing at the angle of the passage—he had a pistol in each hand—they were cavalry pistols—he ought not, as stable sentry, to have had pistols with him—he presented the pistols in the direction that we were going—he per<lb/>sented them both at the same moment, one in one hand, and the other in the other—Hamilton asked him to go quietly home—that was after he per<lb/>sented the pistols—the prisoner said, "Hamilton, if you do not go back, I will shoot you"—Hamilton then requested me to return, as he thought he was better able to get him back than I was, because he was better as quainted with his temper—I then returned by the way I had entend—I had got about twenty yards off, into the court-yard, before I heard any thing—they would not be in my sight if I had looked that way—I then heard the report of fire-arms—I did not go back to the passage that was but entered the passage by another direction—I saw the deceased, and saw Rickey in charge of the guard—he was two or three yards from Humilts when I saw him—Hamilton said to me that he was shot—he was standing up—he was in charge of the guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am troop serjeant-major of the 12th Lancer. I know the prisoner Rickey—on the 21st of June he was the stable senty at the stable of the troop in the old barracks—it was his duty as such sentry to be at the stable in the evening of that day—on the evening of that day I found he was in the barrack-room, between seven and eight o'clock—this was before he was taken into custody, before the misfortune happened—there was a file of guards sent for to take him into custody before he was taken I saw him in the barrack-room—this was before the misfortune—I saw him go in the direction of the palace—he had a pistol in each hand—I did not go with the guard—I only saw him going from the barrack-yard—I saw him going, with a pistol in each hand, in the direction of the palace—I did not see him leave the barrack-room—I did not see him taken into custody.</p>

               <p>selected him to an appointment under myself, by which he derived some advantage; it was to clean my horse and accoutrements, and to keep the stores clean—I saw him in custody afterwards—I observed the appearance of bit face and eyes—his eyes seemed staring, and rather wild, and his countenance flushed—I believe he had been drinking—I had not seen him drink any thing that night—he had the appearance of a man who was ex<lb/>cited by liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 102, Cheapside, and am a book-seller. In July, 1837, the prisoner came to my house, and did business there—he took my first floor—at Christmas last he brought in his furniture—he brought his family with aim at that time—the first floor consisted of two rooms on the front of the house, and one at the back—the staircase is between them—he was not to occupy any other room—I occu<lb/>pied the shop and the rest of the house, the second, third, and fourth floors—it is four stories high above the ground floor—in the cellar there is a water-closet—be merely used that himself, his children went up stairs—his family consisted of three children—he is a widower—he bad no right in the cellar, except to have access to the water-closet—on Friday, the 22nd of June last, I ordered my apprentice, Bolster, to turn off the gas, as he generally did—that was at half-past ten o'clock, after shutting up the shop—he went down the cellar to turn off the main, but I did not see him—after he came up, we shut down the trap-door, and immediately pro<lb/>ceeded up stairs to the second floor together—I then read prayers to my apprentices and servants—while I was reading prayers, I heard a noise on the stairs, and requested one of the servants to shut the door to—it was like a person going up and down stairs—I should think it was not more than one person—the person appeared to be going up aid down, from the first floor below me—my family had retired to bed—about a quarter of an hour after hearing the noise, I proceeded to my bed-room—I have a workshop on the fourth floor—I directed Bolster to go up and close that door—on his going up, he suggested to me that there was a smell of fire—I imme<lb/>distely ran up stairs, and found that it was not in the workshop—I smelt to as I went up, but could find none up stairs—I immediately ran down stairs—we had got about half-way down, and the smoke was excessively powerful—it ascended in such quantities as to prevent my going down stairs—I ran back, and the bells began to ring—the house-bills, front and back—it alarmed my wife, who jumped out of bed, and I ran and took two of my children, one under each arm, and my servant took two, and got them safely out of the house—they were conveyed to a neighbour's house—I went through the house, I saw my wife and family aafely placed elsewhere, and returned to the premises—I found the engines there, and the firemen and Mr. Braidwood at the head of them, and after some time the fire was extinguished—I went up stairs, and there was a strong smell of turpentine in the back room on the first floor—the fire was then out—I had ob<lb/>served, before the fire was extinguished, that it was in the back room of the first floor—I saw it from the outside of the house, and I thought it had made progress from the lower part, as I saw fire in the cellar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could not see it in the back room from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I did, as there is a court goes down by the house, named Freeman's-court—when I returned from placing my family in safety, I found the fire out—I went into the back-room and smelt the turpentine—I did not find any thing in the back-room that night, but I did the next morning—the pri<lb/>soner came to me during the fire, and said to me, "Mr. Ewins, what has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183807090042"/>
               <p>James Bolster being doing?"—(that is my apprentice)—I said, "I am afraid he has dropped a spark among the shavings when he went to turn off the gas"—at that time I had no suspicion there was any thing wrong, but thought it purely an accidental fire—the next morning, which was Satur<lb/>day, some gentlemen came to inspect the premises—MR. Braid, wood was among them—a carpenter was sent for—I saw him take away the skirting of the back stairs where the fire had been—the prisoner was present at the time—when it was taken away there was a quantity of can dies and pieces of fat found, and one candle partly burnt out—I said, "it is a terrible thing"—the prisoner said, perhaps somebody in my emply might have taken the candles and secreted them there, to wait an oppor<lb/>tunity to carry them away—the pieces of fat were not tallow fat—I think one or two were pieces of pork fat—on finding this, I was induced to make a minute search in the cellar—I called Bolster down stairs—he and I went into the cellar together with a light—the cellar had had a new ceiling a few months before—I found there were some holes made in the ceiling and some thing dropping from the holes—I applied a candle—there were pieces of paper in the holes wrapped up and tied round with thread—some was brown paper and some printed paper, of various descriptions, tied round with thread and saturated, some with Venice turpentine and some with some kind of sulphur, a lump of which is in court, and the paper also—Venice turpentine is more glutinous than the other—I gave that sulphur to Mr. Baldwin—I made a further search in the cellar after the officers re<lb/>turned from taking the prisoner into custody, (which was done in conse<lb/>quence of a communication from somebody) and in a recess in the celllar was found a quantity of paper shavings, apparently saturated with turpen<lb/>tine—part of them were such shavings as would be produced in the business of a book-binder—paper cut off the edges of books—the rest was brown paper—I am a book-binder—they were such shavings as I should have occasion to make in the progress of my business—I kept my shavings in a tub in that cellar in front of the house—anybody going into the cellar could have access to that tub—there were upright pieces of wood which directly communicated with the hole in the ceiling—they were placed under the hole where the paper was—they were propped up by one another—then were shavings piled up between them, and between the shavings pieces of bro wn paper and thin mill-board spread with Venice turpentine, andapparently a light had been applied, but it had gone out—there was one or two patterns of pocket-books among the paper—I had nothing to do with the pocket-book patterns—nor do we use any mill-board so thin—but some of the mill-board there, I believe, is mine—a quantity of the wood which was piled up near the trap-door in the ceiling had been burnt—it appears there were two or three distinct portions, but that I have described had not been set fire to, but under the stairs there were other pieces of wood completely burnt—there were several heaps of wood in different parts of the cellar, some of which bad been burnt and others only partly burnt—there had been some near the trap-door, directly under the steps—that had burnt part of a pair of steps leading into the cellar, and another loose pair of steps under these steps, and other wood had been consumed also—the ceiling of the back-room was not at all affected by the fire—the trap-door was very much burnt, and the beams of the cellar—the part of the trap-door was burnt which would be inside the cellar when shut—when shut, it forms part of the flooring of the back-room—I gave Mr. Baldwin the first paper I found—several pieces—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183807090043"/>
               <p>gave the pieces of pocket-book and other things to the officers—after searching I went into the prisoner's rooms two or three times with the officers—on the Saturday after the prisoner was taken into custody, we proceeded from the cellar to his back-room—I had not been in the cellar, it may be for two or three days before the fire—I seldom went—I had another convenience—I did not notice any pieces of wood when I was last there—then I went into the back-room, first-floor, with the officers, I saw some straw lying down in a kind of recess, and there was a pipkin near the re<lb/>cess, with a kind of paste of turpentine in it—it was a thick paste, corre<lb/>sponding with some we found in the cellar—it was on the wood and on the piper—I think the officers took the pipkin—I also found a broken bottle with about half-a-pint of turpentine in it—I should think the property in the prisoner's rooms worth nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made any observation about the prisoner going into the cellar before this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was surprised at his going down so much—I saw? him go down oftener than I thought necessary, and he remained longer—I had noticed that for about a month before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the firemen any thing to drink at the time they came there, did you go and fetch any spirits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the fire was over, the street-keeper suggested they ought to have something—he said they were fatigued, and wanted refreshment, and I gave them some at his suggestion—I do not think the prisoner's property was worth so much as 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were presses there—an embossing-press and a stand and frame—I do not believe it was worth more than 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had some dies and metals, for press-work, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they not worth more than 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I cannot say whether I saw all that he had—there were small blocks and paper patterns—I did not see many of them—there was a small portion, worth.

               <p>was half a quire of cartridge-paper, not half a hundred-weight-there were a few pocket-book clasps and locks—the prisoner received goods from other persons to do work upon—he would not be answerable for those goods if consumed, for I have seen the policy—he had no annuals at this time of the year—he has pocket-book annuals when the pocket-books come out—I am quite sure it was turpentine I found—I know what naphtha is—I believe there was not any of that, but there is a chemist here—the prisoner brought his goods into the house on Christmas-day—I saw his children on the night of the fire—two of the younger ones were undressed—I believe they had their night clothes on—his eldest daughter, I believe, had bon<lb/>net and frock on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Ewins—he married my sister—I am also his apprentice—I reside with him at the house, No. 102, Cheapside, and sleep in the back shop over the cellar—the trap-door which leads down to the cellar is in that shop—on the night of the 22nd of June about half-put ten o'clock, I went down to turn off the gas in the cellar—I had a light with me—J noticed nothing whatever particular in the cel<lb/>lar—after I had done it I came up the cellar steps, and shut down the trap-door—I had fastened the shop and doors previous to going down into the cellar—after closing the trap-door I went up stairs with Mr. Ewins into the kitchen, on the second floor, where we went to prayers—I did not hear any noise anywhere while my master was reading prayen—after prayer I went up stairs, by master's direction, to lock the workshop—on getting up there I smelt fire—I came down and spoke to my master, and he went up stairs with me—we then both went down together to the lowern part of the house, but finding the shop was full of smoke, he ran up stairs to his bed-room and fetched down two of his children—I ran up to the top shop, waited there some five or ten minutes, and then came down stairs again, and saw Mr. Peacock's front-room door open—at that time the fire<lb/>men were down stairs playing, on the fire in the cellar—they were inside the house—I went into the prisoner's room, and looked out of his window, and on Mr. Wilson's leads, under the window which joins Mr. Ewins's leads, there were four bundles—this was on the first-floor—the leads are on a level with Mr. Peacock's window—I got outside on the leads, and brought three bundles in—the other one being very large, I could not carry it in—I lifted it up—it was a bag tied at the mouth, but I did not bring it in, being so heavy—Mr. Peacock was not there when I got out and brought the bundles in—after the fire was extinguished in the cellar, he came into his own room, and I told him I had brought three bundles in, and left one out—he made no reply to that—the leads run under the first-floor window of Mr. Peacock's room, and then Mr. Wilson's, and so on up the street—a person could run along two or three houses on them.</p>

I am apprentice to Mr. Ewins, and have been so about five years and a half.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the City police. I accompanied Mr. Baldwin on Saturday evening, the 23rd of June, to No. 102, Cheap<lb/>side, and there saw the prisoner—Baldwin kept the pieces of paper in his own possession, but I saw them—he took them with him to the house—we found the prisoner in the first floor front room, alone—Mr. Baldwin began the conversation, stating that the fire on the previous evening was a very aad affair, and that he did not consider his property was safe, and that after what had been found on the premises, he considered it his duty to give the prisoner into custody—after he was given into my custody, I told him I wished to put two or three questions to him, but that he might please himself in answering, as I should use them in evidence against him, if it was required—I asked him how he could account for the fire on the previous evening—he stated that he was at supper in the front room when the first alarm was given—I asked him where his family were—he stated some of them were in bed, and some were going to bed—I asked him when the alarm of fire was given, what he did with his children—he said be put them out at the front window, on the leads—he also stated that in the confusion he had lost some plate—I asked him what he had lost—he said, "Seven silver tea-spoons, a pair of plated sugar-tongs, and two plated table-spoons"—I then asked him what amount he was insured for—he said for £900—I asked him how long he might have been insured—he said, about three months—I then made a-remark about the property in the room, and said, "900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a great amount to be insured for, is this all you have got to show for it?"—he observed, the reason he insured so largely was, that he had at various times property intrusted to his care, that if any thing happened to it he should be obliged to make it good—I then asked him to what amount he had had property from his em<lb/>ployers at any one time—he said, sometimes 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sometimes 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, at the same time pointing to two or three Parcels in the room, stating that that was property belonging to some of his employers, that he had got to bind—I asked him what was the value his that property—he stated that they were shilling books each, and the parcel contained 200 or 300—after that conversation I took him to the Computer—as we were going, he said be bad very little doubt but what some person in the house had set fire to the premises, and that Mr. Ewins was a base wicked man—after I lodged him in the Compter I searched. him and found two pocket-books, which do not relate to this, and some money, which was given up—I went back to the house, and found sergeant Blunden with the firemen—in the back room which is the bed room, I saw</p>

               <p>tome of this combustible matter found in a recess, which is behind the door and also the pipkin—Blunden took possession of that, and the firemen took possession of what they found—there were two or three present—I also saw a bottle containing something which smelt like turpentine or naphtha—I also accompanied them down into the cellar, to make further search them and saw some pieces of paper doubled up together, covered over with con<lb/>bustible matter, like Venice turpentine—what I found in the cellar con<lb/>responded with what was in the pipkin in the prisoner's bed-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the Fire-engine establish<lb/>ment, in Watling-street. I went to the premises in Cheapside on the night the fire took place—the firemen had got into the premises before I arrived there—I arrived while it was burning* before the engines began to work—the first thing I observed was flames coming from the cellar into the back shop—I afterwards noticed the trap-door—the flames were at the opening of the trap door which was shut, but they came up between the crevices—the fire did not reach any portion of the walls—the trap-door was about two feet from the nearest part of the stair-case, I should think—it was a well stair-case made of timber—I eonld see up and down from top to bottom—that is a stair-cass much more favourable for the ascent of the flames than another—my as<lb/>sistants succeeded in putting out the flames that were coming throught the trap-door—one of the firemen went up the stair-case first—I went also and could not account for the quantity of smoke there, as I did not notice any fire there—the smoke was in the back room, first floor—in conse<lb/>quence of that I got into the back room on the first-floor, and saw a quan<lb/>tity of fire in the corner—I afterwards learnt that it was the prisoner's bed</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Emanuel Moses. He keeps the Black Lion public-house, in Vinegar-yard—on Thursday the 15th, or Friday the 16th of June I was sitting with my father in the bar, when the prisoner came in and asked my father to discount him a bill—my father asked him to leave it, which he did, and said he would call in a day or two—this bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—looks something like it, but it has been out of my possession—I gave it to the officer, Blakesley—the prisoner said he was the drawer of the bill himself—I did not ask him who the acceptor was, for I took the bill from my father, and saw it was accepted in the name of Byden, and was addressed to Green Dragon-yard, Bishopsgate-street—I do not remember that the prisoner told me where the acceptor lived—I sup<lb/>posed the acceptance was By den's hand-writing—the prisoner might have told me so, but I did not suppose it was of any consequence—I was ex<lb/>amined before the Magistrate, but it was three or four weeks ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did the prisoner give any account who the acceptor was, or whose hand-writing the acceptance was, and where the man lived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said it was accepted by Biden—he did not tell me where Byden lived—I do not remember, because it is on the face of the bill, where Byden does lire—I went down to the address on the bill—I did not know what might occur, and hardly knew what I was about at the time—I did not suspect any thing then—I have been examined on oath before—I think that some more conversation did pass between me and the prisoner, about the acceptance—I think he said it was accepted by Byden, and that Byden lived in Green Dragon-yard, or New Inn-yard, Shoreditch—I know I went there to inquire whether the bill was a bona fide transaction—the prisoner said that Byden lived there, and that it was made payable in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say it was made payable there, or was that an observation of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not know now for the moment which it was—I kept the bill in my possession, and told the prisoner to call again in a day or two, and he called the next day, Saturday—Mr. Byden was there when he called.</p>

               <p>at the time this occurred. I remember seeing the last witneii—I did not tell her, if the man got the money for the bill I was to have a bottle of wine—I have known the prisoner since October last—I went to Mrs. Reeve's, next door to me, and saw Miss Abrahams—she showed me this bill, with my name on it—it is not my hand-writing—it is quite differend—the prisoner told me he had put my name to a former bill, but not him to one—I had not authorised him to put my name on a former occasion—I had not paid the bill he put my name to before—I never allowed him to put my name to any bill—I was not to have a bottle of wine if he got money on the bill, to which he had put my name—he offered to lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know any thing about a bill—he merely drew two bills up to get the money—this is not one of them—I allowed him to draw the two bills to get the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, to lend to me, but not to use my name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he was by bills to get you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said be would lend me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and draw the bills up, and I could issue them if I liked—I have seen one bill of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides this—my name was not on both of them—the officer has one in his possession, and one I hold in my pocket—I was advised by the Magistrate to stop it—this was not one of the two bills on which he was to raise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw those two bills is my house—this I never knew any thing of till J saw it in Miss Abraham's hands—the prisoner called at my house that day, and told me he was going to get the money for me on the bill—not on this bill—he said he had been down to Steven, the bill-broker's, and the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would come to me to help me in my business—he did not tell me he had been to Abrahams—no mention was made about a bottle of wine—I never said a word to Miss Abrahams about a bottle of wine—here is one of the bills on which he was to raise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>.) <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This is not yet accepted—do you mean to say it was not to have your name put across it before he received the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not by my authority.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Nicholas Winsland, a builder. On the morning of the 7th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was on his premises in Duke-street, Bloomsbury—I saw the prisoner, accom<lb/>panied by a lad, come in there with a horse and cart—I looked at the cart, and saw a sack in it, with something in the bottom of it—that was the only thing I observed in the cart—I then went to the joiner's shop, and saw from the door the prisoner take the sack from the cart and pitch it on the pavement—he then got out of the cart, took the sack, and went into my master's cart-horse stable—I then went into a room, the window of which looked towards the dung-hole, and saw him bring three parcels of hay and put them into the cart, and the boy, who was in the cart, <hi rend="italic">covered the hay over</hi> with dung—the prisoner then brought a sack and put it into the cart, and that was covered with dung—the sack presented such an appearance as it would if corn had been in it—the hay and the sack were so covered</p>

               <p>that persons would see nothing but the dung—I then went into the counting house and stated what I had seen—the policeman was procoitd, and we waited till the cart went out of the yard—we then stopped it, and took the prisoner—the policeman asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing but dung"—I helped to unload the cart—I found the sack and the hay under it—I saw the sack opened, and it contained corn.</p>

You would there<lb/>fore much oblige me if you would, may be, procure him the necessary access to public buildings, such as libraries, &amp;c.

I am a foreigner, and have no counsel—I hope you will do the same to me, my Lord, as if you were my counsel—I am only imperfectly acquainted with the English language, and hope I shall have your indulgence—as far as regards the forgery, I have to say, about five months ago I left England with a friend, a member of Pembroke College, Cambridge, named Colonel Bartlett—I could not return to my native coun<lb/>try because I was privately implicated in the Polish revolution—on this account my friend told me to take the name of Dr. Stern, a friend of his—I came to Aix-la-Chapelle, where Bartlett informed me he should re<lb/>main a few days to see a friend—I went on towards Cologne, but Bartlett told me, if I got to Cologne, I might inquire at Schaaffhausen's whether my thing was sent for a person called Dr. Stern—I told him I would do so, and I wrote to know the particulars, as I travelled in the name of Dr. Stern—I received the note in answer, that nothing had been sent for Dr. Stern, and I sent the letter to my friend—I left Cologne, and came to a town in Hanover, named Osnaburg—I there met Bartlett again by ap<lb/>pointment—he asked me whether I could lend him some money—I said yes, and lent him some, requesting him to give me security—he told me he had a letter of introduction from Schaaffhausen, of Cologne, to Messrs Rothschild, which belonged to his friend Dr. Stern, and I might take that for secu<lb/>rity; that the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned in it, and I might deliver it in his friend's name, and receive the amount—I went with him to Hamburgh, and came over to London—after being about ten days in London I went to Rothschild's, and delivered the letter of introduction—in a few minutes Mr. Kirchner came and informed me that Mr. Rothschild could not see ne then, but would be glad to see me next morning—he addressed me in the German language, and asked if I would have a little money now—I said no, I would call again—I called about three or our days after deli<lb/>vering the letter, and wished 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was paid me—Mr. Kirchner asked if I would have all—I said not at present, but I would call again—I gave a receipt, which had been given to me by Bartlett—about eight days after Irecdved the first 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I again went, and received the other 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave the second receipt which had been given to me by him—I then told Mr. Kirchner I expected a letter from Germany, and in case It should arrive, he would be kind enough to let me know—about eight days after receiv<lb/>ing the money, the letter was sent—I went to Rothschild's, but the letter did not state what sum I was bound to receive, but it said, by producing the letter I should be paid—on coming into Rothschild's office, Mr. Kirch<lb/>ner asked if I had brought the letter which had been sent to me—I took it out of my pocket—he took it out of my hands, and left me alone in his office, and a few minutes after, Forrester came and took me into custody—About six months ago, when I came to London, the witness Bell visited me, and took tea with me, and after tea he asked me if I felt inclined to go to the theatre—I said I had no objection—he told me he had money with him, and if I would be kind enough to take care of it till the morn<lb/>ing—I said yes, and he gave 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into my care—he and I went to a tavern—Bell did not return next morning for his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the after<lb/>noon I was obliged to go out, and being in want of money I took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it—I afterwards met my friend, and he asked me for some money—I told him I had money of Mr. Bell's—he persuaded me to let him have some; as he would write to Cambridge, and in a few days he should be able to re<lb/>turn it—on the 3rd of June I went to Greenwich, and met Mr. Bell, who</p>

               <p>said he was obliged to give me into custody—we went bock to London, and on the road he said if I could make a settlement with him he would not give me into custody, but in case I did not, he would put me into custody—Bell said I had told him I had to receive money from Germany, but I think he must be mistaken in that—I said I had to receive some money but did not mention any amount to him.</p>

I was returning home between six and seven o'clock on Friday morning, with a female, who is not here—as I passed Pickett-place, Tem<lb/>ple-bar, near 8t. Clement's Church, the prisoner stood by a ginger-beef stall—I asked what it was a bottle—she told me a penny—I told her to open me a bottle, which she did—I put my hand into my pocket to pay for it, and found I had got but three farthings—I told her I had got but three farthings, and was very sorry, and was walking away—I did not drink it—she followed me, and asked if I was going to have it—I told her I could not, for I had only the three farthings, which I offered her, but she did not take it—she turned back to her stall again, and followed me, with a knife in her hand—sh made an attempt at my head, which I rose up my hand to prevent, and I received a very deep wound on my right hand—she took me by the throat and held me against some shutters which were not open—she stabbed me twice in my stomach and in my leg—I do not know how, but I found my leg was cut, and my shoulder, but that did not penetrate the skin—I heard somebody call a policeman—he presently came to my assistance, and I gave her in charge—I followed her to the station-hbnse, and she was detained.</p>

I knew Dixon before the 24th of June—on that day he was brought to Bishopsgate watch-honse—I was called out of bed, and came down to see that it was him—he was sitting with his hat right over his eyes, and was hanging hit head down—I said, "Hold up your head"—I took off his hat, and said "It is Dixon"—he used to have two beautiful curls, one on each side; and they were then both cut off—I believe he said, "My name is Dixon"—I had seen him a short time before the 11th of May, at the corner of Sun-street, and he ran away—he knew I was after him, as I had been to his mother's house, where I knew he resided—I wanted him for this robbery—I received information, and went to Chatham on the 28th of June, and found Hands and took him—I told him what I wanted him for—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 68, White Horse-street, lambeth I have known the deceased, William Walker, these four or five years he was a carman—I saw him alive the last time on the 24th of May, about eight o'clock, in the Hogs public-house, Broadwall, Surrey—I was him come in, he was rather tipsy—the prisoner was sitting on the opposite side of the tap-room—Walker crossed over to him, and said, "Ben, have you got any beer?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, will you drink, Bill"—after he drank, Walker began to quarrel with him—they only had work in the tap-room—the landlord stepped in—the prisoner begged the de<lb/>ceased to be quiet several times, but he would not—the landlord said, "Now, Bill, be quiet; if not, one or other of you shall go out"—he would not be quiet, and the landlord put him out—he was outside about ✗ minutes—I then observed the landlord let him in, on his saying he would be quiet—he went across the room to Burlingson again, and began with him, and caught hold of Burlingson's pint of beer, and flung part of it over the landlord, and part over Burlingson—they went to very high words, and Walker said'to him, "Come outside, if you will, I will have a <hi rend="italic">turn-up</hi> with you"—he said so three or four times—Walker went out and the prisoner begged him to be quiet—he did not want to fight at all—he was very much averse to it—but Walker went out to fight, and the prisoner went out at last—there was no fighting, it was merely catching bold other and throwing down—Walker threw the prisoner down at the them first falls—I thought he had broken his back at the first fall, but they met together again, and Walker had the next fall, and that was all I saw of it—he fell on the main road, not on any curb—it was a macdamised road—there were no seconds—the moment he fell, I went in and fineshed my beer—it was a regular throw—he fell upon his head—he because in<lb/>sensible, and not able to speak—he was not ill used at all when he was down—there was no foul play at all—the prisoner was a little in liquer the other man seemed to be giving a great dfeal of provocation—the pri<lb/>soner begged of him to let him alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Doubleday, a surgeon. I was called in to the deceased on the morning of the 26th of May, and found him in a state of stupor—on examining him I found a slight confusion on the side of his head about two inches above the left other—I bled bun—inflammation of the brain was coming on—he lived till the 22nd of June—he improved a little about a fortnight after I first saw him, hat the same symptoms of mischief about the head continued—we did not examine the body after death—he had first of all concussion of the brain—inflammation followed that, accompanied by fever, and that inflammation was the cause of. death—I do not know whether there was any abscess—I have no doubt at all that his death was caused by the fall—the Coroner asked if we thought a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination necessary, but we had no doubt of tea being caused by the fall, and the friends objected to it.</p>
