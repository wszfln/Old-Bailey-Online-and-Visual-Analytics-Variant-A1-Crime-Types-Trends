On the 27th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and went out, leaving my door on the catch, the prisoner used to sleep under the sheds in the market; his dog ran after my dog-it ran out of Gerrard-street, which made me know that he was in Gerrard-street; I went to my slaughter-house, and returned in about three minutes, and found my door partly open, I missed a piece of beef, and saw the hook upon which it hung swinging; suspecting the prisoner, I went to a public-house that he used, and told the landlord to stop him if he came there. I went in search of him, and returned to the public-house, when the landlord informed me that he was just gone in with something under his great coat. I went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner putting this great coat (producing it), under the table; I told him I thought he had got something there that did not belong to him - He said he had not. I found my beef and mutton wrapped up in his coat. As I was taking him to the watch-house, he asked me to forgive him, as it was the first time he had ever robbed me; and said he would never come in the market again.</p>

            . I lodge with Mrs. Thompson. On the morning of the 9th of January, I left my lodging to go into the country for a few days. I lodged in the room below the prisoner. My portmanteau, which contained the articles stated in the indictment as mine, was put in the room above the prisoner's, in Mrs. Thompson's care, the things were worth 40l. altogether. When I returned to town, on the night of the 12th, my things were safe - I went away again the next morning. On Thursday, the 14th, I received a letter from Mrs. Thompson, to say, she missed my portmanteau, and some of her own things. I was then at Kensington. On the 27th of February I was sent for to Bow-street to see the prisoner, he was stripped before me, and my drawers and flannel-waistcoat were taken off him; they were in my portmanteau when I left it in Mrs. Thompson's care.</p>

On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the street - door, and the prisoner came into the shop, she remained there about five minutes, there were two men in the shop at the time; I did not see her do any thing; she came out in a great hurry, the men told me to stop her, and I took her by the door, when the cheese fell from her cloak-it was worth ten shillings at the lowest, I had seen it safe on the counter an hour before. Several people had been in the shop. The prisoner was at different parts of the shop; when she was taken into custody she struck the constable very violently.</p>

I went down stairs, but found no marks of violence on the door or shutters; I called up Phillips, who was my apprentice, and told him that I had been robbed, and could not see where any person could get in. I charged him with the robbery, and he was secured. The check was given on the partnership account, for 295l. 17s. 6d.

            . I was apprentice to Mr. Want; I had known the prisoner, Yates, about six weeks, and Gregory and Rouse, about three days before the robbery. About four weeks before the robbery, the prisoner, Yates, asked me to go to a public-house, in Wild-street, with him; he gave me something to drink, and then asked me about robbing my master. I told him that the property laid in a box in the back room, and that there was more money there sometimes than there was at others; it was then dropped for some time. A little before Good Friday night I met him, Gregory and Rouse; they got two ladders to rob the house, on Thursday night, but the watchman saw them tying the ladders together, and they could not commit the robbery that night. I was not with them, but I came out to get a pint of beer, and Gregory told me of it; I saw them with the ladders, but was not with them when they were disturbed; I saw them again the next evening, it was then agreed that when I went in I was to leave the door open; the servant let me in, and told me to shut the door, I said I would, but left it open - I only pushed it to. I went into the parlour and got a light, and then went down stairs, when I came up I found Rouse in the house. I had left them all three together. I sat in the parlour sometime, and then went to bed. About one o'clock my master called me up, and said he had been robbed, and that I must have done it. After sometime I told him how it was. It was agreed, before the robbery, that I should meet them at the White Hart, in White Hart-yard, at half-past twelve o'clock. I told my master of it, and he watched. I went, and in about ten minutes after I got there, the prisoners, Yates and Gregory, came in. Yates took me into the back yard, and shewed me a 10l. bank note, and said we had better come and have our shares of it; we then went into the house, and the constable came in and took us into custody. I afterwards went to the Three Tuns, in Monmouth-street. and saw the prisoner, Rouse, going in at the door, and the constable took him. My master was with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. I returned to my master's house about half-past eight o'clock, and left the door open. I have nearly served seven years of my apprenticeship. I have told the truth. Yates proposed the robbery, and asked me where the property lay. I served my master truly until that time. I never robbed him before. I did not disclose it till I was taken. I told it to save myself. It was agreed that I should leave the door open.</p>

One of them came behind me, and the rest surrounded me, and forcibly pushed me against the shutters, when one of them struck me a violent blow in the face. I got away, and the prisoner came up to me by himself, I had seen him with the others before, he pushed me against the wall, and put his fist in my face, as if he meant to strike me, which threw me off my guard, he then drew my watch out and ran away; I pursued him, and the other men ran after me, we went up Featherstone-street, down Hand-court into Holborn again, and then through Brownlow-street into Bedford-row, I kept calling out stop thief! he fell down, was secured and taken to the watch-house; three or four men went to the watch-house with me, I believe they were part of the gang; they were searched, but nothing was found on them, or the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I did not lose sight of him.</p>

On the 4th of March, about twelve o'clock, I heard the alarm and ran towards the sound, the prisoner was running towards me, I made a catch at him, and he fell, I then secured him; he said he did not take it, but the other man did; the prosecutor said he was the man. Five or six men came up, and said I should not take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If he had thrown the watch away I must have seen him.</p>

He called again the next day, but we could not agree about the price; the next evening he called again, and ordered 56lbs of butter, two large cheeses, and one small one, and desired me to send them to the Barn public-house, in St. Martin's-lane, immediately, with a bill and receipt, which, he said, he had kept for two years. It being Saturday, I did not send it immediately. In about twenty minutes a man came, and desired me to send them directly, without the Gloucester cheese, as a customer was waiting for the cheese; he said he was to see them weighed and sent off with him, with a bill and receipt. I gave them to Ash, and told him not to part with them without the money.</p>

I untied them, and took the two cheeses off the butter and took them into the public-house, the landlord said he had ordered none. On turning round I saw a man stooping to the butter which I had left at the door, I run out and found it was gone. I saw the prisoner, with the butter, running towards the church steps, and I pursued him - He found the yard gates shut and turned back again; I called out stop thief! he threw the butter down and ran away, but was secured immediately. I am sure he is the man. I took the butter up.</p>

She was stopped at a house in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and five 1l. notes found upon her. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. I had a watch about me, but I did not lose that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. On the 2d of April I was called to a house in Angel-alley, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I found the prosecutor there, he charged the prisoner with robbing him of seven 1l. notes; I found five 1l. notes upon her, the prosecutor claimed them, and said he was sure she was the woman; she said she had them from a friend in the country, but would not tell me his name. I produce the notes.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's. On the 27th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Moorfields, with a plank of fir, fourteen feet long, on his shoulder; I followed him down Ropemaker-street, Chiswell-street, through different alleys, into Chequer-alley, I then asked him what he had got? he said it was wood that he had brought from over the water. I asked him where he was going to take it, he said, to a bedstead maker in Bunhill-row. I told him he had passed Bunhill-row, he then said he wanted to take some meat home first, and that he came over London bridge. He put the plank off his shoulder, and asked me to mind it while he went home with his meat. I secured him. The next morning I compared the wood against the old wall in Moorfields, and it fitted the holes both in the wall and in the ground.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Dunstan's in the West. On the 5th of April, about a quarter after twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner coming down Fleet-street, with a bag on a knot. Davis told me to stop him, I went up, and asked him what he had got in the bag, he said it was beef for his family. Davis felt it, and said it was not all beef; he then said there was half a cheese with it, he said he and his brother bought it between them. We examined the bag, and found it contained half a cheese, a buttock of beef, two breasts and a neck of mutton; he said his brother brought them to him in Clare-market.</p>

When I came down, at six o'clock in the morning, I was informed that a man had come out of the next house (which was empty) - I went to the door, and found it open. I went down to the bottom of the house, and found two rolls of lead in the chimney-corner, which I knew to be mine. I went to the house-top, and found a hole had been made through the tiling, and that the lead had been cut away from my house. I came back and took the lead, and had some more fixed in the place. The same evening, about eight o'clock, I went to the back of my premises, and found a man standing at the cellar-door of the empty house - I asked him what he wanted there; he said, he was waiting for a man. I told him I supposed he belonged to the party that was there in the morning. I found the door was open again, and went in; - I got a light, and went into the house, and found some men had been up to the tiling again. I ran up and took the two prisoners there - I asked them what they wanted; they said, they were looking for a lodging - I gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. They were hid behind a chimney. I compared the lead, and it exactly fitted the place.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the watchman - I came down, and found the prisoner, Warren, had got out of bed and left the house-the drawers were forced open, and all the property which they contained gone, together with a great coat, and three pictures which hung up in the shop. I had set the watches before I went to bed, and put them into the drawer. I found eleven skeleton and other keys in the parlour, with which I believe they had been trying to open our iron chest in the closet, where we keep our property.</p>
               <p> Prisoner WARREN. Q.Will you swear that I was in bed when you saw the doors fast - A. I told him to go to bed, and after that I went and wound up the watches - He then went into the shop and made his bed. I went up stairs and came down again, and found his light out, so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160010"/>that I felt certain that he was in bed.

I pushed it wide open, went in, and found the shop and parlour doors wide open-the bed appeared as if somebody had laid in it, but gone; I found a candle and some matches on it. I alarmed the house-Mr. Earnshaw came down, and missed his property. The skeleton keys were on the hearth.</p>

The prisoner then put his hand into my right-hand breeches-pocket, and took my money. I made a snatch at his hand to prevent him, but he got it away. - He took two 3s. tokens, two 1s. 6d. tokens, and three shillings - He turned my pocket out, and ran away. I told him that I knew him well, and that he had got my money. I looked him full in the face. There were six or eight men standing behind me, beside the two who knocked me down - They all ran away together. A boy, named Arnes, came up to me while he was robbing me - I was laying on the ground-the prisoner was there when he came up-it was moon-light. I had been drinking at the Falcon, but was quite sober.</p>

            . I live in George-gardens, Bethnal-green. On Sunday, the 2d of March, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in the Bethnal-green-road. I met five or six men running very fast - I did not know them. I went a little further, and found the prosecutor laying on the ground-no person was with him. I raised him up - He said, he had lost his money; the prisoner came along, and I asked him to give me a lift up; we rose him up. As soon as he got up, he turned round and ran after me. I ran away, for he was so drunk, I did not know what he would do. I did not see the prisoner do any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you give the same account before the justice - A. I have not told all yet. The prisoner's hand was in his pocket, but I did not see him take any thing-this was as he was lifting him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see any person with the prosecutor before I asked the prisoner to help him up.</p>

            . I was at the George public-house on the 2d of March, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the evening. The prosecutor came in, very much intoxicated-several young fellows were there, and called out "see!" The prosecutor struck me on the breast, and I struck him. I went out of doors about fifteen minutes after, and saw him laying on the ground. He had left me to go to the bar for a pint of gin, but the landlord would not serve him. I took him into the George, and went out soon after, and saw him running after my brother, the last witness. He said he had been robbed of 12s., afterwards 16s., and then 19s.</p>

As I was going down stairs, I heard some person walking on the ground-floor - I looked out of window, and saw some person get over the garden wall, and heard another person run out of the house, and at the same time a glass breaking. I found both my doors open, a piece of glass broken in the back door, and a hole cut in the shutter. I found my glass case laying in the garden, and all the trinkets scattered about-it was in the shop the night before. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The shop door had also been forced by cutting a hole in it; the kitchen poker lay just by-the door was black, as if it had been struck with the poker. I only missed the case of trinkets out of the shop-part of a leg of mutton had been eaten, and a bottle of wine gone. There was a chissel, a gimlet, and a screwdriver by the shop-door. In about ten minutes, the watchman brought the prisoner, Norton, and a man named Evans to me. The next morning Witchen brought part of the property-the trinkets were worth 150l.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mr. Wild called me into the house; I came out, and saw two men looking out. I went with some other watchmen into Holland-street, and saw two persons coming towards Mr. Wild's house. I asked them where they were going-one of them said, "what is that to you!" I told them that a house had been broken open, and I must know where they came from. One of them said, he came from Hyde-park-corner - He was going to Hammersmith (they were Norton and Evans) - I secured them.

            . I had known the two prisoners about ten days before the robbery; we met together-Norton said that he had dreamed of a house at Kensington, which he had been looking at about two years ago, and said it was good now. We all three agreed to go down and look at it - We set off about ten o'clock, and Norton pointed out Mr. Wild's house to us. Dugan said he would count how many doors it was from the corner. He said it was No. 8, but only seven doors from the corner. Norton went round to see if the walls were low enough to get over; we then returned to town-this was about twelve o'clock in the morning. Norton asked me for money, and went into the shop to buy something, to see if it was the right house, or not. I saw him come out, and put something in a piece of paper into his pocket. We all three agreed to meet at the top of Oxford-road in the evening, at six o'clock; I stopped there till eight or nine o'clock, and then went to Dugan's house in George-street, waited there sometime, and then went into a coffee-shop. At eleven o'clock we set off. Norton took a screw-driver, a chissel, and a knife. We got to Kensington about one o'clock. Dugan and Norton said I had better get over the wall, as I was stronger. Dugan lent me his handkerchief, as it would not shew so much as mine, being darker. Norton got over after me, and Dugan kept watch outside. We cut the back door open with the chisel and knife, and went into the kitchen; we took four aprons, a pair of boots, two shawls, and some table-cloths; we tied them up and gave them over to Dugan. We then cut a hole in the shop-door, and got the poker to wrench it open. I thought I heard some person up stairs - I took the glass-case and ran out - We threw it down in the garden, broke a pane of glass in it, and scrambled as much out as we could hold in our hands, and ran away. I let them fall in getting over the wall. I had the spoons in my pocket; we ran different ways, and I hid them in the church-yard. I met Norton, and while we were looking for Dugan, the watchmen took us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never committed a robbery before; I gave information about a week after we were apprehended.</p>

            . I am Mr. Dede's errand boy. On the 24th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, as I was taking the pile of paper from the door, I saw the prisoner come and take a bundle off. I called my master. I pursued the prisoner, and collared him. I asked him what business he had with it, when he threw it down, and got away. I followed him, and only lost sight of him while he turned the corner. He was stopped. I am sure he is the man.</p>

On the 3d of April, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the first floor-room; my wife gave me the key of the bedroom to take one of the children to bed, which is up another pair of stairs. When I was about half the way up stairs. I heard the bed-room door shut to, I went up, and found the prisoner in the room, shuffling a quantity of things towards the fire-place. I said what are you doing. I suppose you are going to take away every thing as well as my clothes, which you took before. Who let you in, and who is concerned with you? She answered, "you are mistaken. I am just come up; I only wanted a nurse." I asked her where she came from; she replied, that she came from Hammersmith, and then from Rateliff Highway; and, she had been to 34, Bishopsgate-street, to ask for a man of the name of Gardener; she also said, that they referred her to my residence. I told her, it was impossible. She next said, that the lady below sent her up stairs. I called the lady to come up, who keeps a shop on the ground-floor of my house. She came up, and the prisoner said, "you know me, Ma'am;" but the Lady said,"I know nothing of you." I told her she was concerned with somebody who knew my premises very well. I sent for an officer. She fell on her knees, and begged I would not; for she would expose the parties she was concerned with, but she was afraid her husband should know. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say, you are going to take every thing from me, as you did my clothes before. - A. I had lost a suit of clothes a short time before. I knew somebody must have been in my room with a key. I thought they would come again. I allude to the other robbery. The street door was frequently open. The room door was unlocked by somebody.</p>

            . I am the wife of Charles Wadsworth. My husband lets the house out: the ground floor is let out in two shops: the bed-room is up two pair of stairs; the rest of the house is let as counting-houses. My husband called me up; I found the prisoner in the room: she told me not to be frightened at seeing her, and wanted very much to take the child from me. I told her she had been taking my things out of my drawers (which were then lying in the hearth.) She said I had made a mistake, and had taken them out myself. She cried very much, and said she was sent by a fair young man. The next morning I found a key put between our two beds. I tried it with the lock of the drawer: it opened it. I lost the articles stated in the indictment; all of them were found on the hearth except the purse, which I did not miss till the next day. I never saw the prisoner before-nothing was taken out of the room.</p>

               wilful murder of her male bastard child

               <p>MARY WALSINGHAM. I lodged in the same house with the prisoner. I had observed she was pregnant, but never accused her of it. On Friday, the 21st of February, she was at breakfast in the landlady's room about twelve o'clock. At half-past two o'clock, I was fetched by White, and went to the room with her. The prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160015"/>washing there. I said you was in the family way. She said, yes. I said, are you now? She answered, no. I asked her where her child was? She replied, she had got it. I insisted on knowing where it was, and she took me up into her room, and turned the pillow and bolster back, and took the child up in her arms: it had a cap on, a flannell round its body, and a handkerchief tied round its mouth. I said, "you hussey, you have murdered it;" she said she had not, and appeared flurried. I asked her what the handkerchief was tied round its mouth for; she told me it was to keep its jaw from falling. I then informed her that was not the way. She took it off; it was tied, three times round, a little above the mouth. I do not know whether it was loose or not: the handkerchief was not wet. I went for the parish officer. The child was warm when I saw it-it was quite clean. She called herself a married woman. My room is two pair of stairs above her's. I could not hear any noise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. She confessed that she had been in the family way without hesitation, and shewed me the child directly. It is usual to tie up the jaw of a dead person. The prisoner bore a very good character.</p>

            . On the 21st of February, I slept in the next room to the prisoner. If a child had cried in the night I must have heard it - I did not. I saw the prisoner about one o'clock in the afternoon; she had been poorly for sometime. About ten o'clock, I asked her if she would help me to wash - She said she was poorly. I went into her room again; she was in bed; she got up and had breakfast. I went into her room about two o'clock, and experienced an unpleasant smell. She was washing in my room. In consequence of what my mother said to me, I looked under her pillow and bolster, and saw the child's head. I went away, and afterwards went into the room with Mrs. Walsingham-the prisoner shewed her the child. The account Mrs. Walsingham has given is correct. The child had no marks of violence on it. I knew nothing about the handkerchief, for I was frightened, and ran out of the room. When she was accused of the murder, she ran through our room with her bonnet and shawl on, and a bundle in her hands. I stopped her; she said she was going away, because they said she had murdered the child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The child looked quite composed-there was no distortion of features.</p>

            . I am an overseer of the parish of St. Andrew and St. George. On Friday, the 21st of February, about four o'clock, White fetched me to the house; I took Mr. Taylor with me. About six o'clock in the evening, I took the prisoner to the workhouse; on our way there, I asked her why she had tied the handkerchief round the child's neck; she said, to keep its jaw from falling. I asked her what time she delivered herself; she said, between five and six o'clock, and that she heard the watchman call half past five. I asked her if it cried - She said it did not.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES TAYLOR. I am surgeon and apothecary to the Parish. I accompanied Mr. Povah to the house, and carefully examined the child externally. The flannel and cap were taken off before me; there was no appearance whatever of injury, nor any marks of violence on its face and neck. If a handkerchief had been tied round its throat to destroy it, I should suppose it would have shown symptoms by which I should have known it. I carefully examined the body internally-there was nothing that denoted violence. From the state of the lungs, I considered that it never could have breathed - They were collapsed. Mr. Vincent saw it after me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The lungs appeared never to have been inflated.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of March I saw the two prisoners, with another boy, in Wardour-street; I watched them - I saw the other boy go into several shops. I watched them altogether as far as Oxford-street. At the corner of Market-street I missed them, and saw them again cross Wardour-street; the prisoner, Chapman, then had a bundle under his arm in a cloth - I laid hold of him, and told Wright, who was with me, to secure the other, which he did. I asked Chapman what was in the cloth - He said, he did not know. I gave him to Wright, and took the paper about, to find out who it belonged to. I went into Mr. Ilbery's, and found no person in the shop; I made a noise, and a lady came up. Mr. Ilbery afterwards came home and claimed it.</p>

We then went to another public-house and had supper - We drank a pot of beer at supper, but nothing else. We then took a coach; which I ordered to drive to Whitechapel; they got in with me-the coach drove to <placeName id="t18170416-39-crimeloc215">Old-street</placeName>

I went to bed; the prisoner, Briant, said she was sick, and went down stairs - She came up again. E. Hiet remained in the room, and Briant said she was sick, and went down again. After she was gone, two men came up-Hiet put out the light as they came up. It was moon-light, and said I could see, by a light from an opposite window, who came into the room; I saw the two men come-in I am certain that the prisoner, Kelly, is one of them. He took my clothes from me, and took seven 1l. notes out of my pocket, and gave them to John Hiet to count, and he took them to the window and counted them. I had seven 1l. notes in my waistcoat pocket, and 11s. 6d. in silver. John Hiet said I should not lose them. I put my clothes on and followed them down stairs-they ran away. I did not like to leave the house, for fear I should forget it. I went to a house on the opposite side, and they let me in. I went to the watch-house, and told Burchill - I have recovered two of my notes. I am sure the two prisoners are the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CERWOOD. Kelly took the money - I tried to keep my money. The other man had a knife in his hand. There was a candle on the other side of the way, which shone through the windows - I could see clearly.</p>

I told the prisoner, Kelly, what I wanted him for; the prisoner, Briant, immediately took the candle off the table, and went to the other side of the room - I went after her to prevent her from putting it out, and Kelly opened the window, and threw himself into the street. We got down as soon as possible, and took him in Golden-lane - He was running, and had fallen down; we seized him, but found nothing on him-this was ten days after the robbery - We had left Briant in the room; we took her about five o'clock in the same room. She said she had none of the money at all, and that Kelly was at home when we took Hiet. She said Kelly told her not to go home, as she would be hanged for robbing the sailor. She said she was ill, and knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

I left the door open, and returned again in about an hour, and found my desk broken open and the pocket-book gone. My office is part of the inn-the same gates enclose the dwelling-house and my office. When I took my pocket-book up at night, it had a 30l. and two 5l. notes in it, and a memorandum of the Lynn coach account. The number of the 30l. note was 7079. I did not take the numbers of the others.</p>

I believe Mr. Waldegrave rents part of the inn; he is a joint proprietor of it; my pocket-book was just under his premises-he sleeps there. Mr. Marsh lives at Norwich, and lets the tavern and lodging part to Waldegrave. I produce the note.</p>

            . On the 11th of March I received a cargo of malt for Messrs. Reid and Co. Hubbard and Horrod were with me in the barge. We arrived at Hawkes's Wharf about half-past six o'clock at night: it was then light. I and Horrod went on shore, and left Hubbard on board. We returned on board at half-past eight o'clock, and found every thing safe. Hubbard went on shore about nine o'clock, and returned at about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning. About twenty minutes before twelve o'clock I thought I heard somebody stepping on the fore part of the barge where part of the malt was stowed. I called out"Shinah," meaning Hubbard. I then went and walked on the top of the bulk, and heard somebody about fifteen yards off. I walked round the bulk, and found every thing safe. (We pack the malt so that we can tell whether there is a sack missing.) I returned into the cabin, and the tide having left the barge, I thought there was no danger. About twenty minutes before one o'clock Hubbard came on board, and said the barge had been robbed. Horrod and myself went and walked round the bulk, and missed four sacks of malt out of the midship of the barge. We returned to the cabin, and in the morning, at daylight, I missed four more sacks from the starboard side; the tarpauling was put over again: they might have been taken before, but I did not miss them. We missed, in all, eight sacks, consisting of thirty-two bushels. My master's name was on the sacks; they were new and fresh marked. I saw four of them about a week after in the possession of the officer, and believed them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I cannot positively say, that they were the same sacks, but am sure they were my master's.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORROD. I have heard Horne examined. He has spoken correctly: they were all right when we went on shore. Between twelve and one o'clock we missed four sacks that lay outside; they would be the most convenient to take from the outside of the barge; the others were taken from close forward (outside.) It was high water about five o'clock that afternoon; the barge was on dry land when we missed them; the water had left her three hours.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH FARRANT. I am a corn-chandler, and live in James-street, Covent-garden. On the 13th of March last the prisoner came to me, (he was a stranger to me before), and asked me whether I was a buyer of malt. He said he had some which he wanted to sell for a relation of his of the name of Hawkins, of Alton, in Hampshire. I asked him to show me a sample; he produced a sample in a bag, but not in a regular sample bag. From the appearance of the malt, I knew it would not answer my purpose. He pressed me very much to buy it. I asked him the price; he said, "three, three." I told him I did not understand him, and asked him if he meant 33s. or 3l. 3s. He said, "three guineas." I told him the malt would not suit me. He then desired me to name a price. I told him I did not like the malt; but if I was inclined to be a buyer, I could not give more than 56s. for it; he was going towards the door, and then returned and said, it was a very low price; but if I liked to have it, I should. I asked him where it laid. He told me it laid at Greenwich, but he would cart it to my premises, provided I would give him the money for it, and he would bring it the next morning at seven o'clock. He said he had four quarters of it, (that is, eight sacks.) In consequence of what had passed, I gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is an unusual kind of malt.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been malt that did suit you, what would you have given for it - A. I would have given 4l. for it.</p>

I asked him from whom he received the malt: he said, from a man of the name of Hawkins, of Alton, in Hampshire. I asked him if he had received any directions for the sale of it. He said he had received a letter. I asked him to produce it. He seemed agitated, and said he had not brought it with him, but that it was at his place at Portpool-lane. I inquired of him where he had brought the malt from that day. He replied, that he had brought it from his place in Portpool-lane. I asked him what price he was to sell it at. He said his relation was very much distressed, and in consequence he was to get as much as he could for it. He did not mention the number of the house. We secured him. I went back with Thomas (who had come with the cart), to Portpool-lane: he took me to a house which, he said, was the prisoner's. I found nothing there.

            . I am a labourer, and live in Portpool-lane; the prisoner also keeps a house in Portpool-lane. About the 13th of March, he called on me, a little after five o'clock on a Friday morning (I mean the morning he was taken up), he said he wanted my master's cart, and horse, and me, to go with him to the other side of Westminster bridge - We went over the bridge; the prisoner then got out of the cart, and a man came and spoke to him-it was quite dark; another man came to me, and said, "come along with me." I went to the water-side with him, he told me to back the cart to an old barge that was there - I did so, and two men, who were in the barge, threw the sacks into the cart - I believe there were eight sacks; they then told me to go away. I took the cart to the place where the prisoner got out, and found him there, ready to receive me; we then went to Mr. Farrant's, James-street, Covent-garden - We did not go to Portpool-lane first; we found Adkins, and the other officer there; I afterwards shewed them where the prisoner lived in Portpool-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We went about thirty or forty yards from the bridge to load the cart, and came back to the prisoner. - I knew him before, and have carried coals for him; he was not present when the men threw the malt in.</p>
               <p>SILVESTER DRAKE. On the 15th of March, I was working at the Waterloo bridge, and found four sacks there, it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - They were rolled together, and tied round - They had the name of "John Earl," upon them, in black and red; they were very wet, and appeared to have been in the water sometime, and to have had either barley or malt in them. I gave them to Horrod, for Mr. Earl.</p>
               <p>MR. EARL re-examined. I had no other sacks marked in this way, except what was at Kingston, and what were in the barge.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About five weeks before I was taken, I was at a public-house, and a man came in and said, he had a man who sold corn for him, and asked me if I would sell some for him; he said it came from Alton, in Hampshire, from a man of the name of Hawkins, who was in trouble. He brought me a sample, and said he had four quarters of it. - I agreed with Farrant to buy it; the man came to me to know if I had sold it, when he told me to borrow some sacks, and I borrowed two of Mr. Baker. He desired me to bring a cart to the foot of Westminster-bridge, which I did, and a man came out, and told me to wait till he loaded the cart.</p>

I went with her to a court in Whitechapel - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. I did not like the appearance of the place, and wanted to go out - She wanted some gin - I said I had no money - She said I should not go out till I either paid for the room or treated her-she had locked the door - She opened the door, and three more women rushed in-Watson was one of them-she said, pay me for the room - I refused-all four of them closed round me - I held my watch ribbon - They tried to get it-one of them said, "it is of no use-down with him." They laid me flat on my back-one held my legs, the other my arms, and another my mouth, while the fourth took my watch from my fob. Three of them then got away. I caught hold of the other, but she escaped also. I called out stop thief, and murder. She struck me several times on my mouth, and knocked me down. I was covered with blood (it was in a dark court.) One woman came to my assistance. I gave information at the watch-house. I do not know the other two prisoners. She did not force me into the room - She asked me to sit down - I refused, and she pushed me down - She would not let me go. I went willingly with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, that she forced you into the room against your will - A. Yes, she asked me to come with her.</p>

I went down, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, Williams, who goes by the name of Poll Chapman. She lived on the first floor in that house. She said, let me go. I have not robbed you. He said, you are one of them. I went to get the patrol, but could not. I returned, and saw her throw him down, and run away. I afterwards got the watchman - He went to the house with me, and we found the door locked. Before that, I went into the room, and got the prosecutor's hat and umbrella out. The hat was on the table, and the umbrella in the corner.</p>

We went to look for the prisoners, but could not find them. The next morning, Watson, Smith and Williams, were brought to the watch-house. I found the prisoner, Levy, standing at the watch-house bars talking with the prisoners. One of them asked her where the key of her door was; she said somebody had got it, but I could not hear what name. One of them said, "what have you done with the watch." She said, "I have sold it, to be sure." There was nobody else in the watch-house. She turned round, and saw me, and I took her. Cokely was with me.</p>

             re-examined. At eight o'clock, I asked the prisoner what goods were sold to the amount of 11s. 6d., as that was the entry he had made in the book-it was entered, "clock, plyers, &amp;c. 11s. 6d." Mr. Gann was present. I asked him if it was not 13s. 6d. - he hesitated. I then asked him the amount of different articles he had sold; he said, the lock was 5s. 6d., and the other articles 6s., making the 11s. 6d. - he said, he did not remember what he sold the plyers for. I told him the different prices that Mr. Stace had given for the things, amounting to 13s. 6d., and he said it was correct, that he had made an error, and that the amount would be found in the till. I said, the till contained 4l. 4s. 2d. - his book contained an account of articles sold to the amount of 4l. 7s. 6d. There was a paper in the till of 4s. 2d. put down to the house, which made 4l. 8s. 4d.; if he had entered the prices which Mr. Stace paid, it would have been 2s. more, making<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160025"/>4l. 6s.2d. - I only found a difference of 1s. 2d. Mr. Gann searched him, and found a 1s. 6d. token, and 1s., which had Mr. Stace's mark on them. The prisoner said he never robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mr. Stace was to have his money back again; he might have given change out of his own pocket. He acknowledged receiving 4l. 7s. 6d. - there was as much money in the till as made the amount. There was another person, who served in the shop. The prisoner said he had changed a 3s. piece out of the till, to get some beer.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I went to Mr. Lawtoo's-it was agreed that I should charge him with the robbery. Mr. Lawton said, 11s. 6d. was entered in the book, and read over to him the particulars which Mr. Stace had given, viz. compasses, 3s.; lock, 6s. 6d.; plyers, 2s. 6d.; hasp, 1s. 6d. - the prisoner said it was right, and he had entered it wrong, but the money would be found in the till. We desired him to shew what money he had about him. He pulled out two 1s. 6d. pieces and 2s. 6d. in pieces-one of the 1s. 6d. tokens and 1s. were marked. The prisoner said he had taken change. I produce them.</p>
               <p>MR. STACE. They are the same that I marked.</p>

I had ordered some meat to be marked the night before. I went after him, and collared him in George-street, and said, "I think you have been carrying on this business long enough." I took him back, and took the meat out of his apron. I told him he was very ungreatful, as I had often assisted him, and that he must have a great many people, who bought the meat of him. He said, he should not convict any but himself, and we could not hang him for what he had done. He had thirty-eight pounds of meat in his apron, all marked.</p>

            , jun, I am the son of the last witness. I marked the meat, and placed myself on the kitchen stairs to watch. I heard Jordan come in about six o'clock; I saw him take a shoulder of mutton, and give it to a man, whose face I could not see - He put it under his coat, and went away. I went down stairs to get my shoes, and when I came up a fore-quarter of mutton, and some beef, which I had marked, were tied up in a basket, and covered with an apron. The prisoners were in the shop - They talked together, and Jordan went out of the door, and Collins put up the bundle and went out. I ran from my hiding-place, and found Collins in custody-Jordan was taken soon after. He said we could not hurt him, for Collins took it while he was out of the shop. Jordan did not give any account of receiving money that morning.</p>

I first became acquainted with the prisoner at the New Prison in Whitecross-street; I was sent there by my employers to see him execute a power of attorney (looks at it)-that is it. On my going there, I asked the turnkey for an officer of the name of T.M. Oliver, who was in confinement there; the prisoner was introduced to me in consequence of this application. I told him that I had a letter from Messrs. Walker, Doyle and Company, for him to execute this power of attorney, holding it in my hands to have it executed; he read it over, and signed it "T.M. Oliver, lieutenant of the 93d regiment." I witnessed it, took it, and went away. The seal was on it at the time. I took it there with the seal on it. I saw him several times after this, out of prison. He was at our office the day after he had executed the power of attorney, he told me he had come to get some more money and a settlement. I saw him several times afterwards - He said he wanted to know how he stood with Messrs. Walker and Company, calling them his agents; that the money he had was not sufficient, and he wanted some more-this was the very day after he had executed the deed - I do not recollect his words exactly - He went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160026"/>stairs to them. I afterwards saw him at a house in St. Martin's-lane, about a fortnight after. He then said, that when his quarter became due he should expect some more money. I gave him a letter from Messrs. Walker and Co., which required an answer - He said he would call in a few days. Before this day, I had been to his lodgings to tell him that Messrs. Walker and Doyle wanted him to call at the office to arrange matters; he said he would call. He said, when his quarter became due, he expected they would give him some more money.</p>

             - A. I do not know. I asked for an officer who was confined in the prison, of the name of Oliver, and he wrote his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the difference between a deed and a common agreement - A. No; he only wrote his name.</p>
               <p>MR.BOLLAND. Q. What did he do when he had wrote his name - A. He handed it to me.</p>
               <p>CHARLES DOWNES. I am clerk to Messrs. Greenwood and Cox, army agents - They were agents for the 38th regiment; the prisoner formerly held the rank of ensign in that regiment - He called once, and asked me questions respecting his own accounts as an ensign of the 38th regiment - He then passed by the name of Andrew Oliver; this was at the beginning of the year 1816. He has ceased to be in that regiment since. I had received letters from him before that time - He was a stranger to me, when he called, as a matter of course, I must have asked him his name; he said he was Ensign Oliver, of the 38th regiment-there was no other Ensign Oliver of the 38th regiment at that time. The prisoner never belonged to the 93d regiment, to my knowledge - He has not been in the 93d regiment since he left the 38th. There are books kept by the War-Office, by which it will appear whether he is, or is not, an ensign of the 93d regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was ensign of the 38th regiment, was there a Lieutenant Oliver of the same regiment. - A. There was, his name was Thomas Millward Oliver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether T.M. Oliver, formerly lieutenant of the 38th, now belongs to the 93d - A. He exchanged to the half-pay of the 93d from the 38th. I saw the prisoner in February or March, when he was before the Lord Mayor, charged with this transaction, but I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have letters which purport to come from Andrew Oliver, ensign of the regiment. I never saw him write. I cannot say they came from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say he is not an officer of any other regiment - A.Certainly not. The prisoner has not been in the 93d regiment, since he left the 38th. I only know it by the Gazette.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLWARD OLIVER. On the 25th of December, I received the money that was due to me as lieutenant of the 93d regiment. My Christian name is Thomas Millward, I was formerly lieutenant of the 38th regiment. The prisoner's name is

            , he held the rank of ensign in the same regiment, I never knew him by any other name; he left the 38th regiment in 1816 - He was suspended; the time that he quitted it will appear by the War-Office books. I left the 38th regiment in September, 1816, the prisoner did not then belong to it (looking at the power of attorney), this is not my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Would T.M. Oliver be the way you would sign your name - A. I always sign so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never joined the 93d regiment, I am an ensign on half-pay. I do not know whether the prisoner is or is not in the regiment.</p>
               <p>The power of attorney was put in and read, purporting to empower Messrs. Walker, Doyle and Co. to receive all monies due to

It was a common thing for him to assist in sorting; he was not prevented from sorting them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he employed by the post-office to sort letters-was it part of his duty - A. He was paid as a person in the employ of the office; his payment, or best part of it, was taken for his substitute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of his duty, before he was suspended, to deliver and assist in sorting-A. Yes; there are eleven carriers to the eleventh division.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was his duty before he was suspended, was it so after - A. He was not prohibited from doing it; he had been suspended a month or two, but attended at sorting times; he had about 70l. per annum; I deducted 15s. or 16s. per week for his substitute; the prisoner would have had the rest, and might give it to the post-office for his arrears; the substitute delivered the letters for which postage was to be received, but the prisoner delivered the paid letters. He attended at the time the sorting was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not a letter-carrier different from a sorter-A. No; the letter-carrier sorts them, and divides them into walks before they leave the office; the letter-carriers of the eleventh division, assisted in sorting the letters of that division generally.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The office of letter-carrier, and the office of sorter, are quite distinct; the carrier receives wages to one amount, and the sorter to another - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner received his salary as a carrier, and not as a sorter - A. Yes; although he might assist in the sorting, he was not to be paid for it; he did not receive any pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not been employed by the post-office, would he have been allowed to sort - A. Certainly not.</p>

He said he thoughjt it contained other property, but it was nothing but bills - He did not say how he got it-he left me the letter and bills, and said he should see me soon again, when the letters were out. I was to be at the door when he went by my house. I slightly examined them, and waited at the door; and, in a short time, he passed. I joined him, and went into the Borough with him, where he had the early letters to deliver. I accompanied him, and after he had finished, we walked up the London-road and over Blackfriars-bridge, into the City. We went the back way into the City, and met Mr. Criteley in the back part of St. Paul's Church-yard, near Doctors' Commons. We dined together, in Fish-street - hill, at a public-house. The next day we met at the Windmill, in Nicholas-lane. I told him I had looked over the bills, and found that part of them were due; and that I did not understand how to get them paid. There was nobody else in the room. from there we went to the Cock and Bottle, in Cannon-street; before we got there, I selected the 195l. bill from the others; he said he thought the money might be got for it. I shewed it to him, and he looked at it. There were some persons in the room. From their conversation, I took them to be clerks. The prisoner told one of them, that he had a small bill from the counrty, payable at a banker's, and that he was not in the habit of having bills, and did not know how to get the money. The gentleman said, if it was payable at a banker's, he had nothing to do but to sign his name, and they would pay it. This was about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon. We left the house, and went to the Black Boy, in Nicholas-lane. Two of his friends came in. I wrote</p>

I asked him who it was I met him with on Friday morning; he said it was Samuel Dennett, and that he had walked with him from Doctors' Commons to Sherborne-lane, and then they parted.

The prisoner, and Dennett, were on the other side of the room. I saw him talking with Dennett. I saw the prisoner again a week after, and have every reason to believe, that he is the same man. The prisoner said, he had received a bill from the country, and wanted to know how he was to get it cashed. I asked him if it was a banker's bill, and if payable in London: he said, it was. I asked him the amount; I think, he said, it was 20l. I asked him whether it was payable to him; he replied, it was. I told him if he would endorse it, and give a reference to any person, I could get it cashed for him. I told him if the bill was not endorsed, it would require his endorsement before he could get it cashed.</p>

Clarkson had lodged for five weeks in the same room that the prisoner slept in. The prisoner slept there two nights, and paid me 6d. per night for the bed. On the 2d of April, about a quarter before four o'clock, previous to day-light, I was alarmed by the watchman. I am quite sure I had fastened the house. I found the prisoner gone, and the door wide open. There was no appearance of violence-it must have been opened from within. Clarkson missed his things. The prisoner was taken the next night.</p>

            , Jun. I am an officer of Hatton Garden. On the 15th of March, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of Berner's Mews with something under his coat - He crossed into Wardour-street - I saw him pull the bridles from under his coat - I seized him, and asked him where he got them from - He said he found them-Mr. Pearson claimed them. When I got to the Mews, the prisoner pointed out the stable where, he said, he took them from, and pleaded distress.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Any person could get in in the day-time. The carriage belonged to Colonel Staples-it had not been used for sometime. I had seen it the same day, but do not know whether the glass was stolen, or not. He might have had leave to lay down there.</p>

            . I am hostler to Mr. Arlett. About half-past eleven o'clock at night, the dog barked very much, which induced me to look under the carriage; I found the prisoner there - He said the coachmen had given him leave to lay down there, the coachmen said, they had not. I found the glass was taken out of its proper place, and laid on the seat, in the carriage-the carriage had not been moved for months before; the holder appeared to be fresh cut.</p>

            . I am servant to E. Fleming, pawnbroker. On the 29th of March the prisoner came to my master's shop, and offered to pledge a gold chain - He said it was gold; I tried it in the usual way, and it proved to be gold-(I have been in the trade fifteen years). I offered him 25s. for it; we could not agree about the price, and I returned it to him. He waited in the shop for a few minutes, and then said he would take the money. He gave me a chain, and I lent him the money. I thought it was the same; but on Monday morning, an officer came, and asked me if I had taken such a chain in. I looked at the one he gave me, and observed that it was not gold, but it was of the same pattern. I am positive that the first chain I looked at was gold.</p>

I found a gold chain in his hat-it was tried, and proved to be gold. Mr. Sowerby charged him with offering a chain of the same pattern as the gold one, as gold-it was of the same pattern as the gold one which I found on him. I also found a duplicate of a chain pledged at Fleming's, on him. I went there, and saw a chain of the same pattern. I produce it.</p>

At four o'clock in the morning I was alarmed, and found the patrol at the door. The cellar-door was open, the padlock wrenched off, and laying on the ground. There was a hat and dark-lanthorn at the door. The watch-box is nearly opposite my door, and there is a lamp at the corner of the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my box is opposite Mr. Miller's house-there is lamp at the corner, which shews a clear light on his door. About four o'clock, I saw a man come out of Featherstone-street, and go into Banner-street; he came back, and stooped down by Mr. Miller's cellar grating. I came out, and he ran off. At four o'clock the next morning, as I was going my rounds, I heard Mr. Miller's private door moving gently open - I found it so. I called out, "who is there?"-no person answered. The prisoner shoved the door wide open, and walked out. I seized him by the collar-it was moonlight, and the lamp was a-light - I am sure he is the man. Francis Ensor (who was convicted here last Sessions) then came out. The prisoner said to him, "give it to him!"-the prisoner was then struggling, and I was beating him with my stick. I struck the prisoner on the head, and my staff drew blood, by which I knew I made a mark on his head. I was knocked down, and they both got away. On the 14th of March, I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house, with another person, and pointed him out. I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I was examined at Ensor's trial-it was a great while after that I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.In the course of that time, had you been looking out for any other person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have your evidence here. - Did you, on your oath, say, last Session, any thing about your bloody staff; and did you not say, you had hold of him with both hands - A. I did not say I had. I know Richard Hutchence - I never felt a man's head of the name of Buckle, to see if he had a wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Hutchence, after you had sworn to the prisoner - A. No; I do not know where he lives, or what shop he keeps.</p>
               <p>Q. You never was at his shop in Chequer-alley - A. Once - He is a file-cutter. I think it was before I had been to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remember his asking you, how you could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160033"/>swear to the prisoner, when you said you should not know the man from Adam - A.He never said so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say,</p>
               <p>"I have sworn to him, and will stick by him, right or wrong" - A.Never - I was not with him two minutes. I went to ask him to grind my sword; I had no conversation with him about any thing but the sword. Cormick was in the shop when I was there.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I knew Hutchence by his once being a watchman. There was a wound on the prisoner's head when he was at the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I am a file-cutter, and live in Chequer-alley, Whitecross-street. In February last, a day or two after the robbery, I had been on duty as a watchman, on the same beat with Grenville, and asked him if he should know the other man (Ewer had been committed), as I would keep a look-out. He said he should not know him from Adam, as he was knocked down, and hardly saw him. He came to my shop a day or two after, leaned over my window, and said he had got the chap. I said,"what chap?" - He said,</p>
               <p>"the chap for Miller's crack;" and that he had sworn to him. I asked him how he could swear to him, when he told me he should not know him from Adam? He said, he had sworn to him, and would stick by him, right or wrong. My brother-in-law, Cormick, was in the shop at the same time - He went away. Grenville knew my shop as well as I did myself, and has been there scores of times. I am no acquaintance of the prisoner's. I gave up my place as a watchman when I had plenty of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had been watchman there three years - I never had any discredit imputed to me. When I went to be sworn in as a watchman, the Vestry would not accept me again. This conversation took place when I was a watchman.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS CORMICK. I was in the shop when Grenville called; I was at work at the vice. He said, he had got the man for the crack. My brother asked him how he could swear to the man, when he said he should not know him from Adam. He said," I have sworn to him, and will stick to him, right or wrong." He went away directly.</p>

On the 21st of February, the prisoner came into the shop-there was no person in the shop but myself - I have frequently seen him before. The prisoner looked at several waistcoats, he took a fancy to one, and asked if it would look well with a blue coat - I told him it would. He stopped in the shop talking for about half an hour, and then left, without buying any thing. Immediately after he left the shop, I missed the waistcoat which he had taken a fancy to, from off the counter-it is worth 5s. I did not suspect that the prisoner had taken it. On the 28th of February he called again, and looked at some pantaloons. About a fortnight afterwards, I met him with the waistcoat on in Catherine-street - I stopped him, and told him he had stolen it. He said, he had taken it, and would pay me for it, if I would accept of the money. He ran off, and was secured.</p>

I did not speak to them.

I was the worse for liquor, but was quite capable of walking home. They made no answer, but all four came upon me; one struck me upon the back of the neck, and knocked me down into the kennel, and at the same time one of them struck me on my thigh-all four of them continued together, but I did not receive any more blows. The moment I fell down I felt a hand going into my right-hand breeches pocket, but do not know whose it was; my watch was in my fob, they felt it through my pocket; I caught hold of my watch, and got the seal and key in my hand, the ring of the chain was broken, and they got the watch; I kept the seal and key-they took the watch and pocket together; they tore my pocket entirely out with the watch and fob. I had 1l. 15s. in my pocket, which I lost, but I thought it might have been lost in the scuffle, and did not include it in the indictment; I caught hold of the seal and key just as they gave the watch a jerk. I had no oportunity of seeing them so as to know them again - They ran away immediately. When I fell down, I fell on my knees, which hurt me very much and stunned me - I do not know which way they ran. Before this I had a very severe fall from a ladder and broke my legs, I was lame at the time. I called out stop thief! I could not call out before. I did not lose my senses. I got up and stood in the street, as I could not even move my legs. In less than five minutes the watchman brought the prisoner back. If I had been strong in my legs, the blows would not have done me a serious injury. I told the watchman that I was so much hurt that I could not exactly say that the prisoner was one of them. I said he was one of them, because when I turned round to speak to them on Saffron-hill, I noticed one of them more than the others, and thought he was one of them, becuase he had a long beard, as though he had not been shaved for a month. I will not swear to him.</p>

            . I am a whalebone-cutter, and live in Warwick-place, Whitecross-street. On the 5th April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going up Saffron-hill (it was Saturday night), I saw the prosecutor fall into the kennel, and four men close to him - They jumped down and closed round him (I did not see any blows given). I stopped to look at them, and saw three of them part from him and go down Red Lion-court-the other man stopped by him, he was laying on the west side; the man caught him by his collar, and turned him round on his back; I saw him push both his hands down into his pockets distinctly-it was his waistcoat pocket; he then looked up and saw me, and ran up Saffron-hill. A young man, who was standing about three yards from me, but farther from the prisoner, ran after him. I did not pursue him, but he took him before I lost sight of him - He did not run above eighty or ninety yards; I saw him brought back and given to the watchman. The prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath then, the man this person apprehended is the very man you saw run his hands down the clothes of the prosecutor, and one of the four men you saw close round him - A. I am certain of it; I am sure he is the man, his beard was very long; the prosecutor appeared stupified and much hurt, another young man lifted him up; I did not hear him call out "watch, or stop thief;" he did not appear to be very drunk - He was upon his legs before the watchman brought the prisoner up to him. I did not hear him make any complaint. I saw the key and seal on the ground by his side, a young woman picked it up, and put into his hand, when he was on the ground - He said his watch was gone; his pocket was torn out. I then went in, it being close to my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I run or walk - A. You ran.</p>

I pushed on and saw a young man pursuing the prisoner, he caught him, brought him back, and delivered him to Eyers; we took him to the prosecutor, and he immediately said he was one of the men: he appeared confused, and said, "they have got my watch, and here is the seal and key," holding it up in his hand. I did not see him on the ground; his knees were very dirty; he said they had knocked him down, and that he was very much hurt-his clothes were torn quite off. I searched the prisoner in the street, but found nothing upon him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

I told him I would tell the master. Soon after one o'clock, the master came into the room; I told him, and he ordered us both to sit down to work, which we did-the master left the room. The prisoner got up, and called me a monkey; I immediately hit him, slightly, with my hand; he stood with a knife in his hand - He immediately stuck it into my body. I told the master I thought he had stabbed me. I opened my bosom, and saw a cut; the prisoner said, he was sorry for what he had done, and we shook hands - He had the knife in his hand when I struck him. I do not think he owed me any malice when he did it.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled, that the proof did not come within the meaning of the Act, as it was not done with malice aforethought, it being done at the impulse of a moment.</p>

On the 19th of February, about five o'clock in the morning, he was going to take a cart loaded with straw to town. I saw him on the top with a sack on his shoulder.

            . I am bailiff to Mr. Mellish. The prisoner had received orders to go to town with straw. Hodge fetched me to the barn-yard about half-past five o'clock in the morning. I found the cart there loaded, but the prisoner had left. Duffey was by the cart. I saw the sack in the cart; it contained four bushels of oats-there was quite sufficient in the nose-bags for the horses, ready mixed. I could not find the prisoner. The two men who worked in the barn also absconded. When the prisoner was apprehended, he said, he was sorry for what he had done. He came to his lodgings, on the 10th of March, for his clothes, and they sent for me. I had been there to look for him before, but he had absconded from there. I had got a warrant for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did not say the thrasher gave him the oats. Hodge gives the corn out for the horses.</p>

I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner, Duffy, running, and Mrs. Smith pursuing him. I run into the street, and found the prisoner, Carter, waiting at the bottom of the alley, with the property in his hands. I did not suspect him then. Duffy was secured. He pulled twelve shillings out, and said, he would give all he had to make it up. He made great resistance. When I saw Carter with the bundle. he said he picked it up. He gave me his address, but I found it was false.</p>

On the 20th of March, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by some persons jumping from over the window. I opened the window, and saw a man and a boy looking up to see who was looking out. I called the watch, and in a few minutes they brought the prisoner back. I found the lead had been taken up from off the flat at the back of the house, which forms the roof of the kitchen. I asked the prisoner why he came to a house where he was sure to be seen - He said, that it was distress that drove him to it, as he had had no work for sixteen months. I afterwards saw the lead fitted to the place-the lead and the bag laid just at the place where I saw the men.</p>

I am sure he is the man - I never lost sight of him - He said, I suppose, if I had five or six shillings to give you, you would let me go - He said, there were too many of us for him, but if he had his coat off, he would get away from us - We found the lead cut off, and rolled up, and a bag and two knives, close by.</p>

            . I am a slop-seller, and live in East Smithfield. On the 26th of February, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop with the ticking, and asked me to buy it. I told him it would not suit me-knowing him before, I suspected him. He turned towards Nathan's house - I followed him. As he passed Nathan's, I called him out, and we followed the prisoner till he got to the middle of Rosemary-lane - He then saw us, and we secured him. He said, it was of no use, as we should never find out where he got it.</p>

I went to the back of the shop - He returned, and looked back, as if to see if I was there. He took two books from the shelf, and went out - I followed him, and secured him - He got away, and threw them down. He was brought back - He desired me not to prosecute, and he would apologize.</p>

            . My father is a broker, and lives in Newman's-row, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 12th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the door, with my father. My brother pointed the prisoners, Carter and Pickard, out to us, saying they had stolen the oilcloth. They sent me to Mr. Hildyard's, to see if he had lost any-Mr. Hildyard sent his man with me. We met my brother in Hand-court, and he went with him, I enquired if a man had been seen with the cloth, and was sent down Parker's-lane - I made enquiry there-was sent towards Holborn, and going down Drury-lane, I looked up Short's-gardens, and saw three men together, with the cloth. I went down the opposite side of the way, and watched them into an old iron-shop. It was Carter and Pickard that went in, and the other man passed by - He appeared to be in company with them. I got Wicks and Furzeman, and shewed them the house they went into. I am sure the prisoners are the men. I watched the house after they went in, and no person came out.</p>

I went to the door, and saw the prisoner in the shop, as far as the door would screen him - I am sure he is the man. About half past four o'clock, I saw him at the door again. I saw him pull the scarf a little way throught the string at the door, and go away. He came again, and pulled it nearly off in about five minutes, he came again, and took it quite off - I collared him on the step.</p>

The prisoner came up to me, looked me full in the face, and took my bundle - I am sure he is the man. My sister, who was with me, screamed out. He ran up Bainbridge-street with it-it was about eleven o'clock at night. We gave the alarm - I described the prisoner to the watchman. The next day, the patrol came, and said he had got the prisoner. I saw him at the Office, and am perfectly sure he is the man. There was a lamp at the brewhouse, which gave me a view of him when he stared me in the face.</p>

            . I am a brick-maker. On the 29th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw the prisoner by an archway, in a ditch, in Hoxton-fields - He was pulling several turfs of grass up, and putting them under the archway - He saw me, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160046"/>hid myself - He came out, looked about, and went back, and took a basket - He then came out, and went away - I went under the archway, and found twelve panes of glass, in an apron, under the turf - I shewed them to Etteridge - We went after the prisoner, and secured him, in Moorfields - He had the basket with him, and glass in it - He fell down on purpose, and broke it - I asked him what he did that for - He said, what would not a man do to save himself, and wanted us to let him go - He pleaded distress - I am positive he is the man.</p>

I pursued the prisoner, accompanied by Dodd - We followed him quite close, till he got to Moorfields - He sat down there, and had the basket between his legs - I said you have left part of your load behind - He said, no - I told him it was like the glass that was under the turf - I secured him at the corner of Brokers'-row - He threw the basket down, and broke the glass - He said, if I would let him go, he would say where he got it - He said, it was taken out, and given to him - He tell down on purpose, and trod on the glass - He said, it was of no use to him, and should be to no one else, and it was his own basket, and he would do as he liked with it - I tried the squares with the sashes - They exactly fitted.</p>

On the 4th of February, he was employed in the yard, in the front of the house; the time for his leaving work, was half-past six o'clock, that evening. A man of the name of Rose was employed in the yard with him. Lougham and Kiebird were employed in the loft, as stove-men, to hang the skein-silk to dry. There is a passage from the yard leading<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181704160047"/>to the loft. On the left, there is a door which leads out of the loft on to the lead-flat of my premises, and then communicates to Mr. Prior's roof, on the same level. After you pass Prior's house, there is an open stone-yard, belonging to Mr. Goudge. The door which leads out of the loft on to the lead-flat, is always bolted with four bolts, and locked inside, when the men leave work. There is no means of opening it from outside. On the 4th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Allen told me we had been robbed. I immediately went to Crew, and found him at work in the yard - I asked him if he had seen any body come into or go out of the dyehouse, as they must have passed him, if they had; he said, no one had passed either one way or the other. This was about seven o'clock in the evening, when the men had returned from lunch. The men went to lunch about twenty minutes before six o'clock. I went through the dye-house, at four o'clock, and did not see any rat-trap there then. Bird was taken up for the robbery a few days after. I had particularly asked Crew if he had left the yard at all - He said he had not. The distance from his station to the door was about fifty yards; any body could go, and return in less than a minute. In going to it, he must pass the spot where the rat-trap and water butt stand. He was asked if he had been to the place where the tub was, which is close by the stairs-he said he had not. I went over the premises and the roof, and am of opinion, that the premises could not have been entered from without. The value of the silk was 150l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There is a watchman at the gate always-it was not Crew's place to set the rattrap - He said he had not been near it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LOUGHAM. I am servant to Messrs. Desanges. On the 4th of February, I was drying silk. The prisoner, Crew, was taking up the boiling, in the yard, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, when I left the yard. Crew and Rose were both together in the yard. Kiebird went out with me. The man who attends the boiling ought to stay by the copper. We had just come from the loft as we went out. The door was bolted, with one bolt, inside, when we left, and the silk all safe. I came back ten minutes before seven, and was the first man that came back. I went up to the loft, and found all the skeins of silk that I had left there hanging to dry, gone. The door was unbolted-it opened on to the leads-it could not have been opened from the outside. I traced footsteps from the roof, coming as from over Prior's premises towards the door: they were gravel marks; two tiles were broken. The other part of the tiling goes to Mr. Goudge's yard.

The prisoner was gone. I bolted the door the last thing before we left the loft. Nobody could get into the loft without being let in from within. I went on to Prior's roof; the tiling was broke. A man could get upon the roof of Prior's premises from Goudge's yard, and from there upon the lead-flat where the door was.</p>

            . I am foreman to Messrs. Desanges. On the evening of the 4th of February, the prisoner, Crew, said he particularly wished to stop at the boiler, as he wanted to go out the next day; it was not his turn. The men went to lunch at six o'clock, and I stopped till a quarter after. The prisoner, Crew, and Rose also stopped. I went to tea, and left them in the yard at work at the bat - They had no business to leave work till I returned. I returned in less than half an hour, and found him and Rose at the bat as I left them. In about ten minutes, Lougham told me of the robbery. I went up with him, and missed the property stolen-it was worth 150l. - it was unfinished silk, and the door was open. A person could get from Mr. Goudge's stoneyard on to Prior's roof, and get on to our lead-flat; if the door was bolted they could not get into the loft. Crew did take a holliday the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was Crew's duty to stop at the boiler. A man could not go through the yard to the loft, without his seeing him. There were no persons in the yard but Crew and Rose.</p>

He told me to come down on Tuesday night to the Castle, in Long-alley(this was the day before the robbery), to meet the parties, at seven o'clock. I did not go. I saw him on Wednesday morning, unloading the cart with the man; he said the robbery was done and safe away, and told me to go to the Jolly Weavers, and he would be with me in a few minutes; I went and waited sometime - He did not come - I left; he told me what a fool I was, for I might have have had 1l. or 2l. if I had come down to him; this was while he was unloading the cart. When he proposed the robbery, he said, we were to go into the stone-yard by Messrs. Desanges, and he would bring the silk out; he asked me if I knew any person that would take it? I said I did not.</p>

I remember Crew coming there the night after the robbery - He enquired for Bird, and somebody said, he had not been there that night. He went away. I saw Bird there the next morning, and told him Crew had been to enquire for him. He went out, and said he would see what he wanted. On the day before the robbery I was there-Crew was in the box with some other men, Bird came in, and sat in the next box to them. Crew asked him to drink-they were drinking egg-hot.</p>

I awoke, and found myself alone-my clothes were gone, and my watch was taken out of my stocking. I went to the door, and called the watchman. Rowland came, and took me to the watch-house. I described the women and my property to him, and Taylor was secured. I saw my jacket and waistcoat at the watch-house. Taylor was brought up to me, and I knew her directly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, in company with another man, loitering about St. John-street - they walked by Mr. Prickett's shop. The other man (Waterhouse, who was convicted last Session), took hold of the tub of butter; the prisoner came up, and put it on his (Waterhouse's) shoulder. I secured Waterhouse, and the prisoner escaped. On the 27th of February, I secured him, and am sure he is the man - I knew him before.</p>

On the 28th of March, the bell rang - I asked who was there-the prisoner answered, it was him, and he wanted to see my master, and that he had got a letter for him. I opened the gate, and asked him for the letter. He said, he had not got one, but wanted to write to my master. I told him, I had no paper - He said, he had got paper, and pushed by me, and went up the garden into the passage, and into the parlour. I put the candle down for him, and went into the kitchen for pen and ink. I heard the glasses jingle as I came up, and met the prisoner in the passage. He said, he would not write, but I was to give his compliments to my master when he came home - He said, he came from Highgate. I I went into the parlour, and found the stand empty. I told him he had got something out of the parlour - He denied it. I fastened the door, and told him I would have them before he went away. He pulled the cruets out, and told me not to make a noise, as he only did it in fun. Newton came up stairs and secured him. He could have got out before I got up stairs. He did not take any paper out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of April, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Montague-street, with some mutton and a heart on his shoulder. He said he was going to Leadenhall-Market. I stopped him, and found some boiled mutton and fowl in his pocket. He said, it was his own. He threw them away, and ran off - He ran into the Coach and Horses, in Charles-street - I secured him there, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of March, soon after six o'clock in the morning, I was at the Harrow public-house. The prisoner came in there, and put a bundle on the form, and called for some beer - He saw me, and wished me good morning. I told him he was up early, and asked him what was in his bundle - He said, nothing but a piece of canvas. I told him to open the bundle, and he pulled the saw out. I asked him where he got it from - He said, "Oh, from a friend." I searched him, and found a sheet of copper in his bundle, which had been ripped off a ship, and a boy's jacket and trowsers, and eight pieces of a ship bell.</p>

            . I am the Company's watchman. On the 6th of April, between three and four o'clock, I heard a noise among the coals, and saw three men at the barge-two of them were in the barge, and the other in the boat alongside. I called out, and they got into the boat, and rowed down the river. I went into the barge, and found a white frost on the coals, but not all over them; there was a place without the frost-about three sacks of coals had been taken from that part. I went as far as Bow-bridge, but could not find them.</p>

On the 6th of April, about three o'clock in the morning, he came to me, and said, they were gone out. I saw them a few minutes after they were taken, and asked them how they came by the coals. They said they were given to them - They had between three and four sacks, in five bags and three baskets - They appeared to be of the same quality as the coals in the barge.</p>

I went up to the prisoner's drawers, and found a 3s. piece in his purse, that was market; I am sure it was one that had been marked that day. I sent for Mayhew, the officer, and told the prisoner I was determined to find out who it was that had robbed me; the officer searched him in my presence, and found 1l. 12s., in silver, upon him-among which there was a 3s. token, a 1s. 6d. token, a half-crown, and 2s. that were marked with my mark. All the money in the till was marked; the prisoner had nothing to do with the till. I went up to his drawers with the officer, and found 2l. in notes, and 1l., in silver, among which was a 3s. piece belonging to me; he said it was his own. He begged for mercy.</p>

I found 1l. 12s., in silver, in his breeches pocket; he said it was his own. Bates picked out a 3s. token, a 1s.6d. token, a half-crown and 2s., which were all marked in the same way - He said it was his own. We found 1l., in silver, in a purse up stairs-Mr. Bates claimed a 3s., token; French was present, and told the prisoner it was the money he had marked; he fell down and begged forgiveness; when he was before the magistrate, he said all the money was his but that which was marked, and that was the prosecutor's.</p>

I had just took the house and furniture-the three prisoners lodged there when I went in; I gave them notice to quit, but they desired to stay longer; the articles stated in the indictment were let with the room. On the 17th of February they went away - They did not tell me they were going-the things were safe the night before. Between six and seven o'clock in the morning I heard them running up and down stairs; I went to my room door and found it was fastened outside - They must have done it - I could not get out. In about five minutes I forced the door open, and found the prisoners gone and the property also; I could not find them until the Saturday after. A man named King, lived in the room with them - He went away at the same time, but I cannot find him. I met the prisoner. Todd, asked him about the things, and secured him. I found the other two prisoners opposite Hicks's Hall, and gave them in charge. I heard several persons going up and down stairs. I had no other lodgers - They had left me. I have not found any of the property.</p>

About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Wentworth-street, I saw the prisoner, and another man, run out of a court in Essex-street, and cross by me; knowing the prisoner before. I stopped him, and saw him put something under his jacket; I asked him what it was? he said he had picked them up at a door in Essex-street. It was the pair of breeches.</p>

On the 9th of February, as I was going home, the prisoner accosted me in Oxford-street; she asked me for some drink, and to go home with her. Wishing to get rid of her, I said I had no money, and it was too late. She pressed me very much, and took hold of my arm. I walked up Wells-street and Castle-street, into <placeName id="t18170416-194-crimeloc1025">Adam and Eve-court</placeName>

We got into the passage, and, all of a sudden, she left me, saying, "stop a minute." After waiting about ten minutes, I began to suspect her, and found she had taken a 5l. note out of my left-hand breeches pocket. I ran into Oxford-street, but could not find her. I knew the number and date of the note, and stopped it at the Bank the next day. On the 7th of March it was brought into the Bank. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. I was not intoxicated.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of March I was in Holborn, in company with Wright. I saw the three prisoners together. Francois attempted to take a piece of linen from the shop-door of Mr. Jennings, but the shopman came out. I followed them up Holborn. They attempted several shops, when they came into <placeName id="t18170416-195-crimeloc1030">Oxford-street</placeName>

They all went up to Mr. Ince's shop, and stood there a few minutes, and then went back. The prisoner, Francois, stood in the middle - They stood on each side to cover him. I saw him take the spencer from the door, and wrap it in his apron-all three walked away together. I secured Francois, and took the spencer out of his apron. Wright took the other two-Bowden ran away but was secured.</p>

He crossed over, and waited at the corner of New Cavendish-street. Two other boys came out after him-all three went down Duke-street-the prisoner on the right-hand side of the way, and the others on the left; they all three met at the corner of Riding-house-lane. The prisoner took the sack and glasses from the smallest boy, and all three turned into Edward-street-the prisoner saw me, and ran off as fast as he could, with the glasses - He put them down at the corner of Mortimer-street. I went up and secured him-the other two escaped.</p>

On the 25th of February, the prisoner took a bed at my house; the next day he said he had walked from Canterbury, was very tired, and should sleep there that night also. About half past nine o'clock, he said he should go to bed, and went up stairs. In about ten minutes, a man said he had seen some person go out with a bundle. I found three beds had been stripped of the sheets. I went out, and overtook the prisoner with them on his shoulder - He said he knew he had taken them. I secured him.</p>

I got an officer and went into the room, and found the articles stated in the indictment gone - We apprehended them, and found the property at the pawnbroker's. Digby said he was sorry for what he had done, and he would redeem them, if I would wait.</p>

On the 18th of April, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop for some cambric, which came to 4d.; she then asked to look at some purple handkerchiefs - I turned my back to get them, but kept my eye upon her, and handed her several sorts; I saw her take the four handkerchiefs and put them under her apron-none of them would suit her. She was going to leave the shop - I called my master, and told him to search her. I saw him take three handkerchiefs from under her apron. He asked her what she had in her pocket - She said "nothing." He found a muslin handkerchief in her pocket, which had our private mark on it - She begged forgiveness. I gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am a patrol belonging to the Public Office, Bow-street. On the 2d of April, I met the prisoner, on Saffron-hill, with a bundle. I watched him into a house kept by Mrs. Kenton, on Mutton-hill - I went in there, and caught him offering the articles stated in the indictment, for sale. He said his sister sent him to sell them, and told me her name. I went into Lilley-street, and found a person of that name, who said she did not know him.</p>

I put my bundle down close by me. The prisoner, Thompson,(who was in the other box), came and reached over my table, and I found he had got my bundle. He threw it over to the others-they threw it under the tap-room table. I got up, and charged the prisoner with stealing my bundle. He said he had not got it. I told him it was among them. I saw it under the table, between their legs, and endeavoured to get it, but they all kicked my fingers and prevented me; I put my back to the door, to prevent them from going out. I called the landlord, and asked him to get an officer; he said he would not, and that he knew them very well-that it was only a lark, and that I should have it if I would be quiet. I sat down, and asked them to give it to me - They all rushed out, and left me alone-my bundle was also gone. Payne, the landlord, said, if I would call the next morning, I should see them again. I told him I would - I did so. The prisoner, Thompson, came into the house while I was there. I charged him with taking the property. He said, if I would wait an hour, he would bring it to me. He went out - I waited an hour - He came back and said the man was not there, but he would go again. The next evening, I got an officer, and went to the house, and found Thompson there. He ran out as soon as he saw me, and ran down Sutton-street - He was secured and brought back. The prisoner, Macdonald, came to me the next morning, and asked me to make it up - I told him I would not. He said, the things were sold for 2l., in Golden-lane, aed that they threatened to murder him if he divulged any thing.</p>

He said, some person had taken his bundle, but he could not say who it was.

There were four or five men at his table, he had been drinking with them. They declared they had not seen it, and that he had been offering to sell them bad money.

I searched him, and found a gown inside his breeches, and another in his coat pocket-the other things were about him. He said distress had driven him to it.</p>
