Hammersmith, and am a house agent—when there were defaulters in collecting the poor rates the prisoner was in the habit of employing me to collect them—for that purpose he entrusted me with the official receipts from the receipt book, and I proceeded to get in the moneys—this is a memorandum book kept by me—I should have the whole of the defaulter's receipts given to me—I got 81 receipts mentioned by numbers in this book—I collected up to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid by 31 ratepayers, and I gave the prisoner a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my cheque on my bankers to Mansell's order; it is endorsed by him—it has come back, and I have been charged with it—I hen proceeded, and got 34 further sums amounting to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th September, and I gave the prisoner a cheque for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that cheque was</p>

                  </hi>. I am Vestry Clerk of Hammersmith, and reside at Hounslow—after 1882 the prisoner was employed as collector of the poor rate in No. 3 district—the writ made in May was put into his hands for collection in that district—the receipt-book is in three parts, the demand note, the official receipt, and the counterfoil—they are all numbered—the ratepayer's number is a different one—it was the prisoner's duty to pay in to the overseers' banking account the moneys he received from time to time—he went on collecting the rate of May, 1884, down to the end of August—the numbers in the receipt-book were then checked, and I certified as to their correctness—in September I find entries of the amounts collected by the prisoner, in his handwriting—the last entry of a receipt is on September 11th—there is no entry of any sum received by him after that—I find entries by him of paying in 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 5th September, and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th September, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 15th September—that was the last payment in by him—the number of the ratepayers and the amounts due are eet out—there is no entry of any one of the 81 ratepayers which make up the amount that Mr. Saunders paid over to the prisoner—there is no entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Macey, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Hubbard, or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Ladd—these are the official receipts for those amounts signed by the prisoner—the May collection would close at 4 o'clock on Monday, 29th September—I had seen the prisoner two or three days before—I did not know that he was going away—in the ordinary course he would have been there on the 29th when the rode was closed—he would pay the money into the bank to close the rate—I had no knowledge that he had used Mr. Saunders's two cheques of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in order to pay the amounts he had entered in the book, or that he had paid the 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his own account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I know he has borne an honourable character up to this time—I have personally given him instructions as to his duties and as to his paying in moneys—I was not aware that he kept a private account at the same bank as the parish account was kept, until after 29th September—I may have had such a cheque, but I do not remember it—I checked the accounts of the parish with the bank every month—I had no means of knowing whether the amounts were paid by cheque</p>

               <p>or cash—the collector has to use his own discretion about taking cheques from ratepayers—if he does take a cheque it should be paid in direct to the overseers' account—in balancing the accounts a collector may have a small amount left in his hands; if so he should pay it in immediately afterwards—the parish had a guarantee with the prisoner to the amouut of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was paid a poundage of 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound; that was paid quarterly—his poundage due in December would be paid, I should think, before 27th January, but I do not know—the prisoner would have to collect from about 3,000 ratepayers—in the last quarter, from June to Michaelmas, the sum he paid in to the overseers' account was 2,928<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—his poundage would amount to about 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for preparing jury lists—he assisted Mr. Otterage, another collector, for a short time, about a fortnight or three weeks—on 29th September the prisoner's father came to me and asked if it was not paying-in day—he did not ask if anything was wanting and offer to pay the money—I told him I could not tell without seeing the books, and I suggested that he should go and get me the books, and I would examine mem and let him know what amount the prisoner was short—I think he gave me the books; he gave me everything I asked for—he did not sav, "There will be no difficulty about the money; it can be paid in gold, if you like, at any moment"—the account was very clear, not at all complicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I include in the 2,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he paid in, the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Saunders's cheques—the prisoner's father said he did not know where his son was—when I had the books I made out from the counterfoils an account of the missing official receipts, of which no trace was found in the books—the total amount of the missing receipts was 238<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I said there would be no pro'secution I assumed that the money would be paid—about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would pass through the prisoner's hands annually.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer at Han well—on Wednesday, 19th November, about 11.15, I signed twelve cheques in blank in my cheque book, there are three cheques on a page, that was my usual course for the purpose of my business, I crossed them and put "Co." on them like these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); that is my signature at the bottom, and these are two of the cheques I signed on that day, they come from my cheque book—on 21st November, about half-past 9, I went to my office, and there saw my clerk, Hunt—he called my attention to six counterfoils in the cheque book; the bodies of the cheques were gone; Hunt made a communication to me, and I sent him immediately with the numbers to the London and County Bank, with instructions to stop all these cheques which had been abstracted—about 4 the same afternoon Mr. Keats, a tradesman at Brentford, came to my office with the manager of Hull, Smith, and Co., and produced this cheque crossed Hull, Smith, and do., Bankers, Brentford, for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., made payable to Mr. C. Glenie—they notified from the bank that they had stopped a cheque, which was the second one, in favour of Wilson, one of the cheques lost out of the book and signed by me—I know nothing of the prisoner—I gave no one authority to fill up these cheques in favour of Glenie or Wilson—I know a man named Glenie, I have dealt with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I am an agricultural valuer and auctioneer—I have a temporary office at Southall, which I use on market days—I kept my cheque book there in a desk, I had no key to that desk—I signed these twelve cheques about 11.15, I then went out into the market—I left no one behind me, I did not lock the outer door of my office nor the inner one—I went out leaving the office perfectly empty, with the signed cheques in the desk—I signed twelve cheques—I heard my clerk, Hunt, say he had paid ten away, two are said to have been cashed by the prisoner, that makes the twelve—people did not come to my office and write on this desk; they had no right in that portion of the office where this desk was; there was a flat table for our customers to write on, there was a door with a lid between the two desks, which you lift up to go through—I find I must have signed more than twelve cheques on this day, it was my habit to sign twelve, I don't know the numbers of any of the cheques I signed—Hunt gave me the first intimation about this larceny on Friday morning, 21st; he lives over my office at Southall, about a mile and a quarter from my house—on the 20th I was at 30, Wellington Street, Strand, till 3 in the afternoon—there was nothing to prevent Hunt coming to my house on the 20th and telling me, he did not come—Hnirt did not show me a photograph—this temporary office has been open 15 yean, but I only used it occasionally—I left the office about 2 in the afternoon—</p>

               <p>I did not get a written notice from the solicitor for the defence at Brentford, asking leave to inspect my cheque book—No. 26050 was the fast cheque that was stolen—the counterfoil of 26049 is my clerk's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Southall, and am a clerk in the service of the prosecutor—it was my duty, when he had signed his cheques ready to be given out, to fill in the body of the cheque with the names of the persons to whom the cheques are payable—the body of this cheque, "Pay Mr. Charles Glenie 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," is not in my handwriting; nor this one, "Pay Mr. James Wilson 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was a sale on the 19th, and on that day the cheque book containing these cheques would be in the office—on the 20th I discovered that six cheques were missing from my employer's cheque book—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two of the six, and on the 21st I mentioned the matter to my master—I called his attention to the blank counterfoils—it is the custom before tearing out the cheque to fill up the counterfoil—I know the prisoner, he has frequently bean at Mr. Steele's office when I have been there, and has had an opportunity of seeing where the cheque book was kept—he has seen me take the book from the desk and fill up the cheques—I was at school with him, and know his writing—I believe that the bodies of these cheques are in the prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and the prisoner were taught handwriting by the same master—I said at the police court that I had paid away ten cheques—there are twenty cheques bearing the date of 19th November—after where the cheques were stolen from there is a date of 20th November, and after that there are three cheques of 19th November—I made a mis<lb/>take there in writing them out on Thursday; I put the 19th instead of 20th—the Glenie on the counterfoil is in my handwriting, but the Glenie at the back of the cheque is in the prisoner's handwriting—there is nothing peculiar in the shape of the two G's; I don't think we both make our G alike—I was not aware that Mr. Steele came back about 3 in the after<lb/>noon—I can't tell why I did not go to Mr. Steele's on the 20th—I had two thoughts, I thought perhaps they were stolen and I thought perhaps Mr. Steele might have taken them for his private use—when I saw the handwriting I thought the prisoner had taken them—I went with Mr. Keats to the White Bear, where the prisoner was lodging—a policeman was with us—I was outside when the prisoner came down—I am sure I did not point to the prisoner and say "That is him"—I took a photo<lb/>graph out of my pocket at Brentford and showed it to Mr. Keats—Keats went inside the White Bear with the policeman—Keats spoke to me as we were walking from the White Bear to the station; the policeman could not hear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He said "That is him"—I was about eight or nine when I went to school with the prisoner—I went to school with him about eighteen months—he would be acquainted with my handwriting—I have been at the office 4 1/2 years—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion that the endorsement Glenie on the back of this cheque is in my handwriting.</p>

               <p>sight—on 19th November about 3.45 he came to my house with this cheque and asked me if I would cash it for him—it was crossed—I was not able to cash it at that moment, but I went to Messrs. Hartland's bank—I pointed out Mr. Steele's signature and got the money and took it to the prisoner—I put it down on the counter—he counted it, put it in his pocket, and took it away—I have no doubt at all that he is the man that came there—I was communicated with, and went to the White Bear at Hounslow with the policeman—I went inside the house—I did not go upstairs—when I saw the prisoner I said, "He is the man I cashed the cheque for"—I have no doubt about it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Thompson, pawnbroker, 53, Praed Street—on the morning of the 25th I was awoke by Inspector Bassett, and went with him to the police-station, where I identified these as Mr. Moss's property—I afterwards went back to the house and found Robinson there.</p>

About 5 minutes to 5 on 25th November I was in Praed Street, and in a recess near No. 73 saw two bundles of clothes, one on the top of the other, in handkerchiefs; a constable came and took the bundles to the station; there was a ticket with them with Mr. Thompson's name on.</p>

About 10 minutes to 5 on the morning of the 25th November I was on duty in Praed Street and saw Mills between Bouverie's and Moss's shops, 14 or 15 yards past Moss's—he asked me the time, I told him about 10 minutes to 5; he said, "I have been waiting about half an hour for my brother, he has not turned up yet"—he then walked away—a few yards from where he had been standing I found two bundles of clothing—the inspector came up and took charge of them.</p>

I went to 20, Church Hill Road, Dartmouth Park, where I saw Mills—I asked him if he knew Robinson—he said "Yes"—after some little conversation I said "Robinson is in difficulty, and from what I have learnt I have reason to suspect you have been concerned with him; you had better come to the police-station and have the matter investigated. If you are innocent well and good, if not you must take the consequences"—he said "If I am in disgrace it is all through Robinson"—he was taken to the station, placed with six or seven others, and identified by Hooper as the man with whom he had the conversation—he made no reply when charged with being concerned with Robinson in breaking and entering the remises—I searched and found on him this latchkey and some money.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Deposition read</hi>: I am employed in adjusting weights. I live at 15, Neale Street, Long Acre. I work at 50, Cowcross Street. I know the prisoner; he is a fellow-workman.

I hit him with the back of my hand on the face; he picked up the knife with which he was eating his lunch, a dinner knife, and he said 'I will plunge this into you,' and he struck me on the side with it. I pressed the wound with my hands, got downstairs, got a four-wheeler, and came to the hospital. I left the prisoner there. I have not had a quarrel before with him, nothing to mention. I have known him about two years altogether. I think I struck him twice on the face. I did not run against the knife, he plunged it into me. There was a stool between us. He plunged it into my left side. It was after he said 'I will plunge this Knife into you' that I struck him the second blow in the face; it was the same moment I had the knife.")</p>

I am very sorry, I did not intend to hurt him"—I took him to the hospital, but we were not allowed to see the injured man that night, he was too weak—I took the prisoner to the station; the knife was afterwards handed to me, I showed it to the prisoner next morning; he said, "That is the knife I had in my hand when he ran against it."</p>

I am the wife of Captain Herbert Brackenbury, of the Royal Artillery—I live at Brook Cottage, near Gosport—he is now on his way home from Hong Kong, but probably left before a letter which I forwarded to him arrived—that letter was from a Mr. Hill to my husband—on 28th October I received this letter.

I was 18 years old last September—I was Mr. Porter's carman—I know Connor as Ned Sweeney and James as Bob Low—on 28th October I had to collect some tea at Smith's Wharf, and after I had loaded them I saw the prisoners—James said "Hallo, Dick, can't you lose your van?"—I said "No"—I drove to Miles Lane and they followed—I delivered three half-chests there, and they called me into a public-house and gave me some whisky—I then drove to Pudding Laue where I had to deliver nine of the chests, and when I got then Connor said "If you don't let me take the van away you will not get a farthing"—I had to go down George Lane, as it was too narrow for the van—I carried one chest down, leaving the horse and van and 20 half-chests and 17 boxes of tea—I was away a quarter of an hour, and when I returned they were gone, and the prisoners also—that was about 1 o'clock—I then went to Seething Lane Station and made a report to the police and then weut and told my master—I next saw the prisoners on the Friday evening at the corner of Baker's Row, accidentally—James said "Come down lower"—we went, and he and I went into a public-house, Connor stood outside—James gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said "Come here to-night at 8 o'clock"—I went to Baker's Row at 8 o'clock, but did not go to the public-house—they gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and told me to come on Sunday night, which I did, and they gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the last I saw of them, I have known them three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told Mr. Potter on the day the van was lost, but not the police—it would not be true to say that I told the police the names of the men that night—I did not mention their names to Mr. Potter the day the van was lost—I was in Court when Mr. Potter was examined, I did not hear him say that I mentioned their names that night—I know Renshaw, I knew him before I was at the police-court; we have worked together, and I have drunk with him, and have heen with him once to the Standard Theatre—I have not been to the Cambridge with him, I used to meet him, but did not treat him, he paid his share at the theatre and I paid mine—I did not see him at the time the the van was lost, I only saw him once between 28th October and 17th November—that was when we went to the Standard—when I went to</p>

               <p>Miles Lane I knew the prisoners wanted to steal my van; they were on top of it when I went, but I did not think they would take it away—the meaning of losing thfl van was this: they said "You go in a coffee-shop and stop there and we will take the van;" I did not do that, but I went to deliver the tea—being friends I did not think they would rob me—I did not mention a word of this to Mr. Potter or the police till I saw Mr. Potter in the pony cart, and he said I had better make a clean breast of it—he did not say "Tell us all you know," but he said "It will be better for you and probably you will get out of it altogether"—I received the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. outside the public-house—I heard my evidence read over and signed it as correct—the barman served us in Miles Lane—that was in the middle of the day, he could see us all three together—I have not seen him here—on the evening I was taken I met Mr. Isaac Potter, I knew him working at John Potter's, I did not know I should see him, it was a surprise—I afterwards met the prisoners and went with them and Isaac Potter into the Waterloo public-house, where we all drank together—Isaac Potter left us there, and in a quarter of an hour the police came and took me—I do not know that Potter had gone to Seething Lane Station—he did not ask me the day before to bring these two men into that public-house—the other public-house is the Beehive—before I gave information I found I was likely to get into trouble, I did not do it till they were in custody—I would have given evidence if the police had not taken them—Isaac Potter did not ask me a little time ago to help him in a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. job, a van robbery—Dowse took me in custody—I did not say at the Mansion House "I was taken by Dowse to the station, he spoke to me on the way to the station and I spoke to him of this"—he was called after me at the Mansion House, and I heard him say that he never said a word to me or I to him—that is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Renshaw is a carman in Sedgeley's empolyment, half a mile from Mr. Potter's—they go to the same wharf in Thames Street—carmen often wait two or three hours for their turn on a wharf, and that is how I knew Renshaw—James suggested I should go into a coffee house, and the van should disappear, but I had not agreed to let it be taken while I was in Miles Lane.</p>

I live at 14, George Street, Commercial Road—I was a carman to Mr. Sedgeley—I know Connor by name and James by sight—on 28th October, about one o'clock, I was driving a van near the King William statue, and saw Connor driving Mr. Potter's van, which was loaded, and James running behind, who threatened me with his fist as he passed—they were coming from Eastcheap—I saw the case in the paper on 10th December, and spoke to Mr. Potter, but before that, on a Wednesday night, when the prisoners were remanded a second time, a man whose name I do not know, gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not know then what it was for, but I did afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Coroners for the county of Middlesex—on Wednesday, 19th November, I held an inquest on the body of James Gibbons—on that day the prisoner was called and sworn in the usual way—she was not cautioned at all; she was called as an ordinary witness—she gave her evidence, and I took it down in writing at the time—it was not read over to her then, and she did not sign it then—the inquest was adjourned to half-past 11 on Tuesday, the 25th, when the surgeons and other witnesses were examined, and on that occasion the prisoner signed her deposition—I asked her then in which way her name was spelt, and she told me—she said nothing more that I remember—the inquest was again adjourned to December 2nd, when the depositions were completed and the verdict returned—this is the deposition of the prisoner as I took it down. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I reside in Fleet Lane in the parish of Hayes. The deceased was my husband. His name was James Gibbon. He was 63 years old. He was a contractor in the Creosote Yard of the Great Western Railway. He came home on Saturday at half-past 9 or a quarter to 10. He was not usually so late as that, because he had been out for the day. He had his supper, and went upstairs for bed at very near 11. I was up before he was undressed, and he sat on the side of the bed. I asked him if his cousin Mary met, him at Taunton. He said 'Yes.' I asked him if he had wrote for her to meet him, and he said he had not. I asked him if he had wrote to any one to let her know, and he did not answer me. I told him he might as well have let me went with him if he knew his cousin was coming up to meet him, and that seemed to upset him. He told me I had no business to say anything about his relations. With that he jumped up, got the revolver from under his pillow and waved it about his head, and I screamed and ran downstairs. I heard the shots fired. I ran up again, and he was fell down. I tried to rise his head. I ran down again to Mrs. Sowman, my neighbour, and called her in, and she and I tried to rise him up again. He was dead, then, I suppose; we did not see him breathe. I was undressed, but not in bed, at the time the conversation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412150055"/>
               <p>took place. It is not the first time we have had conversation on the same subject; we have often spoke of it. We never had no words, it was all said in good temper. I do not know what there was to put him out or excite him. He was very often excited like that; for several months he did not seem as if he was right; he used to get up and dress and go down into the yard in the middle of the night and walk about. He did not sleep well. He used to suffer very much with his head. He took his food well at supper time, but not at other times. He has been very much depressed. Sometimes of a morning he did not eat no food. I think it was four shots that I heard, one after the other, instantaneous almost. I did not see where he was shot. Blood was all round the chest and shoulder. He was lying on his stomach when I went up. The revolver was lying up against his head like. I do not know if we moved it in trying to pick him up. There was no one else in the house. He had a bad fall three or four years ago off a truck in the yard, and was insensible for some time, and after that he had a slight sunstroke.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I put questions to her, principally in the same way one would in examining a witness in Court; she answered them, and I put down her answers without the questions—I cannot recollect whether she said "I was undressed standing against the mantelpiece"—my recol<lb/>lection is principally dependent on the depositions—I think she was arrested by the inspector the day she signed her deposition—she made no hesitation about signing her deposition—I said "I want you to sign jour evidence," and she did so at once—the questions I put to her were readily answered'.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fleet Lane, Hayes—my house is next door to the house of Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons, with a garden path between—on Saturday night, 15th November, I was sitting in my house with my husband—I knew Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons very well—I saw Mr. Gibbons pass my house on that Saturday morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock; he was walking in the road—he said he was going to the station—I heard him say "Good-bye, Lizzie, I shall be home about half-past 9 in the evening"—that was all I heard—I don't remember seeing Mrs. Gibbons that morning—he went towards the station—I did not speak to him, or he to me—I have often seen him about in the garden and passing by—I knew that he was a teetotaler—I had not spoken to him—somewhere between 11 and 12 o'clock that night I was in my house with my husband, and heard the prisoner call me—she was in the lane against my gate—I went out—she was in her night-dress—she said "Do come in, Mrs. Sowden, Mr. Gibbons has shot himself," or "My husband has shot him<lb/>self"—I could not say which words she used—I followed her in—I don't' think she had shoes or stockings on—that is a mere guess of mine, she might have had stockings on; I could not say—I saw that she had blood on her nightdress in front—I followed her into her house; she said nothing more—I went upstairs into the bedroom; I could not say whether she went up first—the door of the room was open—it opens into the room—I saw Mr. Gibbons lying on the floor on his face, his head towards the door and his feet towards the bed (<hi rend="italic">A model and plan of the room was here produced</hi>)—I think the door could have been shut without touching the body, I could not be sure—Mrs. Gibbons and me tried to raise him, to</p>

About 1.10 on the morning of the 16th November I saw Mr. Parrott—I was on duty in the street—I at once went to Mr. Gibbons's house—the last witness opened the door to me—I went upstairs to the bedroom, and saw the body of Mr. Gibbons on his back—I saw this revolver on a chest of drawers—I took possession of it—I did not examine it at that time—I took it to the station after having some conversation with the prisoner—in the evening I and Police-constable Manby examined it—Manby, in my presence, took out five cartridge cases—it was a six-chambered revolver—I could not tell whether they had been recently fired—the sixth chamber was empty; we could not get that one out at the time—the empty cartridge case wan in it—I Afterwards saw it taken out by Manby—it was not in the same state as the other cases; it was corroded round—before I left the bedroom I noticed the deceased's face; there was a wound in the face, and the face was blackened as if from powder, from the eye down the cheek—the body was lying on the floor on its back—I did not move the body at all—the clothing was then on—the doctor had then left—the bed was turned down, and there was a slight impression on the side as if some one had sat on the bed—the clothes were turned, down so as to expose the side of the bed—they were turned nearly half way down the bed from the pillow—the impression as if it had been sat upon was on the side nearest the door, near the pillow—I noticed that before I left the room—I then went downstairs and saw the prisoner—she appeared to be in great grief, crying very much—I was in uniform—she made a statement to me—I did not ask her questions, she spoke to me—I had my book with me, I have it here—I wrote down what she said, she saw me writing—I wrote it as it came from her lips as far as I could—she said "Police<lb/>man, I cannot realise it; it do not seem true, to see how he used to kneel by the side of the chair and pray every night; he arrived home to-night at about half-past 9 o'clock, had his supper, and went into the stable to look at the horse; he then went upstairs and partly undressed himself to retire to bed; I went upstairs just before him, and I then asked him 'Was Mary there to meet you?' he having been to Taunton; he replied 'Yes;' I said 'I think she might have written and told me;' my husband said 'I do not know why she did not write;' he then took up the revolver from under the pillow, swinging it round and firing it off three or four times, and he then fell on the floor, he being at the time sitting on the bed; I then called Mrs. Sowman, a neighbour, who came to my assistance, and we went to the bedroom and found he was dead." That was all said to me without any question at all from me—nothing more passed between us—I then left the house—that would be about. 20 minutes to 2 o'clock—I reported the matter to my superiors at the station—I did not read over to the prisoner what I had taken down—I am certain I have given her very words—I was standing up, she was sitting down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Black Lane, Hayes, about three minutes walk from where Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons lived—I had known them ever since they had been in Hayes, nearly seven years—I used to visit them, sometimes oftener than at others; sometimes I have not been there for some little time, and sometimes I have gone there two or three times a week—I don't think I had seen Mr. Gibbons during the last week; he was pretty well the last time I saw him—I don't think I saw him after the Sunday before his death—I believe he was a right-handed man; I don't know whether he could use his left as well as his right; I have always seen him use his right hand—on Sunday morning, November 16th, I heard what had occurred on the previous night and I went round to the prisoner's house; I got there about 9 o'clock and saw the prisoner—I said to her "Oh dear Mrs. Gibbons, what is this that has happened?" and she answered me "Oh dear, Mrs. Markham"—we did not say any more for some little time, she was too overwhelmed in trouble to talk—she afterwards said that Mr. Gibbons had been to Taunton, and he came home and had his supper, and he went out in the back yard to see to the things out there, and he saw a dead fowl, and then he went to see to the horse, and he came back indoors and went up to go to bed, and then he asked her how the fowl came dead, and she said she did not know, and he said that the horse was not properly groomed, and she said he must ask the man about that, and she said Mr. Gibbons took the revolver and twirled it about and shot himself—her words were "He then took the revolver and twirled it round and fired it off," and then she ran downstairs and went and called Mrs. Sowman, and Mrs. Sowman went to her assistance, and there was not any more said—she said she heard two shots after she came down stairs, as she was going out of the door; that she had a difficulty in opening the front door—she said she went upstairs again and Mr. Gibbons was fell on the floor; I don't know whether that was before she went to Mrs. Sowman's or after—she said something about putting her arms round him, but I won't be quite confident about it—she said Mr. Gibbons, went to Taunton on Saturday morning, and returned at half-past nine at night, and had his supper—she said to him, she thought Mary might have wrote to her and said whether she had been coming to Taunton or not—she did not say what Mr. Gibbons said—I have told you as near as I can remember what was said—I did not ask her any questions after she had told me this—I afterwards went up into the bedroom; I saw some clothes there by the drawers, a flannel under-shirt that had been taken off the body, and a shirt also; they were covered with blood, and on the Sunday evening I took them with me, and washed them on the Monday, and after I had washed and dried them I gave to Police-constable Mawby—these are the two things I washed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>he fired one shot which she thought was to frighten her, but immediately fired another one, and she closed with him, and tried to get the revolver from him, but being unsuccessful she ran downstairs, and when opening the front door to call a neighbour she heard two other shots and the fall; she ran back upstairs, and found that he had fallen down on to the floor, and she said "I tried to raise him to kiss him and see if he was dead"—she then went downstairs and called the neighbours—that was all—they lived rather unhappily—Mr. Gibbons was a very particular friend of mine; he was a right-handed man, and a total abstainer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S., and practise at Hayes—I knew Mr. James Gibbons ever since he has been at Hayes—I attended him professionally on many occasions—the last time was in the summer, I could not say exactly when—I frequently saw him from time to time—I last saw him on the Saturday before his death; he was perfectly well then—I almost invariably attended him for one thing, that was dyspepsia—his disposition was very bright and cheerful during all the time I knew him, there was no change in his manner and demeanour—on the night of Saturday, 15th November, about midnight, Mrs. Sowman came and gave me some information—I at once went with my assistant, Mr. Hathaway, to Gibbons's house—I got there in seven or eight minutes, it might be ten—I went upstairs into the bedroom, and there saw the body of Gibbons lying on the floor, face downwards—the head was close to the edge of a small table which stood between the bed and the door; the feet were down by the side of the bed, perhaps partially under the valence of the bed—he had on a white shirt, and subsequently I found underneath that a flannel shirt, drawers, and I believe socks, but of that I am not sure—my assistant and I turned him over immediately—he was quite dead; there was no pulse, no respiratory murmur, no heart sound—the body was warm—in my opinion he had only very recently died,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412150064"/>
               <p>I should say from a quarter to half an hour—there was a great deal of blood on the left side of the shirt; there was blood on the face, on the left side—in the centre of the left cheek there was a small, sharply-defined wound, blackened round with powder and surrounded by blood on the face—I saw there were other wounds—we left the body exactly where we turned it over—I cut the shirts down and turned them back, and saw two wounds on the chest on the left side (<hi rend="italic">A plaster cast was produced, and the witness pointed out upon that the position of the wounds</hi>)—at that time I did not notice any wound at the back—I noticed the bed; the clothes were turned down nearly to the bottom of the bed, all across, and there was an impression on the side of the bed nearest the door as if some one had been sitting on it, and between that impression and the pillow on the same side of the bed the bed was sprinkled with blood—I left the shirts on the body after cutting them—I noticed two holes in front on the white shirt corresponding with the wounds—the shirts were saturated with blood, and round the two holes on the outer shirt were the marks of powder—behind the door I saw a smear of blood and a splash of blood on the wall—if the door was open it would hide the smear and the splash—the smear was about three feet from the ground as far as I remember, it was just a slight smear, but distinct—the splash was two spots, they were below as far as I remember—I observed nothing else—there was no evidence of a struggle—I saw a revolver lying on the drawers at the end farthest from the door, there was blood on the side of the barrel—I took it in my hand, looked at it, and replaced it where I found it—the prisoner and Mrs. Sowman were in the room when I first went there—the prisoner was wringing her hands and making great demonstrations of grief, and after we had turned the body over she pat her arms round his neck and kissed him—she was in her night-dress, she had stockings on, at least some covering that I believed to be stockings—I said to her "How did he do this?"—she said "I don't know, he flourished it about"—I said "Didn't you try to prevent him?"—she said "I put my arms round him and tried to prevent him and fell down with him"—this was said in the room—after that I got a shawl and put it round her and got her out of the room—I saw that her night-gown had blood upon it on the front, not very much, it was stained with blood in places—after I had completed my examination of the room I went downstairs and there saw the prisoner again—she spoke to me first and said "Is he dead?" "Is he dead?" "Is he dead?" three times before I could answer her—I then sat down beside her and talked to her and asked her if she knew of any cause, or trouble, or anything to cause him to commit such an act—she said "No," but she afterwards said "There might have been some little trouble to-day, we have had a little girl living with ua about two years, and Mr. Gibbons was very fond of her; about two months ago I sent her home to her mother, and he has been to see her to-day; and when he came home I said 'You might as well have taken me with you;' he said 'You can go another time, when you like, I will give you her address, you can go on Monday if you like'"—she also said that since the little girl had gone home Mr. Gibbons had not been the same man, that once or twice he got up at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning and went downstairs without any cause, only he said he could not sleep—I think that was the substance of the conversation—I left the bedroom as it was—I went to the house again on the Thursday</p>

               <p>following to make a post-mortem examination by order of the Coroner—Mr. Hathaway was with me—after proceeding some way with my examination I thought it desirable that some surgeon of skill and expe<lb/>rience should assist me, and I applied to the Coroner, and Mr. Boulby, the Surgical Registrar and Demonstrator of Pathology of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, came and assisted me in the post-mortem examination on the following Saturday—we found that the wound in the cheek was a bullet wound which had fractured the upper part of the jawbone; we found the bullet, it had traversed obliquely along, backwards, slightly downwards perhaps; the bullet was found lying deeply embedded in the muscles of the neck, close to the mastoid pro<lb/>cesses of the mastoid bone, in front of the ear, just below it—it had not come through—I took possession of that bullet—at the entrance of the wound the skin was marked with powder, it was a clean mark which I should describe as a characteristic bullet wound of entry—we also found a wound at the back of the left shoulder, midway between the spinal column and the point of the shoulder; that wound had gone through the two shirts and had traversed horizontally forward, of course that is supposing the body to be in an erect position; it had gone in a distance of three inches; the bullet was felt by the probe, it could also be felt easily under the skin with the finger in front of the neck—the deceased was a stout man with broad shoulders; I should think about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches in height—in my judgment it was utterly impossible for the man him<lb/>self to have caused that wound, either with the left hand or the right—I am of opinion that under no condition of things could a man have fired that shot with the pistol himself—there were two wounds in front, one was two inches to the outer side of the left nipple; about half an inch below that there was a bullet wound at the point of entry, and the bullet traversed inward from left to right, downwards and slightly forwards; in its way it perforated and fractured the fourth rib close to its junction with its cartilage, perforated the pericardium, the sac which contains the heart; traversed the anterior wall of the heart, perforating and opening the cavity of the right vertricle, and then passed through the diaphragm and was found in the right lobe of the liver; the pericardium was full of coagulated blood—in my judgment, after that injury had been inflicted the man could have lived but a very short time indeed, perhaps half a minute, perhaps more, but I should say about half a minute; a man after receiving that injury certainly could not have fired any other shot; if he had been standing up when he received it, he would immediately fall down—it is possible that with his left hand he might have fired that shot; to all intents and purposes life would be extinct in half a minute; there might be a few spasmodic gasps afterwards, but he would be rendered instantly powerless, it might be called instantly fatal—the bullet was found by Mr. Boulby lying against the muscle which covers the anterior side of the shoulder blade, it had gone through from the front and was found lying under the shoulder blade behind; it had gone in slightly upwards—that wound which went behind the collar bone and the first rib I consider a very serious one, because the quantity of bleeding lying along the track of the bullet was very great—I have not any special knowledge of gunshot wounds, I have been a sportsman all my life—I should say that the pistol must have been held very close to burn the shirt and flannel underneath, but not in contact—I am speaking of the hole at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412150066"/>
               <p>the back—if it was in actual contact it would set fire, it would not make so large a hole as this, but when once set fire to it would burn any size—I noticed on one of the holes of the shirt there was some black powder, and on the flannel as well, although they had been washed—there were two small contused wounds on the body, one over the left temple and one on the back of the head over the right parietal bone; these might be occasioned by a fall, they were certainly not bullet wounds and had nothing to do with the cause of death—I took charge of the four bullets until the inquest, I then handed them to Inspector Morgan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I speak positively to-day about the pistol not being in immediate contact with the body when the wound was caused, in consequence of some experiments which were performed since I gave my evidence before; that was in consultation with Mr. Boulby and Inspector Morgan; the shot might have been an inch off the body, it might have been half an inch, but my opinion is that it was about an inch—of course if the woman had it in her hand there was nothing to prevent her putting it in any position; but then I say it would not have been fired by accident—I don't think it would have been possible for the wound in the back to have been inflicted by accident—in a struggle supposing she was trying to tako it away from him I don't say it is utterly impossible; I say I don't think it possible—I don't think it possible that that wound could have been caused during a struggle, in the attempt to prevent him shooting himself; in my opinion, I should say it was impossible—I have only treated one bullet wound I betiere before this—if he fell with the pistol in his hand, I am quite prepared to say that the wound in the back could not have been caused in that way; the first thing that would happen would be the loss of power in the muscles of the hand, and the hand would go down by the side; sup<lb/>posing he had clutched the pistol in his hand, it was utterly impossible to have caused the wound there—I say it would be absolutely impossible while he had the pistol in his hand to have caused the wound in the back; of course if the pistol was propped up on the floor, and he fell with his back upon it, and at that moment it went off, it might have caused it—I have no experience of shot wounds in the heart—I have read of them; I don't remember reading of extraordinary positions of bodies on the battlefield; it may be common, but I don't know it—I have admitted that it was possible for either of the front wounds to have been self<lb/>inflicted; but if you take the three front wounds collectively, I don't think I could have admitted that—I have said that individually they might have been self-inflicted, but not collectively; I don't think the, three wounds could have been inflicted by himself—I don't think it possible, that is my opinion—I could not tell you which was the first wound—the wound that went through the heart was the last one in my opinion; of course if anybody else inflicted the wounds there is no telling which was the first, or which was the last; assuming they were self-inflicted, then I am of opinion that the heart-wound must have been the last wound—I think the wound in the back must have been caused before the heart-wound—there was as much hemorrhage as one would expect from a wound in that position; there was not much, but that wound did not wound any important structures or vessels, and therefore one would not expect to get much bleeding—I think there was quite as much blood on the shirt as one would expect to find—I deliberately say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412150067"/>
               <p>that—when I was first examined I declined to give an opinion as to whether the shirt was in immediate contact or not; I did not feel competent to give one—I had seen the three wounds in front before I had spoken to Mrs. Gibbons downstairs and I had formed an opinion previously that it was case of suioide—I was not positive about it—I was inclined to think it was suicide; the remark I made to my assistabt was "We shall see when we make the post-mortem"—I was inclined to think it was a case of suicide—at that time I was not aware of the wound at the back—I didn't find the wound in the back that night—I saw the revolver on the drawers that night in the room, not by the body—I have heard what Mrs. Sowman has stated in Court to-day about it, that it was partly under the man's body—there was a pool of blood on the carpet, unde rthe left shoulder where he lay; if Mrs. Sowman washed the body, she would necessarily have her hands covered with a deal Of blood; she was thdfe when I got there, but she had not washed the body then—I saw the smear before the body was washed; anybody that handled the body would get blood on their hands, not otherwise—a bloody hand or a bloody cloth touching the wall would cause the smear.</p>

If the pistol had been fixed firmly and the man fell upon it, the wound in the back might so be created, but it is very doubtful—I could not give an opinion—in my opinion if the three wounds in front were self-inflicted the heart wound was of such a serious character that death would occur so rapidly that he wounld be instabtly there and the incap<lb/>able of firing another shot—a bullet wound in the face which snfashed to atoms the upper jaw and buried itself in the deep structures of the neck, I don't say would deprive a man of consciousness; but it would give a considerable shock, and such a shock that it would be a question whether he could fire another shot then; the wound passed through important structures in the thorax—in the course of that bullet wound there was a hole in the subclavian artery, which is a very large vessel, and the hemorrhage in that wound was so great as to make us think that the hole in that artery was caused by a bullet; at the same time we cannot be sure; anyhow, the hemorrhage was so very considerable, and the shock from a wound like that would be so very great that having fired the two I do not think a man could put himself in the constrained position that would be necessary to fire that heart wound—the heart wound could not have been fired with the right hadn in any way—you could not get anything like round you to send a bullet in the direction in which this travelled unless you used the thumb—it would depent upon the direction in which the head was turned.</p>

               <p>pistol in either hand to have fired that shot and have caused that injury upon himself—the pistol could not possibly have been got into such a position to inflict that wound, so long as it was in the hand of the deceased himself—I have heard Mr. Parrott's description of the line in which the bullet traversed, from behind directly forward with the slightest degree of tendency upwards, but practically the direction of the wouud was for<lb/>wards; that would make it the more difficult for a man to do it—in course there would be no difficulty in anybody from behind firing it—in my judgment the heart wound must have caused death almost immediately—I should say the man would be absolutely dead within two minutes—the moment it was fired there would be a rush of blood from the heart—I believe it would be quite impossible after the infliction of such a wound for the man to hold a pistol and fire it off at himself—if he was standing up when such a wound was caused he would fall immediately—he could have inflicted it upon himself by holding the pistol in his left hand, but not with the right—with respect to the front upper wound Idon't think that the bullet went upwards; I think it went practically directly inwards, as if fired point blank from front backwards—I think the man could have done that himself with the pistol in either hand—that was a serious wound—there had been very extensive hemorrhage—it was evident that some large vessel had been injured—such a wound would produce a con<lb/>siderable amount of shock—it might not cause him to fall instantly—he wight possibly have physical power to hold the pistol and fire it again; it is highly improbable that he would be able to do so, but not absolutely impossible.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector X</hi>). At 9 on the morning of the 25th November I went to the prisoner's house—I found her there with her sister Mrs. Harrison, and Mrs. Sowman—I was then making inquiries, it was before the adjourned inquest was held—I did not then know the result of the post-mortem examination—I called on Mr. Parrott, he de<lb/>clined to give me full particulars, he was going to give evidence before the Coroner—when I called on the prisoner I first asked her if her husband had any cartridges left—she said "Yes," and told her sister to go to a certain drawer and fetch them—she did so, and handed to me in the prisoner's presence a box containing 16 cartridges—I produce some of them; some have been used, the pistol has not been used—I then examined the room, and behind the door about three feet from the ground and 18 inches from the post I saw a large smear of blood—from one to two feet from the floor I saw large spots of blood as if dropped downwards, they were immediately beneath the large smear—I questioned the prisoner and made a note of the conversation; she said "My husband loaded five chambers about a fortnight since; he said he only loaded fire because the stopper of the other was out of order; he fired one barrel about two days after to frighten the sparrows; I believe only four were left loaded; he bought the revolver about five yeara since of a Mr. Palmeter; Mrs. Markham washed the shirts with other things, she was not told to do so, she always did the washing; they were taken away on Sunday, the 16th. Cousin Mary is Mrs. Venn, of Fitzhead, near Taunton. My husband left home to go to London on business, and said he was going to Taunton from there. I asked to go with him, he said I could not go that day, but was to go another day. My husband's purse containing money, supposed notes and gold, is missing. He also took 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver that morning, that is missing. He is not insured. I have no children. I have been married 37 years last June. There was no person at all in the house exeept myself and husband. I believe four shots were fired; one shot was fired before I left the room. I heard the other three afterwards whilst rushing downstairs. I only had my nightdress on. The revolver was under the pillow nearest the door. I saw it there that afternoon. The door was open when we entered the room, and was left open; it had not been closed at all. I know nothing of the marks on the wall. The door was always left open for air. I was stood at the mantelshelf, that is immediately opposite the foot of the bed; there is a washing stand in front of it and the fireplace at the side I did not see him take the revolver from under the pillow. I first saw it in his hand, I believe the right hand. He was very excited. I have often heard him say he could not stand it any longer. I am not aware he was in any difficulties. When he hurt his head Mr. Parrott's assistant attended him. He banked at Uxbridge. I do not know how much money he had there. I did not know anything of his money affairs</p>

               <p>He always carried the spare cash with him. Everything is in the room now just as it was then. The doctors first moved the body. He did not speak at all. I put my arm under his head and tried to raise it before Mrs. Sowman came"—I read it over to her, she said "That is correct"—I asked her also if she had read in the newspaper her evidence before the Coroner; she said "Yes"—I asked her if she could and anything to that, she said "No"—that is all that passed then—I left her and did not take her into custody then—I afterwards attended the inquest, and after the medical evidence, and after the adjourned inquest on the 25th, I took her into custody—I told her I should arrest her for wilfully causing the death of her husband, James Gibbons, by shooting him in the head and body—she said "I did not do it, I am innocent"—I took her to the police-station—the charge was formally made there, and she repeated the statement "I did not do it"—I produce five bullets which I got from, Mr. Parrott—four were taken from the body, and one was found by Mrs. Harrison and given to Mr. Hathaway.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went to see the prisoner on 25th November I had read her statement made on oath before the Coroner—I did not go there with the intention of arresting her then—I had come from Paddington, where I am stationed, to inquire into a supposed suicide—I had a suspicion then that it was a case of murder—nearly all the prisoner's statement I have given was in answer to my questions—I suspected that the man had died from foul play—I did not suspect anybody elso but her—I asked her a gret number of question, every<lb/>thing I could think of, for the purpose of eliciting the truth—I did not put the questions for the purpose of eliciting answers which might confirm my suspicions as to her being a murderess—I had a suspicion that all was not as it should be—I put the questions for the purpose of confirming my suspicions or removing them, not exactly for the purpose of confirming them; her answers might have removed them or confirmed them—her answers did confirm my suspicions—I did not take her into custody then because my suspicion was not evidence; I had nothing definite to go upon besides the doctors evidence—I had seen Dr. Parrott before going on the 25th—he did not go into particulars; he told me partially the effect of his examination of the wounds—he did not go so far as to say whether he thought it was suicide or murder; fee thought it was not suicide—it was with that conversation in my mind that I put the questions to the prisoner—she gave her answers frankly, fairly and openly; she did not nesitate in answering any one of them—I think she volunteered some remarks which were not actual answers to questions—I cannot recollect what they were; some of them were lengthy answers—after I had tried the revolver I still had a suspicion that it was suicide, a slight suspicion, that was all—I am speaking of the Sunday, night, two days prior to my interview with her—the first thing that excited my suspicion was seeing the hole in the back of the skirts—I took the prisoner into custody at the inquest after the evidence had been, given—I had not actually charged her before she aigned Jier deposition, she was in another room—she did not hesitate a moment in signing her deposition, although she knew she was to be charged with murder.</p>

                  </hi>. In November I was housemaid in Captain Lockyer'a service—I had left in September, and gone back temporarily—on 10th Nov. the prisoner's wife had been in to work from 9 o'clock in the morning till about 3.30 in the afternoon, and again later, from 5 or 6 o'olock till 7—I saw her in the kitchen about 7 o'clock, when she left—I saw the prisoner in the kitchen And scullery during the day—I asked for some wood which was in the stable, he said he would bring it to me—I last saw him on the Monday, in the house, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he used to attend to the plants in the house—I locked the scullery-door and the back door about 7 o'clock—the scullery-door is at the back part of the premises, and leads into the garden—when I locked the scullery-door at 7 o'clock I left the key in the door—I was in and out of the scullery again later, getting some coals, about 9.30—I had to unlock the door to get them as the coal place is outside the scullery-door door, left the key in, and bolted the door—there is another side door downstairs, the one leading from the housemaid's closet, near the back staircase—that door is always kept locked—I went to bed about 10 o'clock—before that I had, as was part of my duty, put the plate away in the chiffonier drawer, in the dining-room—I was the last downstairs—when I went up to bed the house was all secure—after being upstairs some time I heard a knocking at my door, it was the nurse—my room was over the large kitchen, on the second floor—I got up, opened my door, and found the place full of smoke—I went upstairs and put the little boy, who had got out of bed in the excitement and was standing on the top of the stairs, in bed—I went to the window looking on to the back part of the premises, the garden, and called out "Wood! Wood! fire! fire! help!"—I called Wood by name because I thought he would be the nearest one to help us—shortly after I went downstairs, and saw Mrs. Lockyer on the stairs—I went to the front door, it was locked and all right, Mrs. Lockyer unlocked it—I followed her out of the front door to call for assistance, and Codling, Ryder, and Sorrell, came in and put out the fire, which was then alight in the cupboard under the back staircase; it had burnt part of the staircase—I did not see the fire when it was burning, I saw afterwards that there had been a fire there—there was also a fire under the front staircase, which I saw after it was put out—those fires were in two separate and distinct places—I did not see the prisoner till after the fire was put out—I then saw him in the passage—I did not speak to him at the time—afterwards Sergeant Merton came, and we went with Mrs. Lockyer into the dining-room—the drawers in the cheffonier were shut—I and Mrs. Lockyer opened them, and found the plate mjesing—the prisoner was there at that back of me at—the time—he helped me search in the cheffonier to see if the things were gone—when we found these things were missing he said "Will you look in the drawing-room, Annie?"—he did not say what for—I said "There is nothing of any value there"—as I was coming out of the door he said "Are you going to look in the drawing-room, Annie?"—I said "No, there is only china there; it would break, they would not take that"—I and Merton</p>

               <p>and Mrs. Lockyer went upstairs, and the prisoner remained down—later on, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I saw Merton in the kitchen; the prisoner wae there—I told the policeman that the prisoner had thought some wood from the scullery about 7 o'clock that night—the prisoner said "No, it was not, it was about half-pant 7"—I was npt the first down-stairs after the fire was discovered, Mrs. Kniblock was.</p>

I am single—I have been in Captain Lockyer's service for two and a half years—on the night of 10th November, about twenty to 11, I was sitting in the nursery and saw smoke coming through the boards of the room—I opened the door to see what was the matter, and found the staircase and landing full of smoke—I went to Blaney's room and knocked—I heard the crackling of wood—I then went down tat back staircase, there was a smell of smoke, and I saw flames coming from the cupboard under the front staircase—I went tp the scullery to get some water to put the fire out; the door leading from the scullery into the garden was open—the door of the cupboard under the front staircase in which the fire was, was a little open, and a box and some wool were burning—with the water from the scullery I put that fire, out—I I still heard a noise of crackling of fire somewhere—I went upstairs to give the alarm and came down again, followed by Mrs. Lockyer's sister—I went and looked at the cupboards under the back staircase—the staircases and cupboards are totally distinct—the door of that cupboard was open and paper was burning and the wood of the staircase catching fire—three men came in and I helped them to extinguish it, I could not do it all myself—I was the first person that came down.</p>

I am a bootmaker of Enfield Highway—on 10th November, about five minutes past 1, I was passing in the neigh<lb/>bourhood of Captain Lockyer's house—I heard screams coming from it—I jumped up on the wall and called two persons, Ryder and Sorrall, and we all went into the house by the front gate, Mrs. Lockyer was in the front garden, we saw some fire burning in the cupboard in the back stair-case, and helped to put it out—after that, at Mrs. Lockyer's. suggestion, I went to Mrs. Lockyer's cottage—I knocked at the door, the prisoner came down in about half a minute, he was very nearly fully dressed—I think he had everything on but his coat—he had his boots, collar, tie, and hat on I think; he asked me what was up, I said "Come along, the house is on fire," he said "Good God"—we both went baok to the house together; the prisoner's bedroom window looks into the yard—I don't know which room he sleeps in, by opening a window you can see the house, not without—I should think I was about the same distance from</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Inspector</hi>). I am stationed at Enfield—on 11th November about 9.15 a.m. from information I received I went to the officers' quarters—I found Sergeant Keen, and with him made a search of the premises; we examined the cupboard with a door to it under the front staircase; we found the inside charred and burnt, and the stairoue burnt; I examined the cupboard under the back staircase, that had a door to it, that was considerably damaged by burning, much more bo than the other ones; three or four of the stairs were actually burnt—the shelves were very much burnt; the top was charred and the paint blackened, and the ceiling of the passage blackened—the premises them<lb/>selves are entirely surrounded by a brick wall, with the exception of the wooden entrance door—the gardener's cottage is in the grounds, and there is a path from it to the back of the premises; the prisoner's bedroom looks over the yard towards the house—you would have to look out of the window and turn to the left to see the house—the distance from the prisoner's cottage to the scullery door is fifty-six yards—after searching through the inside of the house I left Keen there, and went away for a short time, about half en hour; and then in company with the prisoner proceeded to look round the outer premises and search the outbuildings—I continued to search till about 1 o'clock, and Keen in the prisoners presence called my attention to a bag about three and a half feet under the floor of a moveable shed in the stable yard, about seven or eight yards from the entrance door to the prisoner's cottage—the floor of the shed was about ten inches from the ground; the shed looks like a shepherd's hut on wheels; the bag was between the ground and the hut, it was four feet under, Keen had a stick and could not get it with that—I had to go down on my knees—the prisoner fetched a rake at my request—I got it out—before it was taken out Keen said "There is a bag here and something in it," the prisoner replied "It is full too;" the prisoner at that time was standing whert he certainly could not see the bag—I could not see it, and he was standing by my side—I could not see it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188412150077"/>
               <p>till I went on my knees, I am positive of that—I had previously searched under the same shed, some two hours before, by stooping down and looking; it must have been there then, but I was looking at the front that time, Keen was looking at the side—Keen turned round to the prisoner, looked at him and said "How do you know that? you oan't see it"—I was at the front of the shed on my knees—I could not see it—I and Keen took the baff to Captain Lockyer's house, went to the kitchen, we met Mrs. Lockyer just outside the back door, and in the prisoner's presence told her we had found the bag and showed it to her; the bag contained all the lost property, more than had previously been described to us—Mrs. Lockyer said in the prisoner's presence "I know the bag, I have seen it dozens of times; don't you know it, gardener?"—he said "No, I have never seen it"—I found no trace whatever of any breaking into the house.</p>

I am manager to the Alliance Advance and Discount Company, 2, Leman Street, Whiteehapel—in September the prsoner came alone to my office and said "My name is Charles Bone, I live at 23, Gosport Road, Walthamstow"—he required the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "I have plenty of security there, in fact there is one piano worth mow than double what I wish to borrow"—he further said a Mr. Ashton would also sign with him as surety—I did not ask for a surety—I asked him how long he had been living there and whether he was the house-holder there—he said "Yes," and he had been living there something like 12 months—we arranged the terms and that I was to go and the house—I called at 23, Gosport Road on 3rd September, the next day; a lady appeared at the door, she gave her name as Mrs. Bone—I have</p>

               <p>seen her here—she showed me over the lower part of the house—there was furniture and a piano there—she showed me receipts in the name of Bone for the piano and other furniture on the premises, and the, rent-book was produced—I saw nothing of Hartnell—I saw a gold wateh and chain on the table in the parlour—I was satisfied with what I saw, went back to the office, and reported to Mr. Isaac Brand, my brother, what I had seen—the next day, tne 4th, the prisoner came to the office with Mr. Ashton—this warrant of attorney was signed and executed by the prisoner in my presence in the name of C. Bone, I saw him sign "C. Bene"—Ashton also executed it in my presence—it was a warrant of attorey authorising me to issue execution in default of payment of instalments—Mr. Dobson, the solicitor acting for the prisoner and Ashton at that time, was present; the warrant of attorney was completed at his office—before it was signed it was thoroughly explained to them and handed to them to read, and it was distinctly given them to understand that if there was any default in the payments we had power to sign judgment against them and issue execution—I then advanced the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the prisoner took it up and they both went away together—I lent him the money seing that he seemed to be a householder and to have a beautiful house of furniture, and that everything seemed new; I believed him to be Charlds Bone—five instalments were paid, making together 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by the prisoner, I could not say if he paid personally—the instalments were payable weekly—he then went three weeks in arrear, and iq accordance with my warrant of attorney I signed judgment and issued execution, which was put in to 23, Gosport Road and withdrawn ia consequence of what I heard—I have not had the rest of the money.</p>

Ashton got a loan of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he made a default in paying it back—I issued execution against him—legal proceedings took place between us, and the Judge held that the warrant of attorney in Ashton's case was illegal on account of a technicality, as the Act requires that a solicitor, not for the lender, should be present and explain the document—that was after I had issued execu<lb/>tion against the prisoner—Mr. Ashton has not paid me back—when the prisoner called after the execution was put in, he said "Cannot we get matters settled to withdraw the execution?"—I said I declined to interfere—he did not indicate in any way that he was ilot Charles Bone—he did not say that Bone was trying to get a warrant against him for forgery—Ashton brought another person as surety for himself.</p>

About 11.30 on 27th October I was in Tottenham Court Boad, and heard cries of murder and police—I went to Hanway Street, and found the prisoner on the pavement bleeding from a wound on his head, and Alfred Brown showed me a stab on his arm, and said in the prisoner's hearing that he had stabbed him—William Pollard, the deceased, was lying in the road a short distance off, with a wound in his side and insensible—I took the prisoner to the station, and he was charged with stabbing Pollard; he said at first that he was innocent, he afterwards said "The men used a knife on me, and not me on them"—I looked for a knife, but could not find one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say that to the Magistrate—the prisoner appeared to be insensible—some time must have elapsed from the time the struggle took place till I got there, and he had the chance of getting rid of the knife—ne was lying in Hanway Street, near the picture shop, where there is a bend in the street on the right-hand side, at the corner of John Street, and under the lamp; there was a great deal of blood on him, but I did not see it coming from his head—when I got to the station I found he had been bleeding a good deal—I may have said "I did not see the prisoner put his hand in any one else's—I did not see any female, or any one come up, I except Mrs. Edith Brown—I did not see him pass a knife to anybody.</p>

I am house surgeon at Middlesex Hospital—William Pollard was brought in at 12.10—his clothes were with blood—he had a punctured wound on the left breast, cutting through the nipple—I attended him till November 12th, when he died—I made a post-mortem examination—the wound was three inches long, and ex<lb/>tended through the fourth and fifth rib cartilage, and penetrated the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not examine the prisoner—my opinion before the post-mortem was that the wound was caused by a blunt instrument, bat now my opinion is that it was a sharp instrument, because the cuts in the cartilages were clean—the laceration might have been done by the hilt of the knife, Supposing it to have been well driven home—the laceration was in the skin wound—the track of the wound was three inches long, obliquely downwards, and to the left—I have had much experience in wounds—I do not think it possible that the wound could have been caused by a blunt instrument.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 27th October, about 11.30, I was on duty at Tottenham Court Road Station, when the prisoner was brought in—I asked the constable what he was charged with; he said "Stabbing two men"—the prisoner said "The villains used the knife on me, not me on them"—I told him I should go to the hospital and see the result of the injuries, and if the man was dead he would be charged with murder—he had a cut on his head—I went to the hospital, and saw Pollard—Brown had had his arm dressed—I went back to the station with Mr. and Mrs. Brown, and told the prisoner the man who was stabbed was not dead, and the charge was wounding William Pollard and Alfred Brown with intent to do grievous bodily harm—he said "I did not stab them"—I sent for Edwin Pollard, and saw a bruise on his cheek; the flesh was discoloured—he told me how it was done, and I then charged the prisoner with assaulting Edwin Pollard, and biting him on the cheek—he made a statement, which was taken down in the rough-book—I read it to him—he said it was right—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Edwin Pollard, Mrs. Blanchelt's, King's Arms. The disturbance was in the public-house. He was insulting to the publican's wife, and the wife said she would put him out. He then used abusive language, and she called a man named George, and he saw the boy on a seat crying, and mentioned about this Mend doing something to him. I then told him to dry up his tears for hia sorrows. Prosecutor, Edward Pollard, stood up in the bar, and looked across to see who it was speaking. I passed the remark, I am here,' no sooner I did so the prosecutor and his brother rushed round to the door where I was. Before I could get out for self-defence the two of</p>

               <p>them was in at me, the prosecutor, the boy I bit, his brother I struck. We were then turned out of the bar by the landlord or his assistant. A lady rushed up and caught my hand, and said it was her husband. I followed him up to shake hands and be friends, and before I could do so he struck me a second time, and while striking me the two men rushed on me in white shirt sleeves, and prosecutor, the boy, kicked me, and at the mob came round I found something sharp go into my head, and as I was falling to the ground the prosecutor's boy was kicking me, and the young woman that was with me came between and got the blow, and screamed 'Murder!' and brought assistance. I then walked away, and got within 50 yards of Tottenham Court Road. Two policemen picked me up, and brought me to the station." I was present before the Magistrate, and heard Mr. Hudson, the surgeon, give his evidence—the prisoner had the opportunity of putting any questions to him—I have been trying, with the assistance of policemen, to find Mob Griffin, but was unsuccessful.</p>

On the night of Monday, 27th October, about midnight, a man named Alfred Brown was brought to the hospital suffering from a wound on the arm (left). The wound was a punctured one.

The wound was two inches and a half in depth, and the orifice was very small in comparison with the depth of the wound. I have seen the man, William Pollard, in the hospital to-day.

I am assistant wharfinger to the London and St. Katherine Dock Company, and am in charge of the export department Victoria Docks, including the E and G jetty sheds—I know the prisoner in the Company's service as George Wright—on the morning of the 29th September he was assistant shed-man at the E shed; it was his duty to receive goods from trucks and vans as they were brought in—on the following day he was employed at the G shed; it was his duty to re<lb/>ceive goods and take care of them in the shed—on the 29th September some quarter cases of tobacco were received from the tobacco department and placed in the E shed for shipment—they remained there till October 10th, when they had been delivered to a cart, and my attention was called to two of the cases which appeared to have been opened and re-nailed; they were iron-bound—I had them opened and weighed—each should have contained eight boxes of tobacco and weighed 22lb. net—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample box—six boxes and their contents had been taken out of one case, and a bag of nails and pieces of wood put in their place, and out of the other case the contents of two boxes had been taken, but not the boxes themselves, and a piece of sheet lead substituted—the tobacco taken weighed 1671b.</p>

On the evening of 4th November I was in the Greycoat public-house—I saw Murphy and Daley and Bland there, and two men besides—I heard them talking rather loudly, and I heard one say to the other, "We will go out and fight," and they went into Crumbie'd field opposite, in Straightsmouth; turning out of it—there were six with Mr. Bland—when they got there they were scuffling—I did not see what was done—they got up and laughed, and five went away and I saw no more of them—Bland quickly got up after them—when the five went away he was lying on the ground in tho field, about five yards from Mr. Crumbie's house.</p>

On 5th November, about 9 o'clock, I was outside Greenwich Church—Bland made a complaint to me, and I went with the last witness to the Mitre public-bouse, where I met Murphy and Woodley—Bland said, "There are two of the men that robbed me"—pointing to Woodley he said, "That man was one that held me," and pointing to Murphy, "That one put his hand in my pocket and took the money out"—I told Murphy I should take him into custody—he said, "I know nothing about his money, what is the use of taking notice of a madman?"—I took him to the station—on Murphy I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze.</p>

I am a wheelwright, of 108, St. George's Road, Peckham—on Sunday morning, 2nd November, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, I was in the Albany Road—I met the prisoner there—I asked him if he knew anything of a photograph of myself and the young woman I kept company with—he said he did, and he made use of abusive language and took off his belt and struck me with it, and I hit him in the face and he fell down—he said he would get some one to pay me, and he got up and walked in the road—he then ran at me, closed with me, and I discovered that I was stabbed in the back—I fancy I saw him with a knife before that, but I am not sure—I was taken to Dr. Oakfield, he</p>

I am second officer in command of the fire brigade, and am an engineer by profession—Bawden was in the service of the brigade up to 20th September, when he resigned—since 1882 until he left the brigade he was senior of three men in the hose depart<lb/>ment, and as such would have charge of everything kept in that room, and he would be responsible for these articles to his officer in charge—he would have access to all those articles which were found in his pos<lb/>session in the hose room, and he would draw those articles as he required them—I knew nothing whatever of Black till these proceedings—this leather branch I believe to be the property of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—I have seen similar branches at the Paddington workhouse, and I believe they are the property of the brigade—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a length of air tube belonging to a smoke jacket belonging to the brigade and this is a connecting piece belonging to the air tube—it is marked No. 5; that is the number of one of our stations—it is the custom of the brigade to mark articles with the number of the station to which they</p>

F. B."—connecting pieces are sent in by the contractor before they are tied to the leather branch to see if they are correct—having been approved, they go back to the contractor after having been marked—we sometimes lend patterns on a proper request to other contractors, not to private persons—I can't recall any instance of our patterns being lent to a fire brigade, but we should do so on a proper request—we always endeavour to oblige people as much as we can—we did not lend any appliances to Captain Sutton—I think</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the hose department of Shand and Mason—I went to the Paddington Workhouse last Friday week, and there inspected eight leather branches, three indoors and five out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, the other seven were like it—I cut them out, marked them, fitted them up, and superintended the finishing of them on behalf of my employers for the Metropolitan Board of Works—there were two 25's maae and supplied to the brigade, which they accepted—one lot was made before, they were rejected on account of the leather, and there was another lot rejected, this is a portion of that which they accepted—I didn't put the name of the firm on the branches, but on the fittings—I can't see any name on this now, but there is the place where no doubt the name has been orased by a file—I can't see any letter, my eyes are not so good as they were—I cut out this leather myself, I am sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Bawden.</hi> The branch is not made quite according to the Fire Brigade pattern—I had a pattern to make it by, the leather is cut by a knife, not by a machine, they are made out of the prime parts of the hide.</p>

I am a physician and surgeon, of Clifton House, Battersea Park—between 4 and 5 o'clock on the morning of 28th September I was sent for to 48, Bullen Street—I had been out attending a lady, and I sent my assistant, and received a report from him when he came back, and while going my rounds, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day, I called at 48, Bullen Street, and found the prisoner in bed—I asked him what had been the matter with him—he said "I do not know, I think I must have had a fit, as the last thing I recollect was being at the top of the street at midnight until I was carried in this morning about 4 o'clock"—there was a young woman in the room—I asked them both what had been the matter; she said that she thought it was a fit of lock-jaw, as he was unable to open his mouth, and his limbs were stiff—I asked him if he had met with any accident—he replied "No"—I then asked him if he had been drinking—he said he had had two pints of beer the night previous—I then put the question to him "And how much before during the day?"—he said "I don't know; I have not been drinking"—I made a further examination of his pulse and tongue, and after that I said to him that if he had had a fit at all it had been one of drinking—I told the young woman to continue the medicine my assistant had prescribed, and then left him—from what I saw I considered that he was suffering from the after effects of drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had communicated with Mr. Lenane between his and my seeing the prisoner—I have heard his evidence to-day—the prisoner stated that he remembered nothing after about 12 o'clock, and that he imagined he must have had a fit—I heard Mrs. Pate's evidence as to the condition in which he was found; those and the appearances Mr. Lenane has described are compatible with the occurrence of a fit, they are not indicative of it—I should say the character of the fit was one of drinking—they are compatible with other fits—it is possible he had a fit of hysteria or a fainting fit or hysterical fit—my attention was sot called to the blow on the head, Mr. Lenane did not mention it to me.</p>

I live at 46, Stanmore Street, Battersea Park Road, and am the wife of Charles Roberts—I went before the Magistrate, but was not called as a witness—in March and April last I let a first floor front room to Florence Kemp—she told me she was engaged—she took a furnished room there at five shillings a week—the prisoner next day came to see her—I afterwards knew him as barman at the Latchmere public-house—she used to go to her work while living there—I remember</p>
