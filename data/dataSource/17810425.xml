My house was broke open in the night of the 30th or 31st of March; I heard nothing of it till I was called up at a little after eight o'clock; I then came down stairs: I found the upper sash of the kitchen window was forced down; and it was so fast that it could not be got up again without sending for a carpenter; the window had an inside shutter, to which there was a slight wooden bar; a pane of glass was broke in the window, which enabled the person to undo the bar. I lost the plate mentioned in the indictment from the sideboard in the back-parlour; I found this odd stocking (producing it) in the drawer of my dressing-room, which is the place where my stockings are always kept; I understand the fellow stocking to this was found in the prisoner's lodging-room.</p>

               <p>I have here three pair of silk and one pair of cotton stockings, and an odd silk stocking (producing them); I found them, on Sunday the 1st of April, in a room up two pair of stairs forward at No. 5, in Coventry-court in the Haymarket; they were all in a cupboard, except the odd stocking, which lay on the floor; I asked the prisoner who they belonged to: he said they were his property, and he begged I would leave them behind.</p>
               <p>What was your business at this place? - There was an information came to the office against the prisoner and some others: I knocked at the door at about eight o'clock in the morning, and was let in; I went up to the two pair of stairs, I knocked at the door; a girl in her shift and under petticoat opened the door to me; I went into that room, and from thence into the back-room; there I found the prisoner a-bed: when the prisoner begged me to leave them behind, I told him I should take the stockings away, and if they were not owned he should have them back again: he was asked before the justice, where he got these things? he said he bought them of a Jew in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Are there different lodgers in this house? - There was only a woman with a child in the garret. I searched the rest of the house, but did not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the room besides the prisoner? - Only the girl that opened the door to me.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in the room in which the stockings were found? - There was no bed in the fore-room; the bed was in the back-room.</p>
               <p>Did you find the room forward open or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250004"/> locked? - It was locked. The woman that was with him opened the fore-door, and then I went into the back-room, where the bed was; I made the prisoner get up, and come into the fore-room to dress himself. The back-room opens only into the fore-room; there is not, to my knowledge, any door from the back-room to the staircase.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodgate. This odd stocking I saw at the justice's, and it matches exactly with the stocking I have in my pocket; they are both marked with the initial of my name, W.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose work the mark is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear to the stocking? - Yes, and the other stockings too; they have been tumbling about my drawer these seven years; the other stockings are likewise marked, W; I am perfectly satisfied they are mine.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your plate? - No; I never found any thing but these stockings.</p>

            : she took the lodging of me on the Thursday afternoon; she came in on the Thursday evening, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did she come alone? - I do not know; my servant let her in; I did not then see her.</p>
               <p>You saw her on the Friday? - Yes; she came down into the kitchen to ask for such things as she wanted.</p>
               <p>Did you see any person with her? - No.</p>
               <p>Jones, the prisoner, was found in the room on the Sunday morning? - Yes, so I find; but I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that the prisoner was in the house before that Sunday? - I never saw him before. Hunter said she had an husband, or some acquaintance, who was a silversmith or something, I don't know what she called him; but I never saw the prisoner till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did you know that any man was in that room? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You know nothing about these stockings? - I saw them when they were taken out of the place, I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>And upon your oath you never saw the prisoner before? - Never till the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I had a pair of stockings lying about the room: when he took the stockings up, I thought they were my own; but as to these other stockings, I know nothing of them: what I might say in my fright I cannot tell; but the lodging does not belong to me.</p>

               <p>Jealous. He said before the justice, he bought the stockings of a Jew; Mr. Woodgate heard him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Woodgate. Did you hear that? - I did.</p>
               <p>To Jealous. When did he say he bought them? - On the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been to sea. I was an attorney's clerk. I was going down the Haymarket; this woman asked me to go home with her; I went home with her, and slept with her; in the morning Jealous came up, put a pistol to my head, and took me out of bed: I said I was ready to go with him. He searched the room, and brought these stockings out of the cupboard; I said, do not take any thing there, for they may be my stockings.</p>

I went to the gentleman's house, but I could not see him; so I brought the money back, and put it into a cupboard in my bed-room, about ten o'clock at night, just before I went to bed. The prisoner slept in the same room; but he did not come into the room that night, till after I had locked up the money, and had got into bed. When I got up the next morning, about nine o'clock, I looked into the cupboard, and saw the paper lying there, in which the money was wrapped up, just to appearance as I had left it over night; but I did not open the paper. The prisoner was in bed at that time; but he was awake, and saw me look into the cupboard. I went out to fetch some bread for my breakfast; when I came back, which was in about ten minutes, both the prisoner and the money were gone: he got up before I went out. He was taken on the Monday after, in a public house; he was very drunk: he had bought himself some new clothes, which he had on; and he had two guineas and some shillings in his pocket.</p>

I was at home when Boardman went out to get some bread: he left the prisoner in his bed-room: after he was gone, I heard the prisoner walking about the room, and then I heard him go down stairs; Boardman came in just after he went out. As soon as Boardman had been up in his room, he came down, and told me he had lost his money. On the day before, the Friday, the prisoner came down to me, and said, When I have got money and victuals enough, I cannot eat; but now I have got neither money nor victuals, I am d - d hungry.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner? - He draws draughts for gentlemen, and throws water up out of a coal-pit. His father does that; but I believe the prisoner only grinds colours, and does such things. The prisoner had lodged with me about two months.</p>

               <p>The money I bought the clothes with, and what I had about me, I received for the plans I have in my hand. The day I went from my lodging, I was obliged to go to Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire. I sent a letter to my landlord, that I should be back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250006"/> in a few days. I had before left my lodging, and had sent a similar letter to my landlord, and returned at the time stated in the letter. I often borrowed halfpence and silver; not because I had not money, but because I did not like to break my gold. My witnesses are not here, because I did not expect my trial to come on so soon. Will your Lordship indulge me so far as to ask Mr. Davis how I behaved whilst I was in his house?</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Emery. I was at the parlour-door; the prisoner came into the shop; it was a little before eight o'clock in the morning; the parlour is facing the shop; there was nobody in the shop at the time, except another man with the prisoner; I saw him take a watch off the hook at the window; I said, My God! he is taking some watches! he made to the door to go out; I followed him.</p>
               <p>Does the shop-door open into a passage? - No; it opens immediately into the shop, only there is a little partition in the shop to break off the wind: when the prisoner went out, I immediately followed him.</p>
               <p>What became of the other? - He stood at the door: I cannot say whether he went into the shop or no, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner that went into the shop? - Yes; for I had hold of his coat while he was taking the watch off the hook. When I came to the parlour-door, I made up to him; and when he got to take hold of the watch, I laid hold of his coat pocket, and said what I mentioned; he went out.</p>
               <p>How did he get from you? - I can't be sure whether I had hold of him then or no; I cried out, That man has stole some watches! he ran as fast as he could; when he got off the pavement a little way, I saw him drop a watch; a person picked it up, and gave it to me; I cried out, Stop thief! he was pursued, taken, and brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that the man that was brought back, was the same you saw take the watch? - Yes; this is the watch (producing it) that was picked up, and given to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This watch was in my shop: I had it left to repair.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether you did not say the man that took the watch, had an apron on? - I never said any thing about an apron; but when he first came into the shop, I thought he had been one of my master's workmen.</p>

I cried, Stop thief! but could not catch him; I saw him drop the watch just now produced, in the road; I thought, as he had dropped the watch, he had got no more, and I did not pursue him immediately; but he still kept running on; that rather gave me a suspicion that he might have more; I pursued him; he crossed over towards Mr. Nicholson's, and going upon the flag pavement, his foot slipped, and he was near falling down; he then crossed over towards Mr. Pinchbeck's, in Cockspur-street; I followed him then, and in St. Alban's street he stopped of his own accord; when I came up, he said, Who did you call stop thief after? I said, to you; I saw you steal the watches: I catched hold of his collar; he put himself in a posture of defence, and said, If you offer to stop me, I will cut or knock you down: I catched him by the collar, and brought him back to Mr. Emery's.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop with another person who was an old acquaintance of mine; she was going to buy some china for her mistress; she thought I was a better judge of it than herself, as I had been the mother of children: the young woman asked 7 s. for half a dozen cups and saucers; I said I thought it was too much: she said she would go home and tell her mistress the price. I asked to go backwards. I went into the parlour with this woman to write the direction; after I had wrote the note, I came out into the shop: we came out of the door: the person with me said she saw a gentleman pass that was a good friend of hers; she ran after him, and spoke to him; we ran together; I heard the cry of Stop thief! when this gentleman stopped me, he said, I believe you are the thief; I said, I do not know what you mean; if any thing is lost, pursue that young woman, as she has run away: then the gentleman let me go, and ran after the young woman; but whether he catched her or not I do not know. I put an advertisement in the paper, but could never find out the gentleman. I never knew her guilty of any thing of this sort before, if she is guilty now. I am above five months gone with child.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutrix. You found at Mr. Clark's the linen gown, the Marseilles petticoat, and the black silk cloak? - Yes. The gown and petticoat were the property of a young woman going into the country to service, her name is Smith; I delivered them to her after a certain time, the justice ordered me.</p>
               <p>Who did the cloak belong to? - It was mine: it was but an old one, and I did not bring it: the cloak had a D marked upon it; it was my own marking; I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>I keep a broker's shop at Islington, a few doors from this woman's house. I wanted a single curtain to match some chairs; I bought this of Mrs. Mills; I never saw it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250011"/> till I had paid two guineas and a half for it; it was a pig in a poke; I found the right owner, and he had it; she had it a week in her possession before I had it of her.</p>
               <p>She says you employed her to buy it of the person? - No such thing; I went to ask her for it; she said, more than that, after the woman had bought it, tell the woman now she has given two guineas and a half, it is worth 5 l.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was Mr. Pitt's? - I saw it advertised; and I went immediately and let him know of it.</p>
               <p>To Mills. You said that Mrs. Graham desired you to buy it for her? - The prisoner offered to sell me a curtain; I said it did not suit me. Mrs. Graham found he had been to me to sell it, and as I did not want it, she desired I would buy it for her; he would not sell it to her, she knew, so I laid out my own money to serve the prisoner, and to serve Mrs. Graham: she never came near me; he came to me on the Friday following, and asked if she had come for it; I said, no; he bid me not let her have it under two guineas and a half; she sent this cook's-shop woman for the curtain, and brought me two guineas and a half, and I sent the curtain by the woman.</p>
               <p>What time of the Monday did she come for the curtain? - I think between eight and nine at night: she read the advertisement, and sent for the curtain. I was to account to him for the two guineas and a half when I sold the curtain.</p>
               <p>You had not bought it of him, but given him 17 s. and he ordered you not to sell it under two guineas and a half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Graham. You had read the Daily Advertiser before you bought the curtain? - No; I had not; I was going to cut the curtain up, as it answered the purpose I wanted it for. My daughter said, O mother, don't cut it up, it is advertised.</p>

What reason had you to say she had read the advertisement? - Several of the neighbours in the One Tun heard her read that advertisement, and she said she had found a thing worth five guineas, and went to this cook's-shop woman, and desired her to buy the curtain for her, but said, Don't say it is for me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the King of Prussia's Head, Islington-Road. The prisoner brought the curtain to me about the latter end of February, and asked me if I wanted to buy one; I said, no: he wanted me to shew it to my wife; she was busy; he said he gave two guineas for it and some other things at a sale; I said he might leave it for her to see it, and I would give him a guinea; he did; he came in two or three days; my wife did not want it; he paid the guinea, and took it away; that was about four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Three years: he is a broker: he always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am a broker. I wanted to buy a jack; he had two in the sale; I saw they would not do; I left the sale, and went about some other business: some time after, going to Islington (Molding's is a house I generally call at) there was a woman in the room facing the street had some things to sell, wearing apparel, and this curtain; she asked me a guinea and a half for it; at last we agreed for 22 s. I asking Mold ing to lend me a guinea, he did, and I left the curtain with him; I called on a Mr. Brown; he went with me; I called for the curtain; he looked at it, and bid me 18 s. for it: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250012"/> next day I called upon Mrs. Mills, and I sold it to her for 1 l. 6 s. 6 d. about a fortnight after that I was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>To Molding. Did he buy the curtain of the woman at your house? - Not to my knowledge; I was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his borrowing a guinea of you to pay for it? - He borrowed a guinea in the way I mentioned: he brought it to the bar.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the man coming to your house with him? - Yes; about two days after.</p>
               <p>What did he offer him for it? - I think 16 s. or 17 s.</p>
               <p>Was there a woman in the house at the time he brought the curtain to you? - I do not know; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come in? - I do not know that I did; he might be in before I saw him.</p>

               <p>Mr. GRIFFENHOOFE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed on the 8th of March, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, in the road going from Hanworth to <placeName id="t17810425-9-crimeloc42">Hounslow</placeName>

Upon the heath I saw two men; one with a blue coat, a round hat, his own brown hair, or wig, mounted upon a dark brown horse, or mare, with a switch tail; the other was a lustier man, with a brown great coat, round hat likewise, and a brown wig, or hair, mounted upon a lighter brown horse, with a bald face remarkably white from his ears down to his nose: when I came within a few yards of them, they parted on each side; I was in a one-horse chaise; they bid me stop, and demanded my money; I think they both spoke together at the same time; the man in the blue coat told me they did not intend to use me ill, but they must have my money; I gave the man in the brown coat two guineas; he said, I had plenty of money, and he desired the man in the blue coat to search me; I then gave him the rest of the money I had, making in the whole five guineas and an half, and some silver; I told them that was all the money I had; then the man in the brown coat said I had a pocketbook; I told him I had none; he said I had, and he desired the man in the blue coat to search my pockets; the man in the blue coat stroked down on each side of my waistcoat; he then took out this box, a salvatory, from my pocket; I said it wou'd be of no use to him; he then said, your watch; I gave him my watch, which was a silver one; then the young man in the blue coat said, be was sorry they were under a necessity of taking my money, wished me a good morning, and said I might drive on; then I went away.</p>
               <p>Then by your account the man in the blue coat behaved with great civility? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe either of them, so as to be able to know their person or face again? - Yes; one I was positive of, the man in the blue coat; the other, when I saw him again, he had left his brown coat behind him, and his hair was powdered, which it was not when he robbed me; therefore I could not positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Then it was rather from your observation of the dress than the face that you knew the other? - I was certain to the other from his face; I had a better opportunity of observing his features, because he searched my pocket, and took out my salvatory.</p>

               <p>How long after the robbery was it before you saw these men again? - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250013"/> the men till the next day at Bow-street?</p>
               <p>Which is the man that had the blue coat? - King.</p>
               <p>When you saw them again at Bow-street, had you any doubt that King was one of the men? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt now? - I am sorry to say that I have not.</p>
               <p>Are you equally certain as to the other? - The other had a great coat on when I was robbed.</p>
               <p>You are not equally certain to him? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe him to be the other man? - I do, from his hat and from his voice.</p>
               <p>Were you present at the examination of the prisoners at the office? - They were brought there for me to see them.</p>
               <p>Did you hear them give any account of themselves there? - Not much; I don't recollect any thing particular: they did not confess any part of the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Whoever they were, they spoke to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did one or both of them desire you not to be alarmed? - Only the man in the blue coat, King, told me they did not mean to use me ill; but they must have my money:</p>
               <p>Afterwards he lamented that necessity obliged them to it? - After I had given them every thing I had, he very politely said he was sorry, but necessity obliged them to take my money; then he wished me a good morning, and bid me drive on.</p>

               <p>I went out in the morning on the 8th of March; coming home, I saw the prosecutor stopped between eleven and twelve o'clock; he was in a one-horse chaise, I was on foot: I suppose I was about 100 yards distance; he was coming into Hounslow, I was coming the same way; I was upon the greensward, opposite the chaise.</p>
               <p>Who stopped the chaise? - I saw two men, one upon each side the chaise; I saw one of them put his hand to Mr. Griffenhoose.</p>

               <p>You pursued in company with Bordman? - I did; we had a written description of the people we were to pursue. After going through Hampton-Court and other places the boy directed us, we met the two prisoners, riding slowly; I asked them if they had met two men riding fast; they said, no; the boy said they were, by the description, the two men; I then seized King by the collar; he told me he was a gentleman, and I should take care of what I did.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In second mourning: the other man rode off.</p>

               <p>He made no resistance? - No: I asked him if he had any fire-arms; he said, no: I took this pistol out of his inside pocket (producing an horse-pistol.)</p>

               <p>I went with the two soldiers to direct them the road. We met with those two men between Isleworth and Twickenham; by the descriptions the gentleman gave, I thought they were the two highwaymen; I told the soldiers so; one of the soldiers rode up to the one of them, and said, You are my prisoner; he was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, and had a deep round hat on: I rode up to the other man to take hold of him, but he struck me, and rode away.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a brown coat, and had a round hat: I immediately rode after him; he turned up a lane; I went to go by him, he struck at me, the horse leaped round, so I saved the blow, and got before him; he turned, and rode away another road; I turned my horse, and rode after him; when I came up to him, a gentleman and he were fighting with their sticks.</p>
               <p>Did he ever get out of your sight? - No: I was close to him all the way: he got away again, and I followed him; just after that, I saw him throw the pistol away into a hedge in a lane between the Royal Oak at Isleworth and Twickenham; I told the gentleman of it; he got off his horse to pick it up, but could not find it; then he mounted his horse again, and rode after the prisoner, and the prisoner was taken between Isleworth pound and the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of your sight, from the time he rode off first till he was taken? - No; he was in my sight all the time.</p>
               <p>Who assisted you in taking him? - A serjeant happened to be in the George yard at Isleworth; I called out, a highwayman! the serjeant mounted his horse, rode after him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Was the man whom you and the serjeant took either of the prisoners? - Yes; that man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Was he the same man you met first in company with King? - I am sure he is: the serjeant bid me mind that he did not do any thing; I perceived him putting some money into his boot, or his stocking; I saw his boot, or his stocking, taken off afterwards, and there were four guineas and a half found in it.</p>
               <p>Any silver? - No.</p>

               <p>I joined this lad in pursuit of a highwayman, as he told me; I came up with him; I rode before him; I had my sword drawn; I told him if he did not pull up, I would cut him down; he said, he would, and desired I would not use him ill; I then bid him drop his reins, which he did; I bid the boy watch him; I took him to the George; in a few minutes the other was brought in; when they came in, they seemed to be strangers to each other. When the headborough came, he searched Sheering; he found a guinea and some silver upon him; I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you find any arms upon him? - Not any.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor, when we were brought up to the office in Bow-street, said that the two men that committed the robbery had the appearance to him of father and son returning from some fair; he supposed them to be graziers, father and son: the soldier that rode up to me desired to know if I had seen two persons pass that way; we were going over Richmond-bridge, which was the road the robbery was committed on; if I had been guilty of the crime, self-preservation would have taught me to have taken a different path from that where the robbery was committed; they asked me if I had seen two men pass, for a robbery had been committed; I said I had seen only one pass, and that lately; the boy came up, and said, This gentleman is dressed in blue, and the description of the person that committed the robbery was, that he was in blue; the soldiers came up to me; I said he need not collar me, I would go any where with him; they found a pistol upon me, which I was going to get repaired; they searched me, and found nothing else upon me.</p>

I asked Lee how he came by them, and he told me he bought them of two men, and mentioned their names. I enquired respecting Lee, and found he had lived in the house twenty years, and had a good character. On the Friday following, Lee apprehended the prisoner; he was taken before Justice Girdler; I asked where he was on the Sunday, the day before I lost my fowls; he told me on the Sunday morning he was at Silbourne in Kent, and that he returned in a chaise, that night, to Gravesend; he got there at six o'clock, and came in the Gravesend boat to London, and got here by three in the morning. I knew he could not have come up in the Gravesend boat, because it was not stood till half after eight.</p>

               <p>Did you know the prisoner? - Yes; he sold a great number of fowls in our neighbourhood; he said he used to buy them in the country; I do not know his name; they used to call him Dick the Waggoner. Mr. Park came to me on the Wednesday; I told him I knew the man; he desired me to look out for him; he used to lodge at the Goat when he was in town, I found him there; I charged him with it; he said, Very well, master, I sold them to you, and I will go with you to the Justice. He said he bought them in Newgate market.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the office in Bow-street. We had an information of the prisoner's lodging in King's-head-court, Shoe-Lane; we went there on Thursday, the 26th of October, about seven in the morning; we knocked at the door; the door was not opened to us, so I got down the cellar window, and got into the house, and then opened the door and let the other officers in. I went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room; there I found the prisoner in bed with his wife; we went up into the garret, and found the things Mr. Darby and Mr. Flight lost, tied up in a bundle, and there was a cutlass lying by it: there was another man in bed in the same room with Bagnall. I saw a counterpane hanging on the line; I asked who it belonged to; Bagnall said it was his; the garret was not inhabited, nor was there any person else in the house. We took the prisoner and the things to the office; there were no owners, till they were advertised there; Mr. Flight and Mr. Darby came and owned the things, excepting one of the counterpanes, that respects another fact.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This man you found in the same room, was known? - Yes; he was tried here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure then they were in the place where he lodged? - No; there was no bed in the garret.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of October last, in the evening, a little before 9 o'clock, I was alarmed by a knocking at the door; the people said they saw two men get out of our window; we immediately went up stairs; and found the chamber door and dining-room door both locked; there were several neighbours about the house went to the watch-house, and got two watchmen, and they got in at the window and opened the doors; I went into the room; the first thing I missed was a white cotton counterpane off the bed in the chamber; the maid, who was with me, said she missed a light-coloured coat and dimity waistcoat, of Mr. Flight's, that hung over a chair just by the door; I immediately went to the drawers to see if they were locked; they were all safe; I went to Mr. Flight's portmanteau, and found it was emptied; we searched the house to see if any person was concealed, but found none. Two or three days after, the things were advertised, some of them with Mr. Flight's name at full length; we went up to Bow-street, and I saw the counterpane, and knew it to be mine: the room-doors were open about half an hour before, for one of the servants was in the room at that time.</p>

I was going by Mr. Darby's with a pot of beer, a little before nine o'clock; I saw a person standing on the pallisades, and another upon the pent-house over the door; the one-pair-of-stairs window was thrown up, and the man on the pent-house came on to the man's shoulder on the pallisades, and off his shoulder on to the stones, and walked off; I knocked at Mr. Darby's door, and told them of it: I set the pot of beer down, and ran half way down the street after them, but they got off.</p>

On Tuesday morning, when I came down, and went into the back shop, I found the back door open, which led to the garden; it had not been locked over night; the lock was faulty, and the door was only buttoned: we thought it safe, as there is a high wall round the garden.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it really was buttoned the night before? - I am not certain whether it was buttoned. I found a large willow stick there, as large as a broom-stick. Here is part of the blanketing, which was cut off by the person who stole the blanketing; he left this behind.</p>
               <p>What was the worth of the several articles you lost? - The blanketing cost me 15 d 1/2 a yard; the smock frock was worth about 3 s. the coat was rather old, it might be worth 2 s. the waistcoat was almost new, it was certainly worth more than 7 s. I had the things cried; in consequence of which the things were found, in possession of Mr. Litchfield, upon the 11th. I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday, at Justice Hyde's in St. Martin's street: I understood he had been taken up upon suspicion.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Litchfield, who keeps a a public-house. As I was going up to the lost, to get a bit of hay for the cow, the prisoner asked me if he should throw the cow down a bit; I said he might; he did throw some down. I went up into the lost about two hours after that, to throw some more hay down for the cow, and there I found these things (producing them); they were in a basket hid under the hay; I went and informed my master of it.</p>
               <p>On what day was this? - I am not sure whether it was the Monday or Tuesday. The prisoner was not in the lost when I went the second time. The prisoner worked at the dung cart for my master two or three days; he used to go out with greens upon an ass, and he had a little cart and horse. He came into the house about eight o'clock; my master asked him how he came by these things; the prisoner said, he came honestly by them; my master said he did not think he did come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner sleep at this time? - At my master's, in a back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Was he at this time employed by your master? - Yes: with the dung cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. LITCHFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a public house at Hyde-park-corner. My boy, Francis, came and informed me that he had found some things hid in the hay-loft; I had them brought down and locked up; these are them. I suspected the prisoner; I sent for a constable, and desired him to wait till the person came in; I suspected the prisoner; he came in the afternoon; I called him aside, and told him I had found some things, which I believed belonged to him; he said, they did; I asked him how he came by them; I told him, if he would say where he bought them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250025"/> I would send and enquire; and if he did not tell me, I would charge a constable with him: he would not tell me: I then charged the constable with him. In going to the round-house, he cried, and said something to the officer, but what I don't know. The next day, while he was in prison, I was informed these things had been cried: a man that lodges with me, informed them that I had the things in my possession: the prosecutor came; I shewed them to him, and he said they were his property. When we were before the justice, the prisoner told the justice, in my hearing, that he had sold the coat and waistcoat for 4 s.</p>

Townsend's to Mr. Rivers's house; I was loaded with cloths; I met the prisoner and three more, who were walking together under the Artillery-wall; just as I came by the Red Lion, at the corner of the fields, the prisoner said, Old fellow, will you be three farthings towards a pint of beer? I told them I had no money.</p>
               <p>Did you know them before? - I don't know that I did. One of them said, Poor old fellow, give him a pint of beer; the prisoner said, I will give him a pint of beer, if he will drink it; I said I would, and thank him too, for I had not had a draught of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250026"/> beer that day; I said here is a public-house here, on the right hand, which is the Castle, if they would give it me here; they walked on, and took no notice of it; the prisoner kept close to me all the way, and the others kept company with me till I came to the King's Arms, which is at the top of the Tabernacle Walk; the prisoner went in there, and called for a pint of beer, and paid for it; I stopped my cart, and we drank the beer up; then they said, Will you have any more? I said, no; I would go home with my cart.</p>
               <p>How near is the King's Arms to your master's house? - About 100 yards. I refused to have any more beer; the prisoner called for the beer, and paid for it; he stood within the house; there was another belonging to him stood at the door; he wanted to push me farther into the house; that made me suspect him; I went and stepped up into my cart; I saw this piece of cloth and another lying without any wrapper; I took hold of my horse's head, and led him along towards my master's; the cloth was all safe then; the prisoner followed me, and asked me for one George, a dyer, who he said was in the woollen way, and said he would be obliged to me if I could find him out; I suspected him then; I said, if I heard of him, I would let him know; I had not the presence of mind to turn my head round; this man followed to my master's door; he then said, God bless you, good-b'y'; when I got to my master's door, I looked at the end of the cart, and missed a piece of cloth; I called out, I have lost a piece of cloth; then I ran down to Tabernacle Walk; I saw one of them running with the cloth under his arm; the prisoner, I believe it was; I ran, and halloo'd out, Step thief! stop thief! one ran one way, and another the other; I could not tell which it was; when I took the prisoner, who was the hindermost, I knew him directly; the cloth was thrown down; I am certain this is the cloth; the other ran; I passed the prisoner; he said, it is in vain for you to run, for they have got a mile now: this was about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; I had tasted nothing but small beer all day, except that pint.</p>
               <p>Does it often happen that perfect strangers meet you, and ask you to drink? - I never met with such a thing in my life before; but it being holiday time, I thought they were some young fellows going out, making an holiday; I had some jealous thoughts of them after I had the pint of beer.</p>

I was sitting drinking tea: I saw a man, with a piece of cloth under his arm, move quick; and he looked over his right shoulder, to see if any body was running after him; presently after, I heard Cannon say, Where shall I go to find my cloth? I told him what I had seen; and presently after, the prisoner was brought back; I believe he is the person I saw with the cloth, but I am not sure.</p>

               <p>I am a saw-maker. I live in Barbican; I was in Tabernacle Walk this day week, about seven o'clock. I saw a man with a piece of cloth under his arm; he was about the prisoner's height, in a dark-coloured coat; he passed me; he had not got thirty yards past me, before there was an outcry of, Stop thief! I saw him drop the cloth by the Tabernacle Gates, and many people ran after him; I among the rest; we ran down Rus-in-urbe Gardens; we lost sight of him; I came back, and then they had got this man in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell them that was the man? - Yes; I would have told justice Wilmot so, but he would hear nothing of it.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I was going along by the dead wall facing the Belvidere, near <placeName id="t17810425-20-crimeloc100">Islington</placeName>

               <p>Explain how he put his hands into your mouth.</p>
               <p>All the fingers of both his hands: as they threw me down, I saw a knife just at my mouth, lying on the ground, open; I took up the knife, and threw it in the ditch.</p>
               <p>What were the four men doing, when you took up the knife? - One pressed upon me, the others were trying to rob me, and this man had his hands in my mouth.</p>
               <p>Had you your eyes and hands so at liberty as to see and take up the knife? - Yes; my face and my gums were swelled; I halloo'd out Murder! three times; the last time a gentleman, Mr. Savage, was coming up, upon which three of them ran towards Merlin's cave; the prisoner, to save himself, jumped into the ditch, with my hat in his hand; the prisoner got into the field with my hat in his hand; I told the gentleman that was the man that had robbed me of my hat.</p>
               <p>Did they demand any money of you, or what did they say? - They did not demand any money, as I heard; they took nothing from me but my hat: they were with me about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What were they doing all that time? - Trying to rob me; one was searching my pockets, the others kneeled upon me.</p>
               <p>Had you nothing in your pockets? - Yes; gold, silver, and my watch.</p>

               <p>How came they to take nothing? - Because I had my face downwards, and they could not get at my pockets so well; I had my face downwards all the time they were with me.</p>
               <p>Then how could the man have his hands in your mouth? - He had his hands in my mouth, and my face was downwards.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes; I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Did you know the gentleman before that came up? - No; I never saw the gentleman that came up before: when I told him that was the man, he pursued him down the road, and caught him in the ditch; he knocked him down; I went to him, and the gentleman asked me if I could swear to him; I said I could swear to the man who had his hands in my mouth: we took the man to the Blue Lion in Gray's-inn-lane, and charged a constable with him; they asked me what I had lost; I said my hat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250029"/> two men went with a lantern, and one found the hat, and the other the knife.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the hat yourself? - I saw it in his hand, about twenty yards on the other side of the ditch.</p>
               <p>How far were you from the ditch? - About 27 or 28 yards.</p>
               <p>Was there any hedge? - No.</p>
               <p>This was between seven and eight in the evening; was it light? - The moon was just rising; I could distinguish him from the rest.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could distinguish a man at the distance of 27 or 28 yards, with an hat? - Yes; I could.</p>
               <p>When you was in this situation, lying with your face to the ground, could you distinguish this man so as to know him again? - Yes; I am sure that is the man; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>What did you observe him by? - His blue coat that he has now; I took particular notice of his face; he was the first person I looked at before I was pulled down.</p>
               <p>What did the others do, when they attacked you? - They did nothing but hold my head down.</p>
               <p>How came you to take notice of him? - I generally take notice of the first person I meet; I took notice of him, because I suspected they were upon no good.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A tallow-chandler; in business for myself.</p>
               <p>You was perfectly sober this night? - Yes, as I am now.</p>

               <p>The instant these men laid hold of you, they pulled you down? - I was down immediately.</p>
               <p>You have heard of 40 l. reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Did nobody tell you of it? - They told me of it at Sir

               <p>On Sunday the 4th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I was coming down near the Belvidere; I heard the cry of murder; I immediately ran across the road; there was a young man got to the turnstile before me; I asked him what was the matter; he said he did not know, there seemed to be several people as if they were fighting; I made up to them as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Who was the young man you first spoke to? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Were the people fighting at some distance? - Yes; under the wall by the reservoir of the New River; when I came near, three men ran one way, and one jumped into a ditch that goes across the field. I saw the prosecutor appeared very bloody, and very confused; he could hardly speak; I asked him what was the matter, and after a very short time, he told me these fellows had robbed him; that the fellow was one who had jumped into the ditch, and at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250030"/> had his hat in his hand; I think I saw a hat in his hand myself, but I will not speak positively to that; I think I saw something in his hand.</p>
               <p>Had he a hat on his head? - I did not look; the prosecutor saying he had his hat in his hand, I looked, and ran after the prisoner immediately: the prosecutor had no hat; I ran round by the road to the end of the field; there was a ditch, and by the watch-box I saw this man, who appeared dirty, as if he had been in the ditch.</p>
               <p>About how far did you go round to come to the road? - I dare say it was 200 yards, or more.</p>
               <p>During that time was the man in your sight? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it, light or dark? - Rather light; it was a very fine evening.</p>
               <p>Was the moon up, or not? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to the man who jumped into the ditch, to know he was the man you found at the watch-house, exclusive of his being dirty? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I did not use any ceremony, but knocked him down, believing him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether that man had an hat on? - He had a round hat on at the time I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see what sort of a hat the man had in his hand who jumped into the ditch? - I was not; when he got up, he attempted to get away; I struck him several times with my fist; a little man came up, and I desired him to feel in the man's pocket; he did, and said he had nothing; I felt in one pocket, but found nothing; when he found I had got the better of him, he said, I had knocked him down before, and had robbed him of two shillings; I kept him by the collar till the prosecutor came up; I asked him, if that was the man he wanted? He said, yes; that was the man that came up, and put his hands in his mouth: somebody came up, and struck the prisoner; I desired them to let him alone; I had got him, and would take care of him; I never let his collar go till I brought him to the Blue Lion in Gray's-Inn Lane.</p>

I came home on the 9th of April about twelve at night; I went to bed; about three in the morning I was called up by a nurse attending my wife, who was lying-in; she said there was somebody breaking into my house, or the next house; I had slept found; I rested a little; then I opened the window, and saw some persons were in the street; soon after, I heard a single tap at the street door, which I took to be a signal for persons in the house to come out of it. Upon this I got up, and went down stairs; I found the kitchen door wrenched off the hinges, and the kitchen windows had been forced; in the kitchen I found a dark-lanthorn; and, some time afterwards, there was a crow found in the area. In looking to see what loss I had sustained, I missed the buckles out of my shoes, which were standing in the kitchen, as I pulled them off over night; and there was likewise missing, a silver top of a castor; every place in the kitchen had been searched, but there was nothing in it but common kitchen furniture: the communication between the kitchen and the rest of the house was very secure; so that they could not get in, except by great force and noise, to make their way further. I was not disposed to enquire into these matters, not having sustained much loss, but I was acquainted by one of the neighbours of an advertisement. I went to the office; there I found the top of my castor, and there I saw the prisoner. I am very certain that at night every part of the house was fastened when I came in. I was let in by the boy,

The outside window shutters were wrenched open, the wood of the inside shutter had been cut away, and a hand had been put in, by which means the bolts were undone.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of December I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of the parlour; the prisoner had lodged with me eleven or twelve days; I let her the back parlour at half-a-crown a week at first, afterwards she agreed to go down into the kitchen: on the 26th of December she helped me set the room to rights, she put the watch into a cannister in the tea-chest; that afternoon I was going out; she wanted to persuade me to go on the Wednesday, but I went that day; she said, as I would go, she would go, and went out a little before me; she asked me, where she should meet me to help me bring home my child at night, and I told her; and she came about half after five, at the place appointed, to help me bring the child: we went home about half after six, or near seven; when we came in, the tea-chest was on the floor.</p>
               <p>Who lived in the house? - There was a lodger on the first floor; my apartment was locked; I found it as I left it, when we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250035"/> came in, and the tea-chest was on the floor; she said, Where is the watch? I am afraid you have been robbed; I looked, and the watch was gone: she bid me not be flurried; she dared say that was not all I had lost, and desired me to go and look in my drawers: I went and looked in the drawer where my gown that I lost was, under my husband's clothes; I saw my husband's clothes safe; I did not miss any thing: she said, I was flurried, and bid me look again, I should find I had lost more; I looked again, and missed my gown; the next day I missed three aprons out of the clothes-bag; I told my husband I was robbed; he said, it must be somebody in the house, and said he would have them searched; the prisoner seemed very confused; the next day she ran away: there is a door from each parlour into the passage, but they were both locked.</p>
               <p>Can you form a judgement whether they were taken before you went out? - They were all there when I went out; I have not found any thing but one apron; I am almost positive it was in the room when I went out.</p>

               <p>Did you turn round so as to see her do any thing? - No; I did not miss it directly; after that we bargained for three yards of this (producing it) she agreed to buy it, but had not money enough; she said she wanted a shilling; she bid the boy fetch her a shilling, and sent him out; a little while after the boy was gone, she said, she recollected she wanted four shillings instead of one, and she went after him to tell him she wanted four shillings; then I missed the cotton; I looked after her; and as she went from the door, I saw it hang about a quarter of a yard below her petticoat; I followed her as fast I could; before I got to her, I saw the watermen plying at Westminster-bridge, stop her, and take it from her: our shop is in Bridge-street, the third door from the bridge.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Pagett. On Monday, about nine o'clock, I carried up the tea-things to my master to breakfast; I went down to butter the rolls; I was gone about five minutes; going up again, I saw the prisoner coming out of my master's parlour; I asked him what he wanted; at first he said, nothing; then he said, he wanted some gentlemen. I was going to take him up stairs to see who he wanted, but he slipped out at the street-door; there was not any person in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Was the street-door open? - It was then on the jar; I do not know whether it was so when he came in; I went into the parlour, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner was taken immediately by the coachman; I met him as they were bringing him in.</p>

               <p>Your street-door usually stands open? - Sometimes.</p>

               <p>When did you count the money, before you lost it? - I never count money in my pocket; I received four guineas, and paid a little bill out of it.</p>
               <p>Who went to bed first, she or you? - She was in bed first.</p>
               <p>You suppose she got out of the room? - Out of the window.</p>
               <p>What occasion was there to go out of the window? - The landlady told me that she came down; the door was fast; the landlady would not let her out. I told the landlady I was robbed; she said she would find the prisoner: some of my things were found again by the constable.</p>

               <p>Was Clarke present when she said so? - No; she was going down stairs, and they called her up again. I said to Mrs. Clarke, The girl says, you have got the watch and buckles; she then said, she had, and would fetch them, and she produced the watch, the buckles, and seven shillings, and gave them to Mr. Hinksman; she said she took them to keep them safe, that the girl might not make away with them: we took them before the justice; the black man said he was sorry for what he had done, and gave the prisoner six-pence.</p>

               <p>Did you hear her deny having the property? - No; I was in the back room, examining the beds.</p>

               <p>As I was going out Saturday afternoon, I met with this man; he asked me to go and have something to drink; I went with him to Mr. Martin's in St. Giles's, and staid till eight o'clock; then he took me to Mrs. James's, a disorderly house, and we went to bed: I took the property, and offered Mrs. James half to let me out; she would not; I went up again; she came up and took the eight shillings from me, and bid me bolt the door and go to bed.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came and wanted to have a lodging with me that night; she gave me a bundle in a handkerchief to take care of for her till morning; that was on the Sunday, in the morning; she opened it; there was the watch and buckles and silver; I asked how she came by them; she said, honestly. When Mrs. James and Hinksman came, she asked if I had a lodger in my house that brought any quantity of wet linen; I said, no; they searched, and found the prisoner; and because she had a bed-gown and apron on, they took her, and then I produced the things immediately.</p>

                        targets="t17810425-41-off200 t17810425-41-crimeloc203"/>. I saw a tallish man behind me, in a light coat. I said I was wrong, and asked him where was St. George's church; he said I had passed it: I talked with the man; I stood considering which way I should take; then I heard something shuffling behind me; I looked about, and saw the prisoner and another; I spoke to them twice; they gave me no answer; at last I asked of them the best road to the London Hospital, Whitechapel; the other put his hand to his mouth, and said, Go in at the gate-way, the turnpike; I put my stick over my shoulder, and came away. I came to a cross road, which leads into Church-lane: I am a little dull of hearing; I saw nothing, but I heard people shuffling behind me; I looked about, and saw the two men that I had seen coming up to the turnpike, which were the prisoner and another man, coming up to me: the first man had a pistol in his hand; he poked it to my head, and cut my eye with it; the prisoner was on the other side; he had a pistol in his left hand; he poked it on the other side of my head; then there came up to me two men; I believe they were two others; one hit me with a stick on the nose; then one of them put a cloth or something round my neck; I thought he would choak me; then one of them went down on his knees to take my money out of my pocket; I pressed my belly down, that he could not get my watch out, and he struck me in the belly with his fist; and one of the others struck me over the head with a hanger, as I suppose it was, because it cut the loop off my hat, and my cockade; and the tall man I saw in Ratcliff-highway, was the last that came up; he said, D - n the bougre, why don't you shut his eyes? Then they put an handkerchief over my eyes; I went down on my backside, upon which they fastened my head down to the ground, and then took my money, which was upwards of 25 l. and a watch; they took a bundle of papers out of my pocket, that were the accounts of the regiment: none of my things were ever found again: then they let my breeches down, and walked behind me with their pistols in their hands; they made me walk with my breeches down, and said, If I looked back, they would blow my brains out; then they left me: I met with a watchman, who conducted me to Whitechapel turnpike. On Monday I made an information before the justice's at Whitechapel. On the Sunday I was unable to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250046"/> get out of bed. The prisoner was taken up last Wednesday was week; I knew him again as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before the night you was robbed? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How did you describe him? - I said there was a little man with a cut wig and dark clothes; and another with his own hair, a round hat, and dark clothes; I am certain the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - The moon did not shine, but it was star-light.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This happened about half after two o'clock on Easter Sunday morning? - Yes; when I got up on my backside, I said, You have taken all I have; why don't you take my life also? upon that they gave me two or three blows. I bought that fairly, for I might have held my tongue.</p>

               <p>I live in Tottenham-Court Road. On the 18th of April, as I was returning from the city, (I had supped at the Horse-shoe and Magpie, and parted with my company) just as the clock struck eleven, in my way home, up Holborn, I met with the prisoner; she asked me for a glass of wine, and represented herself as perishing for want of a glass of wine; I said, if the glass of wine would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250047"/> keep her from perishing, she should have it; I went into an open room, and ordered a bottle of wine; I paid for it, and went out; my way lay through the yard; going through the yard, she importuned me for a shilling; I told her she was impertinent, and would give her nothing; she said, D - n your eyes! you shall: she then gave me a violent push, in consequence of which I fell with my shoulder against the wall, on the right side, on some dung; she took from me eight guineas and a half, eight shillings, and my pocket-book out of my left-side waistcoat pocket; I missed it as soon as I got from her; I ran into the street, and called for the watch; the watch did not come; I went into the house, and asked if they knew the woman; the bar-maid said, yes; her name was Miss Walker: I told her I had been robbed of eight guineas and a half, eight shillings, and my pocket-book; I searched after the prisoner; I took up another woman, who said she knew her; the prisoner was taken the next morning; I knew her perfectly well to be the same woman: I never found my pocket-book nor money.</p>
               <p>Had you drank freely that afternoon? - No: I was perfectly sober. She pushed me down, threw herself against me, and took the money out of my pocket by force; I struggled with her about three minutes before I could disentangle myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, the first time, I pushed him against the wall, he fell on one side, and I robbed him; the second time he said, as he came out of the door, I held him together by both his arms, and so robbed his Worship: I said I must have three hands to rob him when I had hold of both his arms.</p>
               <p>Bowman. She spit in the justice's face, and beat the constables. I missed my pocketbook and money, when I got into the middle of Holborn; I ran as fast as I could into Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you relate the same story to the justice you have told me now, that she hit you a blow and knocked you down, and threw herself upon you? - Yes; and if the information is here, I dare say you will find it so.</p>

Is it probable that I should knock a man down, who declared he had no cash about him, and I saw no cash? There was a coachman he knew; he came out and told him he had been robbed by somebody of eight guineas, but he could not tell how; he said he picked up a girl, and went into the French-horn, at three in the morning, and gave her half a guinea to be connected with her; that he wanted her to tell him where one Miss Mee lived, as he chose to lie with her above any other woman.

               <p>I am a coachman. I know Mr. Bowman. When I drove the stage from Pinner to Stanmore, he lived at Harrow-well Common. I was in company with him about ten minutes that night: he said he was robbed between one and two o'clock, at the Coach and Horses in Holborn; he was in company with three girls and two men; he came in with them, and treated them with drams; he treated me with a glass; when he had so done, the girls went about their business. He said, Gray, I have not money to pay; I said I would lend him some; then he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, and pulled out a handful of gold and silver, and paid for it; I said, I wish I had as much as you; afterwards he told me he had been robbed, but he said he did not know how; he asked me to go along with him; I told him I was very much tired, and begged to be excused; he said he wanted to go to the French-horn; the first girl he met, who stands here, he took her round the middle, and took her into the French-horn, into a private room; and I left them.</p>
               <p>How long have you known this gentleman? - I believe five or six years.</p>
               <p>Who did you see at the French-horn? - The landlord and landlady.</p>
               <p>Was the bar-woman up? - I think I saw but one woman.</p>
               <p>Was this man sober, or in liquor? - He seemed to be in liquor.</p>

               <p>About half after two o'clock on Wednesday night, this gentleman asked me to go and drink a glass of wine at the French-horn: he met me within two doors of the French-horn: the last witness was with him. I went with him; he was in my company, I dare say, the space of an hour and better; he asked me if I knew such a name as Mee; I told him I knew such a name, but I did not know where she was.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about his being robbed? - No; he did not mention any thing of the kind to me. I went in about half after two, and I dare say I was more than an hour with him: when I went in with him, he called for a pint of wine; he asked me to be concerned with him, which I was.</p>
               <p>To Parry. Do you remember seeing this man at your house this evening afterwards? - Yes; he came back with

             and the coachman.</p>
               <p>Where had he been from the time lie complained he was robbed till he came back? - He had been seeking after this woman with me. We saw three women in Holborn go into a public-house; I bid him go in and drink a glass of something, and he would have an opportunity of seeing if he knew them; he did, and came out to me; I advised him to get some other woman, who might know where she lodged, and he brought in this young woman; I believe his business with her was to know who robbed him.</p>
               <p>Then you don't believe what she has said? - No: I was in the room; he offered to give this woman half a guinea to tell where the prisoner lodged, and said that he had a particular attachment to her.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Howell. On Sunday the 15th of October, I had been in the room up one pair of stairs about four in the afternoon; the sashes were all close shut down then. About eight o'clock the ladies who lodged in the room came home; they could not get in; the door was fastened on the inside; they called to the servant, and the servant found two chairs laid back to back to the door to keep it shut: the servant pushed the door open; I went up with the ladies; we went into the room, and missed a counterpane off the bed in the next room to the dining-room.</p>

               <p>A Witness sworn.</p>
               <p>I am fourteen years of age, and am a native of the East-Indies. On the Tuesday before last I was sent by my mistress, Miss Oliphant, from the neighbourhood of Tower-hill, with a box to Mrs. Oliphant's in Cockspur-street, to get some thing; I had two or three errands to do; I set out to go home with the box filled with things at about seven o'clock; I grew tired; I set down my box at Bow-church to rest myself; while I was there, the prisoner came up, and said, How far are you going? I said, only to Tower-hill; he said, he lived in French Ordinary Court (which is in the neighbourhood of Tower-hill) and if I would let him carry the box for me, he would give it me again when he came to his own house. I said I was afraid he would not let me have it again; he said, I might depend upon it I should have it again, and he would carry it safe for me. He took the box, and we went together: we did not go up Lombard-street, which was the nearest way; we went up Cornhill; when we came to Gracechurch-street, he wanted to go up Leadenhall-street; I objected; I said, No; go down Gracechurch-street, that is the nearest way; we went on till we came to the steps at London-street, near Crutched Friars; I went down the steps first; the prisoner, instead of following me, slipped away from me; I sought for him, but could not find him: I then went home; I saw the prisoner again the next day in custody; I immediately knew him, and I am sure he is the man that got the box from me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Had not the box a direction to it? - There was a direction.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. Last Tuesday se'nnight, at about eleven at night, I saw the prisoner running along Billiter-lane, with a trunk in his hand; I thought it was a suspicious circumstance, therefore I stopped him; he assured me the trunk belonged to his sister, and wanted to go to the place where his sister lived, but I took him to the watch-house; he endeavoured to get from me into Jewry-street, but I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether there was not a coach passing, and I ran to avoid it? - There was no coach; the prisoner insisted the box was his sister's.</p>

               <p>Coming along I met the boy; he seemed very tired; he asked me to help him carry his box; I carried it for him most part of the way. I was going down the steps at London-street; I happened to miss him; I came back again, and enquired after a black boy; nobody could inform me any thing of him: going across Billiter-lane, somebody called after me, Stop! I thought it was some people playing the fool; as I came into Leadenhall-street, they called Stop! Stop! I stopped presently; they asked me where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250051"/> was going; I said to my sister's; and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 14th of this month, in the afternoon, about three or four o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop; they asked to look at same black silk handkerchiefs, which lay in the window; my brother bid me reach them; I reached them, and laid them upon several bundles of linen ones that lay upon the counter, and opened them; Clarke laid hold of the two opposite corners from me, and held them over the linen handkerchiefs, while I saw Smith's hand go under, and saw her draw it back again; when it came back, I saw a bundle of handkerchiefs in her hand, and saw her put them into her pocket; she observing that I suspected her, she shook her pocket, as if feeling for money; she took out some silver and a halfpenny or two, and counted it in her hand, and then put it into her pocket again; I said nothing about it then, because I thought she would drop the handkerchiefs, and then say they only dropped off the counter; I let them go out with them, and then told my brother of it; he went after them, and brought them back; I followed them into the shop, and picked up the bundle of handkerchiefs upon the step of the door; but I did not see them dropped.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHERD sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday in the afternoon, the 14th of April, I was out at my door; I saw Mr. Potticary overtake the prisoners; he said to them, I shall be glad if you will step back; I saw they rather changed countenance; Mr. Potticary seemed confused; I went towards Mr. Potticary's shop; I saw Smith go in first, Mr. Potticary followed her, and Clarke followed him; just as she was going into Mr. Potticary's shop, she dropped a parcel of handkerchiefs between the post on her right side and the step of the door; the brother immediately picked them up; the constable came; we took them into the back parlour, and my sister searched them; in one of Clark's pockets there was a remnant of ribband in a brown paper; I looked through the glass door the whole time, when she was stripped, as far as decency would allow; I desired my sister to look under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250052"/> crown of her bonnet; Clarke did not seem agreeable to that. When my sister pulled off her bonnet, four whole pieces of ribband were taken out of the crown of her bonnet; one whole piece was taken out of her pocket, and another whole piece she dropped in the shop.</p>

The first I knew of the prisoner was about three weeks or a month before the 15th of March. He came to our house to sit for his picture: my husband had been acquainted with him many years. He sat about three times before the 15th of March: my husband told him he was connected with Mr. Parsons, a glass painter at Westminster; that they had a window to finish for Salisbury cathedral, and he could not therefore attend upon him in an afternoon. On the 15th of March my husband waited at home for him till near two o'clock, and then went out; after he was gone, the prisoner came, nobody being at home at Mr. Coy's, which was next door; I was washing in my passage, because they desired me, if any body came, to take in a message for them; there is no other house but that near ours; there was not any body in our house but myself. The street-door was open: Normansel came in, and said, Well, Mrs. Askew, where is Mr. Askew? I said, He was gone to Mr. Parsons's; he walked into the parlour, turned himself round, and said, I want to speak to you; I have got a picture for Mr. Askew to copy my hair from. I took the picture from him; in the interim he went out and fastened the street-door, and came back into the parlour: I was then sitting on a low chair, blowing the fire; he sat down across my lap, and began to pull me about and kiss me; I pulled his hair, and the powder scattered out amazingly about his clothes; he seemed discontented at my behaviour, because I struggled with him, and would not condescend; he got up in a hurry, ran to the window, and let down the curtains, and darkened the room; the curtains were not drawn on one side; then he came and caught fast hold of me again; he pulled me into another chair by the window, and wanted to pull up my petticoats, and he used me very bad; he then said, he had ill-used me, and if I would give him a comb to settle his hair, he would go away; I refused to get him a comb; but, upon his pressing me, I said, If he would let me shut the door, and fasten him into the parlour, to prevent his following me, I would get him a comb; he swore he would not use me ill, but that the door I should not shut; I told him, then I would not bring him a comb; he insisted on my bringing him one; I then said, I would go backwards into the kitchen, and get him one, thinking to fasten myself in, for we have no back-door; I was going by the stairs to the kitchen; he pulled me back, and desired me to go up stairs, and he would not follow me nor hurt me. Says I, Mr. Normansel, what do you mean? Do you mean to use me worse than you have done? He said, If you will bring me a comb, I will not molest you; but if you do not, I will make you suffer for it, for I will not go out in this situation: I said, Will you swear that you will not follow me, nor ill-use me? He said, no; he would not; but if I did not bring him a comb, he would not go out of the house. Then I said, I will bring you a comb, as you have so solemnly sworn you will not molest me. I went up stairs, by his forcing me to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Persuading you? - He forced me to the bottom of the stairs; I went up; I did not know what to do; I was no sooner at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250053"/> the top of the stairs; then he ran up after me; he had let me get to the top of the stairs; I turned, and ran against him, and insisted upon his going down stairs; he caught fast hold of me round the waist, and would not go, and I could not force him; he took me by main force to the bed-room door, which is about two yards from the top of the stairs; I laid hold on each side of the door, to prevent his taking me in, and cried Murder! I said what did he mean by using me in that manner? I said, If you use me ill, Normansel, I'll punish you for it; he said, If I am sure to be hanged for it, I will have my ends. He unclenched my hands, by force, from the door; he had his left hand round my waist, and with his right hand struck my left hand from the door, and loosened my hold from the door; then he took me off my legs, and rushed with me to the foot of the bed; then I cried Murder! he gave me, with his right hand, a stroke on the breast, and I lost my breath for some minutes. I had hold of the bed-posts; he threw himself against me, and threw me down on the bed; in falling, my left hand fell under me: it was a very good bed; being a light bed, I was just smothered with his weight, and I cried out, Murder! Askew! that is my husband: he said, D - n Askew, I don't care if he was here, for I am determined, if I lose my life by it, to have what I want: then he laid his whole weight down upon me; he deprived me of my breath, and then he had his ends of me; I was incapable of being of any assistance to myself. In struggling with him I turned from one side to the other, and crossed my legs, as much as I could, to prevent him; when he found me so very much gone, he laid his hand upon my breast; I suppose he thought he had killed me by his weight, and his smothering me to make me hold my tongue: then with his knees he began to get my legs open; he had the weight of his body down upon me, as much as he could, and held me fast; he got my left hand clenched in his left hand, behind my back; my hand being under me, he had full liberty with his right hand, and he unloosened his breeches, and had carnal connections with me, against my inclination and will.</p>

               <p>Did he enter your body? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue in that situation? - I suppose about five minutes; then he got off me, and I was quite incapable of getting up; he pulled me up by main force off the bed, and I fainted away, at the foot of the bed; I cried very much, and that brought me to myself a great deal. He said to me, Mrs. Askew, for God's sake, have mercy upon me: I told him I was determined to have no mercy on him, for his ill behaviour to me; he said, Well, then I am ruined. He took me off the bed, and rushed me to the room door, and desired I would go down stairs, and he ran down before me: I wanted to go out at the street door, but he stood between it and me, and made me go into the parlour. I was excessively ill; I sat down in the chair where he had ill used me before: I went up stairs; I cried very much, and he was begging at the same time that I would not acquaint my husband with it, for if I did, he was ruined; he made use of the same expression down stairs as well as above; I told him I really would inform my husband the very instant I saw him, or could get any person to fetch him; and would have him punished as the Laws of the Land would admit; he said, Mrs. Askew, you are not a bit the worse; Mr. Askew will know nothing at all of it; I will always be your friend: he said I never should rue it. I told him I always would, for I had no notion of a man like Mr. Askew, who had always behaved like a gentleman to me, to use him ill in his abstence. - While we were in the parlour, (I believe it was after five o'clock) a little boy, a nephew of mine, came and knocked at the door; I was going to the door; Normansel ran to the door, and prevented the boy from coming in; he bid the boy go and bring some beer; I said Bill, I will have no beer; Normansel said to me, D - n you, don't look back, for if you do, I am ruined; for he is a cunning arch dog, and will see you are crying, and have been very ill used, and there is nobody here but me, and I shall be condemned directly: he compelled me to sit down in a chair; he kept the boy out of the room; he desired me not to make a noise, or say any thing, if I did, it would be worse for me: the boy said, My Aunt never drinks porter; he said, Bring a pint of porter, and a pint of two-penny;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250054"/> so the boy ran away, as hard as he could, for the beer. I forgot to mention, when I sat in the chair in the parlour, that he put money into my lap, and I threw it out; he said, Married women wanted money sometimes unknown to their husbands; that was after I came down stairs, before the boy came. The boy went to order the beer, but it was never brought; I said, Normansel, I desire you will not confine me in this room; when I insisted strongly on getting out, finding the boy was coming to my assistance, and he saw I would not be put upon by him, then he opened the door, and went out; I thought he was gone; I ran to the door to call the boy; I saw the little boy coming, and said, Don't bring any beer, Normansel is gone, and he has used me very ill; the boy was at a distance with the beer; Normansel ran to me, from the Grotto, which is at the front of Coy's house, and pulled me back into my house, and said to the boy, Go and bring me a pint of porter, you dog; and the boy ran and brought the pint of porter; while the boy was gone for the beer, Normansel said to me, you had best not say any thing to this boy; I insist upon it; or it will be worse for you: he said, he would not let him in till I had given him a promise that I would not say anything to my husband, nor to any body, about what had happened.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him before you let the boy in? - No, I did not; the boy insisted upon coming in; the door was not, I believe, quite fast, only upon the latch; Normansel held me when he saw the boy coming; he said, If you say a word now, it will be the worse for you, for I will go and fasten all the doors, and confine you in, and the boy will think you are gone out: when the boy came, he stood at the parlour door, and took the beer from him, and I durst not stir, to look back, or to speak; the boy staid playing about the door, and in the passage. The boy had no notion he was such a villain as he is. The prisoner drank of the beer, and set it down on the table, and said, Good bye, Mrs. Askew, and went out. Then the little boy came in, and said, Lord, Aunt, what is the matter with you? with that Normansel ran in again, and said, Mrs. Askew, tell Askew I will be here to-morrow, at half past four, if not at two, and to wait for me; I will come certainly at that time; I said, Then, you villain, you may depend upon it, I will acquaint Mr. Askew of your behaviour; the boy was in the room, and heard me say this; then he went away directly, and left the boy with me.</p>
               <p>How old is the boy? - I believe eleven years of age.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No, they threatened to send him to sea. Mr. Eccles swore he would stick at nothing.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the prisoner desired Mr. Eccles might be called into court; Mr. Eccles accordingly came into court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the boy? - I cannot tell; I believe they have sent him away; I cannot positively say they have, but they threatened the boy, and said they would send him to sea: the boy has been gone from me three weeks; I was not at home when he went away; my husband sent me into the country, as he said, because of the threatenings of Mr. Eccles. I have enquired after the boy; my husband sent a letter to a blacksmith, at Colnbrook, where the boy had been before he came to me; and at my sister's, and one Crowley's, in St. Giles's; but have never been able to hear any thing of him. I left the boy, and went to my sister,

            's; I told the boy not to stir from the place; but, if his uncle came home, to tell him I was gone to my sister's, and to send him after me; and if he did not come to me, I should be home as soon as possible; that was between five and six o'clock. My sister lives in Parker's-street, Drury-Lane; she was ironing when I went in; I sat down in a chair by her; there was nobody with her that I recollect; she asked me what was the matter with me; I was not able to speak, I was so fatigued: I told her there was a man, one Normansel, who employed Mr. Askew to take his picture, came to our house within this hour and half, and has used me so ill, that I am not able to stand or go, with any propriety: I said, absolutely, he is more like a beast than a man; his treatment has been so vile to me, I cannot express it: she axed me, What has he done to you? I said, he has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250055"/> used me in a very gross bad manner, he has pulled and hauled me about, and he absolutely deserves hanging: she said, I would bring an action against him; I said, an action is nothing, but, if the law takes place, I can hang him; for he has forced me, and lain with me, against my inclination. I said Betty, what had I best to do? I am determined to go to some justice, and complain against this man; but my husband not being at home, what can I do? If Mr. Askew comes home, I said, had I best tell him? for I am afraid of my life, for Mr. Askew is a man that absolutely does not like to have any such thing happen. If Mr. Askew does not condescend, and use me well, if I can do it of my own accord, I will go to a justice, if I am sure to want bread. She said, by all means, acquaint Mr. Askew of it. My husband staid out all that night. I staid at my sister's about an hour and an half. I went the next day to Mr. Parsons, to see for my husband; when I returned, which was three o'clock, he was come home, and was drunk; my sister was dressing some fish for dinner: he was very drunk; he went up stairs, and went to bed in his clothes: he lay four or five hours; then he got up; and I told him what had happened: it was too late to go before a magistrate then. I sent for my sister the next morning, that was Saturday; then my husband, my sister, and I went before Justice Wright, in Bow-Street, and obtained a warrant; and the prisoner was taken up the same day, and brought-before him, and committed.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said, the boy was not before the justice, nor had he been examined by any person: That her husband said, after such a heinous crime, and such a disagreeable affair, it was impossible ever to think of living with her; but that no instructions were given to Mr. Pitman to draw up articles of separation between her and her husband; nor was any mention made of getting money of the prisoner, and her having half of it settled upon her; that there was a talk about money, but that she never meant to have a farthing of his money; that she never said, money was wanting, nor did she propose any sum, nor her husband in her presence: that when she was under the prisoner, on the bed, she sometimes got her right hand at liberty, and defended herself with it, as well as she could, and slapped his face; that with his left hand he kept hold of her left hand; that he came to her house at four o'clock, and the whole of the transaction was over by five o'clock. - That she and her husband had been confined, she first said in the King's Bench Prison, but afterwards she said it was in Newgate, for false swearing, and an assault. That there had been talk of a separation between her and her husband, before this; but that she never meant it sincerely. That when the prisoner forced her to go up stairs for a comb, she had hardly got to the top of the stairs, before he came after her. That the room door was open, but she did not go into the room before he came up. Being pressed for a reason why she did not go in, and lock the door, and call out of the window for help, she said, that he followed her up the stairs, but did not lay hold of her till she was at the top; that, as there was a bed in the room, she was afraid to go into the room, for fear he should ill use her. That she believed she did say before the justice, that she went into the room to fetch the comb, and he met her as she came out; but that she did not recollect what she then said, she was in such a fright, and was afraid of her life; but she now said, she did not go into the room, nor get him a comb at all.</p>

               <p>I am a widow, and live in Parker's street, Drury-lane. My sister, the prosecutrix, came to me on the 15th of March, between five and six o'clock; I was ironing some linen; I thought by her looks she seemed very unhappy, as if she had been crying; I asked her what was the matter with her; she told me, that about four o'clock that afternoon, Normansel came to her house, and asked for Mr. Askew; that she was washing in the passage, with the door open; that she told him Mr. Askew was not at home; that Normansel went into the parlour, took a picture out of his pocket, and called Mrs. Askew to him, and said, Mrs. Askew, give this picture to Mr. Askew, to take a copy from it to do my hair by; that she went into the parlour to take the picture from him, and she turned about to settle the fire under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250056"/> water to make it hot for her washing; that he seemed as if he had gone out at the street-door, and she thought he was gone away, but instead of that he made fast the street-door, and came back again into the parlour; that she was sitting in a chair, and he sat down in her lap, and began to be very rude to her; put his hands down her bosom, attempted to put his hands up her petticoats, and kissed her; and at last she forced herself off the chair, and he dragged her back to another chair that was on the other side of the parlour; that she struggled with him some time, slapped his face, and pulled his hair; that when she did that, he said, Mrs. Askew, I am sorry for what I have done; and if you will give me a comb to settle my hair, I will not offend you any farther; that she said she would give him none; that then he let down the window curtains, and made the place dark, and insisted upon her bringing him a comb; that she persisted against it, and said she did not know where there was one; that he swore if she did not give him a comb, he would use her with all the violence imaginable; but if she did, he would not; for how did she think he could go out in that manner? that she ran to the door, and he ran after her, and pulled her back to the bottom of the stairs, and swore she must bring him a comb, or he would use her with all the severity imaginable, and pushed her towards the stairs with all his force: she said she went up stairs to get this comb for him; that by the time she got at the landing of the stairs, he followed her; that when she found him following her, she ran down a step or two of the stairs back again to meet him, but that he forcibly pushed her up the stairs before him, and took her in his arms towards the room-door, and that she laid hold of both the jambs of the door with her hands; that he took her round the waist in his arms, and squeezed her, she said, to that degree, that she was incapable of helping herself; then he forced her into the room, and as far as the foot of the bed; that she cried out, Murder! but he gave her a blow on the breast that hindered her crying out any more; that she called her husband, and he said, D - n you and Askew too; then she said, I will hang you, if there was no more men in the world; he said, I will use you as I like, if I was sure I should be hanged directly. This, upon my oath, she told me; every word in my own house. That she laid hold of the bed-post with one of her hands, and that he gave her arm a blow with his hand, and knocked her hand off the bed-post, and threw her down upon the bed, got her right hand under him, and her other hand under her back, in one of his hands; and by that means, in that form, by struggling some time upon the bed, that he forcibly and against her will lay with her. She sat down, and told me directly every word I have mentioned; there was no other conversation in the world: I went before the justice, and told this story.</p>
               <p>(On her cross-examination, she said she told her sister she was a great fool if she did not prosecute him according to law; that she understood at first that he had laid with her; that she shewed marks of violence to her; that the next day she went to her sister's about twelve o'clock, to see if Mr. Askew was come home; that she found her sister at home; that her sister left her in the house, and went to see after her husband; that he came home about half past two, very fuddled; that the dinner was dressed, but he could eat none; that he said he was sick, and she persuaded him to lie down; she said she was in the house from about twelve o'clock till he came in; that her sister came in about half an hour after; that she could not tell what they had for dinner that day; that whatever it was, she did not cook it; but that it was boiled meat; that it was on the fire when she came in; afterwards she said that it was not on the fire when she came in, but her sister set it on; that she did not know that it was fish; that her sister took the dinner up when she came in; that she never gave her sister any advice till she had told her the whole story, and knew what the prisoner had done to her.)</p>
               <p>The Prosecutrix called into court.</p>
               <p>Court. When you f irst went to your sister's house, you said you was very much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250057"/> confused, and did not immediately tell her all that had happened to you? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>You told her at first that the man had pulled you about, and used you ill; what advice did she give you? - She said, I would not be pulled about and ill-used by any body; enter an action against him; I said, An action! if justice takes place, I can hang him. Hang him! said she; I would do my endeavour, as far as justice, to punish any body.</p>
               <p>Then you told her he had lain with you against your consent?</p>
               <p>How soon after that was it before you told her all the particulars? - The next day, I believe.</p>
               <p>When did you shew her the marks of violence that were upon your person? - The next day.</p>
               <p>When you went to look for your husband, your sister was then coming to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you desire her to get ready for dinner? - Some fish.</p>
               <p>Who was to buy the fish? - She and I went out together to buy the fish. This is truth, upon my oath: she and I bought the fish together; I just stopped and paid for the fish.</p>
               <p>Before you went into your own house? - Yes; and I desired her to dress it, while I went to seek for my husband.</p>
               <p>Did the do as you desired her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it fryed or boiled? - Boiled.</p>
               <p>What fish was it? - Barrelled cod: we had eggs and potatoes with it; she got them ready too.</p>
               <p>(The counsel for the crown gave up the prosecution.)</p>

Directly I called the watch; the prisoner then called out, and a man came up; and as soon as the watchman came up, two more men came up; I gave the watchman charge of her, for robbing me of 9 s. The men that came up said, Do not go to hurt the poor woman: when I told them what she had done, they said, You can do nothing with her; do not go to hurt her. I perceived her slip something under her cloak to one of those men; I suppose the half crown, for I did not see it afterwards. One of these men went into the watch house, and we found him whispering to the officer of the night. When the prisoner came there, she pulled out her money.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Red-cross Street, Cripplegate. About two in the morning I heard the cry of Watch! I saw the prosecutor and prisoner; the prosecutor said she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250059"/> robbed him. When I was taking her to the round-house, I saw three men men at a distance: they came up to her; and she slipped something out of her hand into one of their hands, and he put it into his breeches-pocket. I asked him, what he had got? He said, Nothing; and slipped into the watch-house. When I came in, he was leaning over the table: he said, What are you going to do with this woman? The prosecutor gave charge: the officer would not take charge; he said, Every body must live by their calling.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - On Easter Tuesday, the 17th. The officer's name is Coverly. The prosecutor would not go, without his charge being taken. Another person came in, and said it was wrong not to take charge of her; and he took charge of her.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Bishopsgate ward. Upon the 6th of March I was sent for to Mr. Harding's the Green Dragon, in Bishopsgate-street: they gave me charge of the prisoner; they charged him with taking a gentleman's things out of a room, and a counterpane off the bed belonging to the landlord; the prisoner owned this box and this basket (producing them); I asked him where the key of the box was; he said he had it in his pocket; he gave it to me; I opened the box, and found in the upper part of it the counterpane: Mr. Harding told me his name was upon it: I found also a pair of stockings belonging to Mr. Fairfax. When the counterpane was found, he said he was mad and drunk. The next day Mr. Fairchild said he should be glad to see him; I went with him to the compter; I then found this pocket-book ( producing it) under the prisoner's thigh, in the inside of his breeches; it contained fourteen pawnbroker's duplicates: I went to one Mr. Brady, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel, where I found a pair of buckskin breeches: none of the pawnbrokers are here. When I went the next day with Mr. Fairchild, who was his townsman, he told me where the things were, belonging to Mr. Fairfax.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to him to induce him to confess that? - No; he desired, as he was his townsman, he would tell him where the things were, and told him he would go to Mr. Fairfax, to see if he could do any thing for him: he told Fairchild and me, that if we would go to the Dolphin inn, in Bishopsgate-street, there he had left all Mr. Fairfax's things; I went there, and found this box (producing it), containing the things belonging to Mr. Fairfax: I took the goods before the Alderman at Guildhall; Mr. Fairfax there deposed to them: they were left at Mr. Philpot's.</p>
               <p>(The goods were all produced in court, and deposed to by the several prosecutors.)</p>
               <p>- PHILPOT sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Dolphin inn. The prisoner came to my house on Monday the 5th of March, and bespoke a bed: we sat up till half after twelve at night: he did not come that night: he brought the trunk produced in court on Monday the 6th of March. The next morning the constable came to enquire after these things, and took them away with him.</p>

            , Green Dragon Inn. I can swear to Mr. Fairfax's trunk; his name is upon it in two places. I was present when the prisoner was examined before the Alderman: he did not say any thing; only he wanted to be sent for a soldier.</p>

On Sunday the 18th of March, at about half past seven o'clock at night, I caught the prisoner in my house, as he was coming into the kitchen where we were sitting. He had a candle in his hand: Mr. Braly and Mr. Brooks were with me: they came there to sit with me, because we suspected my house had been attempted before. The prisoner came as far as the door: we had a light in the kitchen; we heard a little noise about a quarter of an hour before, but we did not go to see what it was. When the prisoner came to the kitchen-door, we jumped up, and took him in the passage; upon which one or two men ran away. We found the street-door open at that time: they had opened it, for I had locked it about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you taken the key out? - I had not taken the key out, nor indeed locked the door; it was only upon the single spring-lock; I suppose they got in by opening the door with a picklock-key. The kitchen-door had been kept shut; somebody opened it; we jumped up, and catched the prisoner in the passage near the door; there was an hair-cloth upon the passage, which I suppose prevented our hearing him when he came in. We picked up the scabbard of a cutlass in the passage: the prisoner was searched, but no arms were found upon him; but we found a picklock-key in his pocket, and a skrew-driver knife: there were three or four locks picked up-stairs; and we found the things mentioned in the indictment in the passage, in a bag as they now are.</p>

The prisoner was brought into the kitchen; at first he appeared much frightened, and could not speak; he was in a faint sweat; he asked for a glass of water, which was given him; then he said, he heard a noise in the passage, and came in to see what was the matter: the next morning he said, he came in to avoid a press-gang.</p>
               <p>(The witness, upon his cross-examination, said the first noise they heard, they judged to be the opening of the door, for they never heard it shut again; and for what he knew, it might remain open all that time, a quarter of an hour; that they found a piece of burnt coal in the passage, and a burnt match upon the stairs.)</p>

               <p>I was coming by Leather-lane, in the afternoon, about seven or eight o'clock; some fellows ran by me with cutlasses, and there was a noise; I found the door open; I stepped in; upon which these men took hold of me by the neck, and dragged me along a long kitchen; they frightened me; I did not know what they meant; in a quarter of an hour after, they brought in a bag of clothes, and said I was up stairs; one of the men said he left the door open on purpose to catch somebody.</p>
               <p>To Ivey. Did you say you left the door open on purpose to catch people?</p>
               <p>When the kitchen door was open, Brooks jumped up and said, You are the gentleman we are waiting for.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the street-door was s hut, and the bolt of the lock shut? - Yes; I am quite sure it was shut; I pulled it to. There is a passage goes to a neighbour's.</p>
               <p>Does not the door of that passage generally stand open? - Yes; but I am certain the passage-door was shut, because I was at the door at six o'clok, and shut it when Mr. Braly came to me.</p>
               <p>It might be opened afterwards for what you know? - Yes.</p>

He gave me first a shilling, and then half a crown. I said I would not have any connection with him for all the world, for he had the evil in his neck; then he pushed me; I pushed him again; he said he had met with such bitches as me before, and abused me.</p>

I said I was going home to Little Wild-street; they said, you are going the wrong way, and they took me down Water-lane: there I was knocked down, and my watch taken from me. The next morning I went to the Public Office in Bow-street, and lodged a complaint, and advertised it on the Saturday following in the Gazetteer. Upon the 5th of this month I was sent for to the Office; there I saw my watch; it was stopped by the pawnbroker: I cannot swear to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a mantua-maker, and am the wife of the last witness. On the 26th of February, about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, the several things mentioned in the indictment were lying on the table in the parlour. I was at that time employed in washing. At about six o'clock, I went down stairs to iron; I did not come up again till one o'clock; then the things mentioned in the indictment were gone. The prisoner lodged in the house: we had a good opinion of her. She had been out between the hours of six and eight: she came back again, and was backwards and forwards in the kitchen, and remained by the kitchen fire, till I had done my ironing. She came up with me to go to bed: when I came into the parlour, I missed all the work. I was in great distress, on account of losing things which were not my own. All the lodgers came down, and endeavoured to pacify me. The next morning the prisoner came down, and said, Nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250066"/> will blame you for it; and she said, she would be one of the first to help make up the loss. I said I would go to all the pawnbrokers: the prisoner set down the things I had lost. I went to a pawnbroker's, who had taken in a piece of silk. I did not suspect the prisoner at that time. The next day the prisoner went out, and took the key of her room with her. I expected she was to return that night; but not returning, I began to suspect her; I had the door of the room opened; and I missed the pillow bier off the pillow, and two flat irons out of the room. Then I suspected her: I went in search after her, but could not find her; at last I heard she cohabited at a fortune-teller's in Kingstand Road. I found her there three weeks after, with a silk gown on her back, which I had to turn: I was charged a guinea and a half for it. I took a constable with me, and we took her up and carried her before Justice Blackborow. First of all she owned to the officer, where she had pawned the things: in my presence, and in the presence of Mr. Bowman, she owned the things were pawned at five different pawnbrokers, and the officer took down the pawnbrokers' names. I asked what she had done with my black silk gown; she said she had lost it: I found it since at her lodgings, and I have it here to produce.</p>

I asked her to tell me where the things were pledged; she said she would tell me nothing till we came into an house; we went into the sign of Alderman Crosby's Head: I took her into a room, and there she told us the different places the things were pawned at, and I put it down in writing.</p>

On Sunday the first of April, early in the morning, I was informed the counting-house was broke open; upon examination I found the desks all broke; the key of the iron safe had been got at; the tin box, in which we keep our bills and papers locked up, was taken out; the hinges of the desk were broke off, and I missed a particular bill of exchange described in the indictment, a bank post bill, for 20 l. and upwards of 10 l. in money. The prisoner had been a servant in our house for a year and a quarter.</p>

               <p>I am a porter to Messrs. Neale and Wright. The night before the counting-house was robbed, at about half past eight o'clock, as I was returning home, I saw the prisoner leaning against the warehouse shutter, looking in at the window; upon my ringing the warehouse bell, the prisoner went off into a little court, and as he entered the court, he turned back and looked at me. Upon the next day, Sunday, the 1st of April, I got up about a quarter before six o'clock. I sleep in the top of Mr. Neale's house, and am a servant of the partnership. I got a key of the shop-door from Mr. Perkins, another person belonging to the house: as I was going towards the cellar with a light, I saw the door of the lower warehouse open; I told Mr. Perkins of what I had seen; I examined, and found the chain of the fore door was down, but the door was locked and bolted; there were marks of the lock having been wrenched. I found the counting-house door broke open; two desks were broke open; the iron chest was standing open: all this I reported to Mr. Perkins, who immediately dressed, and came down; I then informed Mr. Wright; Mr. Wright, Mr. Perkins, and I, examined, and discovered what was lost.</p>

He looked as if he had been up all night; he said he had been moving. I did not examine what that meant particularly; but I observed he went to the ironing-board, and pulled out some counterfeit halfpence: he told me he had been at the other end of the town to receive a bad debt; he proposed to have coffee for his breakfast, and he had coffee; then he cleaned and dressed himself, and promised to come again the next day, which he did, and gave me his linen to wash.</p>

               <p>Amongst the money here is a piece (producing it) which seems to pass for 6 d. but is larger than a 6 d. it is base metal.</p>

               <p>I am a bottle merchant. The prisoner came to my house upon the first of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning. He had a trunk at my house: he went and staid a minute at his trunk; he then came out, and pulled some money out from his pocket; he paid me a guinea, and said, he was very glad he had it in his power to pay me. He went into the room again; he had some half pence: he said he had been at the other end of the town to receive a bad debt; he asked me to change the half-pence for silver, which I said I would do in a day or two. I saw him again on the Monday morning: he appearing to be doing something, raised my wife's curiosity; she asked me to go in and see what he was about. I saw him with a piece of paper in his hand;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250068"/> I asked him what it was: he said a 20 l. bank post bill, or a 20 l. bank bill; I can't be sure which; I looked at it twice. Upon the same day, in the afternoon, I saw him again; he then had been in the fields, and one of his legs was dirty: he asked for some paper; I brought him a sheet of paper; I tore it, and gave him one half; what he proposed to do with it, I did not know; only he asked for a pen and ink; I said I had not one; he said then, Never mind, I can get one at the post-office.</p>

               <p>I am wife of the last witness. I saw the prisoner sold up that half-sheet of writing paper which my husband gave him, and I saw him seal it with a waser: whether he put any thing in it, or no, I cannot tell; it was not directed at my house; he said he would direct it at the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Mr. NEALE sworn.</p>
               <p>The very day after this transaction, I received, under a cover directed to Neale and Wright, the bill of exchange for 276 l. 5 s. which was stolen out of the iron chest: that bill is unsatisfied. Our suspicions originally fell upon the prisoner, in consequence of a report made to us by the porter, that the prisoner, who had been a servant in the house, was seen looking in at the warehouse window on the preceding night, for I had before been convinced that this fact must have been committed by some one that knew the house, and knew where we deposited the key of the iron chest, and knew the way of the house and the counting-house: the porter mentioning that circumstance, that occasioned our suspicion. The prisoner came on the Tuesday night about eight o'clock, with a gentleman's clerk, to our house.</p>

               <p>I have a small house near Mr. Willan's, in Mary bone-fields. near the Jews-harp. The prisoner, Mr. Empson, lived in my house; he was put in by another person, who took the house of me; I asked him for the rent a great many times; he set me at defiance: at last he said, I might get it how I could, I might take my own methods: so I was obliged to seize, and put a man in possession. I used to carry the man professions in the evening, because he could not get any in such a private place; he was there from the 16th to the 18th of January; upon that evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I went up to the gate, and asked for admittance; somebody stood at the door, but made no answer; I called Green, (that was the man's name who was in possession;) nobody answered; I called Green again, and nobody answered: then I got over the pales, as I had done the night before, for they never would give me admittance; as soon as I was over, I took up my lanthorn; Mr. Empson came behind me, with a sword; I saw him when I turned round; I was putting my hand through the gate to take up my lanthorn; it was on the other side: he beat me with the sword; he came behind, and said, You scoundrel, I will give it you, for seizing upon me! I turned round to him; I said, Mr. Empson, you ought to suffer for this, or pay for it, I don't know which. At first I did not know whether the sword was drawn, or not; but afterwards he stabbed me; You scoundrel! says he, I will murder you.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing then? - No, I saw the danger I was in; I got round him, and got hold of him, thinking the man in possession would come to my assistance; he did not come; but the Nurse, who was in the house, came, and took him by the arm, and said, Pray, Mr. Empson, do not murder him; I looked at the nurse, and asked her, where Green was; she said, He was gone; Mr. Empson said, I have paid him, you scoundrel, and he is gone. I disentangled myself from him as soon as I could, and got away; in getting away, I did not think proper to go over the place I had got in at; I thought he would follow me; I turned to the right, to go to another place; and it was lucky I did; for he came out with a gun, which he levelled at the place I came in at, and fired it off. I was about three or four yards from him, and from the place where he fired.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - No, it was a dark night.</p>
               <p>How could you see how he levelled the gun then? - There was a light from the door.</p>
               <p>Where abouts was the place you had got over at? was it opposite the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you stand when you saw him do this? - I got on one side, in another part of the yard.</p>
               <p>After you had disengaged yourself from him, did he go into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he in the house before he came out again? - I do not believe he was a minute; I had not time to get out of the yard; I hurried all I could; I guessed he would be after me.</p>
               <p>When he came out, did he say any thing? - He said something, but I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>If you was so near him as you say, you might have heard what it was. - Yes, but I forget what it was.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he fired off the gun? - He fired as soon as he came out, instantly.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the door, where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250071"/> stood, to the pales? - May be nine foot from the place where he stood when he fired, to the pales. I got my things, and I took up my provisions, and was going away from the place; he came out again, with something in his hand, I do not know what, and said, You scoundrel, are you gone? I was got on the outside of the pales then.</p>
               <p>What was it he fetched out then? - My candle was out; I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>When he pointed the gun, he did not point it to the place where you was standing? - No, because he did not know where I was; he pointed it at the place where I came in. Going along, I found something run down my hand; I looked at it, as well as I could, and found it was blood. I went to the Jews-harp, and found myself wounded in two places in my arm.</p>

               <p>Have you no other evidence of the fact? - None.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, there is no evidence of a shooting at the person of the prosecutor: there must be a shooting at the person, to constitute the offence charged in the indictment.</p>

               <p>I am Deputy-Comptroller of the Post-office at Dublin. On the 10th of January last, a letter was received by the Secretary of the Post-office in Dublin, from the Secretary of the London Office, setting forth, that a bank note for 50 l. which had been stolen out of the mail near Epping, had been transmitted by Mr. Latouche of Dublin, to their correspondents in London; in consequence of receiving that letter, I went, by direction of the Secretary.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250072"/> to Mr. Latouche's bank, in order to make enquiry from whom this note was received by them; I left the letter there, in order to have the enquiry, and went a little further; by the time I returned, I met one of the clerks; he had in his hand a letter, directed to Mr. Latouche, and signed 
               <persName id="t17810425-67-person637">

            , which requested Mr. Latouche would send cash for a 20 l. bank note. [A letter shewn the witness.] This is the letter. Mr. Latouche's clerk informed me, that the letter was brought by the waiter of the Hotel at College-green: I went down to the Post-office, and informed the Secretary of the information I had received; then an Alderman of Dublin, myself, and one of Mr. Latouche's clerks, went over to the Hotel, and enquired for Mr. Jones; we were shewn into a room, the upper part of the house, in which were the two prisoners, and one

             (the man who afterwards turned King's evidence;) the Secretary asked, which was Mr. Jones? the prisoner, Roberts, said, His name was Jones; he was taken into another room, by the Alderman and the Secretary; after being absent for about two minutes, the Alderman came back into the room, where I remained with the other men; he asked them what account they could give of Mr. Jones, the person in the other room; they answered that they had met him, and travelled with him from London, and they had lodged together in Dublin; and that was all they knew of him: the Secretary immediately replied, That Jones's account was so different from theirs, that he was certain they had been guilty of something improper, and he should take them into custody: two coaches were sent for, and they were brought up to the justice's office in Dublin; upon being brought there, the three prisoners were searched; from the pocket of him that called himself Jones, and that was found to be Roberts, a small pocket-book was taken, by the Secretary of the Post-office, in my presence; in it were four Bank-of-England notes.</p>

               <p>Are these the notes? [Shewing four notes to the witness.] - I omitted, at the time, making any marks on the notes. The Lord Mayor came into the office just at the time; he had in his pocket The Hue and Cry of the 5th of January. These notes were compared, in my presence, with the description in this Hue and Cry, and two were found to correspond with two notes described there, one for 20 l. the other 25 l. I marked them down at the time, and I have kept this paper in my pocket ever since: two of these notes correspond exactly with them; these are the notes; the others I did not mark in any manner, so as to identify them. The two other men were searched, but nothing was found upon them, except twenty-two guineas: I think in the pocket of Sullens was a watch; and a watch, without any money, in the pocket of Archer; they had all three watches. [ Producing them.] It was judged proper by the Magistrate, and the Secretary of the Post-office, to have the men examined apart. The prisoners were sent into a separate room, while Sullens continued in that room, in order to be examined; when that was done, this advertisement, and this paper I have in my hand, were read to him; after a short time, upon shewing evident marks of a desire to make a confession, he was taken into a separate room from the Public-office, and there made a confession. Roberts had no money that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Are the watches marked, out of whose pockets they were taken? - Not at the time they were taken from them, but were marked since; they were shewn to these persons in Newgate, and they acknowledged them to be the watches taken from them; Roberts also acknowledged that letter to be written by him, and that he had inclosed a 20 l. note in it; and he acknowledged receiving 50 l. at Mr. Latouche's, upon a former occasion, for a bank note.</p>
               <p>What clothes had the prisoner? - Roberts's clothes were taken off him by directions from the Post office, after he had been some time in Newgate; they were, I think, claret colour.</p>

               <p>Did you leave any body with your cart, to take care of it, when you went into the house? - There was nobody to leave with it: I did not miss the mail till I got to the post-office yard; then it was just getting light; then I missed it out of the cart. The mail is open in the cart: the cart is so secured that nothing could fall out by accident; it must have been taken out at the fore part of the cart.</p>
               <p>Is there not a chain round it? - No.</p>
               <p>Were there more mails than one in your cart? - No: it was all made up in one portmanteau: I am sure I had it when I came to the Coach and Horses.</p>
               <p>How came you not to miss it when you got into the cart? - We do not sit upon it, as on some other roads; we sit upon a seat over it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Rose-lane, Spitalfields. On Friday morning, I believe it was the 8th of December, Archer came between four and five o'clock, and called me up; we went out, with intent to rob carts or waggons, or any thing we could; we went up Mile-End Road, almost as far as Bow; we met nothing to our expectation; we returned back to a watering-house; I fancy it was the sign of the Coach and Horses; it is an house the waggons and carts stop at; we staid there till almost six in the morning. I believe the mail cart came up.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the Coach and Horses then? - No, we were waiting nearly opposite, about that time; the mail stopped, and the boy went into the house; Archer ran across the way; he was not gone, I believe, three minutes; five, I am sure was the most; he returned in five minutes, with the mail upon his shoulder; he carried it just across the road, and then flung it over the bank, which is close to the path-way; then I went over the bank with him; I am certain this is the mail bag; I said, We shall be both hung if we take this; he swore, D - n his eyes, he would take it, for there might be money in it; I said, I would not have any thing to do with it. I knew I was liable, being with him, to suffer as well as him. I went with him over the fields to Globe-lane; it was growing day-light, so that we could see over the fields; he said, It would not do to carry it home; we might be discovered; so we put it in a ditch, next to the lane; Archer staid there till I returned; I brought an hempen bag; I stood by the side of the rail-till he put the small bags into the hempen sack, and after that we threw the outside mail bag into a pit of water, in Globe-lane, called a grain pit, I believe; we flung bricks and stones upon it, to sink it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how many bags were taken? - I was in so much confusion I cannot remember the number of small bags; there were a great many; they were put into the hempen bag, tied up, thrown across the horse, and then, mine being the nighest house, we consented to take it to my house. I went into the stable, with my horse, at the back of my house, the while he carried the sack into a front room of mine. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250076"/> cut the bags, and began to open the letters. I can't tell the number of small bags that were taken out of the mails; I did not tell them, but there were a great many. He said, He would burn the letters; they should not rise up in judgement against us; they were all burned; what we suspected to be notes or bills, all the small papers we found in the letters, we saved, and put on one side.</p>
               <p>Could either of you read? - No, I could not; and I have heard him say, he could not. After we had burnt the letters, we put the small bags in an hempen sack, and took them in a cart to a place called Old Ford, near a hand-post, and flung them into a ditch; and I think there were some stones put into the sack to sink it.</p>
               <p>Old Ford is near Bethnal Green? - Yes. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock when we got home with the cart; then we agreed between us to go to Roberts's, for him to look over the notes and the bills, to see which were good; we went over in the Borough, near the King's Bench; he was at work; when we got there, it was near one o'clock; we went to one Mr. Wood's, I think the sign of the George, a public-house where he lodged: we asked for Roberts; the man went to fetch him; Roberts said, He could not come over till he finished a piece of work he was about. We afterwards all threedined there off pork steaks; he enquired how the mail had been taken? and we told him all that we had done; he said, It was done very well, as it was done in that manner, and he would come over and look at them; he consented to go with us, and we proffered him an equal part with us of the notes. It was past three o'clock, I believe, when we returned from Wood's; we came to Rose-lane, to my house, just at dusk; before we went to Roberts's we put the notes in a pocket book, and buried them in a dunghill, at my house; when we got into my house, we fetched the pocket book out, and he looked over the notes; The Draughts, he said, were of no use to us, as it was war time, but, if it was not war time, he could go abroad with them. My wife and sister went for a Mrs. Moses, to get her to buy them. What he called the draughts were kept in one place, the bank notes in another: when she came, she said, The draughts were of no use to her, but the bank notes she would buy, but she did not not know whether they were good or not; she asked to have two of them, that her daughter might go to her son-in-law with them, to know if they were good. Roberts took two out, and took down the numbers upon a bit of paper, that they might not change them; she went, and was gone almost an hour and an half; in that time Roberts, Archer, me, old Mrs. Moses, and my wife, were in the house. I do not know who the son-in-law is; I never saw him, as I know of. When the daughter returned, she said, The notes were very good. Mrs. Moses, at her return, asked, What we would have for them? We asked 250 l. for 335 l. in value, as Roberts informed us; she said, She would give us 200 l. for them the next day; we waited till next day, eleven o'clock; she did not come; Roberts began to be uneasy; he said, He could lay them out as well as any gentleman in the city of London, without losing any thing by them.</p>
               <p>What became of the bills and draughts all this time? - Roberts said, he would burn them; Mrs. Moses and I said, It is a pity to burn them; you say it is so much money, put them up in something, and I will go lose them, that the owner may come by them again. Roberts said, It would be no odds to the owners; it would be only writing backward and forward that they were lost. They were at last burnt. Mrs. Moses said, Don't burn them, let them be lost; it will be a lightening of the punishment if we should be found out. The next day, when Mrs. Moses did not come, Roberts and I proposed to go down to Rosemary-lane, to Mr. Downes's, I think it was: my wife came after us before we got to the bottom of Goodman's Fields, and told us Mrs. Moses's daughter was come for the notes; we returned to our house; she then said, Her mother could not afford to give any more than 100 l. for them, as they were not for herself, but another person; that she should only get 20 l. by them: we consented to let her have them at 100 l. she was to come at one hour and another; but she did not come: about three in the afternoon Roberts said, He would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250077"/> and lay out some of the notes that night, or else he would leave us. We went down to Mr. Downes's, in Rosemary-lane; Roberts went into the shop, and bought a suit of blue-grey clothes, and a great coat; he told us, He changed a 10 l. note there; we did not go in, we staid at the door. I saw a gentlewoman run over to a silversmith's shop, from Mr. Downes's, with a paper, and the gentleman I observed looked at it; it appeared like a bank note. Then we went up towards the Minories; into Leadenhall-street, I think it was; Roberts went into a stocking-shop, and bought half a dozen pair of silk stockings, at 12 s. 6 d. a pair; there, he told us, he changed another 10 l. note; there were two pair of light mottled stockings, two pair dark, one with clocks, and one without; we shared the stockings, two pair a piece, when we got from London. From thence we went over to one Davidson's, a pawnbroker, near St. George's church, in the Borough; Roberts bought two silver watches, a pair of silver shoe buckles, and knee buckles; there, he said, he changed a note, but I do not know whether 10 l. or what; just as he said, we went by; he said it was a 10 l. note: then he said, he knew another pawnbroker, in Barnaby-street; he went there, and bought another watch, and silver shoe buckles, and knee buckles.</p>
               <p>What became of the three silver watches? - We had one a-piece; to the best of my remembrance this is my watch. [Looking at one of them.] There was a 10 l. note changed in Barnaby-street, as he informed us: then we proposed to go to our house, for Roberts said, Perhaps Mrs. Moses might get us apprehended. We went to my mother-in-law's, in Bishopsgate-street; my mother-in-law wondered to see so many men come there; we staid there, and had a pot of beer, and concluded to have some supper. Then we went to Archer's; there we staid all Saturday night. Archer and his wife went to bed; my wife and I sat up; Archer put the clothes on that he had bought, in my mother-in-law's room, after he returned from the Borough. We got up on Sunday morning; my wife pressed me to know where we were going; Roberts desired me not to tell her, for fear we should be upper-handed: after we came out, we proposed to go to Moorfields, and take a chaise; Roberts said, He thought that was too nigh, that people might find us out too soon. We went to Gray's-Inn Lane, to the Red Lion; and were driven to the Mitre, at Barnet; upon the road between Barnet and Dunstable, we agreed where we should go to; Roberts said, We must not keep a straight road, for that might be the means of our being upper-handed; we must cut out of the main road into cross country roads; he said, He had been a rider for his uncle sometime, and knew the roads. We agreed to go to Wales; he said he would go to Leicester; he changed a 10 l. note at the Peacock, at Leicester; then we went to Market Harborough; there, I think, we laid on Sunday night; the next day, I think, we travelled to Derby; he changed a note there, at the inn where we stopped; from thence we went to Manchester; there was nothing changed at Manchester, but between Derby and Manchester another note was changed: we went on to Holyhead, and from thence we went to Dublin, where we arrived the next Sunday after we set off from London.

The money was shared; I had 14 l. he 15 l. and Archer 14 l. he said, with the discount of the money, that made the difference. Roberts changed another 50 l. note with a gentleman upon 'Change; I do not know on what day that was. On the day before we were apprehended, we walked out all together; Roberts said, He as ashamed to go to Mr. Latouche again, as he wanted to change another note; he said, He would go home to his lodgings, and feign sick, and send a note by the waiter. I had not been returned home five minutes, before a gentleman came in, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250078"/> asked, Which is Mr. Jones? Roberts started off his seat; he said, I am. He said, A gentleman will be here, in a little time, and tell you the discount of the note. Shortly after, the gentlemen came in, and we were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether that letter was sent with the bill, for the purpose of getting it changed at Mr. Latouche's? - The waiter went with it; I was not at home when he went; but he came back when I was there.</p>

               <p>No; have not you had some falling-out? - No; we messed together when we were on the Thames. Roberts was on the Thames too. I was all illiterate man; I used to give him a penny a letter to write for me; I have never had any quarrel with him at all, not since we came away; we had a little difference about messing, upon the Thames.</p>

Archer came to me on Saturday morning, and we concluded to go to fetch Roberts, for fear he should turn from what he had said before we laid at a Mr. Goodges's in Gravel-lane, on Friday night; afterwards did not.</p>
               <p>Roberts. What was the reason of not coming to where I lodged, rather than another house? - Because they should not suspect any thing.</p>
               <p>Roberts. Whether you did not insist that you would not leave me till I went into the country? - It was his own proposal to go into the country; he said he could lay out the notes as well as any gentleman in the city, and he did not like to lose a farthing by them.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday the 8th of December, Archer called my husband up between four and five in the morning: he went along with him; he came home again, in about an hour or two, for a hempen sack, and he took his great coat with him; he returned again between six and seven; the bell had rung six a good while: Archer came with him; they brought this hempen bag with some little bags in it, and he emptied them out; he untied one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250079"/> little bag at a time, and turned out the letters in them; they were opened, those that had any thing in them. Archer took out what were in the letters, and laid them on one side, and the letters were burnt at my fire-side; Archer and Sullens saw what were taken out of the letters, and they were tied up in a pocket case; they took them out in the yard, but where they put them I can't say.</p>
               <p>Were there a great many of them? - A great number of the leather bags were put into the hempen sack again, and Archer and Sullens took them away in a cart; I heard Archer say, when he came back, That they had been taken to Old Ford, and thrown into a ditch, or pond; that they throwed stones and brick-bats upon them, to sink them. They went out together after that to Roberts's lodgings; they returned in the evening, and Roberts with them. Archer and Sullens fetched the pocket-book case out of the yard; he brought the bills in, and put them upon the table; Roberts looked over them, to see which were good, and which were bad; for neither Archer nor Sullens could read: they were emptied out upon the table, and he looked over them; all those that were good, he laid on one side the table; those that were bad, he laid on the other side. Sullens wanted them to be dropped; Archer swore, They should not be dropped, as they should not be brought against him; then those were burnt in the same fire-place. Archer said, He should wish to have the good ones sold to a Fence, which is a cant name for a receiver of stolen goods. I went to Mrs. Moses; I told her Archer wanted her at Sullens's house: it was on the Friday night; she said, It was her sabbath; she should rather like to know before she went out, whether it would be worth her while. She put on her hat and cloak, and came to our house: they shewed her the notes; she said, She could not read them; but if they would let one or two of them go with her daughter, while she staid to let her son see if they were good, she would buy them. Roberts took two out, looked at the numbers to see what the numbers of them were, and sent them by Mrs. Moses's daughter to shew to Mrs. Moses's son, to see if they were good; her daughter returned again, and said, they were good: the mother said then, She would buy them, but could not give the money that night, but would give it next morning.</p>
               <p>Were they all three together, when Mrs. Moses came? - They were. I met them that night at my mother's in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street: they did not stop long there; they went to Archer's lodgings, and sat up with them there all night; Archer and his wife went to bed. They went off in the morning; and I saw no more of them, nor my husband, till I was taken to Bow-street; but they were all together on Saturday morning, and breakfasted at my house, and Mrs. Moses's daughter. I went to fetch them back: Roberts was taking them somewhere to buy some clothes, and Archer and I brought them all back.</p>

On Saturday the 9th of December last, Roberts came to my house about seven in the evening, and said he was going down to Buckinghamshire; that he dealt in lace, and wanted a new watch; he said, I must change it if it would not do.

               <p>I suppose many watches go from your shop you can't identify again? - Yes; and I sold him, besides, a pair of shoe and knee buckles. I think all came to 7 l. odd; he gave me a bank note; I think a 15 l. it was above 10 l. I know; and I gave him change out of it.</p>

On the 9th of December, in the evening, Roberts came to our shop, and bought a silver watch, and a pair of shoe and knee buckles. Mr. Bertram gave him change for a note; I think it was a 10 l. note. This is the watch I sold him.</p>

I asked them where and how they came by bank-notes; when Sullens answered, and said, we honestly got them; for this morning, between Stratford and Mile End, we found, laying in the road, a trunk, which we carried home, and found it contained several banknotes, which we are determined to make use of, as it will be the making of us for ever. I made answer, that it would be much better for them to keep the said notes until they should be advertised, as they would be sure of a great reward for finding the same. They replied, No; for it is all our own, and nothing but bank-notes, which is as good as cash; at the same time they both insisted that I should agree and be Sullen's servant, as he should pay me for my trouble, and said, It will be much better for you than to work for ten shillings a week. I then made answer, and said, that I would consider of it, and let Sullens know my determination some time the next day: No, said he, I must know this night, and you must go along with me home; I made answer, that I wanted to go that night into the city, and would accompany him part of his way home; accordingly we all three went out together from the said George: it was then between five and six o'clock o' Friday evening; and the same evening I parted with Sullens and Archer in Bishopsgate-street, with a promise that I should call upon Sullens some time the next day, Saturday. I was back at the said George by nine o'clock that same evening. The next morning, Saturday the 9th of December, before I was out of my bed, a person comes to the George, and said, that there was some one wanted to speak with me at the King and Queen; when I immediately got up, and went there, where I found Sullens and Archer were a drinking some purl:

By the time I had bought for them what they wanted, I believe it was near eight o'clock o' Saturday night; when Sullens insisted that I should go and stay with him all night at Archer's house, and to set out next morning for the country. I desired that he would let me go and settle with my master, and let him know that I was going into the country:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250082"/> No, said Sullens, you shall not go from me, for I will not trust you out of my sight this night.

On the 17th of December we arrived in Dublin; and Tuesday the 19th, Sullens gives me a fifty-pound banknote, to go and get cash for it; when I went with the same to the house of Messrs. Latouche the bankers, and got the said note changed; immediately after I went with the cash to meet Sullens and Archer at the Elephant Tavern in Essex-street, where I paid Sullens the money, and he gave me fifteen guineas, and I believe to

In a few days afterwards Sullens said to me, that I must get another note changed, and gave me a fifty-pound note; at the same time desired me to go upon 'Change, as some of the merchants would give me cash: accordingly I went, and met with a merchant, who gave me the cash for the fifty-pound note; and immediately went with the same to a house in Smock Alley, where Sullens and Archer was; and we all three went from thence to the Hotel in College-Green, where I paid Sullens the money, and he gave me fifteen guineas, and

             the same. On Saturday, January the 6th, Sullens said to me that he must have some more notes changed, and that I had better go to the same merchant as changed me the last note, to get him for to give me cash for two or three notes accordingly I went to the said merchant's house, and asked him for to give me cash for forty or fifty pounds bank-notes, when the merchant made answer, and said, that if I would wait untill the Monday following, and meet him upon 'Change, at three o'clock, he would take my notes, and give me the cash: accordingly I promised to do so; and on Monday the 8th day of January, I met the said merchant upon 'Change, when he informed me that he wanted a draft of one hundred and twenty-four pounds, but could not get it that day, and on that account he could not take my notes. I immediately went and acquainted Sullens of this, when he made answer, and said, that I must go and get cash for them somewhere else, as he could not go from Dublin without some more money; at the same time gave me in all five bank-notes, value one hundred and five pounds. I then told him that I did not know where or how to get cash for them, unless Messrs. Latouche would change them; then said he, Go and ask them to do it, for you must see and get some cash. I told him then that I would either go or send to Mr. Latouche some time o' Wednesday, if that would do, and he agreeable, when he, Sullens, replied, and said, Do so; I am agreeable. The Wednesday morning, January 10th, I was not very well; and at about ten o'clock in the forenoon, I wrote few lines to Mr. Latouche, with a twenty-pound bank-note inclosed, desiring he would he pleased to send me cash for the said note by the bearer, who was the waiter where I lodged; the waiter comes back, and tells me that he was ordered to call for the money at twelve o'clock, as Mr. Latouche would not be in the way till that time; accordingly the waiter went at twelve o'clock, and returned to inform me that he was ordered to call for the money at two o'clock, as Mr. Latouche could not tell the exchange until about two o'clock; I said to the waiter, Very well, call for the money at that time. About one o'clock, Sullens and Archer comes up stairs in my room to shift themselves, when one of Messrs. Latouche's clerks came to the door of my room, and told me that I should have the money sent me for the twenty-pound note in about an hour's time; but in about half an hour's time, he returns to me, with the secretary of the Post-Office, Sir

            , and others. The Secretary desired to speak with me; I said, by all means; and went with him into another room; when he began to tell me about a bank-note of fifty-pounds that I had changed with Mr. Latouche; also told me that he had an account of that same note being taken out of the mail in England. I made answer, that I did not know any thing about that, for honestly I had received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250083"/> it, as well as some more I had then in my pocket. However, he said, that I was in the hands of justice, and must go along with them to the Crown Office; accordingly we all three went to the said office, but not one question asked of me, and presently after sent me with Archer to Newgate. If I had the least suspicion of any ill consequences should ever attend, or that I had dishonestly come by any one of the notes, I should have hardly remained that day so many hours at the hotel, after hearing three different times from Messrs. Latouche, without the money; this would have been enough for me to go away from the hotel immediately, if I had been guilty of doing any thing amiss; instead of that, I was innocent, and remained there to be taken, knowing my cause was just and honest. Indeed I know'd not, nor no more than the child unborn, that Sullens and Archer had robbed the mail of the notes which Sullens gave me to pass. I am of opinion that any one then in my situation would accept of the same offer that I did from Sullens. Now I leave it all to your great wisdom and kind consideration, hoping, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, that nothing but justice, and what is lawful and right, may take place in this affair, as I here declare before God that I am an innocent man, and am brought into this unhappy situation by deceitful men, and which cares very little what oaths they make, to save their own lives.</p>
               <p>May it therefore please your Lordship to consider my hard case, and shew me all the lenity that the laws of my country will admit of, for I am innocent, and hope your Lordship will be convinced of it, in the course of my trial.</p>

               <p>I am a millener. The prisoner and another woman came into my shop on the 27th of February, under pretence of buying ribbands: while she was looking at the ribband, some other people came in; I served them, and turned again to the prisoner; they both staid in the shop about ten minutes. When they were got about two doors, I missed the ribbands; I called my husband down, and ran after the prisoner; I overtook her in a passage facing the Five Bells Tavern: my shop is at the end of the New Church in the Strand. I got up with the other woman, but she struck me on the breast, and got away: I got assistance, and brought the prisoner back; I saw her searched, and the two pieces of ribband taken from her.</p>
               <p>What is that piece of black ribband worth? - About nine shillings.</p>

               <p>On last Tuesday was se'nnight, in the evening, the prisoner came to a Mrs. Gibbs's, next door but one to where I lived, and asked for a lodging; she would not admit him, unless he paid a shilling before he went into the lodging; he had not a shilling to pay: he asked the woman where I lodge, to have a pint of beer, and she asked me to go along with her.</p>
               <p>What is that woman's name? - Gibbs. I went with him to the Blue Anchor in Snow's Rents, opposite where I live: we had two or three pints of beer. He took me from there, and would insist of my going with him into Tothill-street, into a very bad house I was not acquainted with. He pretended love to me, and that he would marry me. I went with him to the Chequers: we had three pints of beer there; we staid there about an hour and an half; we sat in the tap-room; he took me from there to a very bad place, a night-house in the Almonry.</p>
               <p>How came you to go with him there? - He said he was going home with me; I desired him to set me home; I thought he was going with me.</p>
               <p>How came you to go into that house? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you think that was your own house? - Yes; I thought so indeed.</p>
               <p>You must be much in liquor? - I am not used to liquor; he made me intoxicated; I did not know what I was about: he sent for half a pint of peppermint, and forced me to drink; we were there all night; the next morning he stripped me of my cloak, and a Barcelona and pocket handkerchief, my apron, a half-guinea, and two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Did he take them by force? - No; there was nobody in company with me all night but him, and in the morning they were gone.</p>
               <p>Was he gone before you missed them? - Yes; I was in bed in the Almonry, in that bad house: when he left me, he told me he was going down to get some breakfast, and would come up again.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the things before or after he went down? - I missed the money before he went down, and I asked him about it; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the other things? - Yes, directly; I got up, and had not a handkerchief or apron to put on; he never came up again.</p>
               <p>Had you the money when you went to bed? - Yes, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had it in your pocket? - I thought [ had; I can't swear to it.</p>
               <p>Were the other things found? - Yes; I had him taken up the next day: there was found my black silk cloak, an handkerchief, and an apron: he could not say much for himself, but he swore he had not the money; he took the silk handkerchief and pocket handkerchief, therefore he must have the money.</p>

               <p>SYLVANUS PRICE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. I have a black silk cloak, an apron, and pocket handkerchief; I took them out of the lining of the prisoner's coat; he said nothing when I took them from him.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met this woman: she went and drank with me; she went home, and came out again, and walked with me; she said she was dry; we went into the Chequers, and had four pints of beer; I paid for two, and she paid for two: she wanted to go to bed, and asked me to go home with her; I was a stranger; I did not know the way to her home; she asked me to take her to somewhere to lie down; I took her to an house, and took a bed for her; I gave 1 s. 6 d. for it. When we went to bed, she said she had lost her money; I said I had no money but to pay for the bed; I went to bed with her; she waked at six in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250085"/> morning, and waked me, and said, she was vexed about her money; I said I knew nothing of it; she said, did not I promise to give her some over-night? I said, I did not promise her any money; I had none to give her; she said, what must she do to go home! and she gave me a cloak, an apron, and handkerchief, to pawn for her; I could not get what she wanted; I was bringing them back, and the man laid hold of me and took me up.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner, Gearing, lived with me six months; he behaved so well that I placed great confidence in him: Mrs. Pritchard complained of missing a great number of things to a great amount; I suspecting the prisoner, he was sent for to the justice's by the justice's advice; when he was brought there, he was beginning to make a confession; having some regard for him, I was not willing to take his life; I stopped him from going on with the confession; he only confessed pawning a shirt, a tablecloth, and a neckcloth. I took him home, and promised him, if he would tell the truth, I would be as favourable as I could; I would spare his life. Several articles I had lost were found at different pawnbrokers.</p>

I met them there; and we returned home at about half an hour after 10 o'clock at night. We found the door on the single lock. I had a candle from Mr. Dell's, my next door neighbour. I went into the house, and missed the several articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

               <p>I am an excise officer. On February the 21st, between eight and nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Old-street-road, with a bundle upon his head: he was standing against the wall: from his behaviour I suspected he had got smuggled goods. He went into a yard, as if he was going into a house: he put the bundle under his arm. I told him I was an officer belonging to the excise, and insisted upon seeing what he had got. He asked me what I meant to search for: I told him run goods. He said if I searched for that, I might search; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250090"/> he had none. I untied the corner of the bundle, and put my hand in, and found it was linen. He went into a house, and up stairs; I followed him, secured him, and delivered him and the bundle into the custody of the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter: I live at No. 44, Brick-lane, Spitalfields. On the Fast-day, about 8 o'clock, in Old-street, I saw a man give the prisoner the bundle, and gave him a shilling to carry it just by Moorfields, to James-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see him give him a shilling? - I heard the bargain as I was going by.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I might have seen him before, where he has been sawing; I never was acquainted with him before: I often employ sawyers myself. I knew him by sight these twelvemonths.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you see him? - Just by Mr. Croker's brew-house.</p>
               <p>Did you know the man that gave him this bundle? - No; I never saw the man to my knowledge in my life. I was making water when I overheard them.</p>
               <p>Were they standing together, or coming along? - They were coming along talking together: the other man had the bundle under his arm, and gave it to the prisoner. I heard him say, I will give you a shilling to carry it to James-street, by Moorfields. They both went away together.</p>
               <p>Did you walk the same way with them? - No, I did not, only just to the turnpike; then he crossed down Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>To Whitefield. It was, I think, between eight and nine when you saw the prisoner? - Nearer nine than eight.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in Old-street-road? - About thirty yards from the turnpike, which is fifty or sixty yards from Mr. Croker's brew-house. He told me he took it up in Golden-lane: his words were, as near as I can recollect, a man gave him a shilling in Golden-lane, to carry it to Bayfield's: that was when I had him in the garret.</p>
               <p>When you first saw him, he was standing still? - Yes, against the wall, making water, I believe; but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two other witnesses, who said he was at the White-hart, Bunhill-row, on the Fast-day, till near eight at night.)</p>

I could not give but 10 d. I said, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250091"/> he did not like the price, he might have them again; I asked, where she lived; she said in the middle of Wheeler-street. When she was gone, I went over to Mr. Hartley, to ask what they were worth; he said, 26 s. a dozen; I said, I bought them for 10 d. he said, they must be stole. I went and enquired after her; I could not find her; she came again on the 29th; I sent then for Mr. Hartley; he asked her about these bands; she said one of her lodgers sent her with them to sell. My father advised me to send for a constable; she said, one Blonde, who lived in our neighbourhood, and was a servant to Mr. Harris, knew her; we sent for him; he seemed surprised, and began to abuse us; we said, she had brought things we suspected were stole; he said, she was a very honest woman, he would be bound for her; we told him we were going before a magistrate; he said he would go, and see her righted; he went home to dinner, and came back again; we went to the Mansion House; there was no Alderman there; we went to Guildhall; she said, she lived in Wheeler-street; and he said, he lived in Wheeler-street; they were examined separate; she said, he had been at her house four times; he said, he had not been there at all; he said, he lived at one Green's, a porter, in St. John's street; he was sent to the Compter; we went to St. John's street; we could find no such man as Green; we found, the next morning, that he lodged in Goswell-street, at one Mr. Cosby's, a snuff-shop. I went with a search warrant; I went up into the garret, where he lodged; there were two beds in the room; under the bed we found boxes, with hat linings and trimmings; and there were some hat bands; there was so large a quantity we were obliged to have a cart to take them away.</p>

               <p>How many have the linings out? - Only three; they appear to be the same hats the three are, one out of each of the parcels pawned at different times.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the hats found in the lodgings, and of those at Mr. Fleming's? - Those about 7 l. 10 s. what I sell for 5 s. a hat; there were 88 in his lodgings; I can't speak to the value of them, because they are of different prices. Here are two pieces of belerdine loopings: here is my roll, with my mark; I have had these two pieces of belerdine ever since I have been in trade; they were left by my father; it was bought, I suppose, twenty years ago; I have not been able to sell it, except a little piece at a time.</p>
               <p>Can you say at what time the hats were in your shop? - No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>There is a large quantity of hats? - Yes; and a large quantity of goats-wool; I know some of that to be my property.</p>
               <p>What is your stock of hats? - Perhaps 1000 dozen in my shop and boxes some time last year, now perhaps I have not 50 dozen. I do not know I ever sold a Manchester hat without a lining; and some of those without linings are Manchester hats. The other articles in the cart I believe are my property, except a box and trunk which they are in: there is about 150 pounds of goats-wool.</p>
               <p>How do you know that to be yours? - There is a particular sort amongst it, which I import myself; I believe no other person imports it; I have it cleaned at Leghorn. There is a box, which the red Vidonia wool is in. The bow-strings I can only swear to, because they are English-made strings, and I bought all the person had at the time.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Harris. What opinion had you of the prisoner? - I looked upon him to be a very honest man, or I should not have kept him in the house. I had a good character of him. I placed such confidence in him, that I believe, if it had not been discovered as it was, it would have been worse for me.</p>

I was carrying a box on the 29th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, to the Swan, in Holborn; I pitched it at the Bull's-head, in Bull-head-court, Newgate-street, on a pitching-block. There came a man up to me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250093"/> and said, My friend, you seem to have a heavy load; will you take part of a pint of beer? I said, I did not choose to go in, I was rather in a hurry to go: he went into the house, and I sat down under the pitching-block. In a little time I rose up with my back to the box: when I turned my face to the box, it was gone. I sat there for about five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you drink there? - No; I went into the house after the man to see if he was there, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Is there another door out of the house? - Yes, there is. I went towards Newgate: I could not see any body with the box. I returned towards Cheapside: I turned up Bagnio-court, in Newgate-street: there I met the man that wanted me to go into the house, and the prisoner; the prisoner had the box on his back coming towards Newgate-street: I heard the other man desire the prisoner to slip down the box as fast as he could, and he said, here is the man, here is the man! so the prisoner slipped down the box, and both made away towards Cheapside. I called out, Stop thief! I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him till I took him at the corner of St. Martin's le Grand. The other man got off, and has not been taken.</p>

               <p>I am a smith, in Crown-alley, Moorfields. On Good-Friday, the two prisoners brought iron bars to me, above a ton weight, and wanted me to buy it. I stopped it, as I had a suspicion it was not honestly come by, as they asked under a market-price; they asked about 11 l. a ton; then they said they would take 10 l. I look upon it to be worth about 15 l. We inquired after the owner, and Mr. Finnemore said it was his master's property, he knew it by his mark. They said it belonged to a man that they were to meet at the sign of the Ship in Frying pan-alley, Tooley-street.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Jones, a wharfinger, at Allhallows, Thames-street. I went down to the wharf, at the Steel-yard, on Saturday morning, the 14th of this month. I was told there was some iron stolen out of the barge, and that these men were taken up on suspicion. I went to Mr. Leaverett's house; there I saw all the marks upon the iron, the same that was stolen out of the barge; there was none marked in that way but what was Mr. Thornton's property.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a broker and wharsinger. As soon as I came to town, I went and examined the iron. I saw it was the same sort we had lost: it is a particular sort that comes from that country, of that mark. All that had been stolen was found at Mr. Leaverett's; there were forty-three bars.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you inquire about this man in Frying-pan-alley? - No; I did not.</p>
