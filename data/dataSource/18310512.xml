               <p>MR. SHOOBRIDGE. When he was taken he said something about a man at the corner of Friday-street, having sent him for it - I never saw that man.</p>

On the 12th of April this gold watch, gold chain, two gold seals, and gold key were in the window, exposed for sale; the lowest value of them is 15l. - I had seen them safe in the course of the day; about twenty minutes past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner striking at the window - he was a stranger: he struck three times before he broke the window, as it is plate glass; the watch hung within a few inches of the glass - he could easily take it; he appeared to be alone; there was a gentleman and lady looking at the window at the time - I ran out, and seized the prisoner the moment it was done; I seized him with the watch in his hand; he had just stolen it - he had not time to move from the window: I sent for a constable, and had him secured - I have kept the watch ever since; here it is - it has the chain, seals, and key fixed to it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You seized him before he moved - he might have got away before you got out? A. No, he had not time, for the moment I saw him striking at the window, I ran out; he appeared sober - there were two persons standing by the window at the time he did it; when I seized him I had not time to hear what he had to say, as I wished to take care of my window - I sent for a constable, and had him taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a constable of the City. I was sent for, and took the prisoner on a charge of stealing the watch; I took him to the watch-house - I asked what he did it for; he turned round, and said, "I suppose it was a fit of delirium;" he appeared to me to be quite rational - I said, "What made you take such a watch as this?" he said, "Oh, I thought I might as well have that as any other - it looked a very good one;" he was quite sober; I knew him about the streets as a beggar - I found a knife in his side pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress; I could find no employment - I was in need of money to find bread.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 14th of April, I left the stable, about a quarter to eleven o'clock - I did not lock the stable-door, but am sure I shut and latched it; I looked the gates, and put the key into my pocket - Mr. Ellis' People have nothing to do with the yard; I returned about one, and found the gates still locked - I unlocked them, and went to put the horse into the stable, and the stable-door which I had left unlocked, was looked, and the key taken away; I had left the key inside - as I could not get in, I got over the fan-light of the door, and went up to my room; I missed a pair of boots, a coat, waistcoat, two pairs of boot-top covers, and two brushes - I have not found any of them; the prisoner had come into the yard that morning, and asked if I had got any dunk, as he wanted it for a man - I was then just going out with my master; I told him he could not have the dung, as I was just going out- he said he must have it, because they wanted it to top up a load; I put the horse in the gig, came out of the yard, and the prisoner came out with me - this was about a quarter to eleven o'clock; he saw me lock the gate - he was then outside the yard; I told him be could not have the dung that day - I knew him before by his coming with a man to fetch the dung; I then drove master to town, and on returning, found the stable as I have stated- I have not seen the property since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known him long? A. Only by his coming for the dung ever since I have been at Mr. Bligh's, which is about a year and a half, but not for the last three months - I was robbed about six weeks before: I did not know where the prisoner lived - he was taken on the Saturday night following and searched, but nothing found.</p>
               <p>JOHN MORAM. I am a gentleman's servant out of place, and lodge in Jubliee-place, Chelsea, close to where these stables are; I do not know what parish it is in. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120005"/>Thursday, the 13th of April, between eleven o'clock and half-past, I saw the prisoner get over the gate of Mr. Bligh's stable into the yard, and in four or five minutes I saw him come out - he got over the wall; he had something apparently under his jacket, but what it was I could not say; he went out into King's-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How far were you from him? A. I should think twenty yards, as near as I can say; I never saw any body go over there before - I was once in the yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I am a Policeman. I was on duty when the prisoner was brought to the station-house, in Milman's-row, St. Luke's, Chelsea - I did not either threaten or promise him any thing; he said he had stolen the articles from Mr. Bligh's stables - One pair of boots, a coal, and some other things, which he named; he said so to me, and said he had sold some and pawned some - he said some were in Marylebone, but he did not know the place, and that he had done it through distress; this was on Sunday - he had been taken on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Tell us what you said to him? A.Being the serjeant on duty, I had occasion to go to the cells; I said to him, "This is a bad job;" he said,"Yes, it is," and immediately made the confession - no body else was present; I have been s serjeant in the Guards twenty-five years - he made the same statement before the Magistrate, and it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Policeman came to me in the watch-house, and said it was a bad job; I said it was - he then told me if I would tell the truth the young man would forgive me - that he only wanted his boots, and that was all. On the Thursday, as I went to the stables, I was employed by a man to work - he sent me to the stable to ask if he could have the dung; he said I could not - I said I particularly wanted it; he said I must come on Saturday - I said I would come on Saturday; this was about half-past nine o'clock, and I could prove I was in doors from ten till half-past eleven - on Saturday night I was with a Life Guardsman at Knightsbridge; the prosecutor came and looked in - a Policeman came and caught hold of me - I asked what it was for; he said I should know by and by - I will take my oath I never saw the things.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING re-examined. I did not say the young man would forgive him if he told the truth, and he only wanted his boots - I said nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the stables? A. I was never at them till this happened; I know the parish it is in, because I live in the parish.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             - it was a grey mare; I took her in to grass - he was to pay so much a week for it: I put her in my fields, with other horses of my own - I missed it on the 28th of August that year, about seven o'clock in the morning; I had seen it safe about nine the evening before - the other horses were safe; there are two gates to the field, one at each and - I found them shut and locked; I traced the mare over a bank about four feet high, across an adjoining field to the Paddington canal, and there I lost it; I traced it a very little way along the side of the canal - the shoes were smooth behind, and not turned up, by which I could trace it; the mare's legs had been blistered - I had hand-bills circulated, and in consequence of information I went to some stables belonging to Panton, the prisoner, three or four days after; they are at the back of the Grand Junction water-works - he lived over the stable - when I got there he was not at home; I looked for the mare, and saw footsteps corresponding with the shoes the mare had on, within a few steps of the stable door, where the ground was clayey; I did not find the mare - Amelia Harris gave me the information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Is there not a thoroughfare right by my stable door, where you saw the horse's feet? A. I never knew it was a thoroughfare - it is a sort of passage between some houses; horses and carriages can go along there, but the public thoroughfare is adjoining it - his stable is a mile and a half, or two miles, from my house; I was never there till I went to look after the horse.</p>
               <p>AMELIA HARRIS. I live at Notting-hill, Kensington, at the potteries, with my mother, and work at Mr. Knight's, close to Mr. Wise's. In 1829 I was going through the fields to work, at the second hay-making time - I used to go through there every day; it is Wise's fields - there are a great many horses kept there, and there was this grey mare; I took particular notice of it, because it was generally about the footpaths - it was a pony; I noticed it, because it had bad legs - there was no other grey mare in the field; I saw a hand-bill on Mr. Wise's gate - I did not see the mare after seeing the bill; I went to Panton's stable, and asked his daughter for a book belonging to me -I looked through the key-hole, and saw the pony in his stable; I did not know it was that pony then, not till his daughter came and let me in (the prisoner was up stairs); I asked his daughter for a book, which had been left there for me by a person - I got the book: I saw the prisoner up stairs - they were at breakfast; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning of the 1st of September, 1829; I had to go through the stable to go up stairs - it is a very small place, and there is a step ladder: I saw Mr. James grey poney in the stable - it was the same as I had seen in Mr. Wise's field; I was not a quarter of a yard from it; I knew it to be the same by its legs, having seen it so often; I had seen it for about a fortnight almost every morning - I said nothing to him or his daughter about it, but went and told Wise what I had seen directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you look at it to see that it was a mare? A. I saw it was a mare - I do not tell you where I looked at it; you hit her to turn her further on, to let me come out of the door, because the place was so small; I saw it was a mare.</p>
               <p>JAMES JAMES. I <rs id="t18310512-5-viclabel31" type="occupation">keep the Duchess of Clarence public-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120006"/>house, in Vauxhall-bridge-road</rs>

Mr. Wise had a mare of mine at grass on the 5th of August, 1829 - it was an iron grey colour, under fifteen hands high; I heard of the loss on Saturday morning, the 29th of August, and went to the prisoner's stables between twelve and one o'clock on Tuesday, the 1st of September, in consequence of information; Wise was not there then - Cooper, the officer, of Queen-square, was with me, and demanded admission at the stable door; the prisoner's wife answered us through the window - we got admission; I saw the marks of the shoes of my pony in the stable - it was a very remarkable shoe; it was flat, and about half an inch wide; the mark came out of the door - it was a very clayer place - I traced it about sixty yards in the clay, towards Tyburn turnpike, just close by the water-works reservoir, between some posts, which a horse could hardly go between; I traced it between the footpaths, and then lost it - I returned to the stable, and found several grey hairs answering the description of the hair of my mare; I can swear the marks were the marks of the shoes of my pony - I had such shoes put on for a very particular purpose; she was a very fast trotting pony - the ground was quite wet; it was a very clayey place, and there was no thoroughfare whatever out of the place without turning back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You swear there was clay at the stable door, and it is hard stones, the same as any turnpike-road - a place where dung carts and waggons may go over. Witness. It is no such thing - it is not a road, only a passage - there is a foot thoroughfare behind the water-works; a waggon cannot go along - it is not above twenty inches wide between the posts, and the place is not above five or six feet wide altogether; it is a complete bye place - I have never found the mare.</p>

            . I am a hay-binder. On the 28th of August, 1829, I saw a grey pony and two men, between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the tow-path, in the direct road to Paddington, just by Wilton-green-bridge, about a quarter of a mile from Wise's - I do not know where the prisoner lived; I passed a joke with the two men, saying, "Where are you three going together?" meaning the two men and the pony; one was on the pony and the other running behind - that man stopped behind, and said, "What is it to you?" I cannot swear to either of the men.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CATTLE. I live in Praed-street, Paddington, in the same street as the prisoner. On Sunday morning, the 30th of August, 1829, I saw a grey mare pony in the prisoner's stable, between nine and ten o'clock - he was cleaning it; the leg appeared to he blistered up as high as the hock - I observed the pony again in the prisoner's stables on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not live opposite to me? A. I did at the time; my window faced his stable - there is a piece of waste groung there, and my carts used to pass his stable to be placed in the waste ground; nothing used to pass by there except our earts - it is not a thoroughfare; there are posts put up at the bottom to stop them from going out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there a road for horses? A.There is a road for horses, but nothing else.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. I am an officer. In August, 1829, I received information of this mare being stolen from Mr. James; I went to the prisoner's house about the middle of the day on Tuesday, the 1st of September; he was not at home - I endeavoured to find him afterwards: I searched for him in several places, and went several times to that house for him. but he had removed with his wife and family; I apprehended him on Saturday, the 9th of April last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was with me at Westminster two months before you apprehended me. Witness. Yes, I was - he was then in custody on another charge of felony, stealing ducks; this charge was preferred also, but Mr. Wise did not appear in time, and he was the principal witness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This pony I never had in my possession - it never was in my place in the world; another thing is, I never saw it, and it never was in my possession first or last; it does not stand feasible for a man to steal a horse and keep it within a mile and a half of where it was stolen from.</p>

Middlesex - I live there, myself and family, and the paupers live under the same roof - I have the management of it; the poor are kept by contract - the house belongs to the parish; the paupers have a great many rooms; I hire the servants - the overseers come there sometimes, but there is no particular room for them - there is no committee-room; they meet in the vestry of the church to do their business - the overseers and church-wardens send a note to me with the paupers, but I place them where I think fit; I buy the provisions, and am paid at per head - I pay no rent; It is part of my remuneration - I have the house and garden, and a small field ineluded in the bargain; the bread and cheese is kept in a room, called the pantry. On Saturday night, the 9th of April, we had eleven fresh loaves brought in - they were placed by themselves in the pantry; I fastened the pantry door myself, between nine and ten o'clock that night, and took the key up to my sleeping room - it is an inside door; I saw that the outer door of the house was barred when I went to bed - I got up next morning between six and seven o'clock, and found the pantry door broken open; the servant maid came down just as I did - I found it out first; the outer door was still barred, but on looking round in the kitchen I saw the casement open, which I had seen fast over night - a small square of glass had been broken before, and mended with a piece of paper; the paper was cut - a person could then put a hand through and open the casement, which was fastened the night before with a hasp; I looked about, and missed three new loaves and a piece of cheese, weighing 6lbs. or 7lbs. - I saw the cheese again the same night, about eight o'clock, in John Weatherley's-possession; I could not swear to it, but thought it very much like ours.</p>

I said 3 1/2d., which I gave him; there was a piece broken off the loaf, and he kept that back - I had part of the loaf, and eat it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You say I took three loaves - I acknowledge myself guilty, but there were two quarterns and a half which were cut, and as soon as I got out of the house, being in a state of starvation, I devoured the half-quartern - now I consider your evidence is very false. Witness. I am not certain whether I lost more, but I only lost three new loaves.</p>

There was a large ham and a piece of bacon there, but I always considered an honest man was the noblest work of God, and wished to keep myself honest - I was promted by stasrvation to do it; in my own parish there were new overseers, but they would not take office, and the others had not cleared their accounts - I went to one of the gentlemen, and said if he would give me 1s. I would go off - he refused; I was in want of victuals, and throw myself on your mercy, hoping you will pity a man who has been driven to this.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of April, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner riding a brown horse through Baron-street, Pentonville, going towards Holloway; I did not see whether it was a horse or mare - it had a bridle and halter on, but no saddle nor cloth that I perceived; I had no knowledge of him before, but I had a good look at him under the gas-light - he had on a blue coat; I saw him again in about an hour and a half, turning out of Barnsbury-mews, on foot - I knew it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How long have you been a Policeman? A. Ten months - before that I was coachman to Mr. Gatten, of Marylebone-lane; I do not know what I left him for - I had no words with him; I was discharged at a minute's notice - I was standing within a yard and a half of the gas-lamp when I saw the prisoner; the lamp is in the centre of the street - I saw him some distance before he came to me, ten or twelve, or perhaps twenty yards; he was riding at a sharp trot, just out of a walk - he went very steadily; the horse had a winker bridle, and a flat headed halter, which is called web-headed, and brass on the front; I cannot tell what waistcoat the prisoner had on, but he had another coat on under his blue coat - I am not to have any thing on his conviction that I know of, and do not expect any; there was a reward of 5l. offered for a grey horse of Ings', which was found in the same stable with this, but I am not a witness on that business; I know of no reward being given at our office on a conviction of house-stealers - I never saw a table of rewards at our office; I never was charged with theft in my life.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 29th of April, before four o'clock, I saw the prisoner riding along on a brown horse, at the top of Barnsbury-mews, Islington; I cannot say whether it was a horse or a mare - he went down the mews, and I went part of the way down, but did not see which stable he went into; I came back again, and went round my beat - I saw the serjeant of my section and an officer going up my beat; I ran and spoke to them - we three went to the mews and searched it, but found nothing; we got into one or two stables, but most of them were locked, and we could not examine them - I stopped at the top of the mews while the serjeant and officer went down, and I saw the prisoner come out of the mews; this was about an hour after I had seen him go in - I went, and caught hold of him by the arm; I knew him by his having a blue coat on, which hung down a about three inches below his other coat - I am certain he is the man; I asked what he had done with the horse he had taken down there - he said,"What horse?" I said, "Why, the one you have just rode down;" in the mean time the serjeant came up, and took hold of him by the arm, (he had not time to answer) and said, "You are my prisoner, what have you got in your pocket?" the serjeant said to me, "You go off to Gray's Inn-lane, where the horse is lost from, and let them know we have got the horse, and the man we suppose who took it;" I went, leaving him in care of the serjeant, and when I returned I saw at the station-house the same horse as I had seen the prisoner ride, I am certain, for I was not a yard from him when he passed me - I took particular notice of him, and the horse too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a Policeman? A.Twelve months - before that I lived in Barmondsey-square, and kept a broker's shop; not an old iron, but a furniture shop; I had a partner - he is not in the Police.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not several houses in this mews? A. I believe not - the back doors from some houses come into it; I have not spoken to Collins these three days - we have not talked about the prisoner's blue coat, or his under coat, or any thing of the kind; I did not speak to the prisoner when he was on the house - I followed him part of the way down the mews, but lost him, as it is crooked, and there was a lot of carts there; he was riding rather fast at first, but when he saw me he went very gently - he had no saddle, I am certain; it was between three and four o'clock in the morning; I do not know that any body lives in the mews - I stood watching at the top about an hour, then saw him come up the mews; he had not dressed the horse, for it was quite dirty - he came up to me; I turned round, and caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAVELL. I am a Police-serjeant. On the 29th of April I saw the prisoner running up Barnsburymews, and saw Pickett stop him - he afterwards left him with me; I took him to the station-house, and told him it was my duty to tell him not to say any thing to injure himself, for I should give it in evidence against him - I made him no threat or promise; I asked what he had been doing down the mews - he said he had not been down the mews; I asked if he had the key of the stable, and to give it to me to save further trouble - he said he had no key; on searching him I found a key in his pocket - I left him at the station, went to the mews, opened the lock of a stable door with that key, and found a brown mare there in the stable, and in the coach-house we found a grey horse - I took the brown mare to the station; Mr. Twight's ostler saw it there, and I believe Twight saw it there - I was present when he saw it at Hatton-garden; he claimed it - there was no saddle on it when I found it; Collins took this and the other horse to the station-house; I took a bridle and horse cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many Policemen were in the mews? A.Three - there had been four; the prisoner walked out of the mews, and Pickett laid hold of him - he told me he had not been down the mews at all; I asked him for the key of the stable - I did not say the stable where the horse was; I do not think I told him the horse was stolen - there may be a thousand keys like this, but it is not a very common one; I went with the horse to the station, and afterwards rode it to Hatton-garden, but I then fetched it from a livery-stable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEEHY. I am a constable, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. On the morning of the 29th of April, about three o'clock, I was at the Black Bull stable, between Liquorpond-street and Portpool-lane, and saw a man ride out of the gate of the Black Bull yard on a horse - I did not notice the colour of it; he wore a dark coat, and I saw the skirts of a white coat underneath it - he turned towards Holborn; I saw another man come out of the gate, and turn down a Portpool-lane - I came to the gate, and saw a horse with a halter about its neck, which the other man left there; I called the coachman, but nobody answered - I rand the bell, then got my comrade, and alarmed the master.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the Police? A. About fifteen months - I was recommended from the army; I have not seen Collins since he has been examined - I have talked to him about coming down here against this man; we did not talk about a reward of 5l. -I do not recollect his saying a word about it; there was something in the Hue and Cry about a bay horse - he never told me about the prisoner's light coat or his blue one; Portpool-lane leads into Leather-lane, and then into Gray's Inn-lane - the stables are sometimes open from one to two o'clock in the morning, which made me not take notice till I saw this horse; people do not go in there at all hours - I do not know how the other man was dressed; I thought he was the coachman, and let him go on - it was ten or twelve minutes before I could get the people of the house up: I rang twice.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WOOLFE. I am a wheelwright, and live at No. 11, White Conduit-terrace, Islington, and work in Barnsbury-mews. On the 21st of April two men came to me there - the prisoner was one of them; they asked if I knew of a stable to be let - I recommended them to a person at No. 25, Islington-row; they went together to hire the stable, and next morning I saw them both again - I asked if they had hired the stable; they said Yes - it was in Barnsbury-mews; the other man borrowed a hammer of me while the prisoner was in the stable - whethen he heard what he said I do not know; I was in the coach-house - I saw the prisoner several times after that; he attended the stable daily till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite certain of his per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120009"/>son? A. I am certain - the other man was well dressed, and appeared to be the master.</p>
               <p>Q. A gentleman in appearance? A. Yes, a very good looking man, with several pock-marks in his face - I should know him again; he had a drab coat on, with a velvet collar.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman. in Twight's service. On the morning of the 29th of April I came home with my coach, about a quarter-past one o'clock, with two mares, one brown and the other black; they were put in the stalls in the first stable, under the gateway - I went home, leaving them safely locked in the stable; I went again about ten o'clock next morning, and the brown mare was gone - I did not see it again till it came home on the Thursday following; the black one remained.</p>
               <p>C. H. TWIGHT. I first saw my mare again on the 29th- I saw it at the station, and then at Hatton-garden; I do not think I saw the serjeant at the station - it was the mare I had lost, and I claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that brown mare - I went to Smithfield on the Friday; there was a gentleman who asked me to mind a horse and gig, which I did, and when he returned he asked if I was out of employ; I said Yes - he said he wanted a young man to look after a nag; I said I should be glad of it - he said he had sent a friend to the north end of the town, to look after some stables; I went with his friend, and saw this stable; the following day I went to it, and on this night I was taken and accused of stealing the mare, which I never saw - I have not seen my master since.</p>

             keeps the house; I have lodged there almost six months - I play an organ; I have known the prisoner eight or nine months - he tunes organs, and had tuned for me three or four weeks before this happened. On the 12th of April, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, he came to me, and said, "Will you be so kind as to lend me 1s., to get some dinner," which I did - on that day my brother brought my organ home, and put it in the front parlour, in a kind of passage; I did not see it in the room, but saw my brother bringing it home - I missed it about eight o'clock in the evening; it was afterwards found by my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. At what time did you see your brother bring the organ home? A.About a quarter to eight o'clock - I saw him in the street, coming home with it; my brother has an organ, and another brother another - I sometimes let one out at 6d. a day- I employed the prisoner to alter the tuning of the organ about a month before; he came to my house almost every week - he had no right to the organ; I never said that it was my opinion that he did not intend to steal it; I did not suspect him till it was found, for he was like a brother to me, but I heard he had some money, and then suspected him - somebody said, "Jack took your organ;" I could not say it was him until it was found - I did not say whether I did or did not believe it was him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother. On the 12th of April I brought the organ home at half-past seven o'clock, and put it into the front parlour, by the side of the bed - I locked the door, and opened the window; my brother came home five or ten minutes afterwards, and the organ was gone - it was worth 20l.; I afterwards saw it at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body about the place? A. No; it would fetch 20l.</p>
               <p>JOHN BENNETT. I live with Mr. Clark, a pawnbroker, in Old-street. On the 12th of April a person brought an organ in; we are not in the habit of taking them in, and I asked him if it belonged to himself - he said No, the person belonging to it was outside; I told him to fetch him in - the prisoner came in, and I knew him as a customer; I asked if it belonged to him - he said it did; "I said,"Why did you not come in yourself?" he turned to the man, and said, "Why did not you tell me I was wanted?" I lent him 3l. on the organ, and gave him the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a regular customer? A. Yes - I had taken an organ in from him before - he did not give his right address; he pawned it in the name of Clark - I understand his name is Langshaw.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I live at No. 6, Tothill-street, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday evening, the 12th of April, I was coming down the street, and saw the prisoner and a man stouter than him; one said to the other "Come along, Jack;" they had the organ, and went down Gray's Inn-lane with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you observed them? A. Not above two minutes - I thought the other was a man named Marsh; he was taken on suspicion, but I did not swear to him.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Ball's-pond. On the 11th of April I was at work very near Mr. Stephens' house, and saw the two prisoners, about ten o'clock in the morning; Crockwell had two or three apples in his hand - they were going towards Kingsland; I saw Crockwell go into the front court of Mr. Stephens' house, and come out again - he went in and came out three different times, and then the gave the apples to Tinney - he had only three apples that I saw; Tinney then went in with the apples, and came out of the fore court in about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120010"/>five minutes, with a pair of drab trousers under his arm - they had white buttons at the bottom of them; I was too far off to see the house - my nephew, who is ill, and unable to attend, went to the house, and gave an alarm; they were pursued - that is all I saw: I am quite certain of them both - I never had a doubt of them.</p>
               <p>MARY INKSON. I am servant to Mr. John Stephens, who lives at No. 2, <placeName id="t18310512-9-crimeloc55">Brunswick-place, Ball's-pond</placeName>

On the 11th of April I was at home, and went up stairs about ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning, I left the kitchen window shut down - it is a sash window, and looks into the fore-court; I cannot say whether it was fastened - it was shut close down, and the street door was shut; there is a flight of steps to the door -I do not know how the gate of the fore-court was; there was no window or door open leading to the front yard - I remained up stairs ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when a man rang the bell; I came down, and he gave me information; I found the kitchen window half way open - I should think it would not admit a man's body - I think it must have been pulled partly down after him; I missed a pair of drab trousers, with white buttons, off a hamper on the left-hand side of the kitchen - I missed nothing else then; the prisoner Tinney was taken - he was searched at the station-house, in my presence, but nothing was found; while he was being searched four tea-spoons and a mustard-spoon were brought to the station, and I knew them to be Mr. Stephens' - I had put the tea-spoons into them kitchen-closet, on the left-hand side of the fire-place, the last thing before I went up stairs; the closet was shut, but not locked - the mustard-spoon was in another closet on the other side of the kitchen - I had seen that at supper time the night before; the trousers were worth about 10s., and the spoons 30s. - there is no place they could have got in at but the window, which I am sure was shut down when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAZIER. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a porter. On the 11th of April, about a quarter before eleven o'clock in the morning, I had just left my door, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw the two prisoner running from Ball's-pond-road towards Kingsland-road, in a direction from Mr. Stephens' house - they were about three hundred yards from the house; I ran into the road, and ran after them to Kingsland-road - one turned to the right, and Crockwell to the left; I caught him - I did not see him do any thing: I did not understand the person who was in pursuit - I thought he said he did not want the boy, and I let go of him to follow the other.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUMPSTEAD. I live in Kingsland. On the 11th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was standing at my door, and heard a call of Stop thief! I saw Tinney running, and pursued him till he was taken - he ran down Rosemary-place, away from Kingsland, and from Mr. Stephens' house; I called a witness, who took him, and delivered him to me - I gave him to the Policeman; after he was taken I received information - I had seen him lift his hand up, as if to throw something over Mr. Skinner's garden wall, in consequence of which I searched over the wall, and found five silver spoons, just opposite where he appeared to throw them, and about two yards from the wall - I gave them to Clark, the Policeman; the mustard-spoon had mustard quite wet on it - the others were teaspoons.</p>

            . I live at Kingsland. I heard a cry of Stop thief! about eleven o'clock on the 11th of April, at Dalston - I turned round, and saw Tinney running; I went back to meet him - he turned the corner of Crosby-place, which leads to Dalston-lane, and before I overtook him, I saw him throw a quantity of tea-spoons over the garden wall - I overtook him, and detained him till Bumpstead came up; I gave him into his charge - the spoons were found on the spot I pointed out.</p>
               <p>MATILDA HARRIS. I live with my aunt Scraggs, and am the daughter of Mr. Harris. On the Monday in question I saw a pair of trousers in the area of No. 5, Elizabeth-terrace, Ball's-pond; I took them up, and showed them to my aunt - she beckoned to Mr. Millichap; they were drab trousers, with white buttons.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MILLICHAP. I am a Policeman. I took Tinney into custody about eleven o'clock in the morning - I took him to the station; I found 2 1/2d. on him, a latch-key, and four apples.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS PROTHEROE. I am a Policeman. I apprehended Crockwell by Shoreditch church, on the 11th of April, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I asked if he had been up to Kingsland that morning; he said he had not.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLARK. I am a Policeman. I produce four tea-spoons and a mustard-spoon, delivered to me by Bumpstead.</p>
               <p>MARY INKSON. I know these spoons very well to be Mr. Stephens' - they were in the cupboard at ten o'clock that morning; these trousers are also his, and were on the hamper - they were found about twenty houses from ours, and in a direction towards Kingsland.</p>
               <p>Tinney's Defence. I know nothing of Crockwell - he was never in my company; I was selling apples in the street, and the Policeman ran and took me.</p>
               <p>Crockwell's Defence. I had been to Tottenham to see my sister; I staid there all night - I was coming down Kingsland: I heard a cry of Stop thief! they were pursuing another lad - a gentleman took me; a person said it was not me, it was another lad, and he let me go - when I got home my master sent me for a bushel of peas; as I returned, the Policeman took me - they asked the gentlemen if it was me; they said they did not know, but I was as much like him as two peas.</p>

On the 16th of April, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my husband's shop and purchased 2d. worth of plum-cakes - she took the cakes off the plate, and gave me a sixpence into my hand - I immediately saw it was a very bad one, and gave it her back; I saw Wakeling, and I suppose he was at the door, for as she was going out with the sixpence in her hand he apprehended her - it was between nine and ten o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you say it was a bad sixpence? A. I knew it to be bad, and gave it her back -I had not given any information to the officer; he knew her before.</p>
               <p>FRANCES WILDBORN. I am a widow, and live at the Seven Stars, Rosemary-lane - my father keeps the house. I know the prisoner - I saw her at my father's house on the 16th of April, between nine and ten o'clock at night, to the best of my knowledge - she came with a man and woman, at least I saw her at the counter with them - they were decidedly in company; they called for a pint of porter - I cannot say which it was; a sixpence was offered me in payment - I have every reason to believe it was the prisoner gave it me, as I directed my conversation immediately to her, and she stood immediately before me.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the conversation? A. On looking at the sixpence I observed it to be bad, and told the prisoner so- she was the person immediately before me; I said,"This is a bad sixpence: this is the second bad coin offered me within these ten minutes;" she immediately snatched up the sixpence, and ran away with it - I am sure it was her who santched it up; she ran to the door, and called to some woman inside to follow her - she called her by a Christian name; the other two persons went out in about two minutes - they seemed to wish to engage my attention to them; I gave information of this - the porter was not paid for, nor drank.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR PARKER. I am a widow, and keep the Blue Anchor public-house, Rosemary-lane. On Saturday, the 16th of April. between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my house for a pint of porter - she had a child in her arms; nobody else was with her - I served her; she put a bad sixpence on the counter - I took it up, tried it, found it bad, and returned it to her - the Policeman came in at the time, and took it out of her hand.</p>
               <p>PIERCE DRISCOLL. I am a Police-officer. On the 16th of April, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner go into the Blue Anchor public-house, Rosemary-lane, kept by Parker - I had my eyes on her before, in consequence of information; I stood at the door, and saw her offer the sixpence - I saw Parker try it on the counter, and return it to her; she had put it into Mrs. Parker's hand, and she put it on the counter, bent it, and returned it to her - I took it out of the prisoner's hand, as the landlady returned it to her - I have it now, and have had it ever since eleven o'clock the next day; I took her to the station-house, searched her myself, and found 2s. 3d. in copper, and a good sixpence in her pocket - she was discharged by serjeant Norman; I gave him the counterfeit sixpence - he returned it to me next day about eleven o'clock; I had marked it before I had parted with it, and knew it to be the same, as far as I could judge - I produce it; here is the mark which I put on it - it is a triangle, and it is bent at the edge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the landlady I had given her a bad sixpence - they searched the till, and took it out of a cup in the till. Witness. I did not go near the till; I took it out of the prisoner's hand.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I was at the station-house, in Denmark-street, on the 16th of April, at half-past ten o'clock, when the prisoner was brought in by Driscoll - I saw him find a good sixpence and 1s. 5d. in copper on her; she had no counterfeit money but the sixpence he produced - I cautioned her, and discharged her; I instructed a Policeman to follow and watch her - Driscoll gave me the counterfeit sixpence: I returned it to him next morning - I put a mark on the reverse side of it, and know this to be the same: she was brought in again at eleven o'clock the same night by Wakeling, for uttering a counterfeit sixpence to Mrs. Ward - Wakeling gave me the counterfeit sixpence; I returned it to him next morning - he charged her, in her presence, with uttering it.</p>
               <p>JAMES COOK. I am a Policeman. I was at the station-house, and the prisoner was discharged on the 16th of April, about a quarter or ten minutes after ten o'clock- I then followed her up Denmark-street into the New-road, where I saw her meet another woman; she was in conversation with her; I was about a stone's throw from them - I cannot say what the other woman was doing: I merely saw them, and saw something pass between the two: the prisoner put her hand out to the other woman- they both put their hands out together; the prisoner saw me after this took place, and they directly parted, one went one way, and the other another; I followed the prisoner to the corner of Cannon-street, where I met Wakeling - I told him to watch her, and I went back to look for the woman who had parted from her, but could not find her; I saw the prisoner brought to the station-house, in Denmark-street, in about two minutes - I searched her, and found one counterfeit sixpence, and 1s. 5d. in copper on her - I gave Wakeling the counterfeit sixpence.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WAKELING. I am a Policeman. On the 16th of April, about half-past ten o'clock, I met Cook, and in consequence of a communication from him, I followed the prisoner at the corner of Cannon-street, to the pastry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120012"/>cook's shop, kept by Ward - I saw her go into the shop, the door was open; I could see what was going forward - she asked for two penny worth of plum-cake; I heard that - I was close to the door - she took the two cakes up, and offered Ward sixpence; Ward took the sixpence into her hand, and told her it was bad - the prisoner said she had no had money about her, and she believed it was good - she put it into her right-hand pocket, and came out; I took her into custody, and told her she had just come from the station-house for the same thing, and she must go back again - I laid hold of each of her arms; she had a child in her arms, which prevented her getting her hands into her pocket on the road - I saw Cook search her, and take 1s. 5d. in copper, and this bad sixpence from her right-hand pocket, which was the pocket she had put the sixpence into - only one sixpence was found on her; I marked it, and then gave it to Norman, who returned it to me next morning - I have had it ever since, and now produce it; it has my mark on it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. This sixpence (produced by Driscoll) is counterfeit - it is made of white metal, known by the name of Britannia metal; it is not washed, but white all through - it was not made at the Mint; this sixpence (produced by Wakeling) is also counterfeit, and is made of white metal.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL BRIANT. I keep the Haunch of Venison, at Maidstone. On the 25th of April the prisoner came to my house, and tendered me a 10l. Bank post-bill, which I immediately sent to the bank, at Maidstone - I saw "C. Dundas" written on the back of it; he left my house.</p>

            . I am an officer to the Sheriff of Kent, and live at Maidstone. On Monday, the 25th of April, I saw the prisoner - his conduct excited my suspicion; he came into the Three Tuns, at Kingston - he was rather tipsy, and went to bed: after he was gone to bed, in consequence of suspicion, I went into his bed-room, and searched his-clothes, in the presence of the landlord, and found four sovereigns and a half in his waistcoat pocket, and 17s. in his trousers pocket, 4d. in copper, and an old pocket-book, containing bills and receipts, with Mr. Dison's name - I wrote to him that evening by post, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120013"/>the following morning, when the prisoner awoke, he asked why I had taken his clothes; I told him I bad done it from suspicions circumstances which I had observed, and that I had written to Mr. Dison; he said, "Then I am overtaken at last;" he was about to make a statement to me - I said he had better not; he said, "No, my mind will be the freer for it;" he said he knew when Mr. Dison went to tea, that he went to the shop under pretence of writing a letter - he saw the shopman engaged in serving a lady, that he drew out the till, and took out a 10l. Bank post-bill a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note, and four sovereigns - he then went to the Borough, bought a coat, which he had on, went to Maidstone, and then further, where I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear in very great distress of mind? A. Yes - he said he had robbed one of the best of masters, and was very sorry for it; he did not appear distressed the night before, but in the morning - I never saw a young man show more contrition; I obtained the Bank post-bill from the banker, and asked him if the one he had paid to Cole was the same he had taken from his master - he said it was.</p>
               <p>MR. DISON. This is the Bank post-bill which I lost from my till - it has my hand-writing on it; the house is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - having been informed that by pleading not guilty, any extenuating circumstance which might palliate my crime, would be urged, and give me the advantage of witnesses of character, are the sole reasons which, after the confession I had made, induced me to stand my trial; the unhappy man who stands before you, though respectably educated my brought up, has, unfortunately, not a single relation to stretch out a hand to assist him in the season of adversity and distress: previous to the time in question I have frequently been compelled to walk the streets of London for want of a bed, and the means of procuring one - the constable, not willingly, I believe, but by mistake, has stated that I said I went into Mr. Dison's shop under the pretence of writing a letter - I said, "For the purpose of doing so."</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner an irreproachable character.</p>

No - I did not lose it in such lengths as this; it is black - I have found none of the brown; there are thousands of pieces of the same width - there is no mark of my own on it; it was a whole piece - I cut the ends of the piece off, and have them here.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had cut the end pieces off before? A. Yes, just the fag-end, the list - there is nothing in that to make it correspond; I never sent any cloth to Guest's.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MACMANUS. When I went to Guest's there was a smoke issuing from the kitchen - it smelt as if cloth was being burned; I had a party of the Police trying to get in at the time, and a pistol was presented at me.</p>

On Friday night, the 22nd of April, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - I saw my house and premises secured; between five and six in the morning Pitts, my servant, alarmed me; I went down stairs, and found the house broken open - they had broken through the brick work, by the side of the back door, and made an entrance - I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the shop - (enumerating them); the time-piece was a very peculiar one; the bottom of it was made of wood, and painted to imitate bronze - it had a figured brass band round the top; it was made out of a few materials, which I fitted up myself - it was old-fashioned, and stood on three brass legs; I missed many other articles of linen-drapery, and an Eolian harp - the value of all the articles stolen is not less than 100l.; I should think considerably more - I found an old tinder-box left behind, which did not belong to the premises - I saw the greatest part of the property before Mr. Mores, the Magistrate, about a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any second Christian name? A. No, nor partner - I reside in the house.</p>

            ALLEY. Q.Did you examine the house to see that it was fastened? A. I did - I examined the street door and the back door; I only keep one servant - she locked and bolted the door, and placed two chairs against the back door, besides locking it, and it had a chain, a bar, and bell - we had placed chairs there for a long time, as we had heard of an attempt at robbery being discovered by chairs being thrown down - I never saw Chalk near my house - the door was not insecure.</p>
               <p>SARAH PITTS. I am servant to Mr. Katenbeck. On the 22nd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I fastened the doors and windows - I fastened the back door with two bolts, a lock, and chain, and placed two chairs against it; I came down about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the morning - it was then light; I found the little shop door open, which was shut over night - the chairs I had placed before the door I found in the kitchen when I came down - I had not removed them there; the alarm-bell, which hung on the door the night before, was taken off, and put in the garden - I observed the brickwork taken out of the wall by the side of the door; the space was not large enough for a man to get in, but he might put his arm in and open the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The door was locked, bolted, and chained? A. Yes; a hand could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120015"/>be put in to remove the bolts and chain - they got the door shutter down, and then broke a pane of glass - the bottom bolt could not be undone through the hole in the brick work; I was the only servant.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Was the hole on the side where the lock was, or the hinges? A. On the side where the lock was - the chain fastened on the side of the hinge - the hole in the wall was about half a yard from the floor; an arm put through it could unlock the door, undo the top bolt, and unscrew the shutter; a pane of glass was cut- all the fastenings might then he undone.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM POOL. I am a retailer of beer at Tottenham; I know all the prisoners. I saw them all three at my house on Friday night, the 22nd of April - they came in about a quarter-past nine o'clock; my house is about a mile nearer to the prosecutor's than Patrick's - I believe they all came in together; they had some porter, drank together, and staid till about five minutes after ten, which was my time to clear the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.They went, because you turned them out? A. Yes; I told them it was my time to shut up, and they went.</p>

            ALLEY. Q. Have you not known Chalk some time? A. He has frequented my house about six months.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRADFORD. I am a labourer, and live at the prisoner Brown's house - this is the eleventh week I have been there; neither of the other prisoners lodged there - it is Brown's house, and is in High-cross-lane, Tottenham. On Saturday morning, the 23rd of April, between three and four o'clock, just as it got day-light, I saw the three prisoners there together - I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. What first attracted your attention? A. I was up stairs in my room - the house has only one floor; I heard somebody come in - I did not know who it was, and I went to the stairs to see; they had no candle when they came in, but a little bit of candle was lighted in the back washhouse - I saw them all standing in the wash-house; they were not doing any thing, or bring my any thing in.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect what you stated before the Magistrate, and be careful, did you see any thing in the wash-house that night? A. Yes, I saw the time-piece while the prisoners were there - the time-piece appeared to be on brass standings, and it had some brass about it - I saw several things laying down, but do not know what they were, not to swear to it - there might be a little ribbon, but I was not near enough to see exactly what colour they were; I am certain I saw something there resembling ribbons - I was not on the stairs above two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what resembled ribbons, rolled up or unrolled? A.Unrolled - there was a goodish lot of whatever it was; I saw some worsted - there seemed a goodish bit of it; I saw nothing else - the things were close to the three prisoners; it is a very small place - I stood there looking about two minutes; I then left them, went up stairs, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What distance were you from the wash-house? A.About four yards - I was looking through the bannisters, not through a window - I did not speak to them; I peeped down, and went back; I could tell the colour of the worsted, because it was dark blue; I cannot tell the colour of the ribbon, it might have been white, black, or green, for what I know; it was as near to me as the worsted, but when a lot of things are together, you cannot see them all alike - there might he different colours of that, but the worsted was all blue; I am a labourer, and do any thing I can get to do - I have been in trouble before for getting tipsy, and been locked up for it - I have been in the cage once or twice - three times is the utmost; I was taken to the cage with these three prisoners - I will not swear it has not been four times, five, or six; I do not think it requisite to swear about it - I have not been locked up six times; you would make a person tell a lie.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not say you would not swear you had not been six times locked up? A. I told you I would not swear to it - I was never locked up for any thing but drunkenness, except when I was taken with these prisoners - I was never accused of theft in my life; I was in the employ of Mr. Fiddler, of Tottenham, before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, justly or unjustly, were you never accused of theft? A. Not any thing but drunkenness.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.How long have you lived at Tottenham? A. I was born and bred there, and have lived there all my life.</p>
               <p>JOHN DELLARS. I am a labourer, and live at Southgate. I know the prisoner Grimley; I heard of this robbery on the Sunday morning, as it happened on Friday -I saw Grimley on the Saturday after the robbery, at the Red Lion, at Tottenham, when I was getting my dinner, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon; I had not then heard of the robbery - he had a little bit of music in his mouth: he played it, and one and another asked him to let them look at it; I asked him to let me see it - he said he would sell it, and I gave him 4d. for it; I gave it to Griffiths, the officer, last Friday week - I kept it in my possession till then; I saw him take a few shillings out of his pocket, as they appeared to be - he said nothing.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SAVAGE. I am shopman to Mr. Murray, a pawnbroker, of East Smithfield. On Saturday, the 23rd of April, the prisoner Brown, came to sell some old silver, which I bought of him, and have got here - it is silver buttons, a silver clasp, a spoon, and part of another, a silver pencil-case, and a broken silver buckle - I broke that up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120016"/>to weight it; I gave him about 39s. for the articles - he did not tell me his name; there was some silver coin among them, which the prosecutor cannot identify, and I have not brought them; I gave 39s. for the whole - there were several shillings - it was all mixed with other old silver; Mr. Katenbeck picked out what he thought was his -Grimley brought in a time-piece the same morning and offered it in pledge; I am quite sure of his person - I did not take it in; it was a very old fashioned one, made of wood, and a little brass-work about it - I thought it like an urn; I did not notice what it stood on - Grimley came first and offered it, and in half an hour Brown brought the silver; they were not in the shop together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You do not remember how many coins you bought among the silver? A. No; a dollar was worth 4s. - there were several shillings, I cannot say how many; I put them all into the scale together, and weighed them; there might be 20s. or 30s.; they were old shillings; I do not think there were thirty; I would rather swear there were not than that there were; Mr. Katenbeck saw all my silver, and pointed out what he could identify; what I have brought is worth about 20s., and the whole weighed about 8ozs. - Brown was dressed very respectable, and gave a good account of himself; he told me he came out of the country, and that they were given him by his father, and that he was going into the country - they were old fashioned buttons, and Prussian silver, not worth 3s. an ounce; there was not crest on the spoon - it is an old fashioned spoon, and Prussian silver.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were these things sold you by weight? A. Yes - I gave 4s. an ounce, which is the value for Prossian silver; it is silver mixed with tin.</p>
               <p>JOHN THOMAS. I am a watchmaker, and live in New-road, St. George's East. I know Grimley and Brown; on Saturday, the 23rd of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, they came to my shop together, to dispose of some silver; one of them, I do not know which, produced two Spanish dollars and two 3s. tokens to sell, which I put into the scale; I am not quite certain whether there was any more or not, but after that, one of them chucked a piece of a spoon into the scale - I do not know which of them it was - the scale was as near as possible on a balance, and I took the piece of spoon out, threw it back, and said I would do business with one of them at a time, as it was a different man who threw the spoon in - after that the one who threw in the broken spoon pulled a time-piece out of his pocket, and asked me to purchase it; one of them produced some old fashioned buttons, but which it was I do not know - these are them (looking at some) - in consequence of seeing so many different pieces from one and another, I refused to have any thing to do with them; the time piece was on a wooden stand, painted like bronze - there was a figured brass round the edges, and it stood on brass feet - it was rather old fashioned; I refused to deal with them, and after a good bit they left the shop, taking the property with them - I afterwards found in the box of the scales which I had used at the transaction, the top of the spoon, and I gave it to the officer; it was the same as was chucked into the scale, as I suppose, for it did not belong to me, and I do not know how else it came into my shop; I believe it to be the one they brought - it might be two or three days after they came that I found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you keep any shopman? A. No - the buttons are silver; I cannot say if I bought them whether I should weigh them with spoons - I should buy old silver by the ounce, but I might reckon the buttons as useful articles; I do not consider them so good silver as spoons - the shanks are soldered on: spoons are generally reckoned the best silver - there is a difference in the quality even of coin; I cannot tell whether there is any thing in silver to depreciate it, unless it is assayed - I should not consider them such good silver as spoons, but I have not tried them - I should not call them Prussian silver.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. On Monday, the 25th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the Horse and Groom there; I heard a noise, which induced me to go into the house; I saw the prisoners Chalk and Grimley, in company with others, drinking - I went into the bar, and they saw me; Chalk followed me to the bar-door, and asked if I would have any thing to drink - I told him No; he afterwards went into the tap-room, and in a few minutes he came again, and asked if I would have any thing to drink; I refused - he then asked if I had found out any thing of Katenbeck's robbery; I told him I had not - he said, "Oh, they must be some Londoners - us country folks cannot do that;" I told him he might make some people believe that, but he would not me; he then said, "You may as well say it was me;" I replied, "I believe you was one of the party;" he afterwards asked me to drink again, which I refused - he then put his hand into his pocket, pulled out some money, and said, "Here you b - r, here is some of Katenbeck's money, and I have got plenty more of it in my pocket," and he pulled out some more - I replied, I thought he had never spoken a truer word in his life; he then called for a glass of brandy or a bottle of wine, saying he would treat me with either - he ordered the landlord to bring it; I still refused having any, and he said, "You b - r, come out, if I could get you out here I would run a knife into your bl - dy guts, and rip you open;" I told him if he said that again I would come out, take him into custody, and take him to the cage; he then denied saying so, and said he did not mean any thing, and would give me any thing to drink - it there ended, but he afterwards struck a person in the house, and I went in to take him out.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Grimley left when this conversation took place? A. He was there, in the tap-room; I have not a doubt of his being able to hear it, from his manner of speaking; I did not see Brown that evening - Mr. Reed, a farmer, and Shadbolt, the landlord, were in the bar with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Grimley take any part in the conversation? - A. I did not hear him - he was talking, but did not hold out any threats to me; neither Mr. Reed nor the landlord took any part in the conversation; I was not in any fear of my life; when I went to turn him out of the house they helped me; Chalk was against the bar door, and Grimley was in the tap-room, which joins the bar - a great many others were there; Grimley was drinking with them - there was nothing between them but the bar door; every body in the tap-room could hear the conversation - Grimley took no share in the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. How often have you been a witness in a Court of Justice? A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120017"/>cannot say; I have been an officer ten or twelve years - Chalk knew I was an officer perfectly well; I drank that evening, but not with them - no man ever saw me drunk; I was perfectly sober - Chalk spoke in a very loud tone; I have no doubt Grimley heard it - he seemed to care nothing about what he said; I should think there might be a dozen persons in the tap-room - I thought it very extraordinary, but I thought it was true; I suspected he was one of them from the first morning I was sent for - he told me this was some of Katenbeck's money, but I wanted stronger proof, and that we had in a few days, and I gave information to the officers - I should have taken him that night, if I thought I had proof enough; it was not said in a joke.</p>
               <p>Q.Might he not have been hear saying this at the distance of twenty yards? A.Perhaps he might, for he was in a violent passion, talking about ripping my guts open; I saw no stick or knife in his hand - he threw half a crown out of his hand, and I saw a great deal more silver; he was not perfectly sober, but he was not drunk - he was the worse for liquor; I believe he knew what he was about - he said what I have stated exactly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you known Chalk any length of time? A. Yes - he is a sawyer; he follows that business sometimes.</p>

             SHADBOLT. I keep the Horse and Groom public-house, at Edmonton. I remember Camp being in my bar on Monday evening, the 25th of April - there were about nine people in my tap-room, including the three prisoners; they were all three in there at the time Camp came in - he went into the bar; Chalk came to him, and asked him to drink - he refused, and Chalk called him an old b - r; the prisoners had two or three pots of beer - Chalk asked Camp to drink, and after that asked him to have a bottle of wine; he refused drinking at all with them - nobody but Chalk asked him to drink; Chalk pulled out a handful of money, and said, "D - n you, you old b - r, here is plenty of old Katenbeck's, money, we have got more when this is gone, in Mr. Reed's hollow tree in one of his fields;" I heard nothing more - I had the house cleared shortly after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Camp hear all that you heard, for it was addressed to him? A. Yes- he told Camp that he had got more in Mr. Reed's hollow tree; Camp must have heard that - I have been out of Court while he was examined; I should think he must have heard all about the rest of the money being in the hollow tree - there were only Chalk and Grimley at the bar when he spoke of the hollow tree; nobody was drinking then - Grimley was standing up at the bar door; they were all three together at the bar door, or walking about by the side of the bar - they had nothing to drink then, for I would not draw any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If Camp has said that Grimley and Brown were sitting with the rest of the people drinking near the bar, he must be mistaken? A. They had been drinking together at the first part of the conversation; there were about six of them there - I should think they were within hearing; I am satisfied that at the time of the conversation, Grimley was standing at the bar door listening to it- I cannot say that he took any part in the conversation; I should think Camp must have seen him at the bar door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did you mention to any body what you heard about the money? A. He mentioned it to Camp, the officer, shortly after he came into the house; I gave this evidence before Mr. Mores - I should think they were sober; nothing whatever was said to them about Katenbeck's property - they brought it up themselves; I can swear to the very words Chalk used - I did not write them down, but I took notice of them; he put his hands into his pockets, and the observation he made, made me remark it - he was sober, I should think; I do not think it was said in a joke - I was in the bar at the time, and listened to what they said; my attention was not called off.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say, at the time of the conversation, the other prisoners were either at the bar, or walking about near it? A. Yes - the tap-room joins the bar: Grimley was leaning against the bar door, which opens into the tap-room; nobody could be in the tap-room without being close to the bar.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Edmonton. I was in the bar at the Horse and Groom on Monday night, the 25th of April, about eight o'clock; I saw Grimley and Chalk there - I saw Chalk put his hand into his pocket, take out a handful of silver, and shake it; he said to Camp, "Here, you b - r, here is some of Mr. Katenbeck's money, and when that is gone I will go down to a hollow tree, which stands in Steven Reed's field, and get more;" he was then leaning over the bar door, and Grimley stood by the side of him - he told Camp if he had him outside he should like to let his bl - dy guts out; a man, named Gregory, a gardener, was also in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Gregory here? A. No - Camp was about three yards from Chalk when he said he would go to the hollow tree; he was addressing himself to Camp - I and Camp did not go down to the tree to see if there was any money; I could not tell whether there was any there or not - I did not believe him; he was rather in liquor - I cannot tell his meaning for saying what he did; I had no reason not to believe him - I thought it was malice towards Camp, which made him talk of ripping his guts out; he said if he had a knife he would do it - Camp had given him no offence; he pressed him very much to drink ale, and then brandy, rum, or wine.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you the least doubt he was so drunk that he did not know what he was saying? A. I cannot say that; I should think he did know what he was saying - there are a great many trees in the field; I cannot say which tree he meant - I do not know a tree which goes by the name of the hollow one; I did not consider I had any occasion to ask him which tree it was in - Grimley was standing by; he was drinking at times - he had a pot in his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120018"/>and was passing it to the rest at times; I am sure of that- I should think there were six or eight people in the tap-room; they all heard about the hollow tree - they were not all drinking with Grimley; I should think two or three were not drinking with him - Brown was not there at all; I did not see him - I saw all the persons in the room; he was not one of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What made you believe the money was Katenback's? A. From the character of the man; I did not believe the money was in the tree - I thought that a curious place; I certainly thought it extcaordinary that he should say he had got Katenbeck's money, and I had reason to believe it true from his character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLET. Q. Did you see Chalk enter the house? A.

            . I am a constable of Tettenham. I went, accompanied by other persons, to search Brown's house on Friday night, the 29th of April, after the three prisoners had been apprehended; the first time I went, a man, named Wiseman, was there, but not Brown's wife - I found nothing the first time; I went again the same day, and looked on the roof of his house outside - I borrowed a ladder, got on the tiles, and, by the side of the chimney, I found the mortar, which is called the pointing, had been removed; I lifted up one of the tiles, and saw a bag full of something under the tiles - I produce it; I found a wrapper full of goods in the same place, and a bundle of worsted - I found a chisel in the back washhouse; I have been to Mr. Katenbeck's house since the robbery, and examined his back door - I could not see any marks on the door, because the boards had been removed, and new ones placed; Mr. Karenbeck gave me this piece of wood, which has marks on it corresponding with the chisel.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This, you say, exactly corresponds? A. Yes, if you turn it the right was you will find it does; nobody could get on the roof without a ladder; the prisoners were in custody at the time I made the search; I knew the people in the house - they were not strangers to me.</p>

               <p>EDWARD BROWN.</p>
               <p>The bell on the door was taken off and given to me, which I laid down on the ground in the garden.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BROWN.</p>
               <p>Taken before me, the prisoner Edward Brown, having been first asked what he had to say in answer to the charge, and cautioned as to his statement.</p>
               <p>E. R. MORES.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRIFFITHS re-examined. I received from John Dellars this piece of music, which Mr. Katenbeck has seen.</p>
               <p>MR. KATENBECK. This is mine - it is an Eolian harp, I call it so; I lost it with the goods - I have had it about five years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are these not very common things? A. I think not, made in that way; they were common five years ago - I know it by one of the pegs having been broken and mended again; there is no mark where it was mended - it is a note in playing.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Have you tried, by playing on it, whether you can discover that it is a mended instrument? A. No, it is quite out of order, and I cannot play it.</p>
               <p>MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Is there any private mark on the silks or satin? A. The greatest part of the silks have my private mark - here are the tickets, with private marks on them, and some are in my own hand-writing; here is this crape scarf I know.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You sell them with the marks on them? A. Yes, but these have not been offered for sale, and I have sold none of exactly this pattern, to the best of my knowledge, but I may - I had one of this colour the night before the robbery; to the best of my belief I had not sold this scarf, and I found it with the goods which I lost that night.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Had you, the day before the robbery, an article of that kind? A. I had, and missed it the next morning - I have scarcely two patterns slike in my stock; I had thirty or forty different scarfs or handkerchiefs, all of different patterns - they nearly emptied the whole box; I have not a doubt that the goods now produced belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. If I had not been persuaded by others, I should not have thought of doing what I did - we were all three together in the White Hart, and Grimley proposed to go to Mr. Katenbeck's - he persuaded me, and I believe Chalk woudl not have done it if he had not been persuaded; I always bore a good character, and never did any thing till I got into company.</p>
               <p>Grimley's Defence. I know nothing of Brown, further then seeing him, the same as others; what he says is false, with regard to me - what has been stated here to my prejudice is false; I never was in Mr. Katenheck's premises, nor near them, except being once outside the house.</p>
               <p>Chalk's Defence. I never saw

             that night, after we went out of Pool's house - I should like to ask the constables if they knew any thing wrong of me before; I had been at work all day, and at night went into Pool's to get a pint of beer - I met a bargeman or two there; Brown and Grimley came in, and we had a pot of beer together; the day I was taken I had been working for - Hun, Esq. - the beer-shop was in my way home; I went home, went to bed, and saw no more of Brown - my sister would have come and proved this, but I did not know the trial would come on.</p>
               <p>Brown. I wish to know if the constables know any thing wrong of me.</p>

On the 12th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, he came to my house - I did not see any horse and cart there; he asked if I knew what an awkward predicament I stood in - I said No; he said there was a man coming to arrest me at twelve o'clock - I did not know what he meant; he told me it was a man, whom he considered I owed money to for rent - I was very much agitated when he told me that, and went out to call on a friend to endeavour to get some money; I called at a place in Market-street, St. James' - I went to endeavour to berrow some money towards paying this man.</p>
               <p>Q.When the prisoner said this, did you not ask him who the man was? A. I knew his name very well; he said a person named Barron was coming to arrest me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe Barron any money? A. I had left him 7l. worth of fixtures, and asked him to let the house, which I occupied of him, before I went to Grosvenor-street - he was the landlord of that house; there was 7l. between us for fixtures - it was not a disputed debt; I left him 7l. worth of fixtures, and asked him to let the house, and make the best he could of the fixtures - I had paid the other quarter's rent, and there was a current quarter running; I was answerable for the ensning quarter, and he was answerable to me for the 7l. worth of fixtures, which would just over the quarter's rent - it was 28l. a year; the prisoner said he had seen Barron, and that he was coming to arrest me; I went to Miss Bunn, a relation by marriage, to borrow the money - she could not accommodate me; I was alarmed, fearing I should be arrested, and went further, but did not get the money that day - I got some lent me the next morning, and went and paid 
               <persName id="t18310512-14-person209">Barron</persName>
             some.</p>

               <p>Q.When you went out, who did you leave in care of your property? A. The prisoner - he was to remain there till I returned; he was in care of my house and furniture, and nothing was to be toueched till I came back - he promised to stay and take care of my house till I returned; I was absent two or three hours, or rather better, and then returned, but my son, who is fifteen years old, had come down to Market-street; when I returned I found all my property gone out of the house - the place was completely stripped of every thing that was there; there was not a thing left.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the prisoner shown you any paper or any thing? A.Nothing at all; he merely said Barron was going to arrest me - the prisoner was gone as well as the property; I went to look for my property immediately - I called on Mr. Eley, in Henry-place, Waterloo-road, about a bill, and there found a pair of sheets; I went there because my son directed me there - Eley's is a private house; I went there again with a Policeman, and found a tea-cannister there, which was mine; I had left the sheets safe at home when I went out - I afterwards found my drawers, my china, blankets, sheets, beds, and almost every thing there; I still miss a number of things; I value all I lost at more than 20l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Eley produce any receipt to you? A. No - I gave him a receipt for 11s. 9d. for meat, because he said he had paid that to the prisoner; the prisoner had no right to take away my property - he was not permitted by me to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Have you ever gone by the name of Simpson? A. No; I know Wooley - he is an attorney; he was employed by me to recover money from one Hill.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at this, which is Wooley's receipt for the debt and coats in an action, Simpson Q.Hill? A. Yes; it was a debt left to me by the will of

            , and Mrs. Simpson went to the court, and administered for me - the prisoner was four or five weeks in my service, and he had formerly lodged with me; I thought him an honest young man - the house I formerly lived in is in Eaton-lane, Pimlico; it was a green-grocer's shop, not a butcher's - I sent the prisoner to give up the key a few days before quarter-day - my property was removed from there at different times; I began to move about the 21st of January, and finished two or three days before quarter-day - I removed some things in the day time; at any time that was most convenient - some were removed after dark, and some in open day; the only reason for removing as I did was, to save the expence of a cart - the greatest part was moved in the day; one bed was taken at night for them to sleep on - I told Barron, a few days after Christmas, that I was going to leave; I often saw him - I did not tell him I was moving things, but he knew it; I gave him a bill to put up in his window at Christmas, to let the house - Barron did not agree to buy the fixtures; I asked him above six weeks before I left to let the house, and make the best he could of them, and he said he would - the greater part of my property was there then; I paid 7l. odd for the fixtures - they are not sold yet, and the house is still on my hands; Barron had one of my cards before I moved.</p>
               <p>Q.You say when you found your things gone, you went to Eley's? A. Yes; I went there as soon as I possibly could - my son had found out the carman who moved them; I did not know Eley - I never saw him but twice in my life before; he had been to my house on the Saturday night before, and bought a piece of beef.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he not been there taking an account of your property? A. No; he did not come and take an inventory of my furniture - I never knew him take an account of it; the first time I ever saw him was on the Saturday night -I never made over my interest in the furniture to the prisoner; I am quite sure of that - a receipt for 20l. was produced to me before the Magistrate, but I knew nothing about it whatever; I saw it at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not that receipt your name to it? whether you choose to admit it was your writing is another question? A. I do not know, for I did not particularly look at it; I said I knew nothing about it - it was put into my hands; I did not swear it was not my hand-writing; I said I knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Tuesday night, the 12th of April, about eight o'clock, the prosecutrix applied to me, and said her property was gone; I went to Eley's with her - Eley was not at home then; I found a pair of sheets there, which she identified; I brought them away; I went again in about an hour, and waited round the house some time; and as Eley was coming home I stopped on the road with the prisoner, and took them both to the station - they were both going together towards Eley's house, and within one hundred yards of it; I searched them, and found some papers on them, in consequence of which I went to Eley's house, and found in three or four different rooms the prosecutrix's property mentioned in the indictment - when I went before there were several girls there, who refused to let me into the rooms, saying the rooms belonged to them; here are the papers - on Dent I found this one, marked A; when he was locked up I searched Eley, and found this one marked B - Dent had told me he had written a paper and given it to Eley; he told me he wrote this paper after he heard I was in search of him - here is another paper which Dent produced before the Magistrate, when asked what he had to say; I was desired to put my name on it, and produce it on the trial.</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Henry-street, Waterloo-road. I wait at different tavern dinners in the City- I rent the house; I have known the prisoner about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q.When did he first speak to you on the subject of these goods? A.About a fortnight before, I think: he showed me a receipt for the goods - he first mentioned about them about ten days or a fortnight before the officer came to my house; he showed me this receipt (looking at it) - he told me they were about to let the shop, and he had got those goods, and did not wish to dispose of them if he could put them somewhere for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q.What shop did you think he meant? A. The butcher's shop; he said he expected a man to give him 15l., and asked if I thought I could take the goods in, and take care of them for him - I told him I did not know whether I should have room, unless I saw what they consisted of; he asked if I would take the trouble to walk up to the house, and look at them - I said I would; he said, "If you go up you had better just set down what there is, and then you will be able to judge whether you can take care of them."</p>
               <p>Q.Could you not have told if he had said, there were so many of such and such things? A. He wished me to go and see; I went to the butcher's shop that evening, and received the goods the day after I went.</p>
               <p>Q.Then it was on the 11th? A. Yes - I never went to look at the property till the night before it was taken; Mrs. Davies was at home - I asked her if George was at home; she said he was not - I asked if he had said any thing about my coming there; she said he had - I had been there before; I asked if George had said any thing about my coming there to look at the things - she said Yes, and she told me what they were as near as she could judge; I just penciled them down in a little book before her.</p>
               <p>Q.And, of course, told her that George was to bring them to you the next day? A. I thought she understood that; she agreed readily to my taking the inventory; I told her that would do - she asked if I would take any thing, and I had some gin; I did not pencil down her wearing-apparel - I put down the shop fixtures, the household goods, beds, and blankets - she quite agreed to it, and told me what they were; she pointed them out herself; they were in the back parlour - I was to take care of the goods for Dent; he had told me he was to dispose of the shop - I saw Dent next morning, and told him what I had done, and in the course of the day Dent sent a note over to me by a lad, and asked me to go and assist to remove the goods - I accordingly went there, and saw Dent; he asked where I could get a van - I said a man lived close by who let vans; the goods were brought to my house - I was at home when they arrived; I have four rooms and a kitchen; Mrs. Davies came to my house about two hours after they arrived, and asked me where George was and the things - I told her I did not know where George was, but part of the things were in my house; I asked her down stairs - she went down and saw a pair of sheets and some little things laying about; I was at home - she said, "These are my sheets;" I said I understood they were Dent's, and all the things - she said,</p>
               <p>"No such thing, they are mine, and I will take them away if you will allow me;" I said, "You had better wait and see Dent, or appoint a time, and when Dent comes in, I will keep him till you call."</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to distribute the property in different rooms? A.I could not put it all into one room - I put some into the yard, some into the back kitchen, and some into the back parlour - I have two lodgers; the things were not found in the girl's room - I have a girl in my house; she is no relation of mine - part of the things were in the back parlour where that young woman was, the rest in the back kitchen and in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.About the 2nd of April this young man first made a representation to you about the things? A. Yes; he told me where the shop was, and said they were his things - he showed me the receipt when he spoke about them; I cannot say it was the 2nd of April - my shop is two miles from the prosecutrix's; I went there about seven o'clock the evening before the goods were moved.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not heard the woman examined to-day; she has sworn she never saw you but once in her life before they were moved, and that was about the purchase of some meat - now is the representation you have made true; did you go the evening before and look over the things? A. I did - if she has sworn I did no such thing in her presence, it is quite a falsehood - I think the goods were moved about two or three o'clock, and the van was hired close by, of a man, within a hundred yards of her house -I have two female lodgers; it was the prosecutrix's son who brought the note over to me the day they were moved- Dent gave me the paper about returning the wearingapparel - when he heard she had been to me, he said, "I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120022"/>order you to give up nothing, but what I have put here"- when I was looking over the things Mrs. Davies told me what there was; I asked if there was any thing particular in the drawers - she said only the sheets that were worth putting down; I did not look at them - she lives in a populous neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.When you took the inventory, was the son there? A. Yes; I recollect Collison and Mrs. Davies' coming to my house, and claiming the goods - I was taken before the Magistrate; when I came in, my wife said Mrs. Davies had been with an officer and taken the goods- I said she ought not to have done so; I told my wife I should go to the station-house, and inquire about it, which I did, and met Dent as I went - I said, "Do you know Mrs. Davies has been and taken the sheets?" he said,"Has she?" I said I was going to the station - we went together, and asked if they knew she had been and taken the sheets - they said Yes, that she had sworn it was her property; Dent said, "I will let her know it is my property," and as we came back an officer said, "George, you are wanted at the station-house," and we went there.</p>

Eley applied to me on the 12th for a van to remove goods, and I went into Little Grosvenor-street, to a butcher's shop - I found the prisoner and Eley at the house; they put the goods into the van, and I loaded them - I considered the things belonged to them; I took them to Eley's house - the prisoner and Eley both followed the van behind I believe; when I got there I unloaded - Eley and Dent were there; the things were taken into Eley's house - I got my money, and went away; I did not see Davies's son when I moved the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near do you live to the butcher's shop? A.

            . I am the prosecutrix's son, and live with her - I assist in her business. Dent lived servant with her; he went away to Greenwich fair, came back again, and then my mother and him parted - I was at home when he said my mother would be arrested for rent, and mentioned Mr. Barron; he said Barron would come the next day at twelve o'clock, with a writ, and arrest her- this was the night before the goods were removed; he came the next morning, (the day the goods were moved) - he said mother had better go out of the way, and she went out to get the money to make up the rent; she spoke about going to Mr. Barron, but he said she had better not - she went out, and I then went over to the Waterloo-road, to take a loin of veal and a shoulder of mutton to Eley's; he (Eley) had come and ordered it the over night - I cannot say how much it came to; I took it over there, leaving Dent at the house with all the goods - I saw Eley's wife at his house when I took the meat, and she said he was not at home; I had not seen him at our house that morning - I had seen him over night; I delivered the meat to his wife and came away - I was at home when it was ordered the night before; Eley ordered it himself - he was about half an hour in the shop; he did not say he had come to take an inventory of the furniture, or any thing of the kind - he came out of the shop into the parlour, and had some tea; I did not see him taking an account of the furniture with his pencil - he did no such thing in my presence; I found him there when I came home - I was not there when he first came; I was there when he had tea.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you return in the morning before your mother came back? A. I returned first - my mother had been to Whitechapel; when I returned I found Dent there - he said somebody had been there wanting my mother, that she was at St. James' market, and I had better go and fetch her; I went, she was not there, and as I came back I met Dent in Bond-street, and asked him who was minding the shop - he said nobody, adn that he had locked it up; he said they had been and taken the goods for mother's rent, and afterwards he told me that he was arrested for 50l., and he did not owe half the money; he said somebody had been, and said it was his shop, and they had come and arrested him for 50l., and come and taken the goods - then he asked me to go with him; I refused, and asked him to give me the key of the shop - he said he should not give it up to any body but my mother, and said he had chucked my clothes on one side, and that was all he could save; he said the goods could be got back for a little money, and then he gave me up the key - I went home, and found the house stripped, but before that he told me he should go to St. James'-market, and wait till my mother came - I told him if he would wait at the market I would go home, and come to him there; I went home, and found the house stripped - I then went to the market; he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q.Had Eley dealt at your shop before? A. I believe on the Saturday night before he bought some meat, but I did not see him then; when I came from St. James'-market I asked the people who moved the goods, and found out Allen - I waited till my mother came home, and told her what had happened; she said she would go over to Eley, and get what he owed her for the meat, towards paying the rent, and on going over we found the prisoner had drawn the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You are quite sure Eley had bought meat twice at your mother's? A. Yes, on the Saturday, and on the night before the goods were removed- I found him there the evening before the goods were removed; I do not think he had been there long - my mother asked him to have tea, because she was at tea; he was there about half an hour after I came home - he was talking about the meat; Dent came there that evening after Eley had been, and it was then he mentioned about the arrest - what I heard about it was that evening; he spoke of it again in the morning when he came, and told my mother she had better go out - he did not say to get the money; when I came back he told me my mother was gone to St. James'-market - I knew she was in the habit of going there; when I met him in Bond-street, he at first said the landlord had been, and taken the goods for rent - he then said he had been arrested for 50l.; there was no van with him - he did not say where the goods were moved; I did not ask him - I took a note to Eley, by Dent's desire, after I came back from taking the meat.</p>

The prisoner was about sixteen months in my service, and left about March, last year; I recommended him to my brother-in-law, and knew him down to the present time - I give him an irreproachable character; I know the prosecutrix perfectly well, and have seen her write - (looking at a receipt) I believe the signature to this to be her hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion have you seen her write? A. While the prisoner lived with me I provided him a lodging at the prosecutrix's, at 2s. a week - there was a dispute about a week's rent; I said if she would send a receipt for what I owed her I would pay it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen her write more than once? A. I had a bill for the lodging sent to me by the boy - I went to her, and she wrote a receipt before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Having seen her write once, you know her handwriting better than she does herself? A. I swear to the best of my belief; the person who wrote it certainly ought to be the best judge - I never saw this recipt till to-day; I was informed of the prisoner being in custody last Friday week or fortnight - I came merely to give him a character; I only speak of this from having seen her write once - it is more than twelve months ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the horse rather unwell? A. He broke out with heat bumps, and the prisoner led him about; he said he was going to Dixon's repository, and he expected two or three more to come up, but he did not say that horse was going with others - he said he expected two or three more were coming up, but whether he expected them to come there or not, I do not know; the Fountain is opposite Clapton-green, near the reservoir- the prisoner never crossed the horse from the time he brought him into the yard; he walked it to and for in the main road; he never offered it for sale, to my knowledge- I never heard him say a word about Mr. Johnson; he said he expected a person there - he said the horse came from towards Norwich.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is not Glapton the high Norfolk road? A. am not able to say whether that, or the Romford road, is- the mail does not go through there, but the Telegraph and the Magnet do; I do not know how many miles it is from there.</p>

(written) I knew nothing of the horse being stolen; it was placed with me to bring to town from Norwich, by a horse-dealer, whom I had seen for several years at the Norwich market, and whom I knew; I knew him by the name of Johnson - in case I had had the least idea that the horse had been stolen from the prosecutor's farm, I would immediately have delivered it to the owner, or Tann, who has known me ever since my childhood, and he well knows that there never was at any time the least charge against my character; I lived at Dunston, in Norfolk, till within the last two years, when I left there and obtained a situation with Mr. Edenborough, of Milk-street, with whom I remained one year - I then went to Mr. Sampson's, and remained with him till I went into the country, and was entrapped into my present unfortunate situation: on the 13th of April I left London to see my relatives, at Wilbarton, in Norfolk - I remained with them till the 27th of April, when I went to Norwich for the purpose of taking the coach to London; I went to a public-house, in St. Stephen's, Norwich - I there saw Johnson, and told him I was going to London; after some conversation, he said he was going to Dixon's repository in London, and I might ride one horse there for him; I slept there that night, and the next morning he placed the horse in question saddled and bridled, in my hands, and said he should catch me on the road before I got to London, this was on the 28th of April - I took the horse and proceeded to London very slowly, expecting Johnson to overtake me; he did not, and I arrived at Lower Clapton, on Saturday, the 30th, at eight o'clock, by day-light; I asked the other to accommodate me till Monday - I told him I brought the horse from Norwich, and how long I was going to stop; he has told you I was not at all private - I led the horse about publicly, and did not secrete myself for one moment; the horse was unwell, and I led him about several days, waiting for Johnson; he did not come, and I took the saddle, went to Dixon's, and inquired for him - I could not hear any thing of him; I then went to Mr. Duffield in the morning; I left the saddle there, called again in the evening, and was given in charge of a constable - had I have been guilty I should not have gone a second time; these are the facts of the case - I did not steal it, it was placed with me by Johnson; I am innocent of the charge, and look with confidence to your verdict for my acquittal - this is the first charge against me.</p>

            . I am a saddler and harness-maker. The prisoner came to me on the 5th of May to dispose of a saddle; I stated to him a suspicion about the saddle and horse - he referred me to Dixon's; I asked where he came from - he said from the Fountain inn, Clapton; that he had a horse there, which he brought from a man named Johnson, near Norwich - I gave information; he came again in the evening, and I detained him. (See Fifth Day, New Court.)</p>

             - he was walking along very slowly, with his hat in his hand; I saw three men approaching him behind- they were before me: when they approached Davies one of them, (I cannot swear which) put his hands on the back of his shoulders, and gave him a gentle push, so that he fell down on his face; he laid straight with his face on the pavement - when he was on the ground they all three, as with one accord, turned him over on his back - I then saw his pockets rifled, and some halfpence fell out, shattered on the pavement: the three men were close to him at the time, all round his person - I can swear to the two prisoners being two of the men that were round the prosecutor; the three men stooped to pick up the halfpence off the pavement - I saw no money except the halfpence; they then walked off, at least I do not know exactly whether they walked or ran - they did not go fast; a Policeman came across the road - I told him of it, and pointed out the three men; I never lost night of them from the time I saw them go from the prosecutor till I told the Policeman - he followed them, and I went with him; I saw him take the two prisoners - I had not lost sight of them; a watchman came up after the Policeman seized the prisoners, and he assisted in taking them to the station - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120025"/>third man ran away down Plough-yard; I saw the prisoners searched, and some halfpence and other money was taken from one or both of them.</p>

It was in Shoreditch, which is a long street; it was not near the end - the prisoners did not turn any corners before they were taken - I do not know why I did not cry Police! or Watch! it was no amusement to me - I was sober; Harknett did not go without my resistance - he did not attempt to ill - use any one, but he made use of very threatening language to me; he said in the morning that he would serve me out; the prosecutor fell down in his way to the station, and I helped him up - I did not see Harknett help him up; I think he could not have assisted him up without my seeing him; I would not swear it did not happen, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How came you out at that time? A.

            . I now live in Rose-lane, but I lived on Saffron-hill at that time. A month ago to-day I was on my way home, in Shoreditch - I had gone a few yards past Plough-yard; there were three men, who let me just pass them, and in the course of two or three minutes I was pushed down right upon my face, and it grazed all the side of my face upon the pavement - they rifled my pockets of an ounce of tobacco, within a couple of pipes, two shillings, and 6d. or 9d. in halfpence; I know there were two shillings, which I had had given me, and which I had never touched - the tobacco was in one waistcoat pocket, the silver in the other, and the halfpence were in my breeches pocket - I identified the prisoners the next morning, and said, "You are the two gentlemen;" I did not particularly observe either of the men who were about me- there was one on one side, and the other on the other; that is all I can say, and I felt them riffing - I had a glimpse of their faces; I could swear to them as soon as I saw them the next morning - the prisoners are the two men; I never said to the contrary, and if it was wrong I would not say it - I was groaming, and the Policemen came up before ever they could make their exit - they caught two of them; as soon as I got up there was a tall Policeman there; I felt my pockets the moment I got up, and said, "My money is all gone;" I had not a sixpence or a halfpenny left.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite correct about that - did not you afterwards find some of your halfpence in your pocket? A. No, I was fairly cleaned out; I did not find 2d. or more, to my knowledge, and I never related any such thing before the magistrate - I might say so, but I am sure I cannot remember it, in my florry; I was stunned - my tobacco was in whitey-brown paper, which will be produced; the prisoners are dressed in a different kind of way now, so that I cannot exactly recognize them, as I could on the first examination; one of them had a fustian jacket on, neither of them have it now, but to the best of my belief, it was Williams; I am a Welchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Shoreditch is a long way from Saffron-hill? A.Very good Sir, we know it is - I cannot say what distance it is; I suppose it is about two miles - it was rather a late hour for me to be out; I had been in company and had had a drop, but I knew what I was about - I was not exactly compus menlis; I was what we call rather fresh - less, perhaps, would have been better- I had a very slight glimpse of them; I was frightened- it was enough to frighten any man; I was hurt, and my face was grazed - there was a watchman and two Policemen, or three, about me when I got up - I think there were three Policeman, to the best of my knowledge; they were dressed in their uniform - I could not mistake a gentleman for one of them; I did not see any gentleman there - I might fall down in going to the station, but I have no recollection of falling and being assisted up by one of the prisoners - my memory is not good enough to tell you; I will not pretend to say - I am sure I do not know that I swore before the Magistrate that I found 2d. in my pocket - I do not remember it; I went before the Magistrate the next day, and I was sober then - what I swore was read over to me; I did not find 2d. in my pockets, to my knowledge - if I swore the next morning that I did, it was not true - I have a great bore, and that is a bad memory; I had drank two or three pints of beer and half a quartern of gin, and it made me a little lively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Perhaps the beer was good strong Welch ale? A. That is very good, Sir- I will not swear I had not had four pints.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable, (No. 181 H.) I was on duty in Shoreditch on the night of the 20th of April - my attention was drawn to the opposite side of the way, by hearing a person moaning - I looked towards the spot, and saw, apparently to me, three or four men on the pavement, on the ground - on going over I saw one man raise himself up, and run off or go off at a quickish pace; Williams then raised himself up and went after him, and Harknett was the last man who left; they rather ran at first, but after they had got a little way they stopped a little, and went on at a walk - I saw Davies laying on the ground, and blood on his face; Mr. Allport spoke to me, and said, "Those three fellows have been rifling this man's pockets," and I ran after them - the third man, who is not here, turned round, saw me coming, and gave Harknett, who was nearest to him, a nudge with his hand, and he started off as fast as he could - I sprang forward, caught the two prisoners, turned them round, and told them they had been robbing the old man; a private-watchman came up at the time, and I told him to take care of Williams - another officer came up, and assisted is taking them down to the station-house; I searched Harknest, and found on him 1s. in silver, 8d. in copper, and a knife, which has not been claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. By your account it was your own observation that directed you to this poor man? A. It was the morning - I was not directed to him by any one; I have stated all that happened in my presence - I have measured the distance from where the prosecutor laid to where the prisoners were taken; it is between sixty and seventy yards - there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120026"/>was no turning till you come to Plough-yard, where the third man shot up; I followed the prisoners, and the private watchman and Crawley came up afterwards - the prosecutor was walking fast to the station; be stumbled, and fell - Harknett assisted him - I believe Mr. Allport went to the station, but he went rather first.</p>

            . I was at that time a Police-constable. I was in Shoreditch on the night of the 20th of April - I went to the assistance of McWilliams; I searched the prisoner Williams at the station-house - I found on him two half-crowns, three shillings, and one farthing; I asked him afterwards whether he had not some tobacco - he said No, he had none; he then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, pulled out a piece of leaf-tobacco, and said that was all he had; I afterwards made a further search, and found some tobacco rolled up in whitybrown paper, in his inside coat pocket - I had seen it before, but I did not meddle with it, because I did not then know that the prosecutor had lost any, but he described the paper it was in, and said he had lost some.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Williams did not make the least resistance to your searching him? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. You have bought hundreds of ounces in your time? A. I cannot say I have not, but this I did not buy, it was given me - it is common shag tobacco, which I always have.</p>
               <p>Harknett's Defence. I am quite innocent - one shilling which I had in my pocket I got of my master when I left work at night, and I had one shilling of him at dinner time, which I had changed.</p>

A soldier passed me at the top of Sloane-street, very drunk, and as he was going across the road he made a stumble, and, I suppose, stumbled four or five yards before he could save himself; I went to him, and said, "Keep yourself up, you are very near the barracks;" I followed him till he came to a pawnbroker's shop - he then passed either a man or woman, I cannot say which - they met him; they struck off the road, and he went to strike the same way, to let them pass - he kicked his toe against his heel, and went sprawling right up against the window; he cleared himself from he window, and ran towards Hyde Park-corner - I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120027"/>up to the shop window; a young man came out, and followed the prisoner - another came out; I went up, and said, "You have lost nothing;" he said No; I said,"Well, I consider it is an accident - the soldier was very much in liquor;" I went on, and saw no more - he was walking before this happened, but was very much intoxicated; I do not recollect seeing Field.</p>

On Tuesday night I was at my master's house in Hunt-street, Mile-end - I got home about half-past ten o'clock, and found the street door open; I went up to my room, which is the back room on the first floor, and found the door open - I had left it locked a little before ten that night; I had been absent above half an hour - my wife was out; I found the prisoner in my room, and another man with him, who escaped - that man was stooping down apparently putting his shoes on; the prisoner was standing alongside him -I asked how they came there; he said my wife had brought them home, and he had sent her down to get a drop of gin - I did not know them before; I asked them to follow me down stairs, and I would go and look for my wife - they followed me down; I knocked at Mr. Johnson's room on the ground floor, and told him I had caught two men in my place - the one who escaped said, "Why you ayn't going to be the fool, as to say we came to rob, have not you been drinking with us all day long?" I said, "No, I have not seen you all day;" Johnson told me to call a Policeman - I opened the door to call one; the prisoner and the other man shoved Johnson down, and ran out, but I caught the prisoner - Johnson came to my assistance, and took the prisoner into his room; they both tried to escape - the Policeman came in about a quarter of an hour; I found two bobbins of shute silk removed off the shelf, and put on the table - the Policeman took it to the station with the prisoner; the serjeant returned with me, and I found I had lost six hobbins of shute, which had also been on the shelf with the others -I have not found them; a skeleton or picklock-key was found in Johnson's room, but not in my presence - I had given my key to the woman in the front room in the morning, and my wife had it afterwards.</p>

I had left home about five minutes; it was safe then; I did not feel it taken, but my brother asked if it was safe - I felt my pocket, and it was gone, and in about a minute I saw the prisoner in company with two others, about his own age - the others were laid hold of, and the prisoner ran away - my brother and I followed him; I saw him in about eight minutes in my brother's custody - I saw my handkerchief down in a cellar, and the servant gave it to me; I know it to be atime.</p>

            . I was walking with my brother up Queen-street, and saw three lads following us - on a sudden I felt a slight touch at my elbow; I turned round, and accused them of picking my pocket, which was not the case - I then asked my brother if his pocket had not been picked; two of them immediately said, "You may search me;" the prisoner, who was the third, immediately ran away, and I after him - I merely lost sight of him in turning the corners; I am confident he is the person - I laid hold of him in about eight minutes, at the corner of Turnwheel-lane, but he had thrown the handkerchief down Mr. Hale's area - I did not see him do that, but am certain he ran by there; it was only just round the corner - my brother saw it in the area; when the prisoner was stopped he asked what business I had to call Stop thief! after him, and when he found we had got the handkerchief he endeavoured to get out of his coat and run off.</p>

I was returning from St. Paul's, and in Cannon-street I saw the prisoner run up Turnwheel-lane, and in about two minutes saw Mr. Magnay running after him - I saw him turn round the corner, take something out of his bosom, and throw it down the area of Mr. Hale's house; he immediately turned back, and met Mr. Magnay - I looked down, and saw the handkerchief lay there; he denied the charge, and said he had not got the handkerchief about him, and did not know why Mr. Magnay pursued him - the handkerchief was produced from the area.</p>

I was in the butter-shop, about nine o'clock, alone - two strange men came in, and asked for a pen and ink to write a receipt - my mistress, who was in the parlour, told me to give it them; they wrote something at the counter, and staid a very short time - they staid outside a little while, and then one said to the other, "You have not written the date;" and they came in to do it - I stood at the corner of the counter, watching the butcher's shop, which is on the other side, but I saw nobody go into it - the property was stolen from there; the door of that shop is taken off during the day - the prisoner is not one of those who came into the butter-shop; I saw a man come out of the window of the butcher's-shop with a bundle - I ran out, calling Stop thief! he ran down Fleur-de-lis-court; two boys, at the top of the court, ran after him, and when I came up I saw he was stopped - I did not see his face when he came out, but he appeared the same in size and dress, rather thinish; nothing was found on him - the prisoner is the man who was stopped.</p>

I was in the service of Mr. Shaw, a copperplate engraver, but lost my place through attending at Guildhall on this business - I was at the top of Feather Bed-lane - I saw the prisoner running, and heard Adams crying Stop thief! the prisoner ran up the lane, and turned down Fleur-de-lis-court - nobody else was running from the cry; I laid hold of his coat in Fleur-de-lis-court, and assisted in stopping him; I afterwards saw the bundle produced - Lyford claimed it; it contained two coats, a waistcoat, a piece of canvas, and two stall-cloths.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you were turned away for coming against the prisoner? A. Yes, it was the first week that I had been with my master - the prisoner was the only person running; the bundle was picked up by the Press coffee-house; the front of which is in Feather Bed-lane - Adams came up in about a moment after; I caught hold of the skirt of the prisoner's coat - there is a gas-light in the lane, and more in the court.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Thirteen- the person had a green handkerchief spotted with red, and I think he wore shoes.</p>

I ran with several people - the two boys laid hold of me; and at Guildhall Mr. Crawford came and said he had a pair of shoes to make for me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say that the prisoner never paid you the 5s. 3d. for that leg of mutton? A. I am, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Mr. Ridley furnished the house with beer? A. No - the prisoner went and fetched a pint of beer when he wanted it; I have a house in Eastcheap, and I live there - I have given up the shop the prisoner was at from the losses I met with; I do not know that he was about to set up in business - he gave notice to his father, and his father came to my house; we had an argument - we had some words; he threatened to take his son instantly out of the house - I deny that I begged him to let him stay a fortnight longer, or I should be ruined, not having a man; I said, "If you please let him remain another week, and I will send my son down to take the money, and see if the charge is well founded;" the shop then answered - his father did not wish to take him away; he gave me the offer - I said,"Let him stay another week," and that I had no one but him to manage the business; I was not in the least intimate with Mr. Ridley, except speaking to him as I passed him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you after this charge make a request that the prisoner should remain with you? A. Yes - he has struck the pen through that 5s. 3d. for the leg of mutton, and he has struck out twenty things that I can get no account of; it is a late invention of his own - the 1l. 18s. 6d. was the money I received that day.</p>

            . The prisoner Gibson was in my employ for eight weeks - he came to me about March; in consequence of information I examined my wine cellar and missed some port wine from a bin - there was a hole in the bin, which communicated to the ale-cellar - it was large enough for a person to put an arm through, and draw a bottle of wine out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What are you? A. A <rs id="t18310512-34-viclabel216" type="occupation">licensed victualler</rs>

               <p>MARK PEACOCK. I lodge at the Tallow Chandlers' Arms, kept by the prosecutor. A few weeks before the 9th of May I saw Gibson in my room - he brought up a bottle of wine, and Smith received it of him; Gibson took out part of the cork and left the other in - they drank part of it; they asked if I would have a drop of wine - they poured some into a tea-cup; I took half a tea-cup full Gibson then went down; I asked Smith how he came by the wine - he said there was a rat hole in the cellar, and they could put their arm through and take a bottle of wine out; I said, "You are robbing Mr. Smith of this wine" - he said, "Never mind, he is a d - d old rogue;" that was all I saw done that day, but I saw four bottles of wine brought up at different times - I told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this bottle of wine brought up, of which you say you partook? A. I cannot tell, it was about three weeks ago - Smith said it belonged to the prosecutor; I do not deny partaking of that, but I did not of the four bottles - I went before the Magistrate against these prisoners, but I was not charged with stealing the wine; I told the prosecutor of it about three weeks after I had partaken of it - seeing more wine coming into the room, I thought it my duty to acquaint him; I had talked to Smith, and advised him not to take it - it was red port wine; I do not know of my own knowledge where it came from - they did not say whether it was paid for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any conversation with Gibson, as to where it came from? A. No further than hearing him speak in the room, and say it came from Mr. Smith's cellar - I am quite clear both he and Smith said that; it was after we had partaken of the wine - Gibson made no secret of it; he said in the room that he was going away very soon, and he would have a bottle or two more.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AVIS. I took the two prisoner into custody; as I was taking Smith before the Magistrate in the morning, he said he had received the wine from Gibson, the pot-boy, and the old man (Peacock) was worse than he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that in Gibson's absence? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Gibson's Defence. Peacock made me drunk two or three times, to get the wine - I kept telling him my master would miss it; he said, "Never mind, you are going away- it won't be missed; and if it is you will not be here to answer for it."</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Peacock charges me for not correcting Gibson, when an old man like him did not correct him, but kept giving him liquor and money to get the wine.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received good characters, and one witness engaged to take Smith into his employ.</p>

               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I am a Police-constable. On the 24th of April I fell in with the prisoners in the City-road, coming towards Finsbury-square; Baker had a bundle under his arm - they were above a mile from the prosecutor's; it was then about half-past two o'clock - I asked him what he had there; he said a blankets, and that his sister, who was servant to Mr. Newbury, at <placeName id="t18310512-39-crimeloc248">Islington</placeName>

               <p>Comerford. Q. Did I tell you his sister gave it him? A. Yes.</p>

This blanket belonged to there, but it is my own property- the two prisoners had been there about six weeks; they were there on the 24th of April, and dined there - I believe Baker to be a good young man, and led into this by others.</p>
               <p>Comerford's Defence. On the 23rd of April Baker was talking to a man in the out place - I saw him give the man 2s., and the man gave him this blanket, tied up in this handkerchief - he took it up stairs, and the next day he took it out, and asked me to go with him.</p>

I drove his waggon, and on the 28th of April I fell in with the prisoner at Hillingdon, just on this side of Uxbridge - he was a stranger; he introduced himself to me, and asked if I was going to town, and what time I should get there - I said at seven o'clock in the morning; he then asked the turnpikeman if there was a coach going to town - he said there was not; he then called to me, and said he should overtake me on the road - before I got to Hillington he came up, and attempted to get into the waggon, but I would not let him; he then went on, and when I stopped he called for a pot of beer - I drank once out of it; there were several local soldiers, whom he seemed to know - we then went on again, and he wanted to ride; I said he might sit on the hay-band - he said he was so beat out that he should like to sleep; he got up into the waggon, with his feet hanging out, and appeared very drowsy - he then asked me to have some more beer or brandy, which I refused; I then got on near the night-house I called the prisoner out, and he came out with a bundle under his arm - I knew he had nothing before; he gave me two sixpences, and bade me good night - when he was gone off I got up into the waggon, and put my hand to feel for a box - it had been within one yard of the front on the near side, and I found it moved to the back and broken open - I ran, and caught the prisoner about two hundred yards from the place; he tried to get away as much as he could, and I told him he had broken open the box - he denied it; I said he should go back - I called the Policeman, and gave him into custody; he wanted to put his hand to his trousers - the officer would not allow him; I saw him take the parcel, containing this shirt and sovereign, from his trousers.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY LAWTON. I am a Police-constable. I saw the prisoner put his hand to his trousers - I said, "What are you about?" he said, "I have something here;" I said,"I will take that" - he gave me this shirt and sovereign; I found another sovereign in his pocket, some halfpence, and a key - he asked where they would send him; I said, "I don't know, perhaps let you go;" he said,"No, they will send me to the Old Bailey, and I shall see some of my palls there."</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was going by a wall in Lower Lisson-street on that evening, about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's - there is on the other side of the wall a garden, attached to a chapel; I saw a bar of soap come over the wall; I stood still, and five more came over - I looked over with my light, and saw the prisoner; I asked what he did there - he said he came over the wall; I asked how he meant to get out - he waved his hand, and said, "Over there;" I went round, through a gentleman's house, and took him in the garden; I had taken up the soap, and took it into the gentleman's house - I did not find the frame, but it was found in the garden, and the soap was thrown from that garden into the street - it was about ten o'clock or a quarter-past.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Was it a dark night? A. Not particularly so - I had a lantern; I did not see another person in the street - it was a public street; I will swear there was no other person but the prisoner in the garden - it is not so large as this Court; the wall is, 1 suppose, twelve feet high from the garden, and about five feet six inches from the street - I got on the wall, and inspected it; the prisoner was taken within five minutes of the soap being found - he was laying his length in the garden; I saw the soap come over the wall, and looked in the garden - there was no one there but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you a manufacturer of soap? A. No, I retail it - I and my wife serve in the soap; she is not here - I am sure this soap had not been sold, because I was in the shop all that night; it was on a cask inside the shop door - I did not see any one come in; here is no mark on the frame, but it is my own manufacture.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I met the prisoner on the 23rd of April, in Pitfield-street. with a bundle under his coat, and having seen him before with bad characters, I stopped him, and asked what he had - he said what was that to me; I insisted upon seeing - I unbuttoned his coat, and took out this shirt, with his duplicate on it, which he tried to get off; I took him to the station, and found Mr. Law.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was it not dusk? A. Yes, rather so, and a great many people were passing - it was on Fleet-street side of the bar; the lady is not here.</p>
               <p>JOHN COLE. I am a Police-constable. I was off duty and merely coming up Fleet-street - I saw the prosecutor, who had a handkerchief a little way out of his pocket; I saw the prisoner, with another person in his company, dog the prosecutor's pocket - the prisoner drew the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket with his right hand; I went to make a grasp at him, and the other man put up his leg, and I fell down - I then lost sight of the prisoner for about half a minute - I took him just afterwards, but could not find the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this? A. It was between Temple-bar and St. Clement's church - the gentleman made a mistake when he said it was on the Fleet-street side of the bar; I lost sight of the prisoner for about half a minute, but he had not got more than thirty yards from there before he was taken - I cannot be mistaken in his person; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That man is swearing my life away - he took me into a bookseller's shop in Carey-street, and said a woman saw me pick the pocket; then he went to Bow-street and said he saw me do it.</p>

               <p>HENRY PARKHOUSE. I went to Mr. Cox's livery-stables for the gig at half-past one o'clock - I got the gig and the coat in it; I did not get in - I led the horse, but kept my eye on the coat till the horse made a plunge; I looked at the horse, then turned to look at the coat again, and it was gone - I saw a man running about ten yards from the gig; I believe it was the prisoner, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Have you not sworn that it was a person stouter than the prisoner? A. No, not who stole it, but a person who had it, and I said directly, "This is not the man who stole the coat" - I did not see any person in company with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a late hour for you to be out? A. I had been spending the evening with a friend- it was moonlight; I was eight or nine yards from the prisoner - I was on the pavement, and the gig in the road; I looked at the gig - there was a third person there.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARTER. I am an inspector of the Police. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner running with the coat on his shoulder - I ran about twenty yards, and I saw Park-house running; I said, "What is the matter?" he said,"I have lost a coat;" I pursued the prisoner, who had then got on to the Admiralty - I saw a tall man with this coat; I said, "That is not the man I saw with the coat"- he said, "No, I have picked it up;" I said, "The man I saw was a short man, with white stockings" - the prisoner was brought back in a minute, and I took him to the watch-house; he feigned drunkenness.</p>

The prisoner was employed on board that vessel - on the 22nd of April I had seventy-nine sovereigns and seven shillings in my locker, in the cabin where I sleep, and the key was in my pocket; I went on shore that day with my crew, leaving the prisoner on board - I returned at ten o'clock at night; the prisoner was then gone - I missed all my money but one shilling, which was left; some boards under my bed were so removed so as to enable a person to reach the money in the locker, by extending his arm - the prisoner did not return to the vessel; I have seen the bag in which the money was deposited, at the Police-office, in the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>JAMES CRAIGIE. I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of April, in Mason-street, Lambeth - I received this canvas bag, and seventy-three sovereigns, from Mrs. Ginnett, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

            . My husband is a Frenchman - we live at No. 10, Mason-street, Lambeth; the prisoner came home to tea with my husband on a Saturday, but I do not know the day of the month - he had tea with us; he had seventy-three sovereigns in a canvas bag, and he shot them out for me to take care of them for him; I gave the bag and sovereigns to the officer - the prisoner left this shirt in the room he slept in, and I gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>JAMES GINNETT. I went on a Saturday to the house of a tailor, next to Astley's theatre; I do not know the day of the month - I met with the prisoner there; he went to my house to lodge, and there produced some money, which he said was prize-money.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MICHAUD. I know this bag by this little knot - I can swear to it by that mark.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a petition for a lenient sentence, expressing his contrition for the offence, which he had unconsciously committed in a state of intoxication.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MICHAUD. He has served me four months, and I will freely take him home to his family - I believe if he had not been drunk he would not have done this; he has had the care of my money, and was honest till this time; I do not recollect whether it was on a Saturday or not, but it was the 22nd - I had received eighty-three sovereigns, and taken four of them; I had seventy-nine taken from the locker - this shirt is mine; I have the fellow to it on.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of April she awoke me at an early hour, by taking my trousers from under my head, where I had placed them over night; I missed a sovereign from the pocket, which I had seen safe when I laid out some money the evening before - I had gone to bed about eleven o'clock; she left the room immediately after the trousers were drawn from under my head - I went after her, and found her in a gin-shop with some low characters; the officer found 8s. 6d. on her - I wish to do her no injury, but to bring her to repentance.</p>

On the 7th of May I received information, and went to the station; I saw the bag of almonds- I knew the bag; it is marked R. - it is a particular mark that we buy; I missed almonds of this description - I had such in my warehouse the night before; I went to the prisoner - as soon as he saw me he said, "Mr. Isaacs, I hope you will have mercy - I took the tiles off the warehouse, and took the bag and almonds;" my warehouse is in the parish of Christchurch, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>HENRY WHITE. I am a porter to Mr. Isaacs.

               <p>THOMAS BICKNELL. I was at the station-house. The prisoner was brought in there, and when the prosecutor came he said, "Is that Mr. Isaacs? pray do not he too hard with me;" I told him what he said must be told to the Magistrate - he then said he took the tiles off, took the bag of almonds, and that to get into the yard he was compelled to get over the yard door.</p>

On the morning of the 23rd of April, I missed seven squares of glass from a summer-house -I have seen one which the officer brought; it was tried, and fitted the place exactly - it had been fastened in with putty, which had been cut away; the summer-house is about four hundred yards from the road - there were eight squares missing; the colour and state of the putty appeared the same on the glass as on the frame - it had been painted green on the frame, and on the glass.</p>

               <p>JOHN PEDDER. I am a Police-constable. I heard the prosecutor call for assistance - I came up to him by the White Horse turnpike; I took the prisoner into custody - on the way to the watch-house she gave me two half-crowns, and when I got there I found two sixpences on her - the prosecutor said she had robbed him of three half-crowns and one shilling.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor wanted to prevail on her to accompany him up a court, and that the money found on her had been given her by a gentleman.</p>
               <p>JOHN PEDDER re-examined. I told her if she had robbed the man to give the money up - she persisted that she had not any thing belonging to him; she delivered two half-crowns to me, and I found two sixpences on her - she did not then say that the prosecutor wanted to go with her - she did before the Magistrate; the prosecutor told me two women came up to him.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH DAY re-examined. Q. Did you ask the prisoner to go with you? A. No, my Lord, it is false, and she was in company with another woman, who took my umbrella; I was quite sober.</p>

               <p>EMILY STEERS. I live in the family of Mr. and Mrs. Kirby, in Bloomsbury-square. I lost a pelisse, three necklaces, a gown, and a brooch, from a small straw box, which was in a large box, at Mr. Tremain's, in <placeName id="t18310512-68-crimeloc417">Southampton-row</placeName>

               <p>DAVID TRAIL. I live with Mr. Aldridge, a pawnbroker, in Orange-street. I have a gown and a pelisse, pawned on the 23rd of April by a woman, but I do not know who.</p>
               <p>JAMES BOLAN. I am a Police-constable, (No. 68, E,) and lodge at No. 14, Castle-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday last, in Maynard-court, Borough - I went with Mr. Tremain in search of her; I asked her a great many questions - she denied every thing she had taken, except the box of beads, which I found under her pillow in that house; I did not find any thing on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who put that box of beads under the pillow? A. No; I did not see the prisoner do any thing with regard to that pillow - there were two empty boxes in the room; I did not see the prisoner do any thing, with regard to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your name and hand-writing? (handing him his deposition.) A. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you see the prisoner do any thing to any box? A. No, Sir - in going up stairs my foot slipped, the prisoner went forward, and I suspect she went to the box, took it out, and put it under the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q.Then if you have sworn that you saw the prisoner go to a box in the corner of the room, take something out of it, and then slip it under the pillow of the bed, is that true? A. No, Sir - I had no conversation with her; I questioned her a good deal - I am sober; the prisoner said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not ask if she had any thing about her? A. I asked where the duplicates were, and she said she had destroyed them.</p>
               <p>SUSAN BAYFORD. I am single, and live in the same service with the prosecutrix - my master has the occupation of a room at Mr. Tremain's, in Southampton-row; I am sent there occasionally. There was a trunk there containing these articles, and some other things - it was not locked; I recollect the pelisse, the gown, and the little straw box, containing the necklace and brooch, being in it- I went to that room on the 5th of May; I saw something on the table, which directed my attention to the trunk - I found the things had been taken out of it, and were very much rumpled; I missed these articles - I saw the gown and pelisse at Mr. Aldridge's; I had not known the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TREMAIN. The prisoner was in my service, at No. 6, Southampton-row. She came on the 16th of April, and left on the Monday week following - the property stated was in a trunk in my front attic, which belonged to Mr. Kirby - it was there while the prisoner was there; I went with the officer when the prisoner was apprehended; I saw the officer coming down stairs with the little straw box in his hand - the prisoner's father and mother lived there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Thomas Gallagher told you Moran and the deceased had been pitching into him, and Moran said the deceased and Gallagher had a row in his house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a serjeant of the Police. On the morning of the 24th of April I was fetched to this court by Gillday; I got there about nine o'clock in the morning, and found the court full of people - I inquired where the fight was, and was told at No.4; I went to No.4 - the door was closed; I asked for admittance - Mrs. Moran asked my business; I said I understood a man was either killed or dying - she said there was nothing the matter, there had only been a spree with a couple of her lodgers, and that the man was not dead - I then shoved the door, and it opened; she then said, "Now you may come in;" I said, "I don't thank you for that," because I had opened the door myself - I entered the front room on the ground floor, where Mrs. Moran lived, and there saw a corpse laying across the bed; I felt the man, and he was quite cold, both his breast and forehead - I then saw blood on Mrs. Moran's arm, from her elbow to her wrist, and took her into custody; I took her to the station-house, when I got assistance; I went for a surgeon to inspect the body - Moran's husband had gone away then; I had seen him when I first came into the court, but did not know he was her husband; after I came from the station I took Moran into custody - I found him at the bottom of Bedfordbury; he had not gone away - he also had blood on his hands, and was apparently in liquor; I could not say he was drunk, but he had been drinking - I took hold of him; he said he would not be handled by a Policeman, but I still held him, and took him to the station; by order of the superintendent, I went back to search the house - I then found the stick produced under the bed where the deceased was laying; the superintendent came afterwards, and found the iron server belonging to it, not far from where the stick was; he turned the bed up, and found it - when I found the stick it was in the state it is now in, with a few drops of blood on it, and the server had some hair to it; it appears to me to he human hair - it adhered to it quite close, as if it had been a blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you had that stick ever since? A. No, it has been locked up in the superintendent's room - we have not washed it; here is the mark of blood - the stick is split at one end - I only know that I found it; I cannot say in whose hand it had been - Mrs. Moran might have soiled her hand with blood if she had laid hold of it; human hair is sometimes used with mortar, I believe, for a shift - the server is used to scoop mortar; it had been in mortar - there are only small particles of mortar on it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.You expected to find the deceased at No. 4, living or dead? A. Yes - I pushed the door open with my hand; I gave one push, and it opened - the room is four or five feet from the outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had received an injury, and was taken into the house, is it not very probable he would be taken into that room? A. Yes; there is another room on the side, but that is a sitting-room; there were a great many lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any fresh or moist mortar on the server, to which the bair could be? A. No- the bair was on the edge of it; I did not compare the hair with any thing.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SADLER THOMAS. I am a superintendent of the Police. I went to Brewer's-court with a party of officers, on receiving information, about a quarter-past nine o'clock - I found a great number of persons assembled in the court, and considerable confusion; I entered the house No. 4, and found a dead man laying on the floor - I observed his face and neck greatly discoloured, and a slight contusion on the right side of the nose; his face appeared to have been recently, but very imperfectly, washed - I inquired who had done it; the female prisoner was present - I was answered by several voices "Thomas Gallagher;" I inquired for him, and was answered by Ann Moran, "Oh, he is off - you will not get him;" I then ordered the officers to guard the house, and suffer nobody to escape; I secured every person in the house - Wilson took Mrs. Moran and Martin Moran came, having promised Wilson he would do so; I examined the apartment, and in the room facing Moran's, on the left, I perceived marks of fresh blood on the wall - there were three beds in that room; I found the server in Moran's room, under the bed, which was then turned up - the body was on the floor when I entered; I examined the body more particularly, and found a wound on the back part of the skull - it appeared a sort of bruised wound, which might be made with a stick, and certainly not with an iron cutting instrument; I found this hair on the server (producing three hairs) - I saw several spots of what appeared to me to be blood in the front of Ann Moran's dress; it might have happened by her moving the deceased about, if he had been brought in wounded; on the following morning she had either sucked or washed out those stains - I sent an officer for Thomas Gallagher, and he brought him in in half an hour.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURDOCK. I apprehended Thomas Gallagher at the Three Augels, in Long-acre, about half-past nine o'clock that morning - it is about five minutes' walk from Brewer's-court.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to view the body of the deceased; two other gentlemen were present - I made notes of my examination; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120044"/>appeared to have been a stout, well-formed, healthy man - I found a wound on the head, which had penetrated some depth into the scalp; on moving the scalp, there was a considerable quantity of blood or serum, also on the chest; it is my opinion that the cause of his death was the extravasation of blood on the brain, and that external violence such as blows or a fall would cause.</p>

               <p>GEORGE DOUCHEZ. I am a surgeon, and assisted Mr. Bainbridge - I agree perfectly with his evidence.</p>
               <p>PATRICK BARRETT. I am a surgeon, and was present; I agree with the evidence given.</p>
               <p>Thomas Gallagher's Defence. I struck in my own defence - he struck me first for not giving him some of the gin which the women sent me out for.</p>
               <p>Edward Gallagher's Defence. I stand before the bar of justice with a clear conscience, and am innocent of the charge; on the morning in question, between seven and eight o'clock, I, and one of my fellow lodgers, went into the Black Horse, at the corner of May's-buildings - I returned home about eight o'clock with three loaves under my arm; I brought them into the second floor front room of the house, where this transaction happened, and from that time was never in the court nor down stairs till the Policeman came, about nine o'clock, so that I know no more about it than a man in France; White has merely come for the sake of her expences, to swear my life away - no man in the court can say there was a row there when she says she saw me and my brother strike the deceased; she could not identify me at the first examination, when Sir Richard Birnie told her to point out the two men whom she saw strike the deceased - she could not point out one; I am a very remarkable man, and can be known among two or three people - she could not identify my brother, till Mr. Thomas said, "Did the man wear a straw hat?" Yes, said she - whatever Thomas asked, she said yes to, whether it was right or wrong; she did not point me out- I was remanded from the first examination till Wednesday, when I was brought up, but not examined; I was brought up on the Thursday, and discharged with others from the bar, and as I went home to my lodging, by the Horse and Groom, two Policemen came and said, "You are the man we want," and that I must come back - I went with them to Covent-garden watch-house; Mr. Thomas had the woman up stairs - he fetched her down, and pointing to me, said, "Is that the man?" "Yes, (said she,) that is the man who struck him in the court," and on the inquest she swore there were four men, besides me and my brother, striking the deceased - but at Bow-street she swore it was only two men holding him, and the others striking him; the witnesses against my brother can swear there was no row in the court - I have proof that I was in my chair, fast asleep, when it happened; my landlady and three others can swear I was not down after I brought the loaves up, till after it happened - I did not know what was the matter till I was in the watch-house; I never saw the deceased in my life, to the best of my knowledge - I hope, my Lord, you will weigh it in your bosom; why did not the woman identify me at first? I am remarkable enough to be known - White, I understand, is a very bad character; I sent a person to her last week, and she said she might make a mistake.</p>

               <p>Martin Moran's Defence. I know nothing of the business - I went out at half-past six in the morning, and left two lodgers in the room with my wife; I never came back till half-past eight or a quarter to nine, and all the people in the house were then taken prisoners - the Police man asked if I was landlord of the place; I said, I was - he told me to come with him.</p>
               <p>Ann Moran. Dockery brought in two women in the morning, and he had the bonnet of one of them in his hand - I said, "Who owns that bonnet?" he said, "That is my business" - I said, "I don't want you bringing in women intoxicated to my place;" one woman said, "Never mind, sendout for 6d. worth of gin" - I said "I don't want gin;" he told

             to go out for 6d. worth - he was a long time gone; the women asked what kept him so long - somebody said something about the women taking the gin in the street; Dockery said, "Never mind, if Gallagher don't bring it in he will be sorry for it" - one of the women said, "Never mind it," and the two women walked out; when

             came in, they began words - I told them not to be at words on Sunday, and if my husband came in he would kick up a row with me; Dockery said they had a right to do as they liked in their own place - Dockery struck Tom Gallagher; he returned the blow, and struck him - the back of his head came against the bedstead; I ran out and said, "I will not have a row in my house" - I went to the bottom of the court, but could not see a Policeman; I said, "Oh, Murder! here is Tom Gallagher will be murdered! send for a Policeman to take them away" - as I came back Tom Dockery had the man out at the door; I saw no wounds - I asked what was the reason they were going so far with it, and who brought him out - "Who did, (said Tom,) but those that were able to do it?" - Mrs, King and I brought the man into my house; no Policeman was to be found - I have plenty of proof that my door was wide open when the Policeman and doctor came; some of the blood came on my arm in carrying him in, but I had no part in it.</p>

On the 20th of March I missed a pencil-case and handkerchief; I spoke to her about them, but she denied all knowledge of them - she remained with me three weeks after that; I kept losing property, and said it must be her- she absconded on Sunday evening; I saw her again on the Wednesday following, the 20th of April, at her sister's, Mrs. Foster's, Liquorpond-street, and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.She was bound to you by the parish? A. Yes; I was not a Policeman then - I went into the Police last September twelve months, and gave up my business, but my wife instructed her in binding; I occasionally follow the business now, when I get a job - she was not apprenticed to my wife; when I missed her I went to look for her - her sister said she lived in Elm-street, but I could not find her there - her sister afterwards fetched me to where I found her; I asked what she had done with the pencil-case - she said she had never seen it; she never confessed it to me - I did not intreat her to return to me, saying I could not go on with my business without her; I saw her at her sister's on the Wednesday - I asked if she had not sold the pencil-case for 2s. - she said No; I asked what she had done with the handkerchief - her sister said, "Oh, that is all right - she has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120046"/>pledged it;" I did not say she worked better than my wife - I thought it would be indecem for me to take her into custody; I felt for her, and believe if she had good parents to instruct her, she would be a good girl - I prosecute her because this plunder has been carried on for two years; she had not been a month with me before she destroyed her indentures - Mrs. Green lives opposite me; I never spoke to her till the Tuesday. when she told me she had seen the prisoner with the handkerchief; the prisoner's sister came on Tuesday, and said she would be answerable for her appearance on Wednesday, and on Wednesday I went there by appointment, to take her into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you went by appointment to give her into custody? A. Not to give her in custody; I have not sworn so - I did not meet her to know if she would accept my pardon, and return to my employ; not a word of the sort passed - her sister wished me to do it, but I said I would not, for I said I thought some punishment was necessary, and I took an officer there with me - she denied taking the pencil-case till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was in your service, how many rooms did you keep? A. I at first had two parlours, a back room, and kitchen - the prisoner slept in the front parlour, with my wife's mother; but when I joined the Police I moved to the west-end of the town, and I had but one room for myself, my wife, three children, and the prisoner; I find no fault with her for work.</p>
               <p>MARY GREEN. I live in St. Ann's-court. The prisoner came to my house, I think in March - she said she was going to her mother's, and had no pocket-money - she wished to sell this pencil-case, which she said was given to her by a lady as a keepsake, with a Hymn-book; I gave her 6d. then, and afterwards 2d. 3d. and 1d. - she gave me the handkerchief to keep till next day, when she had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long had you known her? A.Since Christmas; I merely bought this to oblige her, promising she should have it again at any time, if she gave me the money - I offered to lend her the money and not take the case; it was of no use to me - she pressed it on me; she had shown it to me nine days before, and said Mrs. Flood was in the habit of taking it from her, and giving it to the children to bite when they were cutting their teeth; none of the shilling I gave her was spent in gin on my premises, but that evening Mrs. Foster sent for a quartern of gin; she insisted on doing so - I am not in the habit of drinking; Mrs. Foster paid for it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOSEPH WEST. I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge on the 20th of April; Green gave me the pencil-case.</p>

               <p>JOHN FLOOD. Mrs. Foster did not come into my house on Tuesday - she came into the court, and sent for me out of bed.</p>

I saw the prisoner have a cap in her hand, which was missed when I had done serving them - I counted the caps and found eighteen instead of nineteen; I gave them to the boy Parrott to count, thinking I might make a mistake - he made but eighteen; I called Mr. Brown, and asked him to count them - I examined them, and found the cap missing, was one I had put a pin through the private-mark; there was no pin in any of the others - I then finished serving them; I made out the bill - they did not pay me, for I immediately missed another cap; I went from behind the counter, and said the caps must be found - I requested them to walk into the passage; Mr. Brown opened the door, and they went into the private passage - the prisoner sat on the stairs; they had not been in the passage ten minutes when the servant came up from the kitchen stairs, and I saw her pick up a cap - those stairs go down quite close to where the prisoner sat; the cap was rolled in a ball, as if squeezed up in the hand - I put it into my pocket; it was one of the caps they had not approved of; I had sent for an officer, who searched them, but we did not find the other cap - the two other women stood by the shutters; if they had thrown the cap down I think I must have seen them - they were about three quarters of a yard from the prisoner; she could have thrown it down without my seeing her - she was nearest to the stairs; they were all taken to the Compter and searched, but the prisoner's sister was discharged at the Compter to appear at Guildhall, which she did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you stand when they were in the passage? A.Opposite them and nearer the door than them - the prisoner was nearer the stairs than I; I cannot say I had my eyes on them all the time - the cap could not have fallen where it laid if the others had thrown it down; as the servant stooped down, I went to the stairs and saw the cap laying - I went and told Mr. Brown, leaving them in the passage, but the door was locked; I said to the servant "This is the cap I have lost," - I whispered.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARROTT. I am twelve years old. When Church went to the window I saw the prisoner take the cap off the counter - I was standing close by her; I had not time to mention it - I counted the caps, by his desire, on the counter; there were only eighteen - the prisoner went into the passage with the other women; I did not go with them- I saw the prisoner slide the cap off the counter on the floor, and then stoop down to where it dropped, but am not positive that she took it up; I only judge so by the motion of her arms - I went for an officer, and they were all three taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where were you standing? A. Against the passage door - the counter was between me and them; there is a counter on each side the shop - they were at the counter nearest the passage; I cannot say which cap I saw in her hand, whether it was the one she bought.</p>


               <p>LUCINDA PLACE. I was in the prosecutor's service. -While the prisoner and two others were in the passage I came up from the kitchen, and went into the parlour with the tea things; I saw something on the second stair - I took it up; it was a cap - Church took it out of my hand; the prisoner stood nearer to the stairs than the other women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did you say to Church when you picked it up? A. I said, "This is not mine" - he said, "That is the cap I lost;" I do not know that he spoke low - I should think every one in the passage must have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he address himself to you or the prisoners? A. To me.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PARROTT. I am an officer. I took charge of the prisoner and the others - one was allowed to go and appear next day: the other woman was her mother - the cap was delivered to me; there was nothing pinned to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was one pin? A. I did not notice any.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHURCH. This is the cap - here is the paper pinned on it now, in the same state as when shown to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an unexceptionable character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You saw the sacks on the cart tied up? A. Yes, and I counted them tied up - I saw thirty sacks on the cart.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS BREWER. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Kensington Gravel-pits - I ordered some corn of Mr. Lucas; I think more than fifteen quarters, but I am not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120048"/>certain. On the evening of the 8th of April Taylor brought some corn - he gave me a note of ten quarters of one sort, and five of another; I saw the cart was loaded, and asked him if that load was all for me - he said it was; I saw him unload it, but while I was counting the sacks he brought in, I was called to speak to a person, and I lost my tale - when the person was gone, I said to the prisoner,"How many more sacks of that sort have you unloaded?" and he said, "I will count the sacks, and see;" while he was doing that he said to a lad, "Here is one sack, marked R.M., which is not to come out;" I did not see any mark on it myself - I did not say any thing to him; he went on unloading till he had finished all that he said was the five quarters - he then unloaded the ten quarters till I think there were but three sacks left in the cart; I said to him, "How many more sacks are for me?" he said two more; it was then I observed that there were three sacks in it - my attention had been called away, so that I had not observed what were delivered of the first five quarters; I saw the ten delivered - he then proceeded to deliver the two sacks, and I asked him how far he was going with the other sack; he said not far - I again said,"Who is it for?" he said, "For Mr. Sturm," who is a baker, living in the Gravel-pits not far from me - I had not at that time any means of knowing that I had not received the fifteen quarters, and I signed the return-note of the fifteen quarters; part of the oats were shot in the shop, and part up stairs - they were not disturbed till they were afterwards measured; Taylor shortly afterwards passed by my house with the cart, but it was dark and I could not see whether any thing was in it; in consequence of the return of Taylor I went myself to Mr. Sturm, and then desired my brother to follow the cart - in consequence of what my brother said, we measured on the Saturday the five quarters of oats which had been first delivered, one sack of which had been pitched in the shop, and the others had been delivered up stairs; we found one sack short of those which were shot up stairs -I did not measure the ten quarters, as I had seen them delivered, and was satisfied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.How soon after the delivery of the whole was it that you signed this note? A. Directly - the ten quarters I did not measure; they were not of the same description as the five quarters, which were Irish oats, and the ten were Scotch potatoe oats - I should think a sack of the five quarters was not shot amongst the ten quarters; I do not see that I can swear it was not - two other persons serve in my shop; the corn which goes out I as often serve myself as any body - it was on Friday night I received the corn; Saturday is sometimes a busy day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You say he went on, and it was dark - now, supposing he had a sack in the cart when he went away, could you tell that he had not disposed of it before he returned by your door? A. No, I cannot - I did not observe whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a great difference between Irish oats and Scotch potatoe oats? A. Yes - if I had seen any Irish oats mixed with the Scotch potatoe oats, of course I should have known them.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live in Blackfriars-road - Taylor was in my service. I remember his going with these oats to Mr. Brewer's, but I was out the whole of that day; he had no orders to deliver oats to Mr. Sturm, or any other person.</p>

            , at Kensington Gravel-pits. In consequence of what my brother said on the 8th of April, I followed Taylor's cart, (which had gone past his house,) to the Swan, at Bayswater - it there stopped; I concealed myself on the opposite side of the road, and in a few minutes I saw Mantell come over the road and take a sack of something up from behind some heaps of dirt, near to where I was concealed - he took it down the Swan stable-yard; he then came out, looked cautiously around him, took an empty sack from under his arm, and threw it into Mr. Lucas' cart; I was about twenty yards from the cart - it was dark; I saw there was something in the cart, but could not tell what - Taylor soon after came out of the Swan; Mantell and he had some conversation while Mantell put the reins on the horses' heads - Taylor then went on with the cart; I followed, and overtook him - I asked him to let me have a ride, that I might see if there was any corn left in the cart; he gave me leave - I got into the cart; there was no corn in it, but some empty sacks put into one sack, and one single sack close on to the tail-ladder, where I supposed the sack was thrown by Mantell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were the lamps lighted? A. Yes - it was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>HENRY LAPTON. I am a Police-constable. I took Taylor at Mr. Lucas' on Saturday. the 9th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, and asked what he had done with the sack of oats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Did you hold out any hope or threat to him? A.None; I did not tell him it would be better to tell the truth - I did not caution him that what he said would be given in evidence; Mr. Lucas was present.</p>
               <p>MR. LUCAS. I was with the officer when Taylor was taken; I told him I would know the truth, and that I knew more than he was aware of - I said if he would tell me the receiver of the corn, I would pass over this.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.How long was that before you delivered him to the officer? A.About ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour; I did not hear him say any thing to the officer.</p>
               <p>Mantell's Defence. I went over the road, and took up the sack which Mr. Johnson's waggoner had thrown out of the waggon; I took it into the stable to their horses - three or four persons come and leave their corn there.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRIS. I am waggoner to Mr. Johnson, a carrier. I bait at the Swan, where my master rents a stable - Mantell is ostler there; on the night of the 8th of April, I stopped there as usual to bait - I took the sack of bait there that evening, and threw it on the ground, as I do every night; Mantell is no relation of mine - I recollect this was on a Friday, because I go three times a week; I stopped there about nine o'clock in the evening - I did not carry the oats into the stable, because I had to secure the things in my waggon, and fasten it up behind; there was no cart of Mr. Lucas'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120049"/>there at that time - the sack was taken up while I was there, and I went into the stable and gave the horses the oats.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BREWER re-examined. Q. How far from your brother's premises is the Swan? A. About one mile - it is in the way back to Mr. Lucas'; a waggon drew up to the Swan at the time I was there, but I did not see what it was loaded with, or who was with it - I did not see any thing put out of it; the sack that was on the ground was ten or fifteen yards from Taylor's cart, exactly opposite to it, not on the side the Swan is - the waggon was on the same side as the sack, and nearer to it than the cart.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 13th of April I was on duty in Maiden-lane, about a quarter-past five o'clock - I saw the prisoners coming across the fields from Holloway; they had each of them a bag - when they came in sight of me, they put their bags over Mr. Brand's garden wall; I took hold of Bagshaw by the collar, and made a grasp at Freeman - I caught hold of the sleeve of his coat, but he got away; I took Bagshaw into Mr. Brand's house, and asked what was in the bags - he said he did not know, they had picked them up, but had had no time to see what was in them; I found the two bags in the garden - one had six fowls it, and the other eight; they were quite warm - I found this wrench and a knife in a small bag in Bagshaw's pocket; in consequence of some information from him I sent after Freeman, and I am quite positive he is the man who was with Bagshaw - I described a piece sewn in the back of his coat collar, and his shoes were cut as if he had corns; I decribed him to my brother officer, and identified him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. Q.What time was it when you first saw me? A.About half-past five o'clock - you were coming towards the lane, and I hid myself; there was a hay cart going along; I followed it till I got near you, when you threw the bags over the wall - I was within twenty or thirty yards of you.</p>
               <p>Freeman. Q. Did you say you tore the sleeve of my coat? A. No - I caught it, and you got from me; you had light shoes on, and they were cut - I do not know what for; I asked Bagshaw who the man was who was with him - he said he had no one with him; I asked him again; he said it was Freeman, and asked if I knew Nelson-street; he said there was a little passage, leading from there to Pickford's wharf, and if I went there between nine and ten o'clock, I should find him - I have no doubt of Freeman's person; when I took Bagshaw by the collar, I struggled for five or ten minutes with him - I took him into the house, and tied his hands, then went and got the bags.</p>
               <p>JAMES COLLINS. I am a Police-constable. In consequence of information from King, I went to No. 3, George-place, City-road, and apprehended Freeman - his shoes were cut as my brother officer had described, and they had a deal of dirt on them, which was quite wet- I did not take much notice of his coat.</p>
               <p>Freeman. When he came in, he said I was wanted at the station-house, to prove that a man named Bagshaw was going out that morning with a person named Jones; he felt my things, and they were quite dry. Witness. I did not mention any name, for I did not then know the name - I said he was wanted, and then he began to scrape his shoes, which were wet and dirty, as if recently worn; I did not feel his things.</p>

The fowls the officers produced to me were Mr. Varley's; I had seen them alive when they went to roost, between eight and nine o'clock at night, on the 12th of April - they were then locked in; there are some fields which lead down to Maiden-lane - I missed the fowls, and spoke to some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120050"/>officers; I then heard that some men had been taken with fowls - I saw them, and knew them; I had seen the whole fourteen alive the night before - the staple of the hen-house had been drawn; it had always been kept locked night and day - there is a large pair of gates to the stable-yard.</p>

            . I am a hoop-header, and live in Caroline-street, Brook-street. I heard an alarm of Stop thief! from a female voice, upwards of one hundred yards from Parker's shop, and found a piece of cheese six or eight yards below my door - it was picked up about half way between Parker's shop and where the prisoner was stopped; the crowd passed in that direction, but on the other side of the way, I presume, I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.About how many persons did you see altogether running? A.About four or five, I suppose - a neighbour was standing at his door, and some other persons were standing about; I set the cheese on the step of the door, and spoke to my neighbour - I then took it to the prosecutrix.</p>

On the 18th of April I sent the two prisoners with my cart to Kentish-town, to fetch half a dozen water-pipes from the water company - I gave Russell 2l. in silver to pay for the pipes; Haynes was not present - I afterwards met Russell on Hampstead-heath; he appeared rather fresh in liquor - he told me he had put the water-pipes into a field, which I rent of Mr. Platt; I asked him for the bill - he said Haynes had got it; I called him back, and said, "You must have it;" he then gave me a bill, amounting to 1l. 18s. - Haynes was afterwards brought to me by a Policeman; he was not intoxicated - I showed him the bill; he said it was correct - he said I was not going to take him to the watch-house, he had done nothing wrong; I told the officer to take him - I said the right price for the pipes was 1l. 4s.; he did not say that he had nothing to do with the bill - he had only had a little beer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say Russell was quite in liquor? A. Yes; so much so that I would not trust him to town with my horses and cart - that was before I knew how this transaction was; he can write; I have seen him set down things - I should not have liked to take a bill of his writing in that drunken state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long was it after this that Haynes was brought in? A. I saw Russell between one and two o'clock - Haynes was brought about five; I had spoken to Haynes about the pipes on the Sunday, and asked what they would come to - he said about 2s. a foot, which proved to be as near the price as could be; Haynes can neither read nor write - he said he knew nothing about the bill, but when I stated the amount of it he said it was all correct - I had been to Kentish-town, and got the right bill; this case was heard at High-street; they admitted Haynes to bail, and strongly recommended me to drop the prosecution, as the men were in that state, but I have lost a great deal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what money did you give the 2l.? A. All in silver; there were shillings and half-crowns - I do not charge the prisoners with having received any money for me - I can swear I gave him 2l. in silver; I cannot swear I gave him any shillings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor pass that way also? A. Yes - this was a quarter of a mile from where he said he had lost it; I did not hear what silver he stated at the watch-house, for I went out - the prisoner came to Guildhall the next day, voluntarily.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prosecutor say how much money he had lost? A. He said about 1l. 7s., in a green purse, and the prisoner gave me 1l. 6s. 6d.</p>

I was officer of the night, on the 2nd of May - the prisoner and prosecutor were brought into the watch-house, between ten and eleven o'clock; the prosecutor was very drunk - the watchman said he had 1l. 6s. 6d. given him by the prisoner; I asked the prosecutor if he knew the sovereign - he said it had a cross on it, and there was a half-crown in the silver he had been robbed of; I found no mark on the sovereign, nor any half-crown - he strongly persisted that he had been robbed, but he did not know that this was the woman; I searched her, but found nothing on her - I asked if he would give charge of her; he said, "No, I don't want to hurt her, nor to be exposed;" he then said, "Give me the sovereign, you can keep the 6s. 6d. among yourselves;" the prisoner said the money was hers - I pressed him to give charge; he said he would not - he was going out, but seemed much dissatisfied; the inspector then searched her again, but found nothing - she still claimed the money; I asked her if I might depend upon her coming the next day to Guildhall - she said I might, and I let her go; in three quarters of an hour the other watchman brought in the purse and the duplicates - the prisoner came to Guildhall the next day as she promised.</p>

            . I am a widow - my husband died on the 5th of November; he was a stay-maker, and worked for Mr. Gold - he left me some furniture and other things; I know the prisoner and his wife - she had been backwards and forwards to her sister and brother, who lodge in my house; in order to send my husband up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120056"/>to Richmond, I was obliged to sell a pair of sheets to the prisoner's wife, but she was not Mrs. Morris then; I only knew her by the name of Margaret - the sheets were marked R., No. 2; these are the sheets - I know them, but I cannot swear to the mark, as I cannot mark myself; I know these sheets - I sold them in October, and they were marked in this way; I had had them five years - she gave 10s. for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to have these sheets? A. I bought them of Mr. Cockin five or six years ago - I do not deal in sheets; I sold two pairs of sheets in all - I had not had them in my possession above a month; I heard that Margaret left her brother to be married to the prisoner; I knew he lived at Mr. Walker's, as he used to come to his brother's to dinner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You stated you had had them five or six years, and then you said one month? A. They had been in pawn three or four years; I had them at home a month - I was going to pawn them again, but I said I would rather sell them; the other pair was marked with red, and they were left me by my mother - this pair are marked R., No. 2, and these I bought in Blackfriars-road.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was coming from Petticoat-lane to Aldgate church, and heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner came right up to my face- he was running, and turned short into Black Horse-yard - I pursued, and took him in the gateway; a small struggle ensued, and he stooped to throw something down, but I could not see what - a great crowd collected; I pushed him into Mr. Manning's shop - the prosecutor came, and said, "Have you got my watch?" I said, "No, I saw him drop something, but I don't know what;" I begged a gertleman to go and look, telling him where I had seen something dropped - one of the persons brought in the watch, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know who brought it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120057"/>back? A. No, it was a gentleman whom I begged to go and see what the prisoner had put down - I swear he did not say, "Here is the watch - that young man knows nothing of it;" I begged the gentleman to go round the corner and look for the watch, but I do not know where he did go - when I heard the alarm no one was running before the prisoner - some persons were pursuing him; I did not state before the Magistrate that I saw him running with others - I was not running; he faced me - I do not think I stated he was running with others; if I did I did not speak the truth - I really do not think I did say so.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I saw her alive on Monday morning, the 7th of March, about eight o'clock - she appeared in her usual health; I saw her dead on the Wednesday - after her death was discovered I went up stairs, found the place all ransacked, and things taken out of the drawers - she had two feather beds in the house, one she slept on, and the other belonged to my sister, and was there for sale; I found both those beds gone.</p>

Yes, a very good temper indeed - I always saw him kind and attentive to his mother; I never heard him speak an angry word to her - I have received the money from the Saving's-bank; I found the document which enabled me to do so on the premises; it appeared to me that the parties had been there to ransack the house as well as destroy her.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What kind of a document was this? A. It was a book, and was in the same box with her leases - I have administered, or should not have got the money; I have five brothers and sisters, two by the first marriage, and three by the last.</p>

            . I am apprenticed to the prisoner. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he told me I was to go with him to do a job, but I did not know when I went out where I was going- he took me to his mother's house, Lisbon-street, Dog-row; he knocked twice, and the second time the door seemed to open a little, and then he went in and called Mother! mother! - I was outside the door, about two feet from it, on the pavement; I could see into the room, and saw blood on the floor - he told me afterwards that it was blood; I should not have known it was blood - it was a yellowish cast; he first said Mother! mother! then said,"Oh, God! my mother is murdered, run and get assistance" - this was before he told me it was blood; it had a cloth upon it - he was not out of my sight all the while he was in the house; when he said "My mother is murdered," he was just on the near side of the blood, which lay close up to the cupboard, (here the witness pointed out, on a plan of the premises, the siluation where the prisoner entered); I could not see, where I was, whether the door leading to the adjoining room was open or shut - the door opens towards the outside of the shop; he never went out of the first room; he said, "Look there is the blood," and then I came away with him and went to the public-house - he then ran over to Mr. Cross at the chandler's shop, and spread an alarm about the neighbourhood; he sent me to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner in the room? A. It was so momentary I cannot tell - I should think about three minutes; I went to several doctors, could not find any, and at last went to the hospital and brought three - I waited outside the house some time, and then went about my job; I do not think the prisoner could have opened the door of the inner room without my seeing him, but I can hardly tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he knocked at the door twice, and the second time it seemed to open a little - how is that? A. It seemed to give a little to his knocking - he put his knee against it, and it flew open.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. About what size is this front room? I should think about ten feet square - I stood about two feet from the door, on a piece of pavement; I could see the blood quite plain, the door being open would throw light into the room.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I was on duty in the Mileend-road, and was called on to go to Foster-street, Dogrow, between eleven and twelve o'clock, by a man named Stone - I found a few persons round the door; the window shutters were closed - I went into the room called the parlour; there was a large stain of blood between the fire-place and staircase in that room - the prisoner was about the centre of the room; I said nothing to him then; I heard him say twice that his mother was murdered - when I got to where the blood was, I could see into the kitchen, where the deceased lay; I went in - she was then laying in rather a reclining state, in the corner, between the door-post and the copper; her shoulders were against the corner, and nearly eighteen inches high from the floor - there was a cord suspended from the latch of the back door, and it hung down towards her head; it had been cut there - I saw she had a very severe blow on her forehead, and her face was nearly covered with blood; her lips were very black - I saw no other wound on her head; the wound appeared to have been infticted with a heavy jack-towel roller, which laid just by her side, and was nearly covered with blood; Dexter was in the room - he came as far as the door, but not into the kitchen, and requested that the body might remain in the state it was in, and the cord suspended from the latch.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say or do? A. He was making a noise, and calling out that his mother was murdered - I then went with one of his sisters up stairs into the bedroom; a double chest of drawers there were open, and things scattered about - the whole place appeared completely ransacked, to see what property could be found; there was a small chest with linen in it, but I saw no papers - the prisoner did not accompany me up stairs; the sister told me what things were missing - I came down, and after being there a short time, asked Dexter "How long ago is it since you saw you mother last before this morning?" he said, "I have not been here for the last fortnight, and have not seen her;" I afterwards heard he had been there, and told him he must consider himself in custody - I took him to the station; I took a handkerchief off his neck, and at the corner of it there were two or three little specks of blood; I found no marks of blood on his clothes or shirt - there were several stains of blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120059"/>in his hat lining; I could not judge whether the specks of blood were fresh or not - I said, "Dexter, what is all this?" looking at the handkerchief; he gave me no answer whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Stone, I believe, came for you? A. Yes - he is a publican, but has left the house; he kept the Lord Collingwood, very near the deceased's house, in fact both houses join almost - here is the handkerchief; the specks of blood are at this corner - there were three specks of blood when I took it off; they might be produced by the prick of a pin, or in shaving - some of it may have rubbed off; I was before the Coroner, but not examined.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHOS. Q.It is more than two months since you saw the blood on the handkerchief? A. Yes - I have had it wrapped in paper since; here are several marks of blood visible on the hat - I gave my evidence at the Police-office, before the Coroner sat; the roller is here, that has marks of blood on it - the blood on that, the handkerchief, and hat, is faded a good deal.</p>

            . I live in Lisbon-street, very near the deceased's house. Between five and six o'clock on the evening before the Wednesday, on which this murder was discovered, the prisoner called on me to make inquiries about the deceased - I had seen him before, and knew his person, by his standing at his mother's door several times before; he asked me if I had seen the old lady at the broker's shop that day - I said No I had not; he said he thought it strange, seeing the house shut up, as he was in the habit of calling every day - nothing further passed; I wished him good night - this coversation was against my door; I was writing at the counter, and he came in -I could see part of the deceased's house at the time; it was shut up, and had been so all day - I saw the prisoner again next day, about eleven o'clock or later; he came and asked me if I would go over with him to see his mother, as she was in a fit, or otherwise dead - I refused at first, but he persuaded me and I went; when I went in he said, "It is not in this room, it is in the next one;" I could not see the body from the first room, unless I was so placed as not to be seen from the front door - this was about a quarter of an hour before Drew, the inspector, came; I cannot say whether any additional light had been let into the place - when I first went in it seemed very dark, but when I had been there some time it seemed a great deal lighter; I went to the door where I could see the body, and exclaimed, "Yes, it is right, that she is dead, and it appears that she has been dead some time;" I said I thought she had been murdered, as I saw the blood in the parlour as I passed through - those are the words I used; I said, "I think she has been murdered in this room (the parlour) and dragged from there into the kitchen," where I saw her - he exclaimed, "For God's sake, you don't say so!" clasping his hands together; I said, "Well, I must go to my business, I cannot stay any longer;" he said, "For God's sake don't leave me;" I was coming out - the front door opens against the wall; he turned round, pulled the door back, and said, "Look here, they have stopped the key-hole of the door up;" there was tow or something in the key-hole, but that could not be seen without pulling the door from the wall, unless you went behind the door, which is not likely - before I got to the door, I said, "Which way did you get into the house?" he told me how he got in - nothing was done about cutting the cord before I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You say he came to you between five and six o'clock in the evening, and said, "The old lady at the broker's shop?" A. Yes, those were his words, but on the Wednesday he said, "Come with me to my mother's;" I was examined before the Coroner and the Magistrate - I did not state till Thursday, that Dexter was the man who called; that was after he was committed - I knew him by his standing at the door; I had seen him a great many times - I always said he called in the afternoon; I said I could not say whether the person who called was Dexter or not - I am sure I said it was in the evening; I did not say he had a basket on his head - I said I could not swear it was not Dexter; I told the Coroner I would not swear it was Dexter till I was obliged, and that I would sooner swear it was Dexter, than that it was not - I swear to him from his features; I had very little conversation with him, and cannot say about his voice - when he came on Wednesday a boy stood at the door; I cannot tell his name.</p>

I saw the deceased alive last on the Sunday before the Wednesday in question - she was drinking led with her daughter; I saw her in her room alive and well - on the Wednesday following, about five minutes to twelve o'clock, I heard of her death; I went to her house, and saw the prisoner there - he was standing on the step of his mother's door, directing a lad to go to Dr. Cane, of Whitechapel, and fetch him immediately; he then turned round to a man who was going towards the Collingwood, and said, "For God's sake come in here to me, somebody has been murdering my mother;" I entered the room - he went on before me, and as soon as he got up to his mother he said, "Here she is, here she is," before I could see her - she was laying in the kitchen; there was a copper on the left-hand side of her, a door at her back, and a line round her neck, suspended to the latch of the door- the prisoner then said, "She has either been murdered or has hung herself;" I said, "Oh, that woman has been murdered - see how she has been bent about the head;" Dexter said, "Oh, the wretches!" he said, "I will cut her down;" I said, "I would do no such thing;" he said, "Why not?" I said, "You have sent for Dr. Cane, and let her remain till some person comes and sees what state she is in;" I said, "Look at the blood laying here in the front room by the fire-place;" he made no answer, but said again, "I will cut her down;" I then left the room - I did not see her cut down; I felt ill at the sight, and went home - I did not ask how he found her dead; he did not say how he came to go to the house that morning.</p>

            . I live in Philip-street, St. Georges' in the East. On Wednesday, the 9th of March, I saw persons standing at the deceased's door, and went up - I saw Dexter with his foot on the door; I said, "What is the matter?" he replied that his mother had hung herself; I immediately shoved him aside, and said Where! I got into the room, saw her, took my knife out, and cut the cord, which was fastened round the neck - one end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120060"/>it was very long; it was twisted round, and fastened to the latch, and the other end round her neck - the body was sitting in the corner on the ground; but on my cutting the cord, which was tight, the head fell down, and a great explosion of wind came from her, by which I thought she was alive; the cord had kept her head upright - the prisoner said, "Stop, it is not my mother;" I said,"Stand on one side, gentlemen, and let him see;" then he looked and said, "Yes, it is my mother - my God! it is my mother:" I asked how he came into the house - he said he had been in the room before I had, and called out Mother! and that he went to the stairs and called out Mother! - but he had no occasion to call up the stairs for his mother, for he must have seen her if the door was in the same situation as it was when I entered; that is only my opinion - he could not get to the stairs without going by the door where the deceased lay; the room was light enough by the door she was suspended to- it had two or three panes of glass above, and the light comes down from what is called the black ditch, and showed her legs; he must have seen the body if the door had been open.</p>

I live in Foster-street, and am a dressmaker, when I have work - the house I live in joins the deceased's; I can hear the voices of persons in her house, but better up stairs than down - I have heard persons talking in her house; I heard a very great disturbance three times, and heard a man's voice; when I heard the prisoner's voice at Lambeth-street I recognized it - I never saw him near the house on those occasions; the first disturbance was in the Christmas week, but at what time I cannot say - it was between seven and eight o'clock at night, I think, but am not sure - I was up stairs, and heard some female halloo out "Let loose my hair - don't do what you have often threatened me, murder me;" she called out Murder! and with that I heard somebody pushed down stairs - it was the female, for I heard her squall, and then I heard the voice which sounded like Dexter's; it was just the same voice - he said he would either have money or the papers; she said she was not going to work for him to have the benefit of it while she lived - I do not know whose voice the female's was, but the man's voice I do know; I heard but two voices - I heard no more then; one night, about three weeks after, just after she had taken in her things from the door, (which I had not seen her do, but heard it, if she stirred her fire I could hear it) I heard a noise down stairs, but could hear a deal plainer up stairs; I heard footsteps of two people going up stairs- I went up stairs, listened against the wall, and heard something similar to what I heard before; it appeared as if he came for money, and she said he should have no more money, he had had enough; I heard no reply, but upon that the woman was knocked down, for she hallooed out, and somebody fell down stairs, as if she was shoved down, and then I heard the door of the house slam - I heard no more then; these quarrels were always at night - the last time was three weeks before the murder; I cannot tell the date - it was at night; there was a very heavy quarrel - I heard her say he should not have any more money from her, and she would not let him in if she knew it was him, she would not open the door; he said he would find plenty of ways if that was all - he would get up the ditch; there is a ditch at the back of the house - he then said,"Give me the papers, or I will do what I have threatened"- she said he was worse than a bad husband to her; I went down, and heard no more - I always thought she was quarrelling with her husband till one night, when I spoke to her.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of St. Mary, Whitechapel. I was called in on Thursday, the 10th of March, to see the body of the deceased, and made a written statement of the examination, (reads) - I found two mortal wounds on the top of the head, at the back part, with fractures of the bone, penetrating the brain about a quarter of an inch; the large wound on the left was the fracture of the posterior superior part of the parallel line, forcing in a circular portion in fragments, about two inches in diameter, which perforated the membrane and penetrated the substance of the brain - the smaller wound was to the right; it had also fractured and forced in a portion of a bone, about an inch diameter, in a circular form, also penetrating the brain - there was a slight contusion of the right eye-brow, and marks of pressure on the fore part of the neck at the sides, but not extending to the back of the neck, and an indentation on the right side; it had the appearance of a rope having been tied- the indentation I suppose to be where the knot had been; on the 11th of March I stripped the body, and could not discover any other mark of violence or appearance of injury - I have no doubt her death was occasioned by the wounds and fractures, either one of which was sufficient of itself to produce death, by pressure on the brain; I should imagine the indentation in the neck was not the cause of her death, because she did not exhibit the appearance of having died from strangulation - if the cord had been tied round her neck when alive, there would be a mark to show it, which there was not; I should suppose it had been applied to her neck after her death - I am satisfied she could not have destroyed herself.</p>

On Monday, the 7th of March, I was at the Swan public-house, Whitechapel, between five and six o'clock- it was getting dusk; the prisoner came in there about six, or a little after; there were other persons there, and there was ajoke about a woman who Knowles was going to be married to, and something was said about a parcel, in con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120064"/>sequence of which I went out with Dexter for twenty minutes or half an hour - I do not know how long it was after he came there; we went to Mr. Knight's, an oilman, and there he got a piece of brown paper - we went from there to his house in Five Inkhorn-court, and made a parcel of it, tied it up, and directed it for a joke; we left there and went to the Elephant and Castle, kept by Mrs. Graham - we did not stay there more than ten minutes, then returned to the Swan; Dexter had not left me at all in that time - we had been from the Swan twenty minutes of half an hour - when we returned, the parcel was produced; Knowles was there then, and some gin was had - I left the Swan about nine o'clock, and left Dexter there; he had not left my company all that time - I presented myself for examination before the Coroner and the Magistrate, and gave this statement.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.It was between five and six o'clock when he first came to the Swan, and it was then growing dusk? A. Yes, I never looked at the clock - it was not dark; I cannot call it dark till between seven and eight o'clock - it was between six and seven when I went out with him; it was not right dark then - I cannot say whether the oilman had lights; the direction was written at Five Inkhorn-court, by the light of the Heavens - I cannot say whether I mentioned getting the brown paper before the Coroner; I cannot say on what day I went there - I was not hindered from going; I saw Drew there.</p>
               <p>- CADMAN. I am a labourer, and live in Drum-yard, Whitechapel. I went at the Swan on Monday, the 7th of March - I went between five and six o'clock; the prisoner came in while I was there; there was a joke about a parcel; it was to be played on a man named Knowles - Dexter and Dawson left the house between six and seven, to the best of my recollection; they returned in twenty minutes or half an hour with a paper parcel; I left the house at a quarter or half-past ten o'clock, and left the prisoner there - he had not left my presence, except when he went out with Dawson; I should think Foster-street is about three quarters of a mile from the Swan.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any particular reason for observing the time you went away? A. Yes, because a young man went with me, and we looked at the clock in the bar, and by that it was between a quarter and twenty minutes after ten o'clock - I went before the Justice and stated this.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say he was not absent a quarter of an hour, did he go out then? A. He might, but not to my knowledge; but nature will call a man to go out at times, but it did not, to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I saw a mob about nine or ten o'clock at the corner of Field-lane, which is nearly opposite the prosecutor's shop; a gentleman said, "Watchman, go into that mob;" I made my way, and saw the prisoner striking Gerrish, who charged him with stealing two hats, and the prisoner wanted to give charge of Gerrish for assaulting him - I laid hold him, but when I came to look at the prisoner, I knew him, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He charged him with an assault? A. Yes - but Gerrish said, "I will not let him go, he has robbed my master;" he was quite sober.</p>

               <p>EDWARD MORRIS. I am a porter. On the 3rd of May, about twenty minutes to three o'clock, I came out of my master's warehouse - I stood against Lumley's liquor-shop, opposite Newgate; the prisoner came and asked if I wanted a job - I said I did not, that I attended a warehouse, but said, "What is it to do?" he said, "I want somebody to go up to Newgate-market, to Mr. Brown's place, and fetch a flat of butter for Mr. Jones, the Vauxhall carrier;" I asked why he could not go himself, as he was so near; he said, "I have a horse and cart standing at the corner of Farringdon-street, and am afraid that might start away in the mean time;" he had no horse and cart with him then - I went to Brown's, and got the butter; I told them who it was for - I brought it to the priprisoner, who I found at the corner of Farringdon-street - it was in a flat, which was fastened down; I told him I had not seen Mr. Brown, but I asked somebody to see the direction to see that it was right - he asked what I charged, and said, "Will 3d. do?" I said I did not know; he put a sixpence into my hand - I went and got charge; he said, "Stick to the sixpence, I may have another job another time, perhaps" - I left him; he left the flat of butter just round the corner, some little distance from the cart, and came away; I said, "Now, it is quite foolish for you to leave it in that way," and asked why he did not put it into the cart, supposing the cart belonged to him, as he represented - he said, "Oh, I am waiting for somebody;" he wished me good afternoon, and I returned to the warehouse - I saw him at the Compter next morning, where I went, on hearing the butter was stolen - I knew him immediately, and am quite sure he is the man; when he saw me coming, he shifted back, but I said he was the man.</p>

On the 3rd of May, about nine o'clock at night, I was sent for to the Robinhood, in Skinner-street, to look at some butter which two young men had brought there; there were fourteen lumps tied in this cloth, and tied in a blue apron, which I believe the prisoner has now got on; while I was sitting in the bar the prisoner came up, and asked for the apron - I had not time to examine the butter well; another person, named Bathe, was with him - they said they were going to Leadenhall-market; the prisoner took the apron with him - I followed them up the street, and lost them; as they said they would come back in an hour, I went back, and waited till between eleven and twelve o'clock, but they did not come; on the Wednesday morning, between ten and eleven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120066"/>I was sent for - I went there, and found the prisoner and the other; the butter was there - I suspected it was stolen, as it was not wrapped up as it should have been; I asked where they got it from - they seemed very much confused at the moment, but afterwards said they bought it; it was then in this turbot basket, not in a flat - I asked Carter who he bought it of; he at first said he bought it at a shop in Newgate-market - I asked who kept the shop; he made no answer, then said he had bought it outside the shop, but gave no name - I asked where he lived; he said any where - the other said he lived in a court on Old Fish-street-hill; the prisoner afterwards said, before the Magistrate, that he bought it of a countryman in Newgate-market - it weighed 28lbs.; I made inquiry, and found Mr. Knight, who claimed the cloth - he said, "If the butter belongs to me it is two creams (meaning dairys), and it was so. The bill against Bathe was not found.</p>

             he would give me the money - this was on the 17th of September; I said I could not, but I would be there about four o'clock - he told me to bring a 30s. stamp for the warrant of attorney; I went, and he said, "We will go into the other room, and have a bottle of wine," which we did, and then he asked if I would pay for a bottle - I said, "With all my heart," and another was brought; I had taken a 30s. stamp and three 2s. ones- while this bottle was drinking he wrote something on the 30s. stamp, caught them all up, and went out - I said to a person there, "Why he has taken the stamps;" he said, "Oh, he is only gone to the water-closet;" I waited there three hours, but he never returned - he had left his bill unpaid; I did not see him again till the 23rd of April - I never saw his 100l., or the stamps either.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was it in 1817 that you first knew him? A.About that time - I had to receive 200l. from him, paid by his mother-in-law, about twelve years ago; I understood he was an attorney - I had orders from my agent to go to Colchester to receive the 200l. - I went, and was introduced to the person who was to give it to me; as soon as I had signed the document, he said, "Where do you dine?" I said at the Cups - he said he would bring me the money there in half an hour - he never came; I posted up to town, sued his mother-in-law, and got the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the name of Johnson mentioned as the person who was to lend this 100l.? A. No, not at the coffee-house; he mentioned some name to the Magistrate - the prisoner is the person who was to lend me the money; Mr. Carpenter, a confectioner, of Fleet-street, was in the room when I produced the stamps - I wanted the 100l. for a particular use; Carpenter was not to join in the security; I had got him to purchase the stamps and go with me as a witness - we had two bottles of wine between us three -I paid 14s. for what the prisoner drank; he did not say he was going to Peele's coffee-house, to Johnson, for the money - Mr. Halls, the Magistrate, offered to admit him to bail, if he could procure it; as he was going to the station he wanted me to go to a friend of his in Stanhope-street, to settle it, but I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say "I am sorry I did not come back -I could not get the money, and was ashamed; it is true I used the stamps, but here is the money for them?" A. No - I never asked 5l. to settle this; I was tampered with by several persons, but would not accept any thing - the bill-stamps were not written on; I cannot say what he wrote on the 30s. one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.The prisoner knew well were to find you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live in Fleet-street. I know Jacobs - I never saw the prisoner till the 17th of September, when I called on Jacobs, and he was in the counting-house - Jacobs gave me two sovereigns, and asked me to buy the stamps; I bought a 30s. and three 2s. ones - the prisoner came out, and Jacobs introduced me to him; I afterwards went to the Belle Sauvage with Jacobs - the prisoner asked if we had taken dinner; we said Yes - he said, "Well, perhaps you will take a glass of wine;" we had a bottle in the drinking-room - Jacobs produced the 30s. stamp, and hauded it to the prisoner; I understood the prisoner was to lend him 100l., and I was to witness it - Jacobs took out the other three stamps, and laid them on the table, with his pocket-book; the prisoner talked to him about Essex, and he appeared to be writing on the 30s. stamp - he handed the wine round very fast, and then proposed that Jacobs should stand a bottle, which was brought in; I took my share of it, and when it was about half drank he said something to Jacobs - he had the 30s. stamp in his hand, and went out with that and the other three; we stopped there till eight o'clock at night - he did not return - we called in the waiter, who brought in a bill of 14s., including the dinner, which Jacobs paid; I never saw the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street, on the 27th of April - he said the stamps were to be produced - Mr. Halls gave him time to produce them, but he never did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you yourself been negociating in this way? A. No - I have borrowed hundreds and thousands in my life; I was not to join in the security - Jacobs did not tell me what was to be done with the billstamps - I only went to witness the warrant; I smoked a pipe - I can sometimes drink three bottles of wine when I go to cook a dinner, and be steady after it; I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23rd of April, in Picket-street, Strand; Jacobs gave him in charge - they were standing talking together when I came by; Jacobs said he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120067"/>robbed him of some stamps - I took him before Mr. Halls- on the road to the watch-house he wanted to go to a friend's house in Stanhope-street, to settle it, but Jacobs refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had failed in getting the money, was ashamed to return without it, and unfortunately kept the stamps? A. He never said a word of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had seen the prosecutor three weeks or a fortnight before - he asked me to procure him the loan of 100l.; I said I would speak to a friend of mine, Johnson, of Stratford, who I expect here - he was at Bow-street, but Mr. Halls did not think it necessary to call him- I wrote to him last night, but do not see him about the Court; if he is here, I shall staisfy the Jury I am perfectly innocent - I asked what security he could give, and I solemnly declare Carpenter was the security; the warrant of attorney was filled up, and I read it over to them before I took it away; the stamp on it was allowed at the stampoffice.</p>

            . I never was asked to become security, and never intended it - nothing of the sort was ever mentioned, neither by the prisoner nor Jacobs.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JACOBS. The value of the stamps has never been returned to me by any body - the prisoner told Mr. Halls they were allowed to him at the office; Mr. Halls told me to make inquiry, but we could make nothing out- he never offered me any money as being allowed for them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find the prisoner? A. I was passing in the Strand, and saw him - I said, "Mr. Weeding, you are the person I want, stop, for I have an officer;" he said, "Why, I owe you something, and will pay you;" I said, "No, you have robbed me - you owe me nothing."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you pay him any money for preparing the warrant of attorney? A. No - I have not seen the stamp since; it was a printed one - I do not know that it was ever filled up; the bill-stamps were provided in case he should require to draw bills on me for the amount.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The bills were to be given at different dates, and the warrant was the security - if the deposition before Mr. Halls was brought forward, that is very different to what he has said to-day; Carpenter declared there that I took the stamps with the consent of Jacobs, for the purpose of going to read the warrant to the person who was to advance the money.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Police. I went to the prosecutor's house last Monday evening; I saw the prisoner - I searched a box which she said was hers, of which she produced the key and unlocked it- I found two bottles of wine in it; the bottles were corked - I asked the prisoner if that was Mr. Hawes' wine; she said, "I will tell you the truth, yes it is" - she said she was not the only person to blame, there was another to blame as much as herself, and if I would look in Eugenia's box I should find more there; she said the wine came from Mr. Hawes' wine-cellar - I sent for Eugenia, and the prisoner said, "This gentleman is an officer; he is come to search all our boxes, and it is no use to disguise the truth - you have got wine as well as me;" Eugenia was in a terrible agitation, and said, "Yes, I have got Mr. Hawes' wine - why did you make me put it into my box?" she then took out her keys, opened her box, and I found five bottles of wine, and part of a sixth; this is the wine - the seal is cut off the cork of one of the bottles, found in the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You do not know who cut that off? A. No; there were five bottles and a half in Eugenia's box, and two in the prisoner's.</p>

            . The officer came to my master's house; he found some wine in my box, which the prisoner had put there on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where it came from? A. No, I did not then; I asked where it came from - she said,"Never mind; we will drink it - it is nothing to you where it comes from."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first see it? A.Between half-past six and seven o'clock in the morning - my master was not up then; I had been once or twice to the wine cellar with my mistress - my mistress took out the wine, but once or twice she gave me a bottle to take up to the parlour; I looked at the corks once, because Miss Emma gave me one to draw - I have been thirteen or fourteen months in the prosecutor's service, and the prisoner has been about one month, as cook; I did not have wine with the last cook; I did not see the name on the cork of the bottle which Miss Emma gave me to draw - I cannot read; I thought the wine the prisoner brought to my box was Mr. Hawes', because it looked very dusty, and the same as his did - I told Miss Perkins to take care of the keys, because I suspected they were taken down stairs, as I saw the prisoner touch the sideboard key; I did not mention about the wine till the prisoner told the officer - the prisoner said it was not Mr. Hawes' wine; I had not been in the habit of drinking wine with the former cook - the prisoner and I had some of this after we had done work on Sunday; she drank two cups and I drank one - that was in my bedroom; she then told me to keep it in my box; I did not tell any body till the Monday - I did not get the wine; I never saw the prisoner's sister till Sunday night, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120068"/>kitchen - I did not talk to her; I did not give her any wine - I never gave any wine to any body; the prisoner told me that every servant did so - I did not mention this, because I once told of a servant who was thieving in the house, and was treated very ill for that; it was because she picked out the mark of a pocket handkerchief and a pair of stockings, and I was ill-treated by the last cook and house-maid - it was Betsey, my fellow house-maid that I told of; the present cook and house-maid have been there for the last three months, and I have not been so ill-used; the prisoner was not in the house at that time- I never offered the prisoner's sister a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWES. It was in consequence of information that I went for the officer; I have port wine in bottles of this description, and sealed as this is - I have a great deal of wine, and often do not dine at home; I do not see my wine-cellar three times in a year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the book, before a million of people, Eugenia is the person who did it; I had not been in the house five days before she told me of it - she is wicked to the heart; she went into her mistress' bed-room, opened the drawer, and took the key out - that is the guilty person, and if the other cook was here she would say so.</p>
               <p>MR. HAWES. The prisoner had been three weeks and four days in my service; my wine-cellar is at the bottom of my house, adjoining a small coal-cellar, and that adjoins the footman's bed-room - the kitchen is at the back of the house, and the wine-cellar towards the front; I have no fault to find with Eugenia's character; I shall retain her in my service - I have four regular servants.</p>

I have known the prisoner about a year and a quarter, by seeing him at a toll-gate; on Thursday, the 14th of April, I was at work, and saw a basket under the window of the toll-house - I saw him take one bottle out of it, take it into the toll-house, and put it under the window inside.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you made him any promise or threat? A. No - he was regularly in my employ, and so was Gutteridge; I bought - cwt. of this iron, and what has been used is most trifling - the rest was cut up by the prisoner, and remained in my workshop: there were a dozen of these plates, and they all exactly correspond; there are three of them missing - my servants might take them into the out-house with dog's meat, but it is not right to do so; I remember the heifer being killed, but I have no recollection of giving the prisoner any of it; he stated that he took part of the liver of it home on these plates, but I have no sort of recollection of it - it is very unlikley; I did not see him come to my house on the day after these things were found, but I believe he did come; I rather think for the purpose of interceding with me - when I saw him in custody he said he hoped I would not transport him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know from your servants whether he had the liver to take away? A. I have no idea of it; what iron was found at the prisoner's, and what was used, makes up the weight as near as possible.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Would it have been necessary to have carried the liver on three plates? A.Certainly not.</p>

            . Q. When did you take the prisoner? A. On the 14th of April; I had searched his house the day before - I do not know whether he went home that evening; I took him at Mr. Powys', at seven o'clock in the morning - the plates were in a sort of cupboard; there was a powder-flask, and some bottles there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The iron hooping is part of my father's property; at the time the heifer was killed the cowman assisted me; he shewed the liver to the prosecutor, and said part of it was not good - he said if it was eatable we might have it; I took the plates, and took part of it home.</p>

A.Wednesday; he mentioned this particular quality of boots - I had only sold one pair of that sort, which a man walked away with on his feet; I have an apprentice, and he might have sold some; I had seven pairs of them - I sold one, and found but three pairs left; I did not know Penny - I had never seen him.</p>

I was with two or three friends; the prosecutor happened to come in - he went into a little box where there is just room to sit down; I staid sitting by Fisher and his wife - it was near ten o'clock, and they wanted to get the prosecutor out; I got up, and said, "I don't mind helping him out;" I knew he lodged at the Three Crowns - I got him out, and then had to go on duty as a watchman; he wanted me to go and have some more liquor, but I refused, and said I had had enough -I left him, and he went into another public-house or two: he got to fighting, got into a row, and got into the watch-house.</p>

On the 28th of April, I was standing in his shop a little before eight o'clock in the evening - I saw the door open, which was ajar; the prisoner put his hand in, and took one boot out of the window - I pursued him, and saw the boot fall, but I cannot say from whom; I was agitated -I took the prisoner, and accused him of stealing it; he said it was not him - I called the beadle, and then took the boot up; the prisoner had got ten or twenty yards from the shop - he walked; no one but him could have dropped the boot.</p>

Toplis and Son - I enter by the front door, from which there is no direct communication with Mr. Toplis' premises; there is by a back stair case - I believe Mr. Toplis, Sen., Mr. Toplis, Jun., and their families reside there; I have seen them, and had communication with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether the Messrs. Toplis sleep there, or any of their family? A. I believe they do, but I do not know it certainly - I have been repeatedly in their premises; I had not seen any part of the premises fitted up as a dwelling-house - I had a servant slept in my part of the premises. On Saturday evening, the 9th of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I went abruptly out of the premises, and saw two persons looking up and watching the premises attentively - on seeing me they instantly turned, and walked away; that circumstance induced me to give some directions - I believe one of those persons was Phipps, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do I understand you rightly, that you hire part of a house of Messrs. Toplis? A. Yes, the house is theirs; what I hire is a lodging, for the convenience of business - I pay no taxes, nor am I recognized as holder of the house at all; it is a private-contract between Messrs. Toplis and me; there is a communication from my premises to theirs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw two persons, as you thought, looking attentively up at the house? A. Yes - they instantly walked away; one of them is not here, and I might be mistaken in the person of Phipps, having so superficial a sight of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN OLIVE CHARLESWORTH. I am in the service of Mr. Maynard, and had charge of his warehouse in St. Paul's church-yard.

             and Hamnett Hill' - we returned to the house, opened the door, and went in; I met johnson, the prisoner, coming towards me, within perhaps a yards of the door; he asked me if Mr. Williams lived there - I gave him no answer, but seized him by the collar as he attempted to go out, and so did Hill; he struggled desperately, but I did not leave his collar till Speechley and Rawlinson, the officers, came, which, I think, was near a quarter of an hour - I accompanied them in taking him to the Compter, leaving Smith, and subsequently Willmott, to mind the premises; Gunnis stood by the door -Hill had hold of Johnson at first, but when others came up he went for an officer: after I had been to the Compter I went on the premises - I found a number of articles strewed on the first floor, a crow-bar on the middle of the floor, and this black bag, with this one hundred and fourteen yards of silk, this cambric, this lawn, and these Indian trinkets, which are the property of Mr. Maynard - they are worth 16l., and had before been safely placed among Mr. Maynard's property; this bag is not Mr. Maynard's - the door of the first floor had been forced open, and there was a cash-box on the floor, which had been broken open; the premises are in the parish of St. Gregory, by St. Paul's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Had you made any noise before you saw Johnson? A. No other than opening the door - not more than a minute had elapsed before I went back to the house; I know no person of the name of Williams lived there, because Mr. Maynard had the entire of that house, and Mr. Toplis had the premises adjoining - there is a communication between them; I had seen part of this property safe immediately before I went out - I am quite sure this same silk was on a table; I was out from between ten and eleven o'clock till half-past one.</p>

I went with Gunnis to the house, and saw Johnson coming down stairs - he asked if Mr. Williams lived there, and made a rush to the door: I laid hold of one said of his collar, and Charlesworth the other - he dragged us out, and got us twenty or thirty yards to the west, and while he did that I believe the other prisoners got down; he did not strike us, but strugglad very much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He offered no violence? A. No, he merely struggled to get away.</p>

             I am a City-officer. On Sunday, the 10th of April, I was called to St. Paul's church-yard - several persons had hold of Johnson, and he was given to my care - seeing I was an officer, he said he would go with me; Speechley came up to my assistance; as we were going along Warwick-lane to the Compter, Johnson said, "It is no difference to you, I will give you a sovereign a piece to let me go;" I said, "We don't do business in that way;" he then said, as we went past the Three Jolly Butchers, "Let me have some beer;" I said he should have some at the Compter - he seemed to know what beer he should have there, and he made a rush, but we took him to the Compter; I found on him three skeleton-keys, two centre-pieces, and a phosphorus-box.</p>
               <p>JOHN SPEECHILEY. I came up to the assistance of Rawlinson, and took Johnson - what he has stated is correct; he offered us two sovereigns to let him go - we took him to the Compter.</p>

            , a tea-dealer, in Old Broad-street. I was in St. Paul's Church-yard on the 10th of April, about twenty minutes to two o'clock - I was desired to look to Mr. Maynard's premises, but I did not see any persons come out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you watch closely? A. Yes, for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - then the witnesses and the officers returned, and I went into the premises with them - I had seen no one come out, and when I went in no one was there.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALTERS. I live at No. 96. Watling-street. I was going up towards St. Paul's church-yard; I heard a hue and cry, and went forward - I saw Phipps, and he was taken at the corner of St. Paul's church-yard; I followed Williams, and saw him brought out of Paternoster-row by a gentleman, who said, "I have brought the prisoner;" the gentleman then let him go - I followed him, and saw him taken by Pocklington; when I first saw Phipps he ran past the end of Watling-street, into St. Paul's church-yard; Williams was with him - they were both running; I saw they were pursued, but there was no person running before them - I was going towards them, and if I had been soon enough I should have met them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did one of the prisoners appear to be pursuing the other? A. They were so near that I could not tell; they were not on the same side of the street - I only noticed one person pursuing them, and he ran nearly in the centre of the street; he was some distance behind them, crying Stop thief! he was after those two persons - it is rather a populous place, but there were not persons about at that time; it was about half-past one o'clock - I have sometimes walked along there, and not met more than two persons; the moment Phipps was taken I ran on with the intention of pursuing Williams - a strange gentleman brought him back as far as Butler's, the chemist, and then let him go; I did not lose sight of him after he was taken - I walked behind him; any person might have taken hold of him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How far did he walk? A.From Butler's to St. Paul's school, and then he was taken - I walked behind to prevent his escaping; I saw Phipps taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Phipps one of the persons you saw? A. Yes; he came in a direction from Mr. Maynard's, about seventy or eighty yards from it - Williams and him were both running.</p>
               <p>JAMES GUNNIS. I am in the employ of Mr. Hurlock. I was fetched by Mr. Charlesworth - I stood at Mr. Maynard's private door, and saw Williams and Phipps come out; I had not been there a minute scarcely when they came - I think Williams came out first; they went towards Watling-street, and one of them was going down Watling-street, but a gentleman held up his umbrella, and he turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120076"/>towards Cheapside - I saw Phipps taken; I never lost sight of him; they both ran, and I pursued about five yards behind them - after Phipps was stopped I followed Williams, and was about three yards behind him when he was stopped in Paternoster-row - I had only lost sight of him for a moment, as he turned the corner; a gentleman stopped him, brought him back, and then went away - I followed him as far as Mr. Newberry's door, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where was Phipps taken? A. By Mr. Butler's door; I kept on after Williams - I saw no one pursuing them but myself; I was in the middle of the road - I saw Phipps taken, but I kept my eyes on Williams at the same time; Phipps did not turn any corner, but Williams did - I had not seen either of them before; I stood watching at Mr. Maynard's door, and I did not see any other person watching; I saw Johnson taken in the passage - he struggled outside, and then Phipps and Williams came down when he had got a yard or two from the door; the struggling was taking place when Phipps and Williams came out, but those persons, who had hold of Johnson, might not have seen them as he was struggling with them.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 10th of April I was in Old Change - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran into St. Paul's church-yard; I saw Phipps coming into Watling-street - he turned, and went as far as Butler's door, where he was taken; Williams went on, and was brought back by a gentleman - he went as far as Mr. Newberry's door, and I took him; Gunnis said he had robbed a house - I said, "Why don't you take him?" he said, "I dare not;" I said, "Then I will" - I never let him go till I got him to the Compter; in going along the street, I saw him put his hand into his pocket and take out a centre-bit - as we passed the Old Bailey, he stopped down, and wanted to put it into a grating, and shoved me on the pavement, that I should not perceive it - I turned him on the pavement, gave it a kick, and a young man took it up; I went on to the Compter with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Johnson going to the Compter then? A. Yes. but he was ten or twelve yards before him - I had fast hold of him; I saw him searched - nothing of a suspicions nature was found on him.</p>
               <p>JOHN LASSETTER. I am ware house man to Mr. Stubbs. I saw Mr. Pocklington with Williams in custody - he dropped this centre-bit, and I took it up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SNELLING. I took Phipps on the 10th of April, at Mr. Butler's, in St. Paul's church-yard - I had not seen him more than a second before - he was running towards Paternoster-row; there was a person pursuing him, and raising an outcry - I took him to the Compter; the officer searched him in my presence - the stock of a centre-bit was found on him, and this cutter; this centre-bit, which Mr. Pocklington found, fits this stock.</p>

               <p>5th COUNT, that he feloniously and fraudulently did cut, tear, and get off, from a certain piece of parchment, a certain other impression of a certain die, which had been theretofore provided, made, and used in pursuance of the Statute in that case made and provided, for denoting a certain duty, being one of the duties under the care and management of the Commissioners of Stamps, that is to say, a stamp duty of 25l. of lawful money, with intent to use the same for and upon a certain other piece of parchment, contrary to the Statute in that behalf made and provided.</p>
               <p>6th COUNT, the same as the fifth, only charging that he did cut, tear, and get off from a certain piece of vellum. MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL, with MESSRS. GURNEY, ALLEY, and SCARLETT conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JACOB JOSEPH. I am a quill-merchant, and live at No. 9, Suffolk-street East, St. Pancras. I have known the prisoner some years - he called at my house on Saturday, the 16th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and requested me to purchase two skins of parchment of a law-stationer; he said he wanted to get them stamped to send into the country to his father, who is a lawyer, and lives at Axminster, in Somersetshire - I knew his father well; in consequence of this I applied to Mr. Nicole, of Carey-street, and procured two skins of parchment for him that evening, and after Mr. Nicole wrote the beginning of a deed, the words, "This Indenture" on them; I took them home - the prisoner came to my house about nine o'clock that evening, and I gave him the skins; he came to my house again on the Monday, and brought the skins with him - they had then each a 25l. stamp on them; he desired me to take them to a lawstationer in Chancery-lane, and sell them for him, as he said they were stamped wrong - they were too great an amount; I took the stamps to Mr. Nicole, and offered them to him for sale, or asked him to sell them for me - he went out to one place, came back, and said he could not sell them; I took them home again - I saw the prisoner again, and told him I could not sell them; I mentioned no name to him - he said, "I wish you would go out this evening, and try again to sell them, for I want the money;" I took them again to Nicole, and left them with him all night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you ever deal in stamps before? A.Never; I never sold any, nor bought any - I never was in this Court before in my life.</p>

            . I am a law-stationer, and live at No. 21, Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Saturday, the 16th of April, I recollect Joseph calling on me to procure two large skins of parchment for him, and I wrote on each of them in German text, the words."This Indenture:" I gave them to him - he came to me again on the Tuesday morning, to ask if I thought I could dispose of two 25l. stamps, and produced the two skins with a 25l. stamp on each - they were the same two as I had written on; I took them to Mr. Matthews, the law-stationer, and left them with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MANNING. Q. At what time on Saturday did he call on you? A.About nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIAN GEORGE MATTHEWS. I am a law-stationer, and live in Castle-street, Holborn. I recollect Mr. Nicole coming to me with two skins of parchment on Wednesday morning, the 20th of April - they had each a 25l. stamp, and the words "This Indenture" was written on them; I said I would take them on allowing the usual discount - I took them to Mr. Duncan, of Carey-street; I observed that the parchment was not impressed under the blue stamped paper - the parchment had not received the impression of the stamp - that excited my suspicion, and I took them to the stamp-office.</p>

            . I am chief clerk in the office for the allowance for spoiled stamps. The prisoner was employed in that office as a junior clerk; spoiled stamps which are brought from the country with an affidavit are examined by me on Wednesdays and Fridays, and on the Saturday they are sent up stairs to the commissioners room, where I attend - I call the stamps over to a commissioner, who has the warrant before him; the stamps are then handed over by me to the junior clerk to cancel - the prisoner was the junior clerk on the 9th of April; it was his duty to cut the stamps off, and throw them into the fire, not to take the blue paper off the parchment.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the mode in which they are delivered?(handing the witness the corner of a sheet of parchment with the blue stamp upon it.) A. That is the mode in which he cuts them off, and he should throw them into the fire; there were two 25l. spoiled stamps allowed on the 9th of April - I know that by my own signature to this warrant (looking at it) - I have no doubt from that that two 25l. stamps were handed to him that day to be cancelled; I say so from my own signature to the warrant, and from the commissioner's signature to the warrant also - that was the first day, the prisoner had acted in that situation for some considerable time; he also attended on the 16th - there were no 25l. stamps that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive of Mr. Matthews, on the 20th of April, any parchments? A. I received two from him; I cannot particularly recollect the day - those produced are them; the stamps on them are genuine, but not genuine on the parchment, because the impression would appear through if it had been impressed on the parchment - the impressions would appear on the other side, which they do not on either of these; I went with the officer to the prisoner's house twice, and the second time I went I found a gluepot under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look under the bed the first time? A. I might take a casual look; I suppose there was a fortnight between the first and second time - I did not lock the door of his room when I left it; there was glue in the pot- he was apprehended on the day we found the glue-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said it was on the second visit, which was a fortnight after, that you found the glue-pot? A. No; I consider that if these stamps were glued on the parchment they would appear as they do now.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these blue paper stamps, in the course of business, ever impressed on paper? A. I think not, only on vellum or parchment, according to my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This warrant is an entry of stamps brought, to be allowed on Wednesday and Friday? A. Yes - it is an account of stamps allowed by me; it is the prisoner's writing, but has my signature to it - I sign, and the commissioner countersigns as the stamps are allowed; it was not usually, the prisoner's duty to cut off stamps - there was another clerk who should have done it, but he was ill, and had been away about a week: on the 9th of April the prisoner attended in his place - it was the prisoner's duty to cut off the stamps that were to be allowed, in order to their being destroyed, and it was his duty to put them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they go into another clerk's hands to do that? A. No - he was the person to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. In cutting them off he did his duty, and in not putting them into the fire he omitted his duty? A. Yes; there is a private-mark on the die of the stamps, but I cannot distinguish one stamp from another, nor say that any one stamp produced is the very one the prisoner ought to have put into the fire that day; the power which impresses the stamp is a very heavy one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that it never may have happened, from any cause, that it failed to make the impression on the parchment? A. I cannot say that - when instruments come to be stamped the office gives the paper, and it is put on with glue.</p>
               <p>Q. And, according to the thickness of the glue, the stamp may, or may not, fail to give the impression? A. Very likely - I do not consider myself capable of judging - I do not know what may be; I say such a thing may happen, but it is not in my department.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The question is, whether that might arise from the quality of glue? A. I never experienced it -I always found, as far as my practice has gone, that it has always gone through; the stamps do not pass through my hands to the purchasers - that is quite a different department.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. The cancelled stamp comes in this form to the prisoner? A. No, he cuts it off- it is his duty not to take, the stamp off, but to cut it off, parchment and all, and throw it into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. If I find this on another parchment, it must have been taken off afterwards? A. Yes; I have no idea that the glue could prevent the impression going through.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM HINDS. I am supervisor of stamps in the Stamp-office. The stamps on these two skins of parchment are the stamps employed to denote the payment of duty under the 55th of George the 3rd; neither of them appear to have been stamped on these skins of parchment.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to you that they have been taken off some other skins? A. Yes; when the parchments are first sent in, the blue paper is attached to the skin by paste, and the skin will always bear the mark of the engine; the operation is performed by a fly-engine and a weight - it makes a very strong mark; I am sure these skins have never been under the engine in the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been in the office? A.Fifteen years, and in the stamping-office four years; there were 25l. stamps before the passing of the 55th of George the 3rd - I certainly cannot swear that this may not be one of the stamps issued before the passing of that Act.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Have you got the Commissioners' book? A. Yes (producing it); here is an order of the commissioners made on the 18th of July, 1815 - it is signed by Mr. Kappen, the head secretary, who is now dead.</p>
               <p>Stamp-office, London, 18th of July, 1815.</p>
               <p>By the Commissioners - On taking into consideration the Act of the 55th year of His present Majesty's reign, cap. 184, lately passed and entitled (here followed the title of the Act),"It is ordered that impressions shall be forthwith struck in this book, of such of the stamps or dies heretofore provided, and now or late in use, for denoting the present or some former stamp duties, or the payment thereof, as are fit and proper to be used for the purposes of the said new Act.</p>

               <p>22nd of July, 1815.</p>
               <p>By the Commisioners. - Ordered, in pursuance of the aforesaid Act of the 55th year of His present Majesty's reign, cap. 184., that the stamps or dies, whereof impressions are struck in the ten preceeding pages of this book, shall be used for the purpose of expressing and denoting any of the duties granted by the said Act, of the same amount, with the former duties denoted by them; and for expressing and denoting the rate per cent. of the legacy duties, and the amount of the other percentage duties granted by the same Act, and for denoting or testifying the payment of certain stamp duties thereby granted, without specifying the amount in special cases, as occasion and the law shall require, And it is also ordered that two or more of the said stamps or dies, and of any new stamps or dies, which shall be provided, in pursuance of the said Act, shall be used for denoting the amount of any one duty granted by the said Act, as occasion may require, until a single stamp or die shall be provided for that purpose, save and except that the stamps or dies bearing the word receipt shall be used only to denote the duty on receipts, and that the stamps or dies, bearing the word policy shall be used only to denote the per centage duty on policies of insurance. And it is further ordered, that either of the stamps or dies before mentioned, which denote a duty o 10s., shall be used for the purpose of expressing and denoting the stamp duty of 10s. on licences for keeping stage-coaches, granted by another Act of the 55th of His present Majesty's reign, for repealing the stamp-office duties on stage-coaches, and on licences for keeping stage-coaches, now payable in Great Britain, and for granting new duties in lien thereof.</p>

               <p>MR. TWYFORD re-examined. Q. Will you look at these warrants - do you know from them any thing with regard to the time that the two stamps were issued which were given to him to be cancelled? A. No - stamps must be brought to the office within twelve months of the time of their being spoiled.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. But not within twelve months of the time of their being issued? A. No; if they kept them for twenty years before they were spoiled, they still would be allowed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If an instrument were brought which was fifteen years old, it might be allowed for? A. It would depend upon whether the stamp was taken under the existing Act of Parliament - for instance, a person might make a deed previous to the passing of the 55th of George the 3rd, and keep it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Using a stamp is what you would call spoiling it? A. If the deed were not executed or signed by any party; the Act directs that it shall be brought within twelve months of that time, but how long the stamp itself has been in existence the office does not inquire, and cannot know.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. ADOLPHUS, MANNING, and PHILLIPS contended that the offence as proved could not be construed to come within the meaning of the 55th of George the 3rd, c, 184, there being no evidence to show when the impressions of the stamps were made, and that they might have been in existence before the passing of the Act, consequently they could not have been provided under that Act, as alleged in the first four Counts of the indictment, and that the two last Counts were defective in point of law, as they did not allege the prisoner's intent to use them on other parchment liable to a stamp duty, without which liability no fraud could have been intended to the revenue - and, further, that the stamps having been taken off by the prisoner, in the execution of his duty, he could not, at the moment of the removal, have intended to impress them on another parchment, which was essential, to constitute the offence.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HINDS. Q. Is it usual to have skins stamped before they are filled up? A. Yes, very frequently - it is the genral practice with skins which are to be sent into the country.</p>
               <p>The Jury having retired, came into Court, and being asked the usual question, found a verdict of</p>
               <p>GUILTY.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BOSANQUET. Q. Gentlemen. allow me to ask whether you find that the impressions of the stamps in question were issued before the passing of the 55th of 
               <persName id="t18310512-135-person1027">George</persName>
             the 3rd,(i.e.) 1815? FOREMAN. We have no means of ascertaining that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not find that they were issued after that time? A. We do not, we cannot tell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then your verdict must be taken on the two latter Counts; now, are you of opinion that the impressions were detached with intent to be annexed to some other parchment, at the time when they were first cut off? A. We acquit him of any fraudulent intention at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether they were got off the slip of parchment after it was detached from the instrument, with intent to annex it to some other parchment? A.We find him Guilty of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that the impressions were taken off the former parchment with intent to annex it to the other skin of parchment destined to be used as an indenture? A. We find him guilty of that.</p>
               <p>MR. JUSTICE BOSANQUET. The Jury acquit him of having a fraudulent intention to use the stamp at the time he first cut it off, but when he detached that from the piece of parchment, he did that with intent to make use of it.</p>
               <p>FOREMAN. Yes.</p>

            . I am a bill-broker at 'Change-alley, and live at Mile-end. I was walking by the prosecutor's side - he turned suddenly round, and seized the prisoner by the collar, at the same time took a handkerchief from his hand; he charged him with stealing it - the prisoner said he had picked it up; I observed several persons about, but do not know that they were in his company - several low characters followed him to the watch-house, but did not interfere.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOW. I am an officer of Aldgate ward. I went into the watch-house after the prisoner was there; he said he picked the handkerchief up - I searched him, and found two other handkerchiefs in his hat, and a piece of silk tied loosely round his neck.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take it from the gentleman's pocket - I picked it up, and did not know who it belonged to till the gentleman collared me.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty on the 13th of April, in St. Martin's-lane - the prosecutor spoke to me; I afterwards saw the prisoner come out of the public-house - I asked if he knew any thing about the young man's coat; he said he did not know any thing at all about it - that he had been in among a parcel of w-s and thieves, and if he had been robbed of his coat it must be among them; the prisoner is a private-watchman - I said it was very strange that a man should be robbed of his coat, and he be inside and not to know any thing about it; he said so help him God he knew nothing at all about it - I saw something projecting under his coat, and asked what he had there - he said Nothing; I said,"Come, Jemmy, let us look;" I unbuttoned his coat, and took out this bundle, with the prosecutor's coat in it, wrapped up in this blue handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the house - the prosecutor and one or two females had some gin; they wanted more, and the landlord refused to let them have it - they insisted upon having it; he put out the light, and said he would not serve any more - he came round to push them out; I opened the door, and picked up the coat - I thought I had a right to it, as there was another man there, and I did not know who it belonged to; when I came out the prosecutor was gone, and the Police-constable came and took me - I did not do it with intent to steal it.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 1st of April, to lodge by the week - on the 18th he left without notice; about half-past seven o'clock after the prosecutor was gone, I heard him come down and shut the door - he never returned; he took away his night-cap and his property - the prosecutor complained of losing his property; I went the same evening to where the prisoner had told me I might have his address, No. 38, Great Garden-street - as I went up the steps I saw him at the window; I went into the passage - the room door was locked; I saw a young woman, who made a sort of stammor - I said I wanted the prisoner, and it was of no use denying it, for I had seen him; she then went into the back room, and said, "You had better come forward, she has seen you;" he then came forward, and I accused him of it - he denied it; I said, "The young man is at the corner of the street, and you had better go with me to him;" he went with me part of the way, and then ran away - my brother, who was with me, ran after him, but did not like to follow him further; we afterwards heard he was at No. 21, Baker's-row - we sent for him; he was denied, but the officer got him.</p>

The other boy was about the same size as the prisoner, but he had a lighter coat on - I think this was the boy I saw in my shop: when I first saw him he was about forty or fifty yards from my house, and I took him about one hundred and fifty yards off.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 9th of April, at half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in the East India-road, near North-street turnpike, about a quarter of a mile from Stinkhouse-bridge - I saw the prisoner, who ran away; I had not said any thing to him, but I pursued and took him into custody - I asked him about some tools, as I was looking for a man who had stolen some; he said he had a boat load of deals in the canal which he was going to deliver to a person of the name of Baxter, and he had brought them from a Mr. Bainbridge, near Deptford - I asked him at which end he came into the dock, as there are two entrances; he said Limehouse end, and he got there between eight and nine o'clock at night - (I suppose the Friday night, the night before) - he said it had been lying in the lock the whole of the night; I asked him to show me the boat - he took me to it, and I found in it six twelve feet deals - I asked him what time they had been put into the boat, and he said between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I said that was impossible, as there had been a great deal of rain the day before - it rained all day, and I do not think it ceased till near ten at night; the top deals in the boat were dry, and the lower ones wet - I afterwards discovered that he was in the employ of Mr. Dixon - I had, for another reason, searched that lock at eleven o'clock the night before, and there was no boat of that description in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search every boat? A.There was not a boat there - there were two barges; I will swear there was no boat, and I said so before the Magistrate - Baxter was brought to the station-house after the prisoner was there; I did not hear him say to Baxter that he had brought six deal boards from Mr. Bainbridge - Baxter said he expected some that day - the prisoner did say it was on account of a man named Rogers; I tried to find Rogers, and he absconded - the prisoner did not tell me where Rogers and Baxter lived.</p>

The officer came to me and said he had stopped one of my men under very suspicious circumstances - I looked, and missed some deals - I had bought three hundred twelve feet deals a short time before; I had no mark on them - they stood up on end against the warehouse: I missed some, but I cannot say how many; I looked at the ground, and saw that some deals had been removed - they had been pitched on end on some ground which had been garden ground - the rain had washed up the ground against the deals, and some of them had been removed, because the ground was dry on which seven or eight might have stood, or more or less, I cannot say how many - the officer showed me some deals; I looked at them - one end of them was wet, and I concluded they had stood against the warehouse; I compared one deal in the boat with one against the warehouse, and the dirt corresponded exactly - I have no doubt they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is it, if you have no doubt, that you will not swear positively that they are yours? A. I swear to the best of my knowledge; do not let me swear to what I bought in a lump, and never marked - it is a difficult thing for a person conscientiously to swear to such things; Rogers was in my employ at that time - I believe he has absconded; I have employed the officers to search for him - the prisoner had been four years in my employ; I had a good opinion of him up to this time - I had sold some of those deals, but none uncut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Am I to understand that upon directing your attention to the spot you missed some? A. Yes - the dirt on the boards at home, and that in the boat tallied, and the quality appeared the same - I believe they were mine; the prisoner was my lighterman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Rogers at a quarter-past five o'clock - he asked me if I could lend him a pair of sculls to row the boat; I said Yes - I took the sculls, went down, and found this boat, with six deals in it; I put the sculls in, and he lent me a hand to row it - when I got to the Stinkhouse-bridge I made it fast, and he got out - he said he was going to four houses near the bridge; I waited a quarter of an hour, but he did not return, and I went to see if he was gone to the four houses - I looked up the road, and saw two Policemen, who had a barrow, with some cooper's tools in it - directly they came to the turnpike-gate they saw three more men, and they asked them why they did not come to their assistance when they heard the rattle spring; they said they heard no rattle - they then said they had better go down the lane and look for another man - I was in the lane, and turned to see if Rogers was gone to look for Baxter, to buy those deals, as he said he was; I passed the Policeman, and then walked on to look for Rogers - the Policeman then came to me, and asked what knowledge I had of that man that was collared in the East India-road; I said None - he said he thought I had, as there were two men in the robbery; I said I had no knowledge whatever of him - he said he thought I must be the man, or why should I be there - I said I had a boat with six deals in it, and I showed it to him; he asked where I brought them from - I said from the lock-gate, and the man who had employed me brought them from Bainbridge's the night before, between nine and ten o'clock, which was what he told me; the prosecutor always gave me leave to earn 1s. if I could, either in the day or night - I had 18s. a week of him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, but I was in the Police-force on the 9th of April. I attended before the Magistrate, on the part of the prosecution, and gave evidence - I have been subpoenaed here to-day. I saw the prisoner in the place which he has described - I did not speak to him the first time, but I took him afterwards, and asked if he had any knowledge of some tools which I heard had been lost; he said he had no knowledge of the tools, he had a boat laden with deals, and if I would go with him he would show them to me - he said they came from Mr. Bainbridge's, over the water, and a master carpenter had employed him, but he did not know his name - he said he was a master carpenter, and lived at Limehousecut, but he could not exactly tell me where; I had but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120085"/>very little knowledge of the prisoner before - I may have seen him; I was not bound over, in consequence of the misunderstanding the Magistrate had of my discourse - he thought me not fluent in speech; my superior officer frowned and winked on me that I could not get on; I took a memorandum of the Magistrate's name, but being discharged I threw it away.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you see the prisoner run that morning? A. No, Sir - he did not run, he kept on a regular pace, quite slow; he kept on the same pace as when I first saw him - he did not keep the road, he turned over the fence to the Eel Pie-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What do you mean by a regular pace? A. He was going about three miles and a half or four miles an hour - I was discharged from the Police, as my superior officer made a report that I was not fluent in speech, to explain myself before the Magistrate, on this very charge.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DIXON. Q.Had you any customer of the name of Baxter? A. No - I never knew any thing of him; I know Mr. Bainbridge is a repectable merchant.</p>

On the 14th of February I was going down Holborn, about three o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner, who was a stranger, tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I wanted to buy some cigars, as he had some very cheap; I said I would go and look at them - he took me to the <placeName id="t18310512-158-crimeloc924">Blackamoor's Head, in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane, which is now called the William the Fourth</placeName>

            ' ship, Tooley-street, Borough;" the prisoner said he was captain of a vessel, and he had brought this from Holland - I said I would have it, provided it was worth the money, and I was to take it to some friends to have it valued - I asked one of them to go with me; they said they would not go with me, but I must leave a deposit - I am quite sure I offered that one of them should go with me, but they said I must leave a deposit, and they named two sovereigns - I should have said, that when I first went in I said I had no money in my pocket, but they said if I went away I should not return, and I must leave 1s. as a deposit - I at last left two sovereigns, which I put into the prisoner's hand, and went out to make inquiries about it; they said they would let me have it for 2l. 10s., as I was a servant - I took it home, showed it to the cook and lady's-maid, and it turned out to be only calico, worth about 6d. a yard - the prisoner said there were twenty-eight yards of it, but I found it only twenty-two; I went back to the house, and took the holland with me - the landlord said they had left the house directly after I had left it; I have never seen my sovereigns since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you smoke? A. Yes, I smoke tobacco in general - I thought I was buying real holland; I meant nothing but honesty - I did not ask if they had paid the duty; they did say they were smuggled, but this was not smuggled; if I had found it was real holland I should have thought it had been smuggled, and I should have laid an information; at least I could have done so - I should not have thought of buying any thing smuggled; they told me it was smuggled, but their word was not to be taken - I went out, because I was no judge of it; I did not know whether it was smuggled - they swore three or four times that it was real holland; I had an idea of laying an information.</p>
               <p>JOHN BLINCOWE. I keep the William the Fourth, in Beauchamp-street, Leather-lane. On the 14th of February some persons were at my house, and I believe the prisoner was one, but I should not have known him if I had met him in the street - my bar is on the right-hand side on entering the door - I should not have remembered the prosecutor if he had not come back again with the piece of cloth under his arm, and said he had been taken in - I had seen him before in company with two men, and I really believe the prisoner was one, but I could not swear it; the men went away soon after the prosecutor did; perhaps in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, not more certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The fact is, this man bought the cloth of me, and paid me the money for it - I told him it was worth 5l.; he considered it was worth that, and he promised to buy three pieces more, should it turn out as I represented it - I gave him my direction; I did not say I was the captain, but I said a person would meet him at that house - it was a bona fide transaction.</p>

               <p>EDWARD CALVAN. I am a Police-constable. On the 9th of April I was on duty at a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, at Limehouse, near half a mile from Mr. Guest's - I saw the prisoners in company, and each of them had a bundle; I went up, and asked what they had there - they made no answer, but went on; I followed them, and asked them again - they said it was nothing to me; I said I insisted upon seeing - Hazel said,"You shall not," and he said what he had got was his own - I said I would insist upon seeing what they had, and Parker said, "Oh, show him;" they then put the things down against a brick wall, and Hazel began to speak to Parker - I went to the river-ride, and sprang my rattle; I came back, and saw in the bundle some saws and cooper's tools - I went back to the river, and sprang my rattle again lustily; they then each of them ran at me with a cooper's adze in their hands - they struck me on the head several times, and broke my hat down; I cried Murder! a woman opened a window, and she cried Murder! the prisoners ran off; I pursued them, they returned, struck me again, and Parker struck me with a long pole; they then got over a high bank - Hazel stood under the bank, and Parker went across the field; I followed him some distance, and pointed to a man to take him - the man came up, but was afraid to take him; I went up to Hazel; he turned with the adze in his hand, and held it up to me - I told him he had better submit, it would be all the better for him; he cast his eyes down for a moment - I sprang forward, and took hold of him; I took him back to where the tools were; the inspector afterwards went to the prisoner's house with me - we there found eight rabbits, but no fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Who did you find at home? A. Nobody; the people told me the house belonged to Hazel.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Astley, a wharfinger, at Stone-stairs, Ratcliff. On Friday, the 8th of April, I was at my master's wharf, and saw Baxter the prisoner, about half-past six o'clock, but I did not then know his name - a person they called Mr. Rogers, who had a black coat, came with Baxter; they wanted me to get ready to land a piece of timber for them, and Rogers, who appeared to be the owner of the timber, said he was in a hurry for it, for the sawyers were standing still, and the building was standing still - they were both together; I did not see any timber at that time, but in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, Foreman brought a piece which appeared to me to he Memel timber - it was floating; I noticed the race-mark of thirty-four feet - I did not see in what direction it came; I was getting the handles and things ready - the tide was then coming up, and I consider if it had been half an hour later it could have been landed more conveniently, but they would make me get it up; I told them I thought it was a pity to land it then, to drag it through the mud, but Foreman put the dogs to it - I saw no cart then; we had it landed before the cart came - Mr. Rogers then asked me what was the charge for landing it; I said was he the gentleman that had been at my master's last night, and said he had some timber coming - he said Yes; I said, "You need not pay this now;" he said he would rather pay it now - they then walked with me down to my master, and I said they had landed thirty-four feet of timber, how much was it? my master called out, "One shilling, Jem," and Mr. Rogers asked Baxter for 1s., which he gave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure they did not both pay the shilling together? A. It was very much like it - I have had conversation with Mr. Dixon about this; I have only seen him once before, when I went to Lambeth-street - we landed this timber as quick as we could, as it rained very fast; I do not think there were any more men about the wharf - I would not have been there if these two gentlemen had not persuaded me; I opened the gate, and they asked who was the person to get the timber through - I said I was; it might be five or six minutes in landing - the dogs are at the end of the iron chain which hangs to the crane; the tide was not then up - the prisoners took the dogs as far as the bank, and pulled the timber out; it was some distance from the wall - it was then from half-past six to seven o'clock; I did not see it first come in sight - I was in and out, getting the handles and things ready: I did not see Foreman bring it- the first I saw of him was when he came to put the dogs - I cannot tell the length or width of it; there was thirty-four cut in it, with a race knife - there was other timber there, but we had none come in that night, or the day before; there was no single piece came in for a week before, or a week afterwards, I am certain - Mr. Dixon did not tell me the mark on this piece of timber; I took notice of it, to give an account to my master - I did not know either the prisoners or Mr. Rogers; I heard Mr. Baxter's name at the office - I knew them by their clothes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What day was this? A.One Friday morning - to the best of my knowledge, five weeks last Friday - I do not keep account of the days; Rogers acted as master of the timber, as it appeared to me; I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.What became of the timber? A. The carman came, and the prisoners and Rogers helped it into the cart.</p>

            . I am a carman. On one Friday in April, Baxter and Rogers came to me, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, and asked if I would take a piece of timber down to Poplar; it was a very wet morning, and I said it was almost too bad to go out - they hurried me on, and said they must have it done, as their men were standing still - they both spoke together; what one said the other heard - they asked what we would do it for; I sent a lad up to ask master, and he said 3s. 6d. - I went to Mr. Astley's, Stone-stairs wharf; the timber was landed, and we all helped to put it on the cart - I suppose it was then a quarter-past seven o'clock; it still rained very fast - I took it just beyond North-street bar, Poplar; I do not know whether it is Mr. Baxter's ground or not, but he told me to take it, and said he would meet me there; I did not take notice of the timber - it was only one stick; Baxter paid me on the ground - he had one foot standing on the log when he gave me the money.</p>

            . I am a soldier and a blacksmith. I know Mr. Baxter, and I know several buildings he has going on in the East India-road, and some cottages at the back of the road. I went to the North-bar, to look for work one Friday morning, about the 8th or 9th of April, I think about half-past six o'clock - I saw Baxter and Rogers there, in conversation with each other; I cannot tell what about - I saw by and by a stick of timber brought there, and it went into a small gate; Allen was the carman who brought it - it was put into Mr. Baxter's yard, and he rubbed his foot on the ground, and then rubbed it on the timber, about the centre of it; I heard Rogers say"Baxter, you have no occasion to grumble, you have got that timber cheap enough;" and he said, "It came by this," holding up his fingers in a booked direction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long did you look at the timber? A.Perhaps ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - Baxter was building some premises, or he was the master of some buildings in that neighbour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120090"/>hood - he rubbed his foot on the ground, and then on the timber, probably to take the dirt off his shoe.</p>

On Saturday, the 9th of April, Foreman was taken into custody - I looked at my stock of timber, after returning from the East India-road; when the Policeman came to me I went with him to where the deals were, and from there to Baxter's -I saw Baxter on his premises, near the North-bar; I said,"Is your name Baxter?" he said Yes - I said, "Of whom did you buy the deals?" he said, "Of Rogers;" I said,"Have you bought any thing else?" he said No - I said,"Have you bought any thing else of him at any time?" he said No - I asked him again; he then said, "I bought some laths of him about a month ago;" I questioned him again if he had not bought any thing else of him at any time - his answer was No, using the word in a positive tone; I then said, "Where did you get the piece of timber from that lies over the way?" he said, "Oh, I bought that of Rogers yesterday;" I went into the yard, and saw the piece of timber of the thirteenth float, thirty-four marked on it, and three strokes, then a cross, and my name raced in with a knife, by Foreman - the letters were robbed out, as if with road dirt, not the mud of the Thames - I rubbed it off with my hand, and then saw the letters plainly; they were about the middle of the timber - we generally mark it there, that none may be cut off; I bought it as Memel timber, but I cannot swear to that - it was Baltic timber; Rogers had worked for me as a lath-render, for about four months, but not at my wharf - Baxter told me he had known Rogers for five years; I asked Baxter what he gave for it - he said 5l. a load, which would be 2s. a foot - that would be 3l. 8s.; I bought the whole float of the timber - he told me afterwards that he gave 2l. 5s. for the piece; that was all I heard him say, except before the Magistrate - it was after I saw Baxter that I examined my stock, and missed a piece of thirty-four feet; I had not sold any timber of the whole float - I had had it about three months.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.From whom did Foreman receive orders to carry out timber? A.From myself only, and then not without a note - I have a young man, but he does not give orders; Foreman never attends to any thing he says - I am the only person who ever gives directions for the removal of timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you went to Baxter's, did you make yourself or your business known? A. I asked of whom he bought the deals - I did not tell him my name; I did not mention the name of Rogers - I knew nothing of Rogers with regard to this transaction till he told me - I could not tell whether Foreman or Rogers took them; he said he bought the laths of Rogers, but I did not tell him he was my lath-render - I believe Rogers has absconded; I have not seen him since -I have offered a reward to find him; as I was going down the road to Baxter's, a carpenter pointed out the piece of timber to me, and said there was a piece which had come very suspiciously into the yard - that called my attention to it, and when I asked Baxter he said he bought it of Rogers; I believe Rogers was a thief, but not the only one - I do not recollect that I have said that Rogers was the thief; I will not swear I have not - the piece of timber was thirty-five feet cubic measure; I gave 5l. 5s. a load for it - I gave 3l. 11s. for this piece; it was not a damaged piece.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, mind, I warn you, do you swear it was not a damaged piece? A. No, Sir, it was not; there was at one end what we call a blee, which was owing to the frost stinting it in its growth, but it would not be considered a blemish - it would sell for quite as much, and, this being a clean piece, would be preferred to many other pieces - it was in no respect injured; I did not apprehend Baxter -I gave him notice to come against Foreman, to attend and give evidence relative to the piece of timber; the Magistrate had let him go, after two examinations, but we got additional evidence after that - we did not take him before the Magistrate again; the Magistrate said he would not retract his steps. I must take him before the Grand Jury -I had then got the witnesses, White and the carman. Allen; they were not examined till the fourth examination - Baxter was not apprehended at all, when we went before the Grand Jury - he was taken at his own house yesterday - he was discharged after the third examination; I told him, in his own yard, that I should prefer a bill against him, and asked him the reason he did not attend at the office - he said he had no order but mine, and he should not attend to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Foreman had lived with you three or four years, and Rogers as many months? A. Yes - I offered a man 1l. to find Rogers; Foreman did not tell me where to find Rogers - I do not think Rogers worked on his own account; he was very much distressed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know where Rogers lived? A. No, I do not exactly. This timber was taken from my Limehouse premises - Foreman was principally engaged there - he was all that Friday in that yard; no timber sold on my account has been removed from my premises, only little trifling things, of a few shillings value - Rogers had no authority to sell; he had no authority over the other workmen.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BEAL. I am a Police-constable. I apprehended Baxter at his own house yesterday.</p>
               <p>Foreman's Defence. On the Friday morning I was going to work, and went and got 1d. worth of coffee down by the dock-gates - I there met Rogers, whom I had not seen for some time before; he said could I do a job for him - I said I could not, it got too near six o'clock; he said I might as well earn 1s., which Mr. Dixon allows us to do - he said, "Get a boat, and take that timber, and I will go and get the crane ready at Stone-stairs;" the tide did not set till a quarter to seven, and he came twice to me to say what a while I was - I said if he could get a man to do it quicker I would go on; he said, No, as I had the job, I might go on - I took it up when there was water, and then I was asked if I could not book it on; I said, No - I staid a quarter of an hour; they then asked me again, and I put the books, and they took it up, and paid the man for it, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120091"/>believe - I then asked Mr. Rogers for the 2s. he was to give me, and he went to Mr. Baxter, whom I had not known before, and got some money of him; he then gave me 2s., and said he would in the afternoon give me a drop of gin. and gave me the 6d. to pay the lock-man - I went and got my breakfast, and went to work, as I had lost a quarter of a day, which is 9d.; I leave it to the Jury to say if I should be guilty of such an error to be torn away from my wife and family, as I have been - Rogers was in the same employ with me, and he had hired a cart of Mr. Dixon, to carry bricks to some buildings of his.</p>
               <p>MR. DIXON. He did request that a man might go and get some old bricks, and I told the man to go and do it -Foreman was not at liberty to do any work without asking leave; he must have seen my name on the timber.</p>
               <p>Foreman. If I had known it had been Mr. Dixon's I should certainly have stopped it - I was glad to earn 1s. for my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Baxter's Defence. Rogers came to me on the 7th of April, and asked if I wanted any timber - I said I did, but I had bought of Christopher and Son for many years; he said, "I have some timber I obtained from over the water, by exchanging laths" (I knew he was a lath-render) - he said he wanted 3l. 5s. a load, and it was good Memel timber; I said, "Where can I see it?" he said, "It will be at Rain's wharf to-morrow morning, at half-past six o'clock;" I went there, and waited till seven, and then it came - I went and helped to land it; I measured it, and there were thirty-four feet - I gave him the price he asked me; it came to 2l. 2s. 6d., and 2s. carriage - it was taken to Poplar, and unloaded in an open yard, next to the East India-road; I know nothing of the timber, except what he told me, that he had obtained it by exchanging laths for it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not receive twenty-five quarters in the second load, and say it was all right? A. No; some of them had been delivered before the empty sacks were laid down - I cannot say how much; the prisoner, and a person who came with him, unloaded it, and two persons who were in the yard, assisted - they are not here; the corn was shot in the granary - it was all put together; there were not fifty quarters - there was one short; they have not been measured to this day, but I counted the sacks - I put the constable in charge of the prisoner before he left the yard, and he looked to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, in the presence of the two men who assisted in unloading the waggon, say the corn was right, and let the prisoner take the team from the yard, before you gave him into custody? A. No, I never said it was right - I cannot tell how long it was before he was taken; it might be an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the constable take him in the yard? A. No; I wanted to know who the receivers were - I gave the constable orders to secure him while he was in the yard; he had put out several sacks of corn, and then two empty sacks - I counted the sacks that were put out; the two empty sacks made up the number to fifty - I saw forty-eight sacks emptied, having previously seen them full.</p>

Yes - neither the servant nor apprentice are here; I had been up to wash myself, after fastening the door - I swear I did not say before the Magistrate that I saw nothing in the prisoner's hands; I said he had these rings - I first saw him just against the Hospital public-house, when he turned round; that is about twelve yards from master's house - they did not come out of the public-house; I saw them before they got to the public-house door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came out the three men were together? A. Yes - they were going towards the public-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You apprehended him more than three weeks after the robbery? A. Yes; I have seen him occasionally singing songs in the street - the Commercial-road is about half a mile from the prosecutor's; he gave me the name of Hurley, but on searching his lodging, I found it was Collins - I had been in search of him some time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was rather an under kind of servant? A.

               <p>Q. When was your attention called to the loss of this letter? A.On the Saturday morning my attention was called to the finding of a Bank-note; there was nothing particularly suspicious happened on the Tuesday - the prisoner has been two years and upwards in my employ; I considered his father a respectable man - we had a very good opinion of him, and trusted him with a great deal of property of our own.</p>

On Thursday, the 21st of April, I required the prisoner to go with me to the Post-office - he came from a room allotted to him opposite our office, up one pair of stairs, in Middle Temple-lane; the room is not in our house - it is allotted to the prisoner to clean boots and shoes, and doing other affairs; I think that was between twelve and one o'clock - after being summoned by me to come down stairs, telling him he was wanted immediately, he wished to return to his room, but I required him to come instantly - he was in the habit of cleaning my boots; he did not return after going away that morning - after he was gone I put on a pair of my boots, which I got from our office in Middle Temple-lane; his duty, when he had cleaned my boots, was to return them to my private residence in Took's-court, Chancery-lane - I found my boots in the inner office, at half-past eight o'clock, on the Saturday morning after the Thursday on which he left; I put them on, and found a 10l. note in one of them - I took it to the General Post-office, and marked it; this is it(looking at it); I had not worn the boots since the Wednesday - I was present on Friday night, before nine o'clock, when my brother brought them to the inner office; they were left there that night - the office was locked up by my brother, I think, but we left together, leaving it closed; I opened it next morning, but left it before I went to put on my boots - I left Glover there; he is a youth who had come into our service that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you away? A. I should think not a minute - I only crossed the way to the office; all the clerks have access to the office, but not usually to the office the boots were in - I know of nothing that could require them to go there; they can go if they choose - it is not left open; the key is usually hung up when not in use - it hangs under the counter, behind the shop door; my boots had been in the room from Thursday morning till Friday evening, at nine o'clock - I had not looked into them during those two days.</p>

               <p>GEORGE ABRAM. On the evening of Friday I brought my brother's boots over from the room opposite to the shop, where the prisoner had cleaned them - they had been cleaned; I put them into the inner office or counting-house - I believe no use was made of the room after the prisoner left, as the new boy did not come till Saturday; the key hung in the shop.</p>

               <p>MARY INWARD. I am cook to Mr. Abram. I entered his service on the 19th of April; on Wednesday, the 20th, about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came into the kitchen - I thought I saw something in his hand - I think it was a note; there was a lighted candle in the kitchen - I believe I lighted it for him; I left him in the kitchen, and shortly after returned - the prisoner was there, and there was a letter on the dresser: I think it laid open - he was then standing at the dresser, towards the window; I believe he had a note in his hand - I do not recollect how he was holding it; I believe he was looking at it - his face was towards the window; the lighted candle was then on the dresser - I do not think it was far from him - the kitchen is light; a person can read in it without a candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had your own business to attend to, and did not take much notice of what was going on? A. No; I cannot swear it was a note that I saw in his hand.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. (Looking at a paper) the red ink signature or mark on this, is mine, and signifies that on the evening of the 19th of April I opened the unpaid-bag from the receiving-house in Middle Temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have not put your name to it? A. No, it is not customary - I have put a mark, which signifies that I opened the bag that night; I cannot speak about the paid bag - unpaid letters have, at times, dropped into the paid bag.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I belong to the City Police. I saw the prisoner at the Post-office, on Wednesday, the 20th of April, when there was some explanation about a different matter to this - I searched him, and asked if he had any money; he said No - I found but 6d. on him; I was at Bow-street on Monday, the 25th of April; depositions were taken against the prisoner that day - before they were taken I saw him in the presence of Mr. Peacock, the Post-office solicitor, who told him he had no occasion to answer questions unless he pleased, and if he did it might he taken in evidence against him - no threat or inducement whatever was held out to him; Mr. Peacock said whatever he said might be given in evidence against him, and reminded him of having said, at the Post-office, that he had no money - he said, "Yes, I did, but I have since heard of what has been found;" Mr. Peacock showed him the note produced, and asked if he knew any thing of the writing - he said, "Yes, that is my hand-writing;" he said, "I put it into my master's boot, and I will tell you all about it;" he then said that on Tuesday last, the 19th of April, he was in Fleet-street, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, that he met a female standing at the corner of Crown-court, leading out of Fleet-street, who asked him to give her something to drink, that he did so - they went to a house a few doors down the court, on the right-hand side; that he called for a glass of ale, and she had some brandybitters, and he saw some Bank notes in her hand; that she asked him to write the word "Bank" on them; that he did so on some of them, but he thought not on all, and afterwards she gave him one of the notes for his trouble in writing on them - that that note produced he received from the female, and was one of those he wrote the word "Bank" on - I asked if he knew the woman; he said No. he had never seen her before, nor did he know where she lived - he said when his master called him down on Thursday to attend the Post-office, at the moment he was called he threw the note into the boot - he was asked if he had called for a light from the servant girl, which he denied - he also denied having any note in his hand, or any letter, when the servant brought the light - that was stated to him before he denied it; I asked if he borrowed a pen of the landlady to write on the notes - he said No, the girl went to a house in the court to fetch the pen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell him the servant said he had a letter in his hand? A. He had heard her evidence stated before the Magistrate; what the prisoner stated was not taken down, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Nothing was stated to him about what the girl said? A. No; he had heard her evidence given.</p>
               <p>MR. MARK BEECHAM PEACOCK. I am solicitor to the Post-office. I have heard Tyrrell's evidence - his account of what the prisoner said is correct; I did not hear the whole of the statement - I gave him the warning stated, and said nothing to induce him to confess; he was at the Post-office on Wednesday, and went home after that - on the Thursday he was sent for with Mr.

            . I am the prosecutor's son, and was taking care of this house. I left with the prisoner about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, on the 7th of November - he came out with me; I left the door shutter down - the door was locked, and I had the key; the bar was across the window shutters - they were all closed, except the door shutter; I bolted the back door with two bolts - I went to dine with my father, and returned to the house about dusk, and saw the prisoner within twenty yards of the door; as I went towards the house - he said, "Bill, there is a pane of glass broken;" I said, "I cannot see any pane broken;" he said, "Why, can't you see it?" and pointed to it - I found it was broken; the shutters were all correct, but a pane was broken in the front door, half of which is glass; I had left it all sound - the glass was broken close to where the door opens; a person could put his hand in and unbolt it - it was shut, and still bolted; every thing seemed right - I missed a blanket, but nothing else, not knowing what there was in the house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You came out at that door, how did you bolt it? A. I locked it - I found a trunk broken open in the room, but missed nothing; I had slept in the house the night before - the blanket was then on the bed when I left in the morning, and all correct.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came out of the house on Sunday morning with the prosecutor's son, and never went to it again till seven o'clock in the evening - I then went there, and went to bed; I saw the glass broken as we went to the house - when he entered he said he saw somebody had been into the house; he did not want his friends to know of it till the morning, but I said I would not stop in the house unless he let his friends know, and he went and told a friend - I slept there that night, and till Wednesday, when Mrs. Claridge said she did not care about any body sleeping there, and on Thursday morning, about six o'clock, they took me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROGERS, JUN. The prisoner came out of the house with me, and parted from me two or three hundred yards on, between the house and Northall; when I came home in the evening I found him in the neighbourhood, and he walked with me to the house - directly we opened the door he went towards the back door, but I did not examine it, and cannot say whether it was bolted - the front door was fastened, but that shuts on being pulled too; the orchard goes all round the house.</p>

             at that time; I lost the money which was in my pocket about 15s., a few halfpence, and part of the waistband of my trousers - I saw Budd with my fob and part of the waisthand in his hand; I saw him give Taylor the pocket with the money in it - Taylor went out with it, and I followed him into the White Horse public-house, and asked him for my money; he asked what money I meant - I said he knew what money, I wanted the money he had taken out of my pocket; I shut the door - he opened it, and followed me out - he came as far as Mr. Stauley's, the butcher's, and then knocked me down; when I got up I saw

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You must have got rid of 5s. out of the sovereign? A. I paid for eight pots of beer for them - I gave the landlord the sovereign, and he took for the eight pots; I cannot tell how much it came to, as I am no scholar - I was quite sober all the time - the waiter was in the house; I was carried into the skittle-ground against my will - I called out to the waiter; he did not hear me - I was crying as loud as I could all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the waiter? A. After I was in the shed. I was laying down in the shed- I have been a sailor about two years, and have been round the Isle of France; I was a sailor in 1830 - this is the first time I have been in a Court of Justice; I was never here before in my life - I was in the other Court about twelve months ago, accused of stealing some hay; I had fetched it for a man who had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. You forgot all that when you swore you never was in a Court of Justice? A. I did not rightly know what a Court of Justice was - I am sure that was the only time; I lived once with a gentleman named Tuck; I did not go from his service to the House of Correction - I was put there for climbing over a hedge; it was for breaking the hedge down.</p>
               <p>Q. And taking some wood, I believe? A. No, I had none of the wood - I was with the party that had it, at least I was in one field, and they in the other; I was in the House of Correction two months on that charge - that is the only time I was ever in trouble; I was not in the House of Correction three weeks for stealing potatoes - I have told all the trouble I have been in; I was cast away in the North Seas, and shipwrecked; I was acquitted on the charge about the hay; the jumping over the hedge was twelve months before that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure you were sober when you went before the Justice? A. Yes; that was on the evening it happened - I changed the sovereign to lend

            , ESQ. I am a Magistrate, and live at Edmonton. On the evening of the 9th of April the prosecutor came to my house - I think it was about six o'clock; he was sober then.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUGHES. I am a pork-butcher, and live at Edmonton. I was at the Three Tons on the 9th of April, about half-past four o'clock; I saw the prisoners there, and saw the prosecutor there - I saw Taylor, Budd, two Sawyers, and Flood there; Grimes was laying on the ground in the shed of the skittle-ground (I do not think he was drunk), and Taylor had his hands over his mouth - Flood was cutting off part of his waistband and the pocket; they got it off; Sawyer did not interfere at that time - when they had cut off the pocket they both walked away; Grimes got up, said he was robbed, and they all walked out of the yard - I followed them, and Grimes followed me- Budd was sitting on a form in the skittle-ground at the time they were cutting the pocket off; it was done with a white-handled knife.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If Grimes has sworn that when Flood was cutting off the pocket, Budd was holding it out for him, is there a single word of truth in it? A. Budd was not there then - he had nothing to do with cutting the pocket; I should suppose he was nearly twenty yards from Flood at that time - I was sober- I went there, as Gapps' son was going in, and called me to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How many persons were in the skittle-ground besides these men? A. I saw nobody besides Gapps' son and the prisoners - we were not looking on; Gapps' son went to the shed to look for the ball, and could not find it - I went to look for it then, and saw this happen; my mind was not directed to a robbery at first - I never saw men lark in that way; Grimes was on the ground, he was not asleep - I do not think he was tipsy; I will not swear he was sober - I heard him say he was robbed; he did not appear to have been drinking, I am no particular judge of a drunken man - he walked out of the yard very straight.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK SMITH. I am pot-boy at the Three Tons, On the 9th of April Grimes was at the house; I saw

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose, like an honest man, you went instantly for a Policeman? A. No. I thought it was a mere lark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did you see the pocket? A. I saw it picked up down in the skittle-ground - there was no money in it then; one of our little girls picked it up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Whether they were quarrelling or larking you cannot say? A. It did not appear a lark - he appeared perfectly sober when he came to me, and quite overcome with grief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. So sober, it must be impossible but he could tell whether a man was twenty yards from him, or cutting his pocket? A. I know nothing of that - he gave me a very good description of the manner he was robbed; I saw nothing of Budd.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WICKS. I belong to Latimer's charity.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been at school? A. Five years - I was between twenty and thirty yards of the men; I could hear it sound - it was silver; I can tell the jink of silver.</p>

            . I am sister to Mrs. Sowerby, a pawnbroker. On the 13th of May the prisoner brought in this watch - I was in the shop; he pawned it for 1l.</p>
               <p>VICTOR RODRIGUES. I came from the East Indies, in the ship Oriental; the prisoner slept in my bed in a room in Cornwall-street. On the 13th of May I wound up my watch while he was in the room, and then put it into my chest - I went down to dress some victuals about half-past three o'clock, and at five I missed my watch - I had left the prisoner and Antonio in the room; I had put the key of my chest under the pillow of the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was left in the room, but Antonio stole the watch while I was asleep - he then awoke me up, and said if I would go and pawn it I might have half the money, and he would have the other half.</p>
               <p>JURY to VICTOR RODRIGUES. Q. What was the character of Antonio? A. I believe he had a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM JUDGE. Q. Did you take the prisoner to Antonio? A. I brought Antonio to the prisoner- he denied it, and the Magistrate discharged Antonio.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Upper George-street, about two o'clock in the morning, on the 10th of April - I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner standing together; the prosecutor was drunk - the prisoner was in the act of putting his own hat on the prosecutor's head - I asked him what he was doing with the drunken man, and if he knew him; he said No, but that he saw him on the pavement, lifted him up, and he had put his own hat on him out of kindness - the prosecutor charged him with having taken his hat; one of my comrades came up - I left the prosecutor with him; the prisoner said if I would walk a little way he would give me the hat and tea - we walked on; he met a woman - he said to her "You must give up those things; the Policeman is very civil but he will not be done" - we then went down a mews, and found the hat behind some dung; the woman gave me the tea out of her bosom - I took them both to the station-house; the prisoner said she was his wife, and stated where they lived - the woman pointed the hat out; here is the hat and tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man laying on the pavement, quite intoxicated - a woman came up and said he was her husband; she took his hat up, and went away with it - I told the Policeman that a woman described herself as his wife, and I told him the way she went; we went and found her, and she gave up the hat - the man was drunk, and did not know who took it; I never saw the woman before - I never called her my wife.</p>

               <p>JAMES COLLINS. I am a Police-constable. I was applied to by the prosecutor to go to No. 4, Church-street, where I found Edwards in the first floor room - the prosecutor pointed it out to me: I found Jones in the floor above -Edwards was some time before she opened the door; I asked her for the young man's watch - she said she had no watch of his; I then asked her for the duplicate - she said she had no duplicate but what was her own; I said she must go with me to the station-house - she said why did not I take the other girl as well as her; I found this bag laying on the table, and in it the duplicate of this watch - I then went up stairs with her, and she knocked at Jones' door; I was asked what was wanted - I said I wanted her respecting a watch; she said would I allow her to dress herself - I said, certainly; I then took her to the station - it is not a house of ill-fame; it is for travellers and working people - here are the prosecutor's trousers; the watch-pocket appears to be torn.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HAMPSTEAD. This is the duplicate I gave for the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoners put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had treated them with liquor, and sent Edwards to pledge his watch.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Did you treat the prisoners to any drink? A. Yes; we had a pint of beer and a quartern of gin at a house in Long-acre.</p>

               <p>LEWIS PYMER. On the 12th of April I was coming from Covent-garden theatre - I went to a public-house in <placeName id="t18310512-190-crimeloc1111">Bow-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Do you say the Policeman caught him running up the court? A. I said it, but I do not swear it - I came out when the theatre was over; I did not notice whether there was a crowd -I went very quietly into the public-house; there might be persons about, but they did not molest me - I was squeezed in coming out: I gave five guineas for the watch - I bought the seals since: I did not say at Bow-street, at one time that it was worth 2l. 10s., and at another that it was worth 6l. - it was coming out of the public-house I lost it; I do not think there was above one per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120102"/>son walking about - Drury-lane was not over; there was a coach and a cab there, which belonged to me - the coachman was standing by the cab; the prisoner went up a passage, and I lost sight of him - I did not look in that direction for my watch; I dare say he had not the watch long - I do not suppose he had it a moment; I had gone directly from the theatre to the public-house - I had seen the seal and key in the public-house, but had not pulled the watch out; I felt it all the way coming from the play-house - I had my hand on my fob; I had not been drinking - I do not know that I had been to Mr. Jones' winevaults, in St. Giles'; I might have been there.</p>

            . I am bar-man at the Marquis of Anglesea public-house. I supplied the prosecutor with a glass of ale - when he got to the door I heard a scuffle; I went to the door, and saw him engaged in a scuffle with the prisoner - they both fell on the pavement; the prisoner extricated himself, and ran up a court that leads into Russel-street - I saw a man pursuing him; the witness appeared perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite sure he was not intoxicated? A.If he had been I must have observed it - he said he had been robbed directly the prisoner went away; I did not follow the prisoner, as I had my business to attend to, and others were following - I did not observe any person about at the beginning of the scuffle, except some hackney-coachmen; I did not observe whethere he had a watch - I did not see any one in his company; the court he ran up was a thoroughfare - I saw him brought back; I am certain he is the man who scuffled with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him come back in company with the Policeman? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the cook's shop - I was just going by that house, when the prosecutor caught hold of me and said I had robbed him; he pulled me about, and I pulled him about - we both fell down together; I certainly did run away, but I had no knowledge of the watch - I am a hackney-coachman.</p>

               <p>THREE OTHER COUNTS, varying the manner of stating the charge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TUCKER. I am assistant-overseer of the poor of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury - they are united, for the purpose of maintaining the poor. I have a paper, which I got from Mr. Twilly, the governor of the workhouse; here is the signature of T. Tucker to it, but it is not my writing. nor written with my authority or knowledge; I am in the habit of giving written orders to paupers, to get clothing, daily and hourly, I may say- there is no other person named Tucker who gives such orders; the orders I give are on pieces of paper similar to this, and the wording of it is similar - they are as nearly alike as possible; I am not very particular in wording them - if it had been my signature Mr. Twilly would have been authorized to deliver the articles stated; he would have been bound to comply with it - it is the usual way in which we have been in the habit of giving articles to the out-door poor: Mr. Twilly has apparel by him to comply with such orders; it is entrusted to him by order of the directors of the poor, who are appointed by the joint vestry, under the local Act, which I now hold in my hand- there are twelve from each parish; the Act is the 11th of George the 4th.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. By what authority do you act? A. I am one of the assistant-overseers - I have my appointment with me; we act as overseer in every point of view, as regards the relief of the poor - I do not in general write "By order of T. Tucker;" I generally write, - Give such an article to such a person, T. Tucker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your election in vestry? A. Yes. I might have used the words "By order" in one of my papers, but not in general - I should consider that this means that T. Tucker wrote it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL DRISCOLL. I am errand-boy to the master of <placeName id="t18310512-193-crimeloc1128">St. Giles' workhouse</placeName>

I saw the prisoner a day or two before Good-Friday - he came to me in the lodge, and gave me a paper, which I looked at, and put on the file; I did not mark it, but I can tell this paper by the name at the bottom - I took no copy of it.</p>

On the night of the 22nd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I heard footsteps going down the gateway, into the garden - my master's potato-warehouse is in the cellar - when I got up, at six, I went into the cellar, and saw the potatoes, which were not in the same state in which they were the night before - they had then been up to the cill of the door; about two bushels were then gone - the prisoner was in my master's regular employ; he used to dig the ground, and do any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You had seen the potatoes the day before? A. Yes, in the evening - I did not know what quantity there were precisely - I thought there looked to be less than there was the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was the way in which you heard footsteps, leading to the prisoner's house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE FIELDER. I live at Teddington - my back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120104"/>yard joins Mr. Dell's garden. On the evening of the 21st of March, at twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, my dog barked; I looked out to see what was the matter; I saw the prisoner getting over Mr. Dell's wall with a sack, which appeared to be potatoes; the night was very light - I had a good opportunity of seeing him, and am quite certain he was the man; I saw him go into his own house - he then came out, spoke to the dog, and the dog was quiet; the dog was acquainted with him, though he might not know his footsteps.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How near is that wall to the pales? A. The length of the garden is perhaps a hundred yards - I am quite sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you married? A. Yes, my husband lives with me, but he was from home that night; I have three children - the barking of the dog disturbed them; two of them were ill, and had only been put into bed a few minutes before, out of a warm-bath; Mr. Nash had not been passing the evening with me - I do not know his motive for coming; he came, and staid some few minutes; I had been insulted by him before - I told him to walk out, and he went out directly after the robbery was committed; he had not seen all that I did - he saw him go into his own back door, but he was very much in liquor at the time; I saw the prisoner get over the wall with the sack - it had all the appearance of having potatoes in it; I could certainly see that the sack was not smooth - the prisoner had to pass me at my door; he might be about five yards from me - it is a half-sash door, and was a little ajar; the door is frequently open - I have frequent business out in my yard, and at my pump; Nash remained some few minutes after I had seen the prisoner, till I prevailed on him to go out: the prisoner lived next door to me for four or five months - I do not know whether there was any search made on his premises; I had no hand in this proceeding against the prisoner - I only told Mr. Dell what I had seen.</p>

I received information, and had him taken into custody in three or four days or a week afterwards; he continued in my service for one day afterwards, and he came on the Monday and asked for work - I told him I would not employ a man who got into my place at such unseasonable hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you take out a warrant for the articles? A. It might be a week or a fortnight afterwards; I do not think it was longer - I had not stated publicly that I had any accusation against him; when I refused to employ him he said directly, "Is it me?" and three or four more said, "Is it me?" then he went to Mr. Gye's, and sent me a lawyer's letter - he threatened to bring an action against me for slander, arising from this very charge - I did not attempt to get the warrant till he had given me notice of bringing the action.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask Mrs. Fielder whether she was at the window or in the room? A. I was at the back door.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND called -</p>
               <p>EDWARD NASH. I know the prosecutor, also his premises, and Mrs. Fielder's. I happened to be at Mrs. Fielder's on the night of the 21st of March, but I cannot say what I went for; there is a path that runs down between Mrs. Fielder's and Rose's garden - I was in the ground floor room; there is a window, which looks into the road - it is a very small one; it is about up to my breast - a person could see about halfway down Rose's garden from there - I do not think it is possible to see the wall of Mr. Dell's garden; I do not think you could see a man getting over that wall, and I do not think it is possible for a man to get over with a sack- there is a door that goes out of the shop, and a door that goes into the bake-house; there is one door that goes in the same direction with the window - I cannot say whether it was open; there is no door which, if it was open, a person could see more of the garden than they could from the window - I should think I was there between eleven and twelve o'clock; I cannot say whether Mrs. Fielder left the room while I was there - she was in the same room, but she might have left it; I might be there half an hour - I know Rose; I lodged with him very nearly two years; I saw him that night go with a sack - that was before I left Mrs. Fielder's - he came from up his garden, I thought from his pigsty; Mr. Dell's wall is at the back of the pig-sty - I saw him within a yard or a yard and a half of his own back door, and he went into his own house - this was while I was in the room with Mrs. Fielder; I cannot exactly say whether it was moon-light or not - the sack did not seem to have any thing heavy in it - it did not seem like potatoes - it was too light for potatoes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A.Between eleven and twelve o'clock - I cannot tell whether it was a three or four bushel sack, but it seemed nearly full; I should think it contained between three and four bushels - I do not know that it was not potatoes; I have no reason to think about it, but, by the way he carried it, I think it is impossible it could contain potatoes or coals, he seemed to carry it so easily; I have not mistaken the hour - he was about five yards from Mrs. Fielder's promises; she was in the room - she tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Do you see any thing, Nash?" then I looked and saw him within a yard and a half of his own back door - he was about twenty yards from the wall; Rose is a retail publican, and keeps good hours.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were you lodging with him at this time? A. No - I have left him some months; there is a little gate which goes from Mrs. Fielder's back yard into her garden.</p>
               <p>JOHN TILLEY. I know the prisoner. On Monday evening, the 21st of March, I was at his house pretty late, and asked if he could accommodate me to sleep; he said he had no spare bed, but he would make me a bed in his beer-shop with a sack of chaff - this was about twelve o'clock; he went out at his back door, which led down to his garden - there is a pig-sty at the bottom of his garden, and there is a wall as high as a good tall man; he went that way, brought in a sack of chaff, and made my bed - he had been gone about three minutes; then he went to his bed, and I to mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What sort of chaff was it? A. Oat chaff - I will not swear there was no clover, or any common hay; the sack was full - I did not empty any out; it was tied pretty tight - I slept on the top of it; I did not take off my clothes - I slept very soundly, and got up at six o'clock in the morning; I had no night-cap - my back was not sore; I had a good night's real, what little time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120105"/>I did lay - I slept the next night in the same house on the same sack; I had no blankets.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. I am a working man. I live near the prisoner - I heard of this robbery, but I do not know the day it happened; it was in March, and I think about the 21st; shortly before that he had applied to me for a sack of chaff to make him a mattress, and I sold him one; that was in February - I delivered it to him in a sack, which was full; a young man carried it to his premises - I did not go to his premises to see where it was deposited; I went and took the money for it, the same night that it went - I did not see where it was put; I know the wall between his garden and the next - I should think it is six feet high.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night was it? A. It was on a Saturday - I asked my master if I might get this man a sack of chaff; it was a whole sack - it was between six and seven o'clock when I took it in; I am no scholar, but it was in February - I cannot give any account how it was tied round; a man could sleep on it very nicely.</p>

               <p>THOMAS TUCKER. I am assistant-overseer of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury. I have seen the prisoner, but not on this occasion - this order is not my writing, nor did I ever authorize any one to write it; the prisoner has been a pauper of our parish from his childhood, I believe, but I have only known him twelve months.</p>
               <p>SARAH BAILEY. I am matron of the <placeName id="t18310512-196-crimeloc1143">workhouse of St. Giles in the Fields</placeName>

On the 22nd of March the prisoner came and presented this order - he was a pauper out of the house; I was commissioned to give what Mr. Tucker ordered - the prisoner produced this order, and I gave him a shirt and pair of stockings; I took it for granted this order was genuine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Tucker gave me the order; I asked him for it that morning, and he gave it - he is in the habit of being intoxicated, and very often is in a great bustle with having two or three hundred paupers about the house; very likely he forgot to enter it in the book - he and the other overseers have said that if it cost them 100l. they would get me transported out of the country; I was here last Session for a pair of shoes, but they never appeared against me - they said if I did not tell who forged these orders they would have me taken up.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. This is not my order, nor is there any person in the parish who gives these orders but myself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Is it a resemblance of your hand-writing? A. It is somewhat like the signing, but the order altogether is not.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. BAILEY. I presume you are well acquainted with the signature of Tucker? A. I receive a great many; I believed this to be Mr. Tucker's signature- had I had any suspicion I should have sent to him to inquire.</p>

               <p>JOHN DUFFIELD. I am a saddler, and live in Long-lane, Aldersgate-street. The prisoner, who was a perfect stranger, came to my shop, on the 5th of May, to barter a saddle for some web halters, as he told me; I asked him if any one knew him, and he said they would know him at Dixon's repository - I offered to go there with him; he seemed to acquiesce in that - I sent for my hat, and accompanied him about half the way, when he stopped short, and said it would be useless to go there, as he feared they would not recognize him; I asked him his name, and where he resided - he said his name was John Brown, and he was staying at the Fountain inn, Clapton; I asked who he was staying there with, or what he had, and he told me he had brought a horse from Norwich, or from the neighbourhood of Norwich; I told him it looked very suspicious, on account of his saying he was known at Dixon's, and then refusing to go, and I did not feel myself justified in giving up the saddle, but I would go to Clapton, and, if it was all right, I would give him the web headed halters and the sovereign, which I had agreed to do for the saddle; before I had time to go he called again, and said I had not been; I said I had not had time- I then asked if he was known to any one else; he said Yes, he was known to the person who kept the Albemarle's Head, in St. John's-square; I said, "That is a neighbour of mine, we can soon go there;" he then said he would not go there, as they had had a fall out about a pint of beer - I said I would pay for that, and give him something for going there; he still refused to go, and I then questioned him as to how he had been possessed of the horse - he said he had brought it to town for a man of the name of Johnson, who resided at Norwich; he asked me for the money, and I said I did not feel satisfied at all about paying him the money - I then asked him what he meant to do with the halters; he said, "I thought if I came and asked you to purchase the saddle out and out, you would feel some suspicion in doing so;" I then asked him his name again, and he said

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q.Did he not say he was called Dobbs very frequently, and Brown, by his friends in Norfolk? A. No - he said he left the horse at Clapton, and I found that to be correct; I sent there to stop the horse - I have ascertained that he came from Norfolk; when he brought the saddle, he looked out six web-headed halters, and asked what I would give him to boot, for the saddle - he told me in the evening that a person of the name of Johnson had given him the horse and saddle to bring to London - I had expressed my doubts the first time he came, when I found he prevaricated, and would not go to Dixon's - I told him in the evening I did not like the appearance of it; I had appointed to meet him at Clapton, but he came before I had gone out - I went to the landlord of the Albermarle's Head; I asked him first if he knew a person of the name of Brown - he did not give me a direct answer; I then asked him for the name of Dobbs, and he said he had known him twelve months.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUNCE. I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and have had the saddle ever since - this is it.</p>

This saddle is mine, and was taken from my premises - I missed it about a fortnight ago, as I usually ride with it; my servants could not give me any account of it, till I heard a horse had been stolen in my neighbourhood - the prisoner had been in my service as a boy; he served under his uncle, who worked for me as a bricklayer; he left me about two years ago - the person who lost the horse lives about two miles from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a person named Johnson? A. No; I am not much accustomed to be at Norwich-market - the prisoner lived with me four or five years; I always thought him honest, quiet, and a civil young man - he was with my wife in Devonshire, and from thence came to London; his uncle is named Brown, and he was brought up with him; this is a common saddle, but the edge of it is plush velvet - I say positively it is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that Johnson, a horse dealer, had given him the saddle and horse to bring to town to sell.</p>
