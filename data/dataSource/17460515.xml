            . Here is the Sacking I was robb'd of the 2d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity?</p>
               <p>Hide. I don't know the Quantity. Here are nine Pieces found at London-Bridge; I believe I have lost a hundred Pieces. This Gentleman, Mr. Corderoy, stopt these.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity did you miss?</p>
               <p>Hide. I did not miss it 'till the 6th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantity did you miss then?</p>
               <p>Hide. I believe by the Bulk of them in the Place, for there were two thousand, I believe there are near one hundred Pieces gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of them?</p>
               <p>Hide. I don't know what is become of them at all; but as I met with these nine which I had from Mr. Corderoy.</p>

               <p>Hide. Yes, Sir; these are the Cloths produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Then these two Pieces are yours.</p>
               <p>Hide. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Yards are there in these two Pieces?</p>
               <p>Hide. There should be twenty-four Yards in each Piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Value of them?</p>
               <p>Hide. They are worth about fourteen Shillings a Piece, but they are valued at twelve in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how you lost them?</p>
               <p>Hide. I have seen them since they stood in the Warehouse, and there are little Wooden Bars, so they have put a Stick in and book'd them out as you would a Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your Warehouse?</p>
               <p>Hide. At Brook's-Wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you lost them out of the Wharf?</p>

               <p>Court. But you don't know who took them; you don't know it of your own Knowledge?</p>
               <p>Hide. No, they were made for Hammocks of Men of War I made for the Government, and they have since taken a wider Sort, and they have been useless for a Year and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Cart. Then I went to Mrs. Carlisle's House, and found both the Prisoners there. Carter said it was his Cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came and found the Prisoners at the Bar, who shew'd you the Cloth?</p>
               <p>Cart. That Man that stands there in Blue-grey, Carter.</p>

               <p>Q. When he shew'd you the Cloth, what then?</p>
               <p>Cart. Then I said, I wish you would carry it down to the Water-side. I told him, when he carried it home he should have the Money for it.</p>
               <p>Cart. Then you did not ask him the Price, nor bid him any thing for it?</p>
               <p>Cart. No. So he carried it down to the Waterside : I would have had him come over the Water, if I could; but he pretended that the String of his Breeches was broke, and desir'd this good Woman to bring him some Money directly. I wanted it to be carried to Mr. Corderoy's, under a Pretence of having Money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Carlisle say of these two Pieces? These two Pieces were at Carlisle's House?</p>
               <p>Cart. They had a Fullpot of Beer there, and Carter said, bring me what Money you can.</p>

               <p>Corderoy. My Lord, I deal in Sacking, and I am Constable too. My Lord, this Mrs. Cart and her Husband are Sack-Weavers; they work for me in weaving of Cloth; I have bought several Pieces of them at a Market Price, and have had some Suspicion that they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, Sir?</p>
               <p>Corderoy. That was before I had a Suspicion that they were stolen. I had four before I had a Suspicion, and I had a Suspicion of the fifth Piece. This was on Saturday the 3d of May. On Monday Morning there was two more brought, and I desir'd them to bring the Persons to me. On the 6th of May they brought two Pieces with Mrs. Carlisle. I ask'd Mrs. Carlisle who she had them of; she said she they were the Property of a Person for whom she had the Disposal of them. I told her she must not take them away, but I must stop them and her too; so I takes her to Guildhall, and was before some of the Sitting Aklermen, and by her Directions went to Fleetditch, where they said Carter liv'd, but they said that

               <p>Corrock. Yes. I went up Stairs but could not find any such Things in the Name. When I came down the Door was open; one was within the House, the other was just keeping the Door open; but it was not 'till the next Morning that I miss'd the Things, and I had nobody come in but a Woman of good Character; so I made Enquiry after these People, but could not find them 'till Saturday Morning. When I took them they confess'd they had pledg'd the Gown and checqu'd Shirt; when I found them on Saturday Morning about Eight o'Clock, the Woman, she roll'd and twisted the Apron about so, that she had about her Middle, that I did not see it at the first. I said this is the Apron I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, did you find any Thing else upon them?</p>
               <p>Corrock. No, my Lord. Then I charg'd a Constable with them, and I told them, if they had a Mind to make any Confession where the Goods were, if the Justice of the Peace would acquit them, I would, could I have my Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, did they make any Confession?</p>
               <p>Corrock. Yes, my Lord. I was along with the Constable when they made the Confession. The Husband confess'd that how they both had them in their Possession; that the Woman had pledg'd the Gown for 4 s. and confess'd where they sold one chequ'd Shirt and a chequ'd Apron. It was the Man made the Confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what Place he sold the Things?</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Stephens. In Whitechappel-Road. I let these for 2 s. a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you let the Lodgings to?</p>
               <p>Stephens. To the Man. He gave me 6 d. Earnest.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Woman was not with him when you let it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you let with it? What Furniture was there in it?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Please you my Lord, there was Bed and Bedding, and Table, and Chairs, and Grate, &amp;c. I let these Things with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what Things there were in the Room.</p>
               <p>Stephens. Please you my Lord there was a Bed in the Room, a Chest, a Fire-shovel, Poker, Pillows, Blankets, &amp;c. I lost a Blanket, please you my Lord, and a Pair of Sheets, and a Woollen Rug, a Frying-Pan, and a Saucepan, a Candlestick, a Napkin and Pillowbeers. I lost these Things out of the Lodgings whilst the Prisoner Donnington lodg'd there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this ago?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Five Weeks ago last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the Goods?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I did not miss them 'till last Saturday Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say the Prisoner had them?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I was going out of the Door last Saturday Morning about Six o'Clock. My Business is a Fish-Meeter at Billingsgate. So they took an Opportunity to carry these Things out when my Wife was a-Bed and a Sleep. I saw them carrying a Bundle. So I overtook them? I said, what are you going away? No, said he, I am coming back to pay you at Night. I steps home again and takes a Ladder and goes in at the Window, and there I miss'd the Goods. I went after them down to St. Katherine's, and there I found they were in the Custody of Rickelworth. The Prisoner carried the Rug out that Morning</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the Rug here?</p>
               <p>Stephens. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not bring it?</p>

               <p>Stephens. I did not know I should?</p>
               <p>Q. What other Things did he own that he took?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I got a Search Warrant and search'd the House of Mr. Smith and Mr. Corrock; also a Napkin and Saucepan I found at Mr. Corrock's.</p>
               <p>Q. And where did you find the Curtains?</p>
               <p>Stephens. At Mr. Smith's in St. Katherine's-Lane. He had sold the Blanket and Sheet at Mr. Jones's. in Black-Horse-Yard. I went with a Search Warrant to this Broker's, and they had sold them. My Lord I want to know how I may get these Things again, for there are four or five of these Brokers join together to make a publick Sale every Month.</p>

               <p>Morris. I never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. This Man (the Prisoner) laid hold of me, and said he would blow my Brains out, because I made a Noise, when my Husband throw'd me over the Bank to make my Escape; the Moon shone in the Prisoner's Face at the Time he robb'd us; he was in Soldier's Cloaths, and his Coat was turn'd the wrong Side outwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the other?</p>

               <p>Morris. The others run swiftly by us, this Man stopt us.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had he a Wig on, or his own Hair?</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you lodge?</p>
               <p>Parran. I lodged at one Fuller's at the King's Head.</p>

               <p>Parran. It was about Nine o'Clock at Night.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they dress'd?</p>
               <p>Parran. I could not so perfectly see their Dress; but I believe Watson was in a blue Coat, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other in?</p>
               <p>Parran. The other was muffled, with a brown Coat about his Chin; but I can't be so positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be more positive to Watson than Taylor?</p>
               <p>Parran. Because Watson was the Man that took the Things out of my Pocket. I had not got thirty Yards in the Field but Watson said first, D - n your Eyes, Soldier, put out the Light, or we will blow your Brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the Prisoner, Watson, said these Words?</p>
               <p>Parran. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you pitch upon him?</p>
               <p>Parran. My Lord, he riffled me. There were three of them; one came on one Side, and the other on the other Side, and the Third held the Pistol to my Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held the Pistol?</p>
               <p>Parran. I take that to be Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what was done after this?</p>
               <p>Parran. My Lord, they took from me 20  and upwards: The Man that stood at a Distance d - nd them for being so long. Watson took 20 s. in Silver, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it?</p>
               <p>Parran. In my Breeches Pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. In no Purse?</p>
               <p>Parran. No, my Lord, loose in my Pocket: Also the Shoe-Buckles out of my Shoes, the Knee-Buckles out of my Knees, my Hat off my Head, a Tobacco-Stopper tipp'd with Silver, a Tobacco-Box, a Memorandum-Book, and all my Papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell in particular what Watson took?</p>
               <p>Parran. I believe he took the biggest Part of the Things. He tore the Lining of my Pocket out; he took the Hat off my Head, and put on an old one.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Parran. I am aboard a Man of War; I am Steward.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing further?</p>
               <p>Parran. When I desir'd him not to take my Pocket-Book, he said, D - n your Eyes, I'll blow your Brains out.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Mr. Parran, How came you so particularly to distinguish Watson from the other Soldier? How can you pretend to say that he was the Person that spoke those Words, for you never saw him before?</p>
               <p>Parran. I saw him, I think, the Monday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him?</p>
               <p>Parran. I saw him at Clerkenwell-Bridewell; I went there accidentally, and they stopp'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the third Person?</p>

They did not exactly fit, but I said, I can alter that. I said, go to the Clogster's, and buy the Buttons. Now he had got a Pair of Breeches, belonging to Mr. Broom's Boy, before; and he said to me, Brother, if you will go along with me, we shall have something to drink, &amp;c. I said, Brother, I cannot go, I am to attend upon such a one, &amp;c. I went to my Brother in Bridewell, and seeing his Irons I was sorry. I was half happy, as I am almost now.

               <p>Willis. I never heard any thing to the contrary of his having a very honest Character; he would not wrong a Wrm. He came to my House and desir'd something for supper. He went to Market, and bought some Steaks; and I never saw him out of the House that Night.</p>

               <p>Q. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>Dew. A Cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night was it?</p>
               <p>Dew. About Dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Dew. I know him by Sight; but before this Fact was done I did not know him. There were some Fellows making Game at the Prisoner as he was going home: Presently after I saw the Instrument that kill'd the Deceas'd; it seem'd to be Three-square, like a Bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it any Handle to it, any thing to take hold of?</p>
               <p>Dew. I cannot tell. There were some Men making Game of the Prisoner near his own Door; and he went in, and came out again with this Instrument in his Hand; and upon the Prisoner's coming up, the Deceas'd clos'd in with him. Upon seeing this, one Mr. Holland went to part them; and as he made his Endeavour, the Smith, the Prisoner, and the Deceas'd, reel'd back a little Way, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150011"/> the Deceas'd dropp'd down, and never spoke a Word, but died immediately; and Roberts went in at the Door, and shut it after him.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was it from Roberts's House?</p>
               <p>Dew. It was the next Door.</p>

               <p>Dew. I can't tell the Words.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you gone from them?</p>
               <p>Dew. About two or three Yards.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was Roberts gone into the House to fetch this Instrument?</p>
               <p>Dew. A very little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the Instrument before he went into his House?</p>
               <p>Dew. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something of their making Game at him; What did they make Game at him for?</p>
               <p>Dew. They seem'd to shame him for going into the House, and would not stay to scold at them, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us in what way he came out.</p>
               <p>Dew. He came out in a great Passion.</p>

               <p>Dew. But a little Wound; it was under his Ribs, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they clos'd in before they parted them?</p>
               <p>Dew. A very little while.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a Mob at the Door a little before the Murder was done?</p>
               <p>Dew. There was some People about there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Soldier there with his Piece; was the Soldier there at the Time when the Mischief was done?</p>
               <p>Dew. The Soldier was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this the Night there was the Rejoicing for the Victory of Culloden ?</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear no Conversation from the Prisoner and the other about breaking of Windows?</p>
               <p>Dew. The People were talking of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive that the Prisoner was not within-side of his Groundsel when they had the Scuffle ?</p>
               <p>Dew. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were in the Scuffle and clos'd how far were they from the House?</p>
               <p>Dew. About the Middle of the Street.</p>
               <p>Council. You said somebody endeavour'd to part them, and they stagger'd toward the House, and just before the Door the Man fell down dead.</p>
               <p>Dew. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did not the Deceas'd insist upon it that he was Man enough for the Prisoner, and he would fight him ?</p>
               <p>Dew. I did not hear that.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Seal. Please you, my Lord, as I was going from my Work the Night the Rejoicing was, there was a Bonfire made at the Upper-end of Golden-Lane. I went to the Bonfire, and as I stood by the deceas'd Man, this Roberts and he had some Words.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there at the Beginning of the Quarrel?</p>
               <p>Seal. My Lord, I was not at the Beginning. The deceas'd Man was by the Fire, and there was some Windows that had not Lights put up; and they were talking round the Fire side of breaking Windows; with that Roberts came to the Fire-side, and he and the Deceas'd had some Words.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the Words?</p>
               <p>Seal. I can't tell. With that Roberts goes back to his own House, and a little after he came again, and several more Words passing, they went towards Roberts's Door. With a great many Words the Deceas'd challeng'd to fight Roberts for Half a Crown: With that Roberts takes up the Flap of his Coat, and said all the Cloaths that he had upon his Back were not worth Half a Crown. Said the Deceas'd, if they are not worth Half a Crown, I have Half a Crown in my Pocket, for which I will fight you: With that, when Roberts came out again, he ran at the Deceas'd, and they collar'd one another, and scuffled 'till they had got just at the Threshold of Roberts's Door: I saw Roberts make an Offer of striking, but did not see any Weapon, or any Blow struck. That was all that I saw of it, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Scarborough. My Lord, I can't say I ever heard this Fellow, the Deceas'd, speak a Word to him: I saw Roberts go back to his own House, and said d - n Duke William and all the Family; must I have my Windows shut up?</p>
               <p>Court. Well then he was complaining that his Windows were shut up, and he was angry?</p>
               <p>Scarborough. I can't say what he was angry at, except it was shooting at the Bonfire; though this Fellow, the Deceas'd, never shot nor ever gave any Provocation, as I heard; I saw them close in, and Roberts had a Weapon in his Hand; but what it was I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, I went to Bed, and this young Woman I thought was going to Bed, too. She was with me four Days and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, what happen'd?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At Night I went to Bed, and thought that she was going to bed. In the Morning, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150015"/> I got up, the Door was open, and she had not been in Bed: I had great Reason to suspect that she was the Person that got the Things; and she never came any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I miss'd four Napkins, Shift-Sleeves, a Gold Ring, one Silver Salt, taken out of the Children's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find her out?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, she was taken in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you charge her?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Please you, my Lord, there was one Mrs. Ashly who came to see me on Easter-Monday; she took her with a Hat upon her Head, which she own'd was mine; with that she sent for me; and when I came, the Prisoner confess'd that she was in Liquor when she did it, or she should not have done it; which I believe. She said, she sat down at the End of Field-Alley to sleep, and the Ring was taken out of her Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the Things that you are sure are your's ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, here's the Hat; as for the Gold Ring, she says that she has lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any Thing of the Napkins again?</p>

I said to the Maid, if you know any thing of them tell your Mistress, to put her out of her Fears; but there was a Gentleman in the House, one Mr. Russel, who insisted to know were she lodg'd that Night; so she said she was to pay Three-pence and sit up all Night: Her Mistress ask'd her how she came by that Three-pence, as she had no Money when she went away; she then said she had pawn'd her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150016"/> checqu'd Apron for 18 d. at such a Pawmbroker's; then we went to enquire where she said she had been over Night; and by what I heard of her Character I thought it was sufficient to go back again and make an Enquiry: At first she stifly deny'd it, but afterwards came to a Confession; she confess'd she had them, and deliver'd them to me, and I deliver'd them to Sir

               <p>Cook. That she had casry'd them to the Pawnbroker's and pawn'd them for three Half Crowns, in St. Martin's-Lane; as to the Pawnbroker's Name she could not tell. Whereupon he order'd me to take her away to the Round-House. The next Morning he granted Mr. Hudson a Search Warrant: Accordingly we went to Mr. Caddy's, in St. Martin's-Lane; we takes the Woman at the same Time from the Round-House, and brings her before the Justice, and the Pawnbroker at the same Time, and she was committed to the Gatehouse.</p>

               <p>Hern. The 22nd of February I weigh'd up my Stuff, then I lost a Quill of Silver Wire; the 26th of March I weigh'd my Stuff again, and I lost a Quill of Gold Wire and a Quill of Gold Plate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>Hern. When I found I had lost them, I cry'd thoroughly; I tax'd my little Girl, my Apprentice, with it: I cry'd bitterly; she put her Hand round my Neck, and desir'd that I would not cry. I got a Warrant for the Mother and Child both.</p>

               <p>Q. So you had a Warrant for them, and had them before a Magistrate; and what past there? what did she say?</p>
               <p>Hern. She (the Girl) said she took the Quill of Wire out of my Drawers, and hid it behind the Bedstead 'till Sunday; then she took it out, and her Mother was to meet her at St. Luke's, which she did, and her Mother went home directly, and the Girl went into the Church. The Girl told the Justice that her Mother set her on; next she told the Justice, that she unty'd my Bag, and took two Quills, and hid them in the same Place that she did the Silver Wire ?</p>
               <p>Q. Did she deliver that at Cripplegate Church?</p>
               <p>Hern. Yes, she gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say? Did the Mother say any Thing?</p>
               <p>Hern. She denied it positively. I ask'd the Girl before the Justice; Mary, did not you tell your Mother on Easter Sunday the Grief and Trouble I was in? Yes, said the Girl, Mother you know I did.</p>

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Best. On Friday the 9th of this Month I was going by an empty House of Mr. Moor's, at the End of Finch-Lane in St. Martin's in the Fields. Some of my Neighbours told me, there was a Person had brought some Lead out of the House: I went up to him, as he was standing with some Lead in his Hand. When I came to him, he said he was sent for it. I ask'd him if he had any Key; he said, No. I then said, Are you sent to get in at the Window? He said, he was sent for it by a Person in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What Lead was it that you found in his Custody?</p>
               <p>Best. It was Part of a Leaden Gutter; it might be about 50 or 60 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Best. He told me he would not stay, he insisted upon taking the Lead away. I turn'd myself about, and seeing many of my Neighbours there, I ask'd them what I should do; they advis'd me, by all Means, not to let him go. I was speaking about sending for Mr. Pearse the Constable, and soon he came, and I charg'd the Constable with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Best. I had him before Sir

               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing before Sir Thomas?</p>
               <p>Best. Yes, to his Clerk.</p>
               <p>Court. What were the Clerk's Words?</p>
               <p>Best. He said, Do you acknowledge the stealing of this Lead. He then immediately down'd upon his Knees, and begg'd that I would shew him Mercy. He said it was Necessity that drove him to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was it he enter'd this House and took the Lead?</p>
               <p>Best. About Nine o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear frighten'd like a Thief when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Best. The Prisoner said he was in Liquor, and could not tell what he did.</p>

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Seamans. Last Saturday Night, coming from Bishopsgate-Street, there was a Woman that said to me, Whither are you going? I said, going home. She ask'd me if I would give her a Glass of Wine? I said it was too late, it was Time to go home. There were to or three of them; I saw them stoop down and speak to one another. I put my Hand to my Pocket and found it turn'd out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two Women, How do you know it was this? it might be the other.</p>
               <p>Seamans. It was not the other Woman, she was not so near.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Money had you in your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Seamans. Five Shillings and Sixpence, my Lord, and no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no Notion of their picking your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Seamans. No, my Lord, 'till I saw them looking down to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What Mistruit could you have by seeing them looking down to the Ground ?</p>
               <p>Seamans. I then clapp'd my Hand to my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What Company had you been in before?</p>
               <p>Seamans. I was in Company with some young Men; my Master's Son, and several of us, were at a Merriment on the Account of a young Man's being out of his Time.</p>

I had been to a Friend of Mr. Dun's; and as Mr. Dun, and another Man, that went along with us, were coming by St. Michael's Alley, near the Exchange, we saw a Man with a Woman up in the Gateway; as soon as they heard us the Man got his Breeches up as soon as he could, and the Woman run away towards the Exchange; and there was that young Woman at the Bar, who was about seven or eight Yards towards Cornhill; this young Man runs to her, and says, You are the Person that was along with me up in the Alley. She declar'd her Innocency. Then the Prosecutor said, You are a Confederate with her, if you are not.</p>

               <p>Court. Now tell us what past.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. They had been disputing, my Lord, together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there besides them?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. All these Witnesses. They charg'd one another with Sodomitical Practices. The Deceas'd desir'd him (the Prisoner) to quit his Company; he said he would not: With that he did but come into his Company again, and in about ten Minutes Time he stabb'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was backward and forwards, and not in the Company. Upon what Occasion were they met together, or was it any publick Time?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. It was what they call a Chair-Night. The young Men in the Neighbourhood come frequently to that House. These two quarrell'd and wrangled with one another for the Space of Three-quarters of an Hour.</p>
               <p>Court. They charg'd one another with Misbehaviour; What past about that Time?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I was leaning over the Suttle while they were wrangling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the rest of the Company do, did any body interpose, or say any thing to them?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. The Prisoner at the Bar, he had a Penknife in his Hand, that no body could discern : I did not see him give the first Stab. He gave him a rip up, and he fell back, and said, Oh! Oh! Then the Prisoner at the Bar, after he had ripp'd him up, gave him three or four Punches in the Breast with his Double-Fist.</p>
               <p>Q. You said just now that the Prisoner had gone out of the Company; How long was it after he return'd that this Misfortune happen'd?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I believe about six or seven Minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when he came into the room again?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. All the Time, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. When the Deceas'd got up to go out of his Company the Prisoner then stopp'd him.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Deceas'd upon his Legs?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. He mov'd, and came towards the End of the Table; then the Prisoner ripp'd him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Deceas'd say?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. He said he must quit his Company, or he should get out of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when the Deceas'd said that, and was moving along, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I did not hear him say one Word.</p>
               <p>Court. You describ'd the young Man as leaning back, and crying, Oh! Oh!</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I did not think he was stabb'd: They came out when he was hitting of him, and had, as it were, all the Room to themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Now before the Prisoner went out the first Time, what past about the Prisoner's leaving the Company.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. The Prisoner was persuaded to leave the Deceas'd's Company; then afterwards he came again.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Deceas'd fell down, was it any Distance?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. The Prisoner follow'd him two or three Steps, and stabb'd him in the Breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Immediately seiz'd him, as soon as he had struck him. I twisted his Arms when I laid hold of him; and he said, Let me go, or I will stab some of you.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Deceas'd came to go out at the End of the Table, as you have been describing, Did he strike the Prisoner, or was he in a Temper of Striking?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. My Lord, he spoke with all the Mildness in the World; said, he would not stay in his Company if he continued wrangling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he justle or push him, or any thing to provoke him? Then he was not come up to him to strike; which would be very material. Did the Prisoner do any thing to hinder the Deceas'd's geting out.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I never saw any thing but the Stabs upon the Breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing else relating to Circumstances? Had you any Discourse with the Deceas'd after he was wounded.</p>
               <p>

            ) Was you in this Company?</p>
               <p>Merrit. I was in the Company from the Time it began, to the Time of the unhappy Accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with this young Man? You was all of a Club, was you?</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what past previous to this Misfortune.</p>
               <p>Merrit. The young Men, the Society, newly came from another House; they are Neighbours, and such like, together; and the Landlord offer'd to give us an Entertainment. We came to Supper after we had left Work. A little while after we had been there, the Prisoner at the Bar came along with another Man up Stairs; they were ask'd to sit down before Supper, which accordingly they did. By and by the Deceas'd came into the House, and enquir'd for Mr. Church; but a young Man said he would bear him Company 'till he came, he believ'd it would not be long. After Supper was over the Prisoner went down to the Deceas'd, and came up again; and some Time after the Deceas'd sent up, If any of them had any thing to say to him, they might come down.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Deceas'd was not in the Room?</p>
               <p>Merrit. No; the Deceas'd had some Steaks dress'd for himself in another Room. When the Prisoner went down most of us went down with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have any Curiosity to hear ?</p>
               <p>Merrit. Because they were accusing one another with Sodomitical Practices. The Prisoner told the Company the Deceas'd was one concern'd in Sodomitical Practices. All of us came down, and stood round the Table. Several Words and Squabbles past between them. The Deceas'd said, Bear Witness what the Man says to me. Please you, my Lord, after several Words had past we went up again; I can't say there was any thing more 'till the unhappy Accident. When we had paid the Reckoning the Prisoner said, Are your Company gone? the Landlord said, some are below and some above. Then said the Prisoner, I'll go and have a Look at them. Now his Friend, one Shaw, desir'd that he would not go; but he insisted upon going in to look at the Deceas'd. Some of the Company desir'd him not to set before the Gentleman, because it would be an Affront to him; so he sat down at the End of the Table; and a great many Things past upon the Subject. At last he turn'd about and said, he would withdraw out of his Company, or else the Prisoner should go away.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had paid your Reckoning above Stairs?</p>
               <p>Merrit. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the first Wrangling who did you leave in the Room with the Deceas'd.</p>
               <p>Merrit. There were, I believe, two or three; the Prisoner said he would go and have one Look more at him; and his Friend told him he was afraid. Mischief would come of it: He said these Words, or to that Effect.</p>
               <p>Q. You all went into the Room; pray tell what pass'd then?</p>
               <p>Merrit. He sat down at the End of the Table; some of the Company desir'd him to get off, telling him he should not sit before the Gentleman, meaning the Deceas'd, but he continued sitting at one End of the Table and the Deceas'd at the other, when the latter desir'd him to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner urge the Quarrel again?</p>
               <p>Merrit. Sometimes Words ran high, and sometimes abated; then the Deceas'd desir'd him to withdraw, or he would go into a private Room and talk with any of us; but as for that Man, meaning the Prisoner, he would have nothing to say to him; so some of the Company made an Opening for him, and as he was coming out the Prisoner met him; he lifted up one Hand and with the other made several Motions at his Belly; I did not see the Gentleman make any Return, but cry'd out, Oh! Oh! then he said I am ripp'd; I did not hear him say he was ripp'd up, but I am ripp'd;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150027"/> with that he fell backward, and the Prisoner stepp'd forward and gave him some more Pushes; I saw his Powels come out, and there were two or three Wounds upon his Breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the Knife from him?</p>
               <p>Merrit. No, my Lord; but the Gentlemen who were by took the Knife out of his Pocket: When the Deceas'd open'd his Cloaths a considerable Quantity of his Blood and Bowels flew about.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you the same Question as I did the other Witness: Did the Deceas'd, when he was going out, or towards the Prisoner, come in a Way of fighting, threatning or striking, or did he make any Motion at the Prisoner? You used an Expression just now, I would have you explain it; you said the Prisoner met him, as he rose up he turn'd the Corner of the Table.</p>
               <p>Merrit. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if he turn'd the Corner of the Table that Way, he was in the Way of the Prisoner's coming out. How far might it be that this poor Man, who is dead, fell back, when the other stabb'd him again?</p>
               <p>Merrit. His Body fell back, I believe, near four Feet.</p>
               <p>Court. You said there were two Men that sat at the other End of the Table.</p>
               <p>Merrit. Yes they did, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Merrit. No, my Lord?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you of the Company above Stairs.</p>
               <p>Church. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray give us an Account of this unhappy Affair. Was you by when this Man was wounded ?</p>
               <p>Church. When he Deceas'd came in first he sent for me to drink with him; please you, my Lord, the Prisoner at the Bar came down after I had been there a little while, and said, How do you do, Mr. Girl? The Deceas'd said, let me alone, let me eat my Supper in quiet.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Prisoner came down almost as soon as you.</p>
               <p>Church. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ask'd this Girl how he did, what was the Manner of it?</p>
               <p>Church. I could not know the Heart, but I thought it was in a scornful Sort of a Manner. Please you, my Lord, the second Time he came down he began to asperse him very much; they accused one another, and neither of them made any Defence. The Deceas'd desir'd me to go up Stairs and enquire whether any of the Gentlemen had any thing to say to him, if they had he would answer them; with that the Prisoner came down, and another or two with him, when a pretty deal pass'd between both: The third Time when he came down he sat himself upon the Table; after some Words the Deceas'd got up to go out of the Room, whereupon the Prisoner said he would make way for him to go by; but as he was coming out of the Box the Prisoner met him and gave him the Rip: He cry'd out Oh! Oh! Oh! and the Prisoner gave him two or three more Stabs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Deceas'd in a Posture of attacking or striking the Prisoner at that Time, or was he going out in a quiet Manner?</p>
               <p>Church. Please you, my Lord, I saw no Offer of any Blows at all; I did not see him lift his Hand up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Wound?</p>
               <p>Church. I saw it; but it was in such a Condition I could not bear the Sight; I believe the Cut was six Inches long, and the Bowels that came out were as many as I could put into my Hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live?</p>
               <p>Church. I believe my Lord he liv'd about five or six and twenty Hours. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Person that took the Knife away?</p>

Afterwards the Deceas'd sent up to know if any Body had any Thing to say to him, if they had they might come down; then the Prisoner went down and two or three more with him; with that they were sending and proving for some Time: When we had paid our Reckoning, I saw the Prisoner at the Bar come and sit down at the End of the Table, and they brought a Stool for him; and the Deceas'd said, Gentlemen, I should be glad of all your Companies, except that Man. With that he was a coming out, the Prisoner met him and ripp'd up his Belley, and he fell backward a little, and cry'd Oh! Oh! Oh!

               <p>Duncan. I was in Company, my Lord, at the same Time when Mr. Shaw and Mr. Prigg came. The Deceas'd had accus'd the Prisoner at the Bar: Mr. Shaw said that Girl did not dare to face them. Girl came afterwards into the House, and sat down in a back Room below Stairs. When we heard that Girl was come, some of the Company said to Prigg, that he had as good go down and clear himself; so he went down and several others; so Prigg said to Girl, your humble Servant Mr. Girl, and he look'd at the Prisoner at the Bar, and said, who does he speak to. The Deceased farther said, mind, Gentlemen, what he says of me; with that we all went up Stairs again, and when the Deceased had supp'd, he sent up one Church to tell us, that if any of the Company had any Thing to say to him he would answer them; Prigg immediately said, he should be glad if some of us would go down with him, to hear what he had to say; accordingly we did so, and many Words passed between them; then we went up again to pay our Reckoning; and coming down Stairs Mr. Shaw and the Prisoner went into the other Room to the Deceased; I went in also, and lean'd over the Box to hear their Discourse; The Prisoner at the Bar sat on the End of the Table, and one of the Company said, get Mr. Prigg off the Table, for it will affront the Gentlemen to sit before them; whereupon a Stool was brought him, and he leaned with his Right Hand on the Table, and they talk'd pretty deal. The Deceased said, Gentlemen, bear Witness, I have nothing to do with this Man; and desir'd he would get out of his Company: The Prisoner said, he would sit there, as it was a publick House. The Deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150029"/> said he was glad to see his Friends about him, but he did not like that Man. The Prisoner said, if you do not like my Company make a chalk, or lay your Cane across the Table; but that did not satisfy the Deceased, he got up and would go into another Room to see if the Prisoner would follow him.

He gave him a Wound six Inches. I went to him, he pull'd up his Shirt, and my Hat would not hold the Quantity of Bowels that came out of the Wound; with that some went for the Watch, and others for the Surgeon.</p>

               <p>Coates. In Little-Kirby-Street, by Hatton-Garden. My Lord the Prisoner serv'd his Time with me, and work'd with me afterwards for a Twelve-month; but the. Year before he was out of hi Time I was oblig'd to carry him to the Cold-Bath. for an Illness in his Head, and they told me if I did not dip his Head all over he would run mad.</p>

               <p>Coates. I believe he has not been able to work for some Time: I have seen him lately, and sometimes he has talk'd wildly, and I have taken him to Task as he has been rambling backwards and forwards; he always seem'd a good sort of a Man, and a sensible Man before this Illness seized his Head: I saw him about three Weeks ago, he said he believ'd he should drown himself. I gave him some good Advice, and, then indeed, he seem'd to answer me very well in that Respect.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been frequently in his Company within this Half Year?</p>
               <p>Hare. I was with him the last Sabbath-Day at Night before this Affair happen'd, he drank to me, and said your Health; said he I believe I shall never drink with you again as long as you live; I said, Sam, you are beside yourself: And he talk'd very out of the Way Things of making away with himself, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean that he did not keep the Business of a Pawnbroker as he should have done?</p>
               <p>Hare. Sometimes he would take it in his Head to lie in Bed for half a Day together, then he would come down and go up again.</p>

               <p>Ray. Sir, at some Times I have observ'd him to be very melancholy; and one Time he drew a Knife out of his Pocket to stab himself while he was at Dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the knife at his Breast?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes. His Wife said, what are you mad? with that she took the Knife from him. When he took the Penknife out of his Pocket he said he would run it through him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you apprehend to be the Matter?</p>
               <p>Ray. I look'd upon him to be in a melancholy Way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to be at that Time in his Senses, to understand what he was about, or this to be owing to a sudden Start of Passion?</p>

               <p>Ray. I took him to be in a melancholy Way; but no body said any thing to him then; there was only my Mistress and I and my Master at Dinner; at the same Time no body had said any thing to him, for he had not been out of the House all Day.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, young Woman, what Trade or Business your Master carry'd on?</p>
               <p>Ray. My Master is a Plaisterer and Pawnbroker; but my Mistress and I carry on the Business.</p>

               <p>Ray. I sometimes paid them and sometimes my Mistress; What my Master might pay out of Doors I can't say, but he seldom paid within.</p>
               <p>Q. But I ask you, whether you ever took him, at ordinary Times, to be one that did not understand what he was doing?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes, when he has come down Stairs and wanted to go out in the Night time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Ray. About three Months ago; and I have very often seen him sit and cry to himself.</p>

               <p>Have you since discover'd any Thing?</p>
               <p>Shaw. About three or four Months ago he came to my House, between Seven and Eight o'Clock; he came up very quick: I ask'd him why he came so very soon? he did not speak. I said there is something the matter that you get up so very soon; with that he look'd at the Glass, and fell a crying. He ran down, and I follow'd as far as Hackney; when I overtook him he fell a crying sadly. I insisted to know what was the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Shaw. He lives in Spittalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, whether, when you call'd him, you did not see him dress'd.</p>
               <p>Shaw. When I spoke to him, he said he was going to that House, and I told him I was going there too.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he knew that very well.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the House, did you go into the Company.</p>
               <p>Shaw. Yes, my Lord, we supp'd there, and there was a Noise; they said there was a Man come into the House that had something to say to the Prisoner at the Bar; when he came he spoke something to him. As to Particulars, there was such a Noise, that I cannot relate.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me ask you whether the Prisoner did not maintain his Dispute with as much Understanding as any of the Company?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I can't give any Particulars of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear him and the young Man that is dead reproach one another? Now the other Witnesses, several of them, have said that the rest of the Company were listening, and attentive to hear what they charg'd one another with. Can the Prisoner write?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I believe he can.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he write any Letters?</p>
               <p>Shaw. Yes; I know he has wrote one Letter, the Letter he sent to the deceas'd Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read that Letter?</p>
               <p>Shaw. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried that Letter?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I carried it to a Tavern.</p>

               <p>Good. I look'd upon him to be very wild with his Eyes, and very melancholy, and like a Person out of his Senses. About half a Year ago he came to me in a very melancholy Way: I endeavouring to know what was the Matter; at last he turn'd himself about, Good by, you will never see me any more alive; I'll drown myself.

               <p>Charles. I have shav'd him for this two or three Years; he always behav'd very well, and paid me for what I had done for him.</p>
               <p>We think it may be acceptable to give some Hints of his Lordship's Charge to the Jury, upon this melancholly Cafe.</p>
               <p>- What Condition of Mind, or Understanding the Prisoner appear'd to be at the Time this Fact was done; they all of them say that his whole Behaviour was sensible in what he went to do; that he reproach'd the Deceased the same, as the Deceased did him; and all his Actions appear'd to them as cool and as sensible, as any other Person in the Company. The Witnesses were call'd out, and all gave the same Account; they always look'd upon him to be a Man of Understanding. Gentlemen, this is the Evidence to maintain the Indictment. The whole Defence made against it is, that he is a Man that has lately lost his Understanding, has been beside himself, and 'tis open'd by him, or his Council, that this is to be look'd upon as an Act of an Irational Man, who did not know what he said, or did, and is not to be answerable for any Consequences. I must tell you, that in Point of Law, a Man void of all Sense and Understanding, so degraded to the Condition of a Brute, is no more answerable for such a Fact, than the Instrument by which he does it; but then it must be one void of Reason and Understanding, and one known to be so. But if a mad Man happens to be so at particular Times, and has lucid Intervals, as we know such Persons have, if at that Time they commit any of these Facts, they are as much answerable for it, as Persons that were never in that unhappy Condition: Whether that is the Condition of the Prisoner at the Bar, you must determine upon Evidence on both Sides, in order to prove that he is not to answer for any Thing he does.

These are Circumstances his Master mention'd; he seems to give a candid and sure Account. - Now, Gentlemen, in all Accusations of Murder, 'tis necessary there must be not only unlawful killing, but by Malice; that Malice may be implied and collected from Circumstances. 'Tis not enough for a Man to say, that he did not intend it, because that would be in the Mouth of the Guilty, as well as the Innocent. In the present Case, the Manner of doing of it, if nothing more, implies Malice. It was secretly cover'd, and most effectually done in the Manner that all the Witnesses have describ'd: Done in a Manner, that no Man could possibly make a Defence against; that is all the Evidence of the deepest Malice. - If on the other Hand there is an Evidence given to you, which induces you to think he was a Man depriv'd of Reason and Understanding, that is an Excuse allow'd by the Law; because unless a Man has Understanding, he cannot be guilty of any Crime; for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150033"/> Crimes are Acts of the Mind.

               <p>Q. What were his Words, as near as you can remember ?</p>
               <p>Spear. He said, Sir, your Watch, or I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his Hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Who demanded her Watch and Rings?</p>
               <p>Spear. It was one Keys. Master said, I have never a Watch, nor ever had one. Then they stood still; and he on the Left-hand Side of the Coach bid me, I think, look another Way. I did not say any thing to him, but thought of my Watch; and looking down to see if I could see the Seals out, he perceiv'd me, and came up and took my Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Spear. He said, if your Master has got never a Watch, I see you have, and I will have it. I said, I hope you will not take mine. Yes, said he, I will, or else I will shoot you.</p>

             of Frith-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of that Watch?</p>
               <p>Brown. Please you, my Lord, the Prisoner at the Bar brought that Watch the 15th of March at Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know him.</p>
               <p>Brown. He brought me a Gold Watch about six Weeks before this?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where he liv'd?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Keys with him?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, my Lord; but he made his Escape?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he brought the Watch to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. He ask'd two Guineas and a half for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he brought you this, what did you do?</p>
               <p>Brown. I stopt him; for the next Day after he brought the Gold Watch it was advertis'd, I look'd at it that he might have no Suspicion that I would stop him. I bid him a Guinea and a half for it; there was nobody at home, my Master was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150035"/> within. I told him my Master was just by, and may be he would let him have more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went out what then?</p>
               <p>Brown. I went to one Mr. Pardy just by, and I told him the Case; he came along with me, and went for some Assistance; when I came back again, they had some Suspicion, and I met Keys at the Door; he asked me whether I had found my Master; I said, no, I had been at one Place, and I would go to another; and he said, D - n your B - d, give me the Watch: (I had it in my Pocket to shew it to my Master) I said, I had not got it, I had left it. He said again, D - n you, give me the Watch: With that he put his Hand in his Pocket, and turned himself on one Side; I saw him turn himself, and I whipt across the Way: Upon that the Person I went for, came up. Keys call'd after me, and he went in and call'd the Prisoner at the Ear, and when he came out, the Person caught him in his Arms, and the other made his Escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the Man?</p>
               <p>Brown. I have seen him two or three Times; he brought me a Gold Watch; and I know that is the Watch, I have had it in my Custody for six Weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the Watch?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, my Lord, by the particular Marks.</p>

            (to the Prisoner) Now is your Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In regard to the Watch the young Man that I was in Company with, desir'd me to go with him to pledge it, he not being used to the Town?</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was a Vintner, but not in Town.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I liv'd with one Mr. Miller, Attorney, in Hare Street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose your Master is here, or some of your Friends?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He (the young Man I mention'd before) desir'd I would pledge this Watch; he went off as the young Man had said before. I can't say but I had heard something of his Character before; I doubted he came by it in a clandestine Manner. I went to make my Escape, but I was taken into Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no further Witness than the young Man that brought the Watch.</p>

               <p>Macdore. I believe this is the Man that robb'd my cousin of his Watch at Mims, four Miles beyond Barnet, a Quarter before Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, at Mims Wosh; there were two Men upon two brown Horses came past us in the Wash.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, when they came past you, what then ?</p>
               <p>Macdore. They came up to us, one took hold of my Cousin's Bridle, and the other came up to me, so they robb'd my cousin of a Silver Watch and Three Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lost any Thing?</p>
               <p>Macdore. I was in Company with him, and saw it. I believe the Prisoner was the Man, but I can't swear it.</p>

               <p>Macdore. Yes, the other Man that attacked me I refused; the Man that robbed my Cousin he said, D - n the Dog, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the Watch again when it was taken in December ? how came you to see it?</p>
               <p>Macdore. It was advertis'd; it was at Col: De Veil's; he had also the Key of my Cousin's Bags. The Watch I know, I have had it in my Hand many Times</p>

               <p>White. My Lord, she was in Custody at that Time for another Thing; for other People's Affairs, not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. The Prisoner herself was in Custody, and what then?</p>
               <p>White. We found all thes e Goods in her House.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you know how the Prisoner came by them? Had you ever, at any Time, any Conversation with her? When you found the Goods in her House, what did you do then?</p>

               <p>Davis. No, my Lord. No further than shewing her: He untied them and went up one Pair of Stairs, and shew'd them to her one by one, and she ask'd us what we would have for them; and we told her two Guineas.</p>

I went out to the Door; there is a Door backward, which I found wide open; I said to my Wife, we are robb'd. I discover'd that a large Basket of Linnen, which had been look'd up for washing, was gone, and I thought it might have been done by some of our own Lodgers.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she say to that?</p>
               <p>Price. She said she would go with all her Heart, and told us that the other Things were at one Merrit's; but that if we did not make haste they would be gone. We left this Woman and Boy before the Colonel and went to Merrit's.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he went into the Wash-House? What then?</p>
               <p>Davis. We took an Apron and put them all in; we went into the Parlour, there we found a Coat, a Hat, and a white Apron, and we brought them out into the Wash-House and put them into the Apron.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got these Things what did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Davis. We carry'd them to Katherine Lowry's House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time in the Morning was that?</p>
               <p>Davis. Between Four and Five in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with Katherine Lowry?</p>
               <p>Davis. About a Week; and when we carry'd the Things to Lowry's, he and his Wife, and another Woman that was to have been Burn's Wife, all got up together, and they carry'd the Things to Merrit's House, all of them, except one Coat and Waistcoat, a Couple of Aprons, a Shift that she put on her Back, and a Shirt.</p>
               <p>Court. As you all lay together I suppose she made no Difficulty of shifting herself before you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150039"/>Davis. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Merrit's House who did you find there?</p>
               <p>Davis. We found Mrs. Merrit and her Husband; Mrs. Merrit would not buy any of them but the Horse-Cloth, and that she gave 7 s. for.</p>
               <p>Q. If she did not buy them, to what Purpose was it for you to carry them there?</p>
               <p>Davis. We expected she would have bought them ?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Person at home that was call'd the Husband, Merrit ? Who gave you the Money?</p>
               <p>Davis. Mrs. Merrit herself.</p>
               <p>Q. What Did you do with the rest of the Things?</p>
               <p>Davis. She lent Burn a Crown to give to me for my Share of the Things, and made me spend 2 s. of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to Lowry or Merrit how you came by these Things?</p>
               <p>Davis. Lowry ask'd me where we took them from, and I said Drury-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you gave an Account of this?</p>
               <p>Davis. When I was taken, last Monday se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you was taken the very Day?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, my Lord, there was a Gentleman in a red Cap, a Carpenter, saw us go by and go into
