I said, 'Well, I think I can take it to the man it belongs to;' and he said, 'If you do, you will get your head punched.

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Upper Cottenham-road, Hornsey-road, and am a bricklayer—I was taken into custody on 21st October, for stealing a shovel—I heard the prisoner examined against me—I did not take this shovel—I was never there—I did not have the conversation alleged to have taken place between me and the prisoner, nor any portion of it—I was not at that place at a quarter to 7—I was not in the area at all that day—the first time I saw the prisoner on that day was about half-past 9, or a quarter to 10, when I was taken into custody—he knew me perfectly well.</p>

               <p>job was not near the building which the defendant alluded to on the 21st; my job laid something like 400 or 500 yards off where I live, on my own ground—that was not a job under the same contractor, or the same superin<lb/>tendent—they were Mr. Hammond's buildings—I was engaged to do the brickwork—Mr. Davis is the confidential man—Mr. Hammond is a watch-maker—I was not near this area on this morning—I was never away from my own ground till after 8 o'clock, when I went with my landlord to order some lime—at a quarter to 7 that morning, I was talking to my landlord on the ground at the back of his own house—I remained there talking to him until about a quarter or twenty minutes pas 7, when I went in-doors, and there I remained till my landlord called me to go after the lime, about a quarter or twenty minutes after 8—I then went out with my landlord in his horse and cart—he lives two doors from me—he stood at the front-door with it, and I got in, and rode away with him to order the lime—I was out of employment on 21st October—I was doing nothing—I had left Mr. Hammond's job on the Tuesday before—I had not been engaged on any work since, only at my own house, where I had the building for my landlord, Mr. Skrines, that morning—I was not doing any work, my men were getting the ground out—I have a horse and cart; I had two—I have a bill of sale on one, and have had for eighteen months—that was executed to a gentleman in Dorset-square, not Mr. Skrines—Mr. Skrines's name is on the cart—I don't know whether it has been on the cart since the last Session—he bought the cart last summer—I don't know that I am very intimate with my landlord—I have what I work for, that is all—I never was off the ground at all till I went with my landlord.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman in the service of Mr. Charles Hibberd, of Ludgate-hill—Latham was a printer in his service, and had permission to occupy a room at the top of the house—Neville was an errand boy in the same service—two or three months ago a patent-lock was put on the shop door—it was my duty to lock up the premises, and take the key—on 22d November, just previous to closing, about five or ten minutes to 8, I noticed Neville take a box up stairs—there seemed to be something in it and that made me suspicious—I believe Latham followed the boy up—the shop was closed about twenty minutes after 8—I left the pre<lb/>mises in company with Neville, and parted with him at Farringdon-street—he had nothing with him then—from seven to ten minutes afterwards, I re<lb/>turned to Ludgate-hill, and saw Neville come out of the premises with a</p>

               <p>parcel on his shoulder—Latham came out directly afterwards—the boy Neville crossed over to the right-hand side, and Latham walked on the same side as the shop—I followed Neville about 150 yards, and then asked him what he had in the parcel—he said it belonged to the printer—I asked him what it contained—he said he did not know; he was going to meet the printer with it—I asked him where he was going to take it to—he said he did not know, but I could call the printer across, and speak to him, as he was on the opposite of the road—I said I bad no wish to do that; if it was the printer's property, I had no wish to interfere with it—after that I saw Latham cross the road, and touch Neville on the shoulder—they spoke to each other—Neville went down Creed-lane with the parcel—Latham stood at the corner of Creed-lane with his hands in his pockets—I said to him as I passed, "Good night, printer," and he said, "Oh, good night!"—he then crossed over, and went down Ave Maria-lane—I went down Creed-lane after the boy, and asked him again what he had got in the parcel—he said he did not know; it belonged to the printer, and the printer had promised to meet him—I said, "That will not do for me; I must see what is in it"—I tore the side of the parcel, and saw it was paper—I told him to bring it back again to the shop; not being able to get into the shop, on account of the printer having the key of the outside door, I left the paper opposite—I communicated with Mr. Hibberd that night—I let the boy go then.</p>

I am employed by the Mint, to look after persons en<lb/>gaged in coining—on 2d December, about half-past 4 in the afternoon I was in the Strand, opposite Somerset House, with Sergeant Ackrill, Inspector Brannan, and several other officers—I saw the prisoner pass by and called attention to him—we followed him about 40 paces, and I then instructed Ackrill to stop him—he did so, and I said, "Well, Mr. Davis," calling him by the name I knew him by, "you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession, what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing, sir,"—at that time he attempted to put his left hand in his left-hand coat pocket—Ackrill seized the hand—I put my band in the pocket, and found these two packets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped up in one—one contained 9 counter<lb/>feit half-crowns, and the other 3 counterfeit florins—I opened them in the prisoner's presence and said, "They are bad,"—he said, "Oh"—when at the station I asked him his name—he said "Humphery," and refused his address—I knew his name was not Humphery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barman, at 29, Cambridge-street, Euston-road—on 27th November, about 9 o'clock, I was at the Crown and Hand, at the corner of Arthur-street, New Oxford-street, with my brother-in-law and his wife and my wife—we took some refreshment, and remained seven or eight minutes—the prisoners came into another compartment, and they both asked me to treat them three or four times, but I refused—when we left they came out by the other door which we had to pass to go home, and Sullivan struck me on the side of the head, and knocked my hat off—he did not speak—he struck my brother, and then Donovan struck my brother, and Sullivan struck my wife twice on the breast, and knocked her down—nothing was said—my wife and another witness went for a constable—we were knocked down, and picked up again near Bloomsbury-street—Donovan afterwards caught hold of me, and I caught hold of his neck-handkerchief, and gave him in charge for an assault, as I did not know that he had taken my watch—the policeman said, "Loose him"—I did so, and saw a piece of my gold chain hanging from my waistcoat—I took hold of Donovan again, and saw a piece of my watch in his left hand—I got my fingers between his, and took the watch from him—I cannot tell where Sullivan was then—I did not see him again till I went to the station, half an hour afterwards, to look for my wife, and saw both prisoners there in custody—I have no doubt that Sullivan is the man who I saw with my watch in his hand—Sullivan is the man who struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, carrying on business at 104, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—on Thursday, 17th November, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner called at my shop, and showed me a sample of lace, of which lie said he had 2,000 pieces—he asked me to buy it—he then said he had a large lot of silks, and asked me if I would purchase—I pressed him as to where he got them from, and after some hesitation, lie said they were not right—I pressed him again, and he said they were from a warehouse in Wood-street—he said it was stolen from Wood-street, and that he and another man had got the lot—he then left, saying be would bring me a sample the next day—communicated with the police the same evening, and Inspector Potter called the next morning—I knew the prisoner's address—I had known him as a trimming and fringe maker for some time—I knew that he lived at 13, Slater-street, Bethnul green—I went there about half-past 6 the next evening, and asked him to show me the silk—he said it was too hot, he could not show it to me then—I did not see the silk then—I next saw the prisoner at his house on Wednesday, 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, about 12 o'clock—he then gave me a sample of silk—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the piece—I gave it to Mr. Potter within an hour after—I went again to the prisoner's house the same evening about 6 o'clock—he then said he would take me over the water to see the silk, he did not keep it in his own house, because it was dangerous—Mr. Potter and two other officers were then outside—I accompanied the prisoner the same evening to the County Terrace public-house, New Kent-road—I rode there in the prisoner's cart with him—he left me there, and was away for about half an hour—he then returned, and said the man where the silk was was out—he then drove me to Sutton-street on the road home—I left him that evening under the arrangement that he was to come to me the next day—I was to purchase 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silk of him—I told him on the Wednesday morning that I could not purchase that amount, as I had not the money, but he was to call on me the next day—he came about 12 at noon—he wanted me to leave with him immediately—I told him I could not leave for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—during that time I communicated with Inspector Potter—I then went with the prisoner and another man to Horsemonger-lane, where I and the prisoner got out—the man drove the horse and cart away—I and the prisoner went to the County Terrace public-house, where we were joined by the man who accompanied us in the cart—we all three then walked as far as the Elephant and Castle, when the prisoner said, "We had better have our boots cleaned; that will throw the police off all scent"—he said it would throw the police off their guard, or scent—another man then joined us, and we went to a public-house at the corner of West-square, a very quiet house—we stayed thereabout half an hour, when a man came and said he had seen some one watching, and that the silk had been sent over the water, opposite to Rotherham and Co. 's, the large drapers in Shoreditch—I and the man who first accompanied us then got into a Hansom cab and drove to the place named, in Shoreditch—I there saw the same horse and cart I had seen before, with a strange man in charge of it—either the prisoner or the other man said to him, "Have you got the silk?"—he said, "No"—the prisoner then got into the cart with the strange man and drove away, leaving me with the other man—this was about half-past 2—it would take two or three minutes to drive to the prisoner's shop from where we were at that time—in about eight or ten minutes he came back, and said he had got the silk in the cart—he was sitting on the right-hand side of the cart, near the kerb, and he asked me to pass him the money, which I did—I gave him 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and gold, in two separate bags—I</p>

               <p>had counted the money before, in his presence, in a public-house where we stopped—after I paid the prisoner the money, he spoke to the man who had first accompanied us—I was then going round at the back of the cart to get up the other side—immediately I got into the cart, I saw the officer in attendance, and gave him a sign that the silk was in the cart—the prisoner bad not driven more than ten or twelve yards when police-constable Fawell seized hold of the horse's head—the prisoner jumped out of the cart—I tried to apprehend the man we bad just left—there were two or three sacks in the cart; I cannot say exactly—when the prisoner first came to me, he said, him and another man had got the lot, and said, I should have the lot when I got the required money—I saw the silk in the cart when I paid the money—I can't say how many pieces there were—they were in brown-paper parcels.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had known the prisoner some time, had you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the first time I saw him was probably seven or eight years ago—when I knew him first, I bought trimming of him, at Cater and Co's, of Finsbury, for the firm where I lived—I left there about six years ago—I saw nothing of him after that till eighteen months ago—he then brought me some chenille nets, which I bought, and bought them very dear—I lost money by them—those are the only two transactions I had with him—he has a shop—I believe he. sells silk at that shop—the first policeman I told was Knowles—I went to his house—I went to the station as well—I saw two or three men on reserve there—Potter came the next morning, the 18th—the prisoner did not tell me that the person to whom he was going was a man named Dixon—he did not tell me the name—this man called himself Jones—I did not hear the prisoner mention the name of Dixon at all—I saw two more men besides the prisoner—I saw two men over the water—the man who drove the horse and cart to Shoreditch was the same man who met us at the Elephant and Castle—the man who drove the cart over to Shoreditch was the same man who drove it to the Elephant and Castle—he was the strange man I alluded to—when we got to West-square, he went away, then came back again, and said the silk had gone over to Shoreditch; and when we got to Shoreditch, that very same man was with the horse and cart—I saw no other man—the money I paid was my own money, some I had taken out of my cash-box at home, and I drew a cheque for 102. at the London and County Bank head office, as I went down on the same day, the 24th—the reason I drew that cheque was to detain the prisoner until the officers overtook us—I cashed it myself—the rest of the money was taken in my shop on the two or three previous days—the money I paid to the prisoner has not been found—I made a note of what I have stated—I have the notes with me—I made them as the matter was going on—I did not make a note of every word the prisoner said—I told Mr. Potter the same morning the conversation that took place—I did not make a note of the words that the prisoner used, that the goods were not quite right; that they were stolen from Wood-street; the prisoner gave me some cigars—I never had any quarrel with him at any time—about six months previous to this, he called, and asked me if I could buy some wide silk—I said No, I could not—I then communicated with Mr. Potter—the prisoner did not tell me that he had a commission to sell this silk—these notes were made at different times—on 17th, when I got home I wrote, and on 18th I wrote again—I am quite sure I did not write them all at the same time—I did not write every item; I thought it was not requisite.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Rice, of 20, Coal-yard, Drury-lane—on the night of 27th November, about 11 or 12 o'clock, I was in bed in my room; we only occupy one room—my husband was asleep on the end of the table—there was a lamp burning in the room—I was awoke out of my sleep and saw a woman leaving the room—I jumped out of bed and stopped her—she was carrying the shawl I have on now, the cloak I have here, and many other articles, in her arms—I caught hold of her; she was just in the act of going out at the door—I took the things from her—she got away, leaving her shawl behind—I did not see her face—the next day I saw the prisoner in the next room to me, in the same house, and showed her the shawl, and I asked her whether it was her shawl—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You are the woman that came into my room last night"—she said, "If I did I was drunk"—the things she was carrying are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I had locked the room that night.</p>

Q.</hi> Did your husband come in after you had locked it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he is not here—he was not in bed that night because he was drunk—I went to bed about ten minutes to 11, and left him sitting up in the room on a chair—I went to sleep immediately—he was fast asleep when I got out of bed—the woman had a lot of things in her arms, not tied in a bundle, but altogether—I know this is the woman by her owning the shawl—she does not live in the house, only a friend of hers, where she is in the habit of visiting—the friend is a married woman; she has lodged in that house for some length of time; I believe on the same floor—I roused my husband up—I had not seen the prisoner before, that I know of—I don't know whether she was in the habit of visiting the house or not—I went to bed about ten minutes to 11, and fastened the door, and I suppose I awoke about 12, or a few minutes after, from 12 to 1; I could not tell exactly.</p>

               <p>was near Angel-court a man came up to me, as I thought wishful to ask a question—he put his face close to my ear, and being a little shorter than myself, I held my head down, in order to hear what he had to say, as there were a great number of people about—at the same moment he snatched at my chain—I had no overcoat on then, and my chain was hanging down—he broke the chain in two and ran away, leaving a small piece—I imme<lb/>diately supposed that he had the watch, and followed him, holloaing out, "Stop thief!"—Angel-court is not more than three yards from the place where the man took my watch—it is not a thoroughfare for horses; it is about four feet wide—I followed him down Angel-court, and just as I got into the court, I saw a man there, who I at once concluded was au accom<lb/>plice—I passed him, and he followed me for about twenty yards, and then I felt a blow at the top of the hat—my hat was knocked to pieces; the blow was very severe, but it did not hurt me—he still kept following me—I then holloaed, "Murder!" and "Police!" as loud as I possibly could, and another blow was struck me by the same man, which knocked a hole in my hat, and had the effect of knocking me down—it did not render me quite insensible, I think—the man who snatched my chain escaped; I did not see his features—the prisoner is exactly the figure and style of man—I picked him out from twelve others afterwards.</p>

I went down Angel-court and saw a man I could not recognise, at the back of him, strike him on the head and run away—there was a light where the prisoner snatched the chain, right underneath, about three yards from the pavement, quite sufficient for me to see his features—there is a lamp projecting from a public-house right over where the prisoner snatched the chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Finch, a coal-porter, of 7, Devonshire-street, St. George's—on 18th November, at not quite 8. 30 in the morning, I saw the prosecutrix and a man with his arm round her waist, and two other men—they were all three very drunk—the prosecutrix did not appear to me to be sober—the prisoner was about twenty yards behind—I saw a short man thrust his hand into the prosecutrix's bosom—she screamed out "Murder!" and "Father!"—the prisoner then went up to her, but the other man was robbing her then—that was at Mr. Atkinson's door—the prisoner went up, and laid hold of her by the shoulders and neck—I cannot say whether he had hold of her when the other man took the money, but I think he was very close to her, as he had his hand on her shoulder—what I said was, that he was twenty yards behind when I first saw them—he held her while she was being robbed.</p>

We had been there ten minutes when this woman came in, and the two shoemakers came out. I know one of them by night, and he handed the pot to me; she called for a pot of beer. One of them said, "Now, mistress, you drink along with us." She did so. She gave me seven chops, and I gave four of them away to the shoemakers. I lighted my pipe, and was about forty yards behind them. One of them had his arms round her shoulders, and they were rolling from one side of the pavement to the other. She holloaed out and I went up, but whether I put my hand on her shoulder or not I cannot say. I did not know she had a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the world. She never appeared against me, and I was remanded twice. Is it likely that in a street where all the people knew me I should attempt to rob a woman?</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 98, St. James's-street, Clerkenwell, and am an attorney's clerk—on the evening of Wednesday, 23d November, about half-past 10, I was undressing to go to bed—I heard a noise, and lifted my window open—the noise was a cry of distress, a groaning, gradually in<lb/>creasing to a greater loudness from the first time I heard the cry; the cry was, "Murder! oh, oh!" increasing as though a person was in great distress</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186412120037"/>
               <p>—when I opened my window I heard a second cry of "Murder!" proceeding from Messrs. French's workshop—my house is parallel with the workshop (<hi rend="italic">A plan was produced</hi>)—this is my room-window, and this is an alley called Newcastle-alley—any person being there could get into the public way—this is the door of the workshop—I could not see the door of the workshop from my window, but I could see any person coming out at it—I could see the wall; I could even see any person coming to shut the door—the wall is in a straight line with my window, so that anything, even an inch beyond that straight line I could see—when I looked out of my window I saw a man running out of Mr. French's workshop, out at the door which I have described on the plan—he had something in his hand; I could not swear what it was, but it was something like a thick, long stick; it was something bug—he came towards me in the yard, running from the window towards my house—he then got on the wall—I could not see exactly what he put his foot on, but he was not out of my sight—I only saw about half of his body at the time be sprang to get on the wall—I then saw him turn the angle and on to the wall, and go down from the wall—there is an iron rod on the wall—the wall is in Messrs. French's yard, and divides their place from mine, and from the public lane—that lane terminates at the yard—when this man I saw was on the wall, there was nothing between him and me but the lane, and a foot or two of the wall of the house—when he was on the wall I called out to him to stop—I think he was about twelve feet from me at that time—I have not measured it—there was a light in Messrs. French's workshop—the light appeared to me to be almost the whole length of the shop—the front of it is all glass; the light shone on the man's face as soon as he came out of the workshop-door—I recognised him when he was on the wall—I had known him by sight before; the prisoner is the man—he jumped, and dropped down from the wall, and ran away—the wall is about ten feet high—as he was getting on to the wall I heard something resembling the sound of a stick falling—I called out—I saw some one come from Mr. French's house—I dressed as quickly as I could, calling out to the parties in the yard that I should be there—as soon as I went out of my front-door I went round to see whether the prisoner had fallen or jumped from the wall—I examined the back-door of the yard which leads from Mr. French's workshop to Newcastle-alley—it was closed and fastened with the usual thumb-latch, which a person could push from the outside—it was fastened so that I could not get in—I then went round to the front entry in Clerken<lb/>well-close, and went into the workshop—Mr. French was there when I got, in—after speaking to the deceased I found this broom (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the yard—it very much resembles what the prisoner had in his hand, only the head part being down I could not see what was at the end of the stick, be<lb/>cause the gas-lamp would not enable me to see that—I found it on the yard side of the wall; it Was stained with blood—it was raining very heavily at the time—I took the broom up and carried it in my finger and thumb, so as not to take any of the blood off—I carried it into the workshop, and laid it there to dry—the blood was at this end (<hi rend="italic">The broom part</hi>), and also on the handle—when I first went into the workshop they were washing his wounds—I had seen the deceased before; I did not know him by name—I found him sitting on the stairs—Mr. Joseph Smith, a workman, and Mr. French were standing by his side—while I was there he was removed to the hospi<lb/>tal—next morning I was called to the Clerkenwell Police-court—I was asked to pick out the man I saw get over the wall—there were three persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186412120038"/>

I am a clerk in Mr. French's employ—the deceased, Francis Ploughman Roberts, was in his employment, and also the prisoner—on Wednesday evening, 23d November, about half-past 10, my attention was called to a noise—I was sitting in the back parlour, which adjoins the yard, with Mr. and Miss French—the window of the back parlour looks out into the yard, but the shutters were closed at that time—the noise I heard sounded like a very loud groan, a cry of distress; it proceeded from the workshop—I went into the passage, opened the back door, and went into the yard—to the best of my belief the back door was fastened—Mr. and Miss French followed me—I found the deceased standing up, lean<lb/>ing against the workshop-door; he was inside the workshop—I saw the last witness at his window—Mr. French and I led the deceased on to the stairs—I saw blood flowing from the top of his head; his face was covered with it—after seeing him put there I tried the back door of the yard leading into Newcastle-alley; it was locked—that door is always kept locked after dusk—the men come through that door to their work in the morning, and those who leave before dusk go out that way—those who stay late, working over<lb/>hours, have to come through the house—those who stay late cannot go in and out of the house as they please, not after a certain time—the chain is usually put up about 8—after 8 they leave by the front door—they come in at the back door of the house; it opens with a pull from the outside; if it is locked, of course they cannot open it—it may happen that it is locked or not—if it is not locked they can let themselves through, if it is locked they have to knock—I was sitting in the back parlour that evening—if any one had passed along the passage and out at the front door I should have heard them—I do not know who stayed late that evening—I did not see Smith leave—I went for a doctor—I did not go with the deceased to the hospital—I went with a constable to the residence of the prisoner—I did not go any<lb/>where else first—I found him at No. 2, Arundel-cottages, Kingsland—we got there about 3 o'clock in the morning—when he came down to us he had on his shirt, trousers, and stockings—he said, "What is it, Mr. Brinton?"—I said, "You will hear presently"—the policeman then in my presence charged him with violently assaulting the deceased—he was not then dead—the prisoner said he had not done it; he said he had left that night with Gouget—we then returned with the prisoner to the station—there is no other way of getting</p>

               <p>from Mr. French's workshop except through the house, through the back yard gate, or over the wall—it is the practice in Mr. French's establishment to have a tin can for the men to put the gold in that they are working upon—one of those cans is kept for those men who work late—it is called "the overtime can"—immediately after the deceased was taken to the hospital, I saw the workshop locked up—only two persons went into the upper shop, Smith and the constable—that was while the deceased was there, before it was locked up—I did not see any one else go into the shop—it was possible for a person to go up into the shop without any one seeing them—after the workshop was unlocked, I went into the upper shop and looked into the tin can—this is the overtime can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was kept in the upper shop—when I looked at it it did not contain five unfinished gold rings—I looked at it on going into the shop about five minutes after the deceased went to the hospital—it did not contain any gold wire—it contained two gold rings, but not five unfinished ones—there are two workshops, one above the other—one is on the ground-floor, and the other over it—there is no communication from the upper to the lower, but by the stairs which are in the lower workshop where the furnace is—the men do not work there—all the work is done in the upper shop—when I went in and found the deceased, there was one gas alight at the further end from the house—the end nearest Thomason's house—there was one gas burning in the lower workshop—I saw traces of blood in the lower workshop—they were scattered along the floor, and on the bench, and a considerable quantity in the corner—the further corner from the door—the mortar was also knocked off the wall at the further end in several places—it seemed as though something hard had been against it, and knocked the mortar off—I saw marks of blood on the furnace—the furnace is on the opposite side to the bench I have spoken of, so that there were marks of blood on each side of the workshop, particularly at one end—the marks were like drops of blood as if they had spurted.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on Wednesday evening, 23d November, at a quarter-past 11, Roberts was brought there—his face was besmeared with blood; his lips were very pale, as if from loss of blood—I examined his head; I found seven wounds on his head, and a bruise at the back of his head—there was also a bruise <hi rend="italic">on</hi> his left shoulder—the wounds were on various ¡arts of the head; one over the right eyebrow; two just above the forehead, on the right side; one on the forehead on the left side; one on the top of the head, and two on the left temple—he was sensible when he was brought in—he became insensible about three hours after his admission, and died about a quarter-past three—I don't know that he had any fear of death—I did not anticipate that he was so near death—he was very seriously injured, but I did not anticipate such a speedy termination—I was quite uncertain whether he would get well not; it was difficult to form an opinion at that early period—I did not form an opinion—I have seen the broom produced—the blows were such as might have been caused by that—I made a post mortem examination—I found the scalp extensively bruised, a large fracture of the skull on the left side, which implicated a blood vessel of some size, and from that was effused a large clot of blood—the blood vessel was broken, and the blood flowed on the brain—it must have required great violence to inflict these blows—that would depend on the nature of the instrument used—greater violence would be required with a light instrument—I should not suppose they were such as he could have inflicted on himself—if he had thrown himself from a height, that would have produced those injuries—the death was caused by those injuries.</p>

Dear sir, I have done so wrong to you, that I do not know what to say or do until I send you the money I have sent Mr. Pipe for you.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About the hiring of the pony, I certainly had the prosecutor's sanction to take it I had some drink in the morning, and drank twice with Mr. Pipe, and had some more after I had the pony and cart. I then went to Charrington's Brewery to buy some iron, and found they had sold it I was very wild at losing it, and drank at two or three places. I remember having a man or two in the cart with me and going to Mr. Bambrough; but I never recollect leaving there, or receiving any money. I heard next day that the pony was missing, but could not call to mind where I had left it till I was told. I then wrote that letter, and another to Mr. Pipe, telling him where the pony was. We all live within four hundred yards of each other, and it is not likely, if I done it for felony, that I should take the pony and cart to sell close by; I should have taken it into the country, where it could not be found. I wish to call a witness to show that I was drunk; the remark was made that I should fell out of the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Blanchard, a linen<lb/>draper, of 2, Church-street, Greenwich—about 15th September, the prisoner purchased a silk dress, and, paid for it—she then ordered another dress, and took one with her, and ordered thirty-two yards of silk for Miss Harvey, who she said liked the dress she had purchased for herself, and wished one like it, and she ordered thirty-two yards and a half of black silk for a pupil of Miss Harvey's—that was distinct from the dress—thirty-two yards would be enough for two dresses—I procured that silk from the City, and sent it to Miss Harvey's, Ashburnham House—on Saturday 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, the prisoner came again for silk she had seen on the day she purchased the others—she said that it was for Miss Armstrong, who was leaving town for the vacation, and asked if I would allow her to take it with her, which I did, and it was entered to Miss Harvey—she had an invoice in Miss Harvey's name—the value of it was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have not been paid for either of those articles—I believed what the prisoner told me about Miss Armstrong, or I should not have sent the goods—I believed the silk was for Miss Harvey who we would trust to any amount—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the first dress we sent to Miss Harvey—this is the dress we sent the day after, and this is the one she took with her—we have not been paid for any of them.</p>

               <p>her again when she came the second time—on the first occasion she merely called to have the silk sent up, which she had seen when she had purchased her own—that was for Miss Harvey, not to Miss Harvey—if she had given me the name of Miss Horsfall, I should have entered it to Miss Harvey—I sent the goods home invoiced to Miss Harvey, and addressed with our business label—she came again on the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, and said that she came for a check dress which she had seen for a young lady who was disappointed of her holiday dress, Miss Armstrong, but her mentioning Miss Harvey's name was the reason I let her have it—when pupils of Miss Harvey come and give orders I do not expect to be paid at once—she pays it afterwards—if the prisoner had said, "I want this dress for myself as a pupil," I should have allowed her to take it away, knowing her to be a pupil of Miss Harvey's, if it had been booked to Miss Harvey, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the district of the parish of Lambeth, and live at Moor-place, Kennington-road—on 10th November I saw the body of a male infant at the dead-house; Adamson directed my attention to it—I made a post-mortem examination of it, the navel string was cut close to the abdomen—the child was fully developed—there was a jagged wound in the throat about four inches long, extending from left to right, cutting through all the large vessels of the right side of the neck, together with the trachea—there was an incision between the fourth and fifth cer<lb/>vical vertebra), dividing the spinal marrow—on reflecting the scalp I found a fracture on the right parietal bone, rupturing the longitudinal sinus—there was extravasations of blood round the fracture—in my judgment the wound on the throat was the cause of death; it was not jagged very much, but sufficient to call it a jagged wound—it had been inflicted by a cutting in<lb/>strument, because by the side of the long incision, there were two slight incisions, cutting through the cuticle, making three incisions altogether—the three incisions did not run into one—the two others were merely slight cuts, an eighth of an inch long, through the cuticle—they were independent of the principal cut—they were distinct cuts, not marks only—the large cut had gone half-way, and then gone on again, and so produced a notch in the centre—I should imagine it had been inflicted by a knife, and rather a pointed one, on account of the division of the cervical vertebrae—it would be impossible for the wound to be produced by the child falling from the mother into the fender—the lungs were fully inflated—I placed them in water, and they floated very buoyantly, together with the heart—I</p>

               <p>took the heart away, and put them in water again, and they still floated—I then cut them up in twelve or fourteen pieces, pressing each piece, and each piece floated—my judgment is that the child breathed—it might have done that in the the act of being born—there is nothing to assist my opinion as to whether it breathed in a state of existence separate from the mother—the body was completely drained of blood, every organ.</p>

Q.</hi> Is it a fact that a child may breathe before it has passed into the world? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is a great difference of opinion about whether the hydrostatic test can safely be relied upon—with regard to the fracture of the skull, it has been the case that the cranium has been pressed against the pelvis in the pains of labour, and has been fractured—I knew a case, where the throat was cut when the child was half born, in the endeavour to cut the umbilical cord—it was not a case of mine, but my father's—the woman was alone—I know, as a man of experience, that in the case of a poor wretched woman cutting the navel-string, wounds are frequently inflicted unintentionally on the child itself.</p>
