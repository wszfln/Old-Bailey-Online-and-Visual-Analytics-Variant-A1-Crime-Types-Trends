Harvey are you mad"—the prisoner dashed Mr. Banks away, as if he had been a child—he seemed very much out of breath, and leaned against the front of the counting-house with the whip in his hand—I said, "You will have to account for this"—he said, "Yes, I know I shall have to pay for it, and I am d—d if I do not give it you; you accused me of stealing your pencil-case"—I said, "I never accused you, or thought of such a thing"—I got into my gig, and when I was in, he gave me a tremendous blow on the back—I staggered on, and he kept beating me all the time with the same weapon—I did not see anybody take him away again, he was behind me—I was obliged to stand up, as I am now—I was in great pain in sitting down, and as soon as I had started my horse I felt a blow on my head which stunned me—the stunning was momentary, and 1 felt him beating at my head—the reins got from me, and the horse ran out of the yard—the prisoner pursued me quite into the King's-road—my groom is quite a little boy—I</p>

The prisoner applied for work at my office on 6th Dec.—he worked for me on the 6th, and on the 7th, which was Friday—on that day, as I was going up-stairs to tea, about five o'clock, he met me in the passage, and asked me to let him have some money to get his tea—I told him to remain till I came down, and I would give him some—I was gone about half an hour, and when I came down he had gone out—he returned in about a quarter of an hour—I asked where he had been—he said to get half a pint of beer—I paid him what was due to him, and requested him to come the following day; he did not come—about eight o'clock on the Saturday morning I went into the office, and missed some type—I met the prisoner at five the evening before, without his coat—I have not seen the type since; it has been melted down: it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again, from twelve to one on Saturday night, at his own house—1 had found out his residence, and went there and waited till he came home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Edward Biggs, of Willesden. He had a black gelding with a white mark down his face, which I saw safe in his field on Sunday 16th Dec. at four o'clock in the afternoon—there were two gates to the field, one was locked, and the other was fastened by a chain, and a T link and three rings—I went to the field at five, and missed the gelding—the gate had been unfastened—the horse had lost a shoe—I tracked it to Highgate toll-bar, and there found the policeman with the pri<lb/>soner and the horse—the prisoner has worked for Mr. Biggs five years, and had left three weeks before this, through misconduct.</p>

On 16th Dec, between fire and half-past five o'clock, I was passing along Mill-lane, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's field, and saw the prisoner on a horse—I wished him good night, he muttered so that I could not understand him, which gave me suspicion that he had come wrongly by the horse, and I gave information—there was no saddle on the horse, I did not notice whether he had a bridle—it was a black horse with a white graze down the face.</p>

He is one of the Opera Company—we formerly lived in Huntley-street, Bedford-square—while living there I took Mumford into my service as general servant—soon after, I had occasion to leave town—I left her in charge of my apartments—I returned on 9th April, and she had then left the house—she had not given me any notice—I examined the place next morning, and missed dresses, shawls, capes, boots, shoes, and under-clothing of every description—we only occupied the first-floor and kitchen, the owner of the house occupied the rest—Mumford had the keys to our rooms when we went into the country—I have since seen a silk cape, a satin cape, and two merino dresses—they are all my property, and are only a small portion of what I missed—I have lost altogether above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth.</p>

I passed the east end of the "C" warehouse—I saw the prisoner standing against the wall near a box, doing something to the front of his dress—he came past me, and I called after him to stop—he did not, and I stopped him, and said, "What have you got here?" pointing to the front of his dress—he said, "O! Mr. Mumford, I was going to put it down these steps"—I found this lead on him—he said he found it in the privy—it is branded—it was entirely concealed by his coat—the Dock Com<lb/>pany had such lead on the quay in front of the warehouse, and the brand on it was the same as is on this—I took the prisoner to the principal gate—he had not been at work in the Docks that day; he had no business there.</p>

               <p>I found by the side of it a garden rake, a razor-strop, and some prints—I went to Mullaly's house, in Cooper's-court—I asked him if he was in the Docks on 1st Dec.—he said, "Yes, I was there, but was turned out by a police-constable"—I asked him if he knew anything about any fishing-rod—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew Mr. Child, the pawnbroker, in Shadwell High-street—he said, "No"—I took him to the pawnbroker's; he was not identified there, and was discharged—this was on 5th Dec.—on 22nd I took Ballard at the Docks—I asked him if he was at the East quay on 1st Dec.—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew anything about any fishing-rod—he said, "No"—I asked if he knew Mr. Child's, the pawnbroker—he said, "No"—I took him there, and saw the foreman—I said, "Do you know this man"—he said, "Yes, he is the man that pawned the fishing-rod, I have no doubt about it"—he was then taken to Lemon-street station—about two hours afterwards he returned, and said to me, in the presence of Mullaly, whose proper name I believe is Gannon—"I did pawn the rods; I was asked to pawn them by Gannon, who told me, he had taken a case from a shed on the East quay, broke it open, and took out the rod, and he got them out under the brandy quay gate."</p>

IV., which would support the present indictment. It might be contended from the words of the first section, that the repeal of 6 Geo. IV., in the schedule, was not an absolute and total repeal, but one qualified by the provisions contained in the first section; but in the same schedule, where other Acts were enumerated as repealed, (the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, c. 122, for instance,) there were express reservations. The question Would therefore be, whether the words in the first section were sufficiently clear to indicate the intention of the Legislature to except from the repeal, those parts which had the effect of repealing former Acts.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE PATTESON:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">"I do not think you can stand upon this argument at all; because the first section is, in express terms, a repeal, except so far as the said Acts, or parts of Acts, repeal any former Act. Your argument would go to show that the expression in the schedule was in effect to do away with the exceptions expressly enacted in the first section, so far as 6 Geo. IV. is concerned; and that argument you ground, I think, principally upon the circumstance, that where another Act of Parliament is mentioned in the same schedule, the 5 &amp; 6 Vic, c 122, in stating the whole to be repealed, there is an exception; that is to say, the whole is not repealed, only a part of it, and the exception; this very exception which is contained in the first section; therefore you argue that wherever that exception is intended to be applied to the particular Act of Parliament mentioned as repealed in the schedule, it is expressed m the section. But you will find that is really no argument after all, it is but an observation. I can easily account for the expression that is put in with respect to 5 &amp; 6 Vic., c. 122, because, in fact, the 5 &amp; 6 Vic., c. 122, mentioned in this schedule, is not intended to be wholly repealed, but there are parts of it not intended to be repealed, and it was thought necessary to say, by way of exception, 'it repeals the whole except certain parts,' and therefore they put in the exception already contained in the first section. It had better not have been there, because these things lead to discussion and argument; but being there, it really does no harm, and the first section must have its full operation; there<lb/>fore I think it is quite clear that the statute prior to 5 &amp; 6 Geo. IV. is not revived."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Johnson, and live at Shirley-common, near Croydon. In Jan., 1848, I was living at Peckham—the prisoner was introduced to me, and brought me a child to nurse—it was a boy, about three months old—she called it Louis, and in the course of the year I had it baptized by the name of Louis—I was present at his baptism—the prisoner did not tell me her name when she brought the child—she was to pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for bringing it up—she afterwards sent some flannel for it—for the first three months she came to see it four times—at the end of the three months, in April, I received this letter from her—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"My dear Madam, in consequence of a sudden death in my employer's family, I have unexpectedly returned to London for a few days; if the weather will permit me to-morrow, Thursday, I shall probably see you to take out my dearest baby for an hour, if he is well enough. I am afraid his father will be determined of him going to France, to his mother; a proposal I strongly oppose. My hand trembles, I can scarcely write; perhaps you may enter into my feelings. My love and kisses to my dear baby, with kind regards to yourself and Mr. Johnson. Yours very sincerely, S. Tavern. Clarendon, April 26th, 1848.—P.S. While writing, a circumstance has occurred which will probably prevent me from coming to-morrow; I will say Friday; if it will be improper to take out my dear baby, please write to Miss Harrington, and say he is not well; I shall see her to-morrow, but not say I have written to you. Excuse haste and trouble.")—I did not see the prisoner again till February, 1849—no money was paid me in the mean time—I received letters from her—she passed by the name of Drake in Feb.—she came then, and said she could not leave home before, on account of her mother being so ill—she said she would take the child to an institution in Boulogne, that its father had been brought up there—she paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and still owed me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she took the child away, but not the clothes—I went with her to the Dover station—she paid her passage to Dover, and I saw her go off with the child, in the train—next night she came back to my house, at Shirley-common—she said she had been to a doctor, and he had told her the child had got the water on the brain, that it would not live long, and that she had better bring it back to where the child had always been brought up; that she would not take it away any more if I would keep it, for she would go to service, and do the best she could for the child—I agreed for it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the future—it was very ill at that time—I did not see the prisoner again between that month, Feb. and Nov.—I</p>

I received this letter from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"My dear Mrs. Johnson, with a trembling hand, and aching heart, I write you this letter. You will be sorry to hear I have been obliged to sell the greatest and best part of my clothes to pay my expenses. I am better, but I am a poor ceature, scarcely able to go about; when walking in the park on Saturday, for the benefit of the air; I accidentally met with Mrs. Musgrove, a relative to the family I lived with in Manchester; my appearance excited her pity, and she offered to take me with her to Madrid, in Spain, which I have accepted; otherwise I could not have got a place, nor am I able to take one. I hope the sea air may do me good, if I have strength to bear with sea-sickness. I did not write to you before; had I done so, they would have seen my letter; they are all strangers to me, and I do not wish them to know my affairs. You say I am unkind to the child; I hope and trust you will never be called to encounter with the trouble I have; I have suffered great privations on his account to pay you the money I have. I do not wish you to get him more things than I am able to pay for; my heart's desire is to pay you; it will take me some time to earn what I already owe you; my wages are but 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year; had I had my health, and stayed in my place, my wages would have paid you, and brought him up respectably, but I cannot do impossi<lb/>bilities. I have not heard from him since I saw you, nor is it in my power to do anything for him but what I can earn; I wish you would let him go to the parish; if I am spared with life to return to my native land, I will then take him, and do all that lays in my power for him; should I die in going over, I shall request what few things I have left to be sold, and the money sent to you; but you must say it is money I borrowed from you; if it is known, my parents will curse me in my grave. My heart is broken at writing this, but I know not what else to do. If I had not done this, I must have been starved to death. If I am spared with life, you will hear from me in a few months; it may be six months, or it may be twelve, before I return to England; if I live, I leave London at six o'clock this evening. Kiss my dear child for me. I hope you are all well; good night, and God bless you. Yours sincerely, Sarah Drake. Nov. 26th, 1849. 22, Edward-street. I leave here to-night.")—I went the same day to Edward-street, Dorset-square, and got some information, which made me go to Harley-street, but I did not know the number, and did not find her that evening; but on Wednesday morning, the 28th, I went to 33, Harley-street, at a little after ten—I took the child with me—I saw the prisoner, and said, "Good morning"—she said, "Oh, it is Mrs. Johnson; I thought I should see you, by my dream"—I said she was a very cruel woman to cause me so much pain and trouble—she said she could not help it, she could not send me any more money, that she did not know until the night before, that she was not going abroad, that the family had put it off till the spring—I said, "Now, don't say so, Mrs. Drake, for you have no intention of going abroad"—she asked me to walk into the kitchen a few minutes, until she had seen her mistress—I went in, and waited there a few minutes, and then came back to the housekeeper's room, to the prisoner, and told her I must leave the child there, that I was not to take him home any more if I found her—she asked me to take him back for a week—I said, "Mrs. Drake, I must not take him back any more"—she said he was looking a great deal better, and he had got much stouter than when she had seen him last—I told her he had grown a very hearty little fellow, and had got quite well—I said she had better take his pelisse and hat</p>

Providence so provided for me, that I have kept it from any one in the house. I hope and trust you will not expose me. Yours sincerely, Sarah Drake, 33, Upper Harley-street, Cavendish-square. Nov. 29th, 1849")—on Saturday, 8th Dec, I went down to North Leverton, in Nottinghamshire—a coffin was shown me there, with the body of a child in it—it was the child I had had to nurse—there were no clothes in the coffin—Smith showed me a red frock, a black petticoat, and a flannel petticoat, and I recognized them as belonging to the child—I also saw the handkerchief that was round the child's neck when I left it, also a pelisse and a cap—after I discovered that the prisoner's name was Drake I called the child Louis Drake.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>after ten o'clock in the morning—she came into the kitchen with the child for a few minutes—I saw her return into the housekeeper's room, which is down stairs, on the same floor as the kitchen—I had occasion to go into the house<lb/>keeper's room while Mrs. Johnson was there with the child—I noticed her leaving the house by the area steps, and saw the prisoner run and ask her a question—she then went away without the child, and the prisoner returned into the housekeeper's room—I do not know how long she remained there—I never saw the child again—about half-past twelve I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—she said the woman (Mrs. Johnson) had caused her a great deal of trouble, that she (the prisoner) had been responsible for money, and that the woman said her husband would summons her—(I had not heard what Mrs. Johnson had said to her at the area steps—I was so placed that the prisoner could not see me when she went up the steps—I was in the servants' hall, but the door was nearly shut)—about a quarter of an hour afterwards, she asked if I had got a small box which I could let her have—I said I had one, and I would let her have it—she said she would get me another soon, that she had got clothes which were of no use to her, and she wanted to send them to her sister's children—she did not have the box—she did not ask me for it any more—the servant's dine at one, but it was half-past one that day—she asked the housemaid to help at dinner, because she wanted to write a letter—she told me to go in to my dinner, that she had to go up-stairs for her paper and pens to write her letter—I then went in to my dinner, as she desired me, and next saw her at twenty-five minutes to three, after my dinner—she came down stairs into the kitchen, and told me she had packed her box—soon afterwards I went up into the room where she slept, and I saw a box, packed in a wrapper and corded—the wrapper was sewn with white cotton, and was all over the box—it was one of the boxes she had brought with her on Monday—it remained there all night—I brought it down stairs the following morning, at seven, by her desire, and carried it into the butler's pantry, on the lower floor—it was heavy, I could scarcely carry it down—there was no direction on it—she told me to take it down, and give it to Mr. Glass, the butler, she would send a boy with it to the station, that she did not wish the other servants to see it, because they might think she was send<lb/>ing things out of the house—I put it on the floor in the butler's room, and told him what the prisoner desired me to say—I saw it again about an hour and a half afterwards, still in the pantry, and then lost sight of it—this is the cover of a letter the prisoner gave me to post that day (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I do not recollect whether I posted it at Devonshire-street or Great Marylebone-street—it was one of the post-offices in the neighbourhood—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the wrapper, I know it by the sewing.</p>

Drake, 18," on it—it has a little blood and other matter upon it—I produce the clothes that were in the box, and the handkerchief that was round the neck—I afterwards showed those clothes and the handkerchief to Mrs. Johnson, and also the body of the child—I was present when Mr. Blagg examined the body.</p>

On 3rd Dec. last I was called to examine the dead body of a male child, shown to me by Smith—from its appearance, I should judge it to have been from eighteen months to two years old—it appeared to have died recently, not longer than a week at any rate, and I think not so long—I observed a contusion on the</p>

               <p>left side of the forehead, and also on the left ear—the face was swollen and livid, and the tongue was compressed between the teeth—I made an internal examination of the head—upon removing the scalp, I found extravasated blood on the brain, and marks corresponding with the bruise on the left side of the head—there was a contusion visible on the left parietal bone, and there was a corresponding mark under the skin on the pericranium—there was also a bruise on the left ear—in my opinion, the blows I observed on the head were sufficient to have caused death—they were caused by some blunt instru<lb/>ment, or by the child's head being beaten against something, I cannot say which—a blunt instrument would have caused those appearances—a handker<lb/>chief was fastened round the neck; it was passed twice round the neck—the inner fold was tight, the outer loose—there was a mark round the neck, but I did not notice before I took the handkerchief off whether that mark was produced by the handkerchief as it was then tied, or whether it was produced before—I untied the knot of the handkerchief, and took it off—I then found a mark round the neck, caused by a ligature—there were decided appear<lb/>ances of strangulation about the child—the eyelids were swollen, the tongue compressed between the teeth, the nails blue, and the fingers contracted—those were the external marks—I think the handkerchief as I found it was not sufficiently tight to prevent respiration, unless it had been held or hung on some substance, decidedly not—the mark of the ligature round the neck indicated a sufficient compression of the throat to cause strangulation—the appearances of strangulation which I saw were sufficient, in my opinion, to have caused death—in my opinion, death was caused by strangulation and the blows combined—either would have produced death, but, finding the two, I am led to the opinion that both combined to produce death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver, of Fleet-street, Bethnal-green. I sleep in the workshop—on 19th Nov. the prisoner came there a little before five o'clock—he asked for a job (he had before worked for Mr. Wingate, my master)—he had no work for him, and I gave him some work of mine—I had a silver watch in the room, which I placed between the bedclothes—the prisoner saw me do it—I followed Mr. Wingate down stairs to get my tea, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I heard him come down, and I said to him,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of James Mettam, of the China Ship, Hermitage-street, in the parish of St. George-in-the-East. The prisoners had been several times to my father's house prior to 12th Dec.—On 12th Dec. they came accompanied by another person—Budd, and the other person who has escaped, came in first—it was about twelve o'clock in the day—I was in the bar—they said, "Good morning, Miss; how is your father?"—I said, "Not very well, he is not about"—they said it was very cold, and walked in, and stood at the entrance of the bar-parlour, which turns round to go up to the club-room, on the first floor—they went up, and I asked if they would like a fire—they said no, they were not going to stop; but they stopped, and I ordered the servant to light a fire—the bedroom is on the same floor, facing the club-room—the prisoners and the other man were all together when the conversation took place about lighting the fire—they went up-stairs together—my father was not about, he was in the bedroom—they came down about a quarter before three—my father was still up-stairs—they had several pints of ale, which I took up, as the servant was engaged—when they came down, they called for another pint of ale, and while they were standing at the bar it was proposed to meet there that day week—they left about three o'clock—after that, having answered the parlour-bell, I went in there, and saw Hughes sitting there, whom I had not seen come in; but there is a back-way to our house; the front-way is in one street, and the back-way in another, and going</p>

               <p>in once or twice, I also saw the man who has escaped, sitting opposite Hughes—Budd came in in about half an hour, the front-way—he walked quickly by the bar, and said, "Good afternoon, Miss"—he went into the parlour, and called for a pint of porter, which I supplied—as I had taken in the porter, and got the money, my father was coming down-stairs—the parlour-door was open—the persons in the parlour could see him come down—the parlour-door opens in the passage, opposite the bar—some time after, I went up-stairs to see whether the club-room fire was alight, and as I came down I saw Budd and the one who has escaped, walk up the passage as if they had come from the parlour-door—Hughes came out of the parlour, and they all three went up-stairs, saying, "We may as well go up, and have another game"—(they had been playing from twelve till three at the bagatelle-board)—immediately after they had gone up, Hughes came down, and asked for a glass of brandy-and-water—I said I would bring it up—he said, "Oh no, I will take it up"—I let him take it up—that was just before five o'clock—my father keeps a desk in his bedroom—I had been there that morning, about half-past eleven, for a check—the desk was locked; my father gave me the key to open it—I opened it, locked it again, and gave the key to my father—I did not take out any sovereigns—my attention was not called to the cash.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser of 16, Sussex-place, Old Kent-road. I produce a distress warrant for rent from Mr. Roberts, which authorized me to enter the house 22, Thanet-street—I went in the middle of the day, when the prisoner was not at home—he was a lodger there—I told all the lodgers they must take their goods away—I first saw the prisoner between four and five o'clock, when I was in the kitchen seeing the lodgers clear out their things—he came down to me and said, "Are you the broker?"—I said, "I am"—he said that was a d—d lie—he said, "Have you got a certificate?"—I said I had got a warrant, and it was in my man's possession up-stairs—he said he was a lodger—I told him he might take his goods away if he liked, the greater portion was gone, and he might take the rest away—his wife was engaged in removing them—he rushed up-stairs for a pair of pistols, saying he would clear the house—he tore up-stairs—I heard the cries of children, and a piece of timber came over the top of the stairs—he then came down-stairs with this piece of a bedstead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and struck me on the lip and nose with the end of it—here is blood on the end of it—I fell down, and laid stunned for two or three seconds—I then got up and inquired for him—one of the men said he had gone down the street, and I followed him—he tried to get away, and I said he must go to the station—he said he should give me in custody—I told him he could if he liked—we went to the station—I became faint from the loss of blood, and the officer can tell the rest—I lost a great deal of blood—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith, and lodge at the prisoner's father and mother's house. When I heard the prisoner calling, I went down, and saw him standing at the privy-door with a candle, and he said, "Witness this, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—I went, and saw Calvert, and the prisoner's mother with her clothes up—the prisoner said, "How could I bear it!" and took hold of Calvert, struck him, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him and the mother into the room, and said, "Stay there till my father comes home; I shall not strike you any more"—Calvert jumped up, sprang at him, and the prisoner struck him again—he then went and sat down, and asked for water, the prisoner gave it him—the prisoner then took the kettle, poker, and tongs out of the room—the policemen then came, and while the prisoner was talking to them, his mother threw up the window, and Calvert went out of it—I saw no knife or poker, except when he took the poker out of the room—he had a black silk handkerchief round his hand, and that might have been taken for a poker.</p>

I am stabbed by that fellow there!"—the prisoner said, "I have done it! I have done it!" and he walked four paces back and leaned against the public-house—the prisoner had his hand lifted up, but I could not see whether anything was in it—Matthams bent down, and said he was stabbed—I ran round the corner, and called "Police!"—I said, "You had better knock him down; he will stab some of you"—I fetched the stretcher, and assisted in taking the policeman to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I remember Matthams being brought there on the night of 23rd Dec., about a quarter before twelve o'clock—I attended to him—he had received a punctured wound in the abdomen, between the chest and the navel, rather to the left side of the middle line of the body—it went rather obliquely—it was about two inches deep, and about five-eighths of an inch wide—such a knife as this produced might have done it—I have heard what dress the man wore—to have gone through all that dress and into the man's person, it most have been struck with force—I should think it must have required considerable violence to do it—if those substances had not impeded the blow, it must have pene<lb/>trated deeply—if it had gone much further, the results would have been very serious indeed—he was in the hospital nearly a fortnight—the wound was not bleeding when he came to me—he appeared to have lost much blood—he was faint—it was a dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the afternoon of 23rd Dec, between four and five o'clock, I was at Mr. Pi<lb/>per's public-house, the Six Bells, New Brentford, and saw the prisoner, the de<lb/>ceased Thomas Hipson, and several others, there—Hipson was intoxicated, and very quarrelsome—Robert Winter wanted to fight; the landlord would not allow him, and took him to another room—the deceased said he would fight a person named Brown who was there—Brown held up his right arm, but I cannot say whether he struck or pushed him—Hipson rolled back a step or two, but did not fall—he then went up to Brown again, and swore he would fight him, and Brown pushed him away a second time—the prisoner, who was sitting in the opposite corner, said to Brown, "If you touch him again, I will serve you a d—d sight worse than you served him"—Brown then drank his beer and left—previous to that, the prisoner had got Hipson to sit in a corner between him and a man named Jordan—Hipson could not sit upright, and seemed overpowered with drink, and we thought it advisable to lay him in a corner on the settle to sleep—he appeared to be asleep, and a young man, named Maddox, a boatman, came in, who was just out of his apprenticeship, and they wanted him to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some gin—he <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> some, and his father offered some to Hall, who refused having any, as he had had enough—old Maddox said, "You must have some, in or out"—he had a little, and Maddox <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> the remainder into his eyes—Hall got up in a violent pas<lb/>sion, and struck all round—some one spoke, I cannot say who—Hall</p>

               <p>thought it was the next to him, and said, "Can you fight?"—while this talk was going on, the deceased, Hipson, arose, and said he could fight, and Hall struck him a blow on each side of his face with his clenched hand—Hipson then laid his head on the table, and cried a few minutes, and occasionally rose up and talked about fighting—he seemed to aggravate Hall very much, who said he could fight him and his mate too (that was a boatman), if he had fair play in a field—Hipson appeared to be aggravated, and said if he had fair play he could beat him—Hall, who at the time was in his original seat on the opposite side of the fire, about eight feet off, jumped up again, went across the room, and struck him on the right side of the head—Hipson laid his bead on the table, and appeared to be snoring very loud—I heard no more, and it was generally believed he was asleep—he snored very loud about half a minute—in about twenty minutes, two men went and rose him up, and found he was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at New Brentford. On Sunday evening, 23rd Dec, I was called to Mr. Piper's, and saw the deceased—he was quite dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinaionon 27th, and found two very slight scars on the right side, of the face, and one on the left ear, exceedingly slight, but no external bruises about the head—they appeared quite recent, and very slight—upon opening the head, I found the vessels on the brain in an extremely con<lb/>gested state; I never saw any so full of blood; the membranes were all very much congested—there was a small vessel upon the face of the brain rup<lb/>tured, which threw out a great deal of blood: there was a small quantity of blood in each of the lateral ventricles—the liver was perfectly healthy, but rather large—I attribute the cause of death to this, I think the man was lying down on a bench and had been drinking, and got his head exceedingly con<lb/>gested or full of blood, and a very slight blow in that state would produce death.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> The whole of the congestion may have been occa<lb/>sioned by drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it required no violence of any kind to occasion it—everybody who gets thoroughly drunk is in a state very nearly approach<lb/>ing apoplexy every moment he lives—the least stimulant is likely to cause it, they are always subject to it—if, instead of having good strong healthy vessels, they have vessels naturally weak, the apoplexy is more violent—it was one of the ventricle arteries that was broken; it is not a very large ves<lb/>sel—it lies at the base of the brain—it is a part of a main artery—I should not say it is more easily ruptured than the main one—I think the mere rais<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>of his head suddenly, joined to considerable excitement and anger, would not have caused the rupture—if a man gets drunk and is angry, the blood is thrown up more quickly into the brain, and it goes back more slowly, the vessels are congested—if he raised his head in violent anger, it may have caused a rupture—it is within my experience that it has been caused over and over again in that way—I think, under the circumstances, a blow on the side of the face which left no external mark would not rupture the blood-vessels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watch-maker, at 147, Fleet-street. On Wednesday, 2nd Jan., the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I had got a good watch—I said I had, and showed him two or three silver ones, which I considered suitable for a man in his station of life; he looked like a sailor—he said be did not mind about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, but he must have a good watch, it was for a present to his uncle in America—I then produced a gold one, the price of which was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he looked at it, and seemed to make up his mind, and purchase it—I laid it on the counter, and he said, "Will you say 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said no, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price—he then asked for a good heavy chain, I showed him one—he said it was not heavy enough, had I got a heavier one—I went to the other side of the counter to get a heavier one, and a handful of pepper immediately came into my eyes, which blinded me, and when I recovered my sight the watch and the prisoner were gone—the transaction altogether did not take ten minutes—I had the opportunity of seeing his face—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—I have since seen the watch in the prisoner's possession.</p>

On Sunday, 2nd Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner quarrelling with Mrs. Walls—she said, "Go and pay your Queen's taxes, you know your lodgers will be seized on"—Mrs. Walls said, "Go and pay your score at the public-house"—with that the prisoner came with a stick and knocked her down to the ground, and the prisoner's husband wrenched the stick out of her hand, and ran into the passage—Mrs. Walls fell down from the blow, and two women and a man took her to the doctor's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw the whole from the beginning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw brickbats flung about, before they were quarrelling, and at the time, in every direction—there was a great confusion—Mrs. Walls was calling all manner of names—I saw no one struck with the brickbats—I saw them nearly catch one or two persons—young Walls was in the passage—he came out once or twice—he had no stick in his hand; it was the prisoner that had it—he did not use his fists at all—the policeman was waiting for him outside—he swore they should not take him to the station, and the prisoner complained of his striking her, but he had no stick—Walls is not a dutiful son; he is some<lb/>times drunk—I think he used to beat his mother, I never saw him—he bears the character in the court of being a very cruel son—I heard he was taken up for attempting to cut his mother's throat.</p>

               <p>property in Ireland on ray arrival at my majority—during my minority I had several money transactions with the prisoner, who at that time, I believe, had a place of business in Dublin—I think I first commenced transactions with him in Dec, 1846, or Jan., 1847; but my impression is that it was in Jan., 1847—he used to come to my rooms in barracks—he brought pictures, musi<lb/>cal-boxes and jewellery, and lent money upon bills—when I was approaching my majority, I made a communication on the subject of my affairs to Mr. Pullman—I think that was in April, 1847—it was also communicated to my guardians, one of whom was Mr. Murdock, a partner in the banking-house of Bouverie and Co., of London—after that communication, I placed my affairs in the hands of Mr. Pullman and my guardians—I gave Mr. Pull<lb/>man authority to arrange any claims that the prisoner had on me—I first consulted Mr. Pullman, I think, towards the end of April, and at the latter end of June, I think it was, the whole of these matters were placed in his hands—in consequence of information I received on 21st Nov. last, I went to the office of Messrs.

Bouverie and Co.—I drew on Bouverie and Co. for the amount of the allowance—I was first a cornet, for about three years—my pay as a cornet was a little over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, I cannot say exactly; I think it was somewhere about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, but I cannot say—the agents of the regiment in England were Messrs.

I said there were two bills that were forgeries—there were three that were forgeries—I cannot tell the amount of those bills—no doubt it was told me then—it was considerably more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should guess it was somewhere about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mean the forged ones—the total amount was, I think, about 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on which Harris brought the action—I was informed of the total amount upon which Harris sued me—I understood that he first of all made a demand of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd, but I was told by my friends that he brought the action for about 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no doubt I was told at the time upon how many bills the action was brought—I cannot recollect, but my impression is, it was on about five bills—I was told how many of those bills appeared to be dated before my majority—there two dated after—how many were dated before, I cannot precisely say—I was told at the time—I have now forgotten, but my impression is about three—two out of those three were forged—I believe those two amounted to a little above 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot swear as to the sum—I knew I was not liable on the bills accepted during my minority—I know that minority was the defence made as to a portion of those bills—there was, of course, the defence of forgery upon the other three—there was the double defence of forgery and minority to one—I do not know what has become of the two bills that were alleged to have been accepted after my majority—I have never had an opportunity of seeing those three bills that I stated were forgeries—I never endeavoured to see them—I endeavoured to get them impounded; my friends did—I was not present; by my friends I mean Mr. Pullman, Mr. Murdock, and Mr. Markcomb, my guardians.</p>

I paid a visit to my estate in Ireland, and came back again to England, and was either at London or Great Halkesley—I was backwards and forwards between those places—I should say I was in London as much as a week together with Mr. Pullman—I was at an hotel the first two or three days—I must have been in Ireland about ten days—I went straight through Dublin up to County Leitrim to my estates—the greater part of, in fact I may say all, the winter of 1848, I was going backwards and forwards between Mr. Pullman's and Great Halkesley, stopping a week, ten days, or a fortnight at either place—I was visiting between those places until the spring of 1849, when I staid with Mr. Murdock, my guardian, some little time—I had a lodging near his house up to about May, but I was going about chiefly between Mr. Pullman's and Mr. Markcomb's—I forgot to mention that I was in Ireland when Harris brought the action—that must have been in Nov., 1848, and I went to visit a cousin of mine in the county of Cavan—I stayed there some time, and came away about the middle of Jan., 1849, I think, and from then until May I was visiting between Mr. Pullman and my guardian's—in May I took a lodging at 17, Pall Mall—that has been my lodging ever since—I visited Mr. Pullman when I came to town up to May, and communicated with him about my affairs—I know that they have remained unsettled up to the present day, and I know why—I do not know of any other claims than Joel's being left unsettled in the spring of this</p>

               <p>year—my affairs remained unsettled up to the spring of 1849, because we could never get a proper account from Joel and others—Joel sent in accounts which I had the means of checking, and I knew they were not correct—Mr. Marcus's account is still unsettled—he holds one bill of mine for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware that any tradesman's bill was left unpaid from that period—I know a person named Meyer, of Kilkenny—I have no account of his—I do not know that I owe him anything—my friends managed it—I never saw Meyer—I know there was an arrangement with him—I do not owe him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the circumstances were these: Mr. Meyer backed a bill for me; my friends thought it was very wrong of him, an old man, to back a bill for me when I was a boy, and consequently they decided that only so much of the bill was fairly owing, and so much they paid—what amount Mr. Meyer may have lost by the bill I do not know; I have not troubled myself about it—I know the bill is settled—I believe Mr. Waterhouse is paid—I paid the money for the check—I knew when I was in Dublin, in 1848, that Harris's action was going on—I went over on purpose for the action—I was first informed that Harris had sued me on the bill when I came back from Spain in 1848, not before—all Mr. Pullman's letters missed me, except just that one which I luckily got, and which bronght me back as quick as possible—if I had not received it, I might very possibly not have come back then—I went over to Ireland first about my affairs, and then about Harris's action—I owed a Mr. Dillon some money—he became bankrupt—he was requested to send in his account, and I have been to his attorney's—his bill is still owing—I should say there cannot be much else unsettled, with the exception of Joel's, of course.</p>

               <p>in any way involved—he was a ward of the Court of Chancery for a con<lb/>siderable time—there was very great difficulty with reference to the manage<lb/>ment of those affairs in Chancery, and I was requested to investigate the matter in Dublin, which I did—the uncles affairs were also in the Court of Chancery, and I was watching for both—I was paid barrister's fees for that—one of those suits is wound up, the other is not, on account of the admini<lb/>strator of Mr. Denny's father having died, and his accounts not being rendered—I became acquainted with Mr. Clements in the winter of 1846, or the beginning of 1847—I think he first mentioned his affairs to me at the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I was then in Dublin—I had often met him before—I communicated with other creditors, as well as Joel, with all who I believed to be creditors in Dublin—I called on them—Mr. Clements first called on me, and gave me a verbal account—he then gave me an account of his creditors in writing, it was after that that I applied to Joel—I am not aware that he kept a shop—he was lodging in Dame-street, in a room over a fruiterer's or greengrocer's shop—I called on him, saw him, and requested him to send in an account, which he promised to do—I said nothing beyond that; that must have been a day or two before I left Dublin—his letter followed me to London—I have no doubt I gave him my address either at my chambers or my house—I have lost the envelope of that letter—he showed me no bills when I called on him in Dublin—I do not recollect anything more passing than I have stated—I had seen Mr. Clements' guardians before that; I saw Mr. Murdock at his bank in the Haymarket—I had been to London, and returned before I saw Joel—I do not remember when Mr. Clements gave me names of his creditors—it was before I came to London to see his guardians; for I came to London to tell his guardians what he had told me—that was the first time I had seen Mr. Murdock—it was somewhere about 13th July—I immediately returned to Dublin again, and I believe that same day called on all the creditors in Dublin who I knew to have any account; not the same day I returned from London, but the same day I saw Joel—I took no bills or accounts with me to the guardians; I had not received any then; I am quite certain of that—I returned to London again, to go on the Western Circuit, which I joined at Bridgewater, and there, or in town, I received Joel's letter of 30th July—I was at Bridgewater a week, or thereabouts—I believe I only found one account waiting for me on my return—that was Harris's, dated from Dublin, Aug. 2nd—it was forwarded to me at Bridgewater, I believe—I believe I saw Joel on the subject of his first account within a day or two after the Somerset election—that was at my chambers—there was no one present but him and me—I made a memorandum of what passed at that interview—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made it at the time—it is a correct memorandum of what passed, with the exception of some letters here in blue ink, which were added afterwards, when I endeavoured to test his verbal statement with the account that was afterwards sent in—there is no date to the memorandum, only, "Half-past six, Tuesday evening;" address, "49, Strand"—that was the address Mr. Joel gave—Mr. Joel was sitting with me at the time I took this down—I told him he had better send in a written account—he told me exactly what is on this paper—the interview must have lasted some consider<lb/>able time—I frequently went to Armit and Burroughs, in Dublin, after this interview, with reference to Mr. Clements' affairs—I have shown this memo<lb/>randum to Mr. Clements—I called on Cox and Greenwood once—that was subsequent to Mr. Clements' having left the army—it was in Sept.—it was</p>

               <p>trial at Croydon, Mr. Clements was down there, and his solicitor instructed counsel to move that the bill should be impounded, in order that a prosecu<lb/>tion might be instituted—Messrs. Wright and Kings ford, of Essex-street, were Mr. Clements' solicitors, and their managing clerk was there, and gave those instructions—I was concerned in the arrangement of Harris's matters with regard to Mr. Clements' bills—Harris has never been taken into custody, except when he was bound over to keep the peace, having threatened to do me some personal injury—I am not aware that he has ever been taken into custody for forgery—in the account produced there is a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stated to have been drawn or accepted by Lieutenant Williams—I did not refuse to pay that in the first instance—Lieutenant Williams did not threaten to chas<lb/>tise me if it was not paid—the bill was dishonoured, and Lieutenant Williams was threatened with an action—he told me so, and showed me the letter from the attorney—the reason the bill was dishonoured, as I believe, was, that there was a mistake with reference to the date—I saw this gentleman, and said to him, "Inasmuch as you had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this bill, and no more, as I understand; if you will pay 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., namely, the interest upon the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you had, I will deposit the remainder with Annit and Buroughs"—I paid in 396<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with reference to its not being there, that was not the fault of Mr. Clements; but the 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lodged, and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was then made up—it was dishonoured in the first instance—there was no dispute about the consi<lb/>deration of it—there was a little delay about the amount being made up—it was not refused on the ground of any charge of forgery—it was paid in two or three days, I believe—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the second account</hi>) I made this erasure on the back either in July or Aug.—I made a memorandum upon this, which ought to have been made on another, and then scratched it out—I have had a great many opportunities of seeing Mr. Clements' writing—that was after I was engaged in his affairs—I have no recollection of having seen any bill that is signed before he became of age, with the exception of one which he drew in my presence for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen his handwriting on bills which purported to be drawn before he became of age, but I had not, until he became of age, seen his handwriting upon any bills—there were two bills which purported to have been accepted after he became of age, which I have seen—I did not see him write those—I do not think the acceptance to the bill in question is a disguised hand—I think it is very much like Mr. Clements' writing, but I do not think he wrote it, inasmuch as there are peculiarities about it which I have not seen before—the only peculiarity it with reference to the "s" and the "t"—they are not at all like anything that I have seen Mr. Clements write—there is no stroke to the "t," and here is a flourish at the end of the "s" which I do not remember seeing in Mr. Clements' writing—here is a peculiarity also about the "C" in Clements; still it is very much like his writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper marked Z</hi>) this is very much like Mr. Clements's writing, but it is not written as that is—I think it is his writing—it is very much like it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one marked Y</hi>) I cannot tell as to this—I should say "J.M.

(<hi rend="italic">Looking at another paper marked X</hi>) I should say, looking at this, that it is very much like a copy of the signature on the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill—I do not think it is his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">this was the </hi>1000<hi rend="italic">l.-bill in question, but handed to the witness in an envelope, a portion of which was cut out, so as to render the signature only visible</hi>)—the words "Lieu't. 13th Light Dragoons" are very like his writing; but</p>

               <p>really I should say it does not appear to be written with the same ink as "T.M. Clements" is, or at the same time. (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a paper marked W</hi>) I think this is Mr. Clements's writing—I see the words "Lieu't. 13th Light Dragoons" here—I think that is his—I have seen the three bills that were in Harris's hands, which were alleged to be forgeries—I saw them at Dublin—the last time I saw them was in Nov., or Dec., 1848, in Court, at Dublin, and I had seen them before that, when they were brought into the Master's Office for inspection—they were produced by Mr. Bloomfield, Harris's solicitor, upon a motion for their inspection—when I saw them in Court, they were in the hands of Harris, where they still remain, I believe, or in the hands of his attorney—that was the last I saw of them—I saw Harris in Court; he was there when the verdict was returned—I have not spoken to him since—I saw him at the Bankruptcy Court here, and once at the Imperial Hotel, where I was staying—I have not seen him at all since Joel was taken into custody—the last time I saw him was perhaps two months ago—when I saw him at the Imperial, he was in the coffee-room with some officer upon some bill-transac<lb/>tion—that was six or seven months or more after the trial—I had nothing to do with Mr. Clements' debts—I have paid every claim that I am aware of that has been sent in—if any party has a claim against him, I will pay it now—we are quite ready to pay every farthing—the matter is not finally settled—I have not paid Joel a single farthing, and he has never asked for a single farthing—I have endeavoured to ascertain what amount in actual cash, and what amount in real value of jewellery he has furnished to Mr. Clements—I have only made these inquiries from Mr. Joel and Mr. Clements—I have been to Armit and Buroughs, to ask them for their account, and I have got it—I have no idea who the clerk was who gave it me—my account with Mr. Clements and his guardians is not yet settled—I am to be paid thus, I was requested to make this investigation, and I then stated that I was not an attorney, and I could make no charge whatever—they said if I would go to investigate the affairs, I should have the fees which a barrister was entitled to while I was away—I would make no terms whatever with Mr. Clements in any way, or have any transaction with him—I stated so distinctly—I have been paid something by the guardians, but am not entirely settled with—everything was done from communication with the guardians.</p>

               <p>know this was the agreement on which the bill was drawn, because there was always an agreement on all these bills, as to what was to be in cash, what in jewellery, and what was to be the commission—I never drew a bill without that arrangement—I should say this memorandum was not made in Joel's pre<lb/>sence—I have no means of knowing whether I personally received any cash on that bill—I know there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash paid on it, which Lieutenant Williams had, whether I received the remaining 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I cannot tell—it may have been dishonoured at first, but it was paid eventually—my affairs were then out of my own hands, and I was away—I cannot swear whether I got the three stone diamond ring charged at 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; my impression is I did not; if there is no memorandum of mine on the margin, I suppose I did—I sold that diamond to Waterhouse—there is a note of it—I cannot say when I sold it him—I know the stones did go there eventually, but when I cannot recollect—Lieutenant Williams did not come to me about the bill after it had been dishonoured—I was in England when it was due—I do not remember receiving any letter from him—I have never seen him since—he was aid-de<lb/>camp to the Lord-Lieutenant, and I believe he is so now—I know what accepting a bill in blank is—it is writing your name across a blank piece of paper—I never saw the two bills of Harriss that have been mentioned—I was not in the Court at Dublin—I was waiting at Morrison's Hotel while the trial was going on—Mr. Franks, of Dublin, was my attorney—Joel used to come to me at barracks, as you will see by his accounts, every now and then—the bills were drawn and accepted in my private room there—no one was present when I gave any of the bills—of course you would not have two in your room at once—I think Joel came to me in June and July, 1847—I cannot tell the date, but it was after I had signed the last bill in this account—it may have been the beginning of July—he was a very short time with me; it was in my barrack-room—he did not ask me to make any payment on account—he asked me to renew two bills—I do not recollect which they were, but he said two bills would become due, and he asked me to renew them—he did not show them to me—they may have been over due, or coming due, I do not recollect which—the conversation perhaps might have lasted five or six minutes—we were the only two persons present—I refused to renew the bills—I did not give him any reason; I said I would rather not—he did not ask for a reason—he said he wished I would renew them, and wished me to write a letter, saying that all his transactions with me were fair, and I declined doing either.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he ask you why you refused to renew them, and did not you say because you were a minor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, decidedly not; because I was a minor then, and it could have done him no good to renew those bills—I do not recollect anything passing about my being a minor—I will not swear it, but my impression is there was nothing—he did not threaten to take proceed<lb/>ings against me, he was very civil, he said nothing of the sort—I do not recollect his saying I had disputed other persons' accounts, and said I was a minor—I do not recollect that I had disputed any accounts—I was not told as early as April, when I consulted Mr. Pullman, that the defence of minority was a good one—I may possibly have had conversation between May and July, 1847, with persons about my being a minor when I accepted bills, and very possibly with creditors—I do not remember telling anybody that I was not bound by those acceptances, because they were given when I was a minor—I do not recollect any such conversations—I say it is possible there may have been such conversations, but I do not recollect it; I do not deny that there</p>

Kings<lb/>ford and Wright; counsel, I understand, had instructions in Court to impound the bill if it was produced, but it was not—I did not see Joel there—I did not go into Court—I was staying at Windsor when I first heard of the bill, and I came off, I think, almost the next day—I passed through London—I may have gone to Kingsford and Wright's offices, I cannot say—I know that there is an action now pending against me upon that very bill—I believe that had been begun long before Joel was taken into custody—I had heard of it before that—I came up to London from Yorkshire the moment I heard there was such an action, and that the bill was likely to be forth-coming—I went to Mr. Campbell's, and that was the first time I saw it—I did not believe it was my signature, decidedly not.</p>

So-and-so, J.M. Clements, Lieu't. 13th Light Dragoons, payable at Messrs. Armit and Burroughs"—I usually wrote "accepted, payable."</p>

Williams's bill, does not enable me to say whether I had that 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—it enables me to swear that the statement of it here is wrong, and to state the nature of the arrangement that I then made with Mr. Joel—it was a bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the additional security of Lieut. Williams—Joel was to give me in cash 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to take up two bills which he had given to Mesage the print-seller, for 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did not do, to take out in goods 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and interest at the rate of 60 per cent.; the bill was drawn for four months, that would be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in my other dealings with bills with Joel, I always made a similar</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how could yon give a memorandum for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave a memo<lb/>randum for a paper left with me; in fact I had no glasses at the moment, and could not see to read it—I merely gave him a memorandum for a memo<lb/>randum given to me to give to one of the partners, merely a memorandum that he had left a paper with me—that was all the information I received from him—my eyes did not, without my glasses, enable me to look and see the particulars of the paper—I did not look at it after he was gone, and before I gave it to Mr. Reeve—I put it into my desk, and when Mr. Reeve came I took it up, and said, "Mr. Reeve, here is a paper left by Mr. Joel for you, will you take it?" and I gave it him—I really believe it was a paper of this description, but I could not say what it was—I did not receive more than one paper from Joel, which I gave to Mr. Reeve—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Chipping Ongar, in Essex. On Tuesday, 1st Jan., I was returning from London to my residence—I had occasion to go through Epping Forest—I saw the prisoners about three o'clock in the day, just behind the Eagle at Snaresbrook, in Wan stead parish, on the road that leads to Woodford and Chigwell—I and my wife were in a gig—Joseph came up to my horse, took hold of its head, and stopped it—I asked him his business—he came up to the side of my horse, and I said to him, "Friend, what is your business?"—Joseph said, "Your life or your money," and immediately fired a pistol—I do not know whether it was</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Mortlake. On Sunday; 16th Dec, a little before ten o'clock, I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read—addressed,</hi> "Mr. C. Cain, cow-keeper, East Sheen, Surrey. Dec. 15,1849. Sir,—If it be convenient and agreeable to you, I will beg the favour of you to lend me the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and likewise a further sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my companions, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, who are bent on your ruin unless you comply with our request; for we intend <hi rend="italic">splitting</hi> on you buying corn of Barclay and Perkins's men, when they were drawing turf from the New-road. The 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be returned the 19th Jan.; if you will lend it me, I will return it personally: if not, either let me have a note to what terms you mean to come. It is not six months since a man was transported for a much less quantity than you have received. Bury the money, or a note, by the common gate adjoining Pocock's Meadow, close to the gate-post; where the sappers and miners have cut across. It must be there by ten o'clock on Sunday morning. We are your humble servants, G.H., J.M. G.W.'s mark x.")—I immediately went to Sergeant Finlayson, and asked his advice—he wrote me a letter, of which this is a copy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it being over the time on that morning, he advised me to bury it, according to the instructions, on the Monday—I put three farthings in the letter, and buried it at the place I was told to do so—I am quite satisfied no one saw me bury it—I returned about one o'clock, and found it in an undisturbed state—I walked down the Richmond-road a little distance, and then met Holland, who was watching it—in consequence of what passed with Holland, I went and took the farthings out, and deposited the letter again in the same place—no one was near at the time—I went again the following morning, found the hole disturbed, and the letter gone—on the Thursday after, by the twelve o'clock post, I received this second letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Dec. 19. Six,—As we have not received the money or note, we take the trouble of writing to you again. We all came down on Sunday morning, and stayed till nine at night; but you neither placed the money or a note. If you think that place not safe,</p>

               <p>place it by that little gate opposite the lane, the Richmond side of the Five Awls; you will find a piece cut off one of the posts; we mean a narrow place leading to the railroad. It cost us 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. coming on Sunday; you must, therefore, put the money or the note on Thursday evening, or early on Friday morning, so as we may know what to do; for we intend giving infor<lb/>mation at the firm on Monday, where we shall get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and our expenses paid. If it cost us any more coming down, we shall expect it from you. We remain, your humble servants (<hi rend="italic">not signed</hi>). You will get off so cheap with them.")—I do not know the writing of either of the letters—I inclosed that letter, with a note, to Sergeant Finlayson—two officers came to me, and, by their advice, I marked five farthings, folded them each up in paper, and sealed them with wax—I then folded all five in a sheet of writing-paper, and secured the folds and ends—I wrote outside, "To be left till called for," and under that, "Police"—in the morning, at a little before six, I went and put it in the place described in the second letter, by the gate under the post that had the notch on—it was impossible to mistake the place—I made a hole, and buried it four inches under ground, returned the mould on it, put my foot on it, and went away—I am quite sure no one saw me do it—it is a place by the high-road side—about eight o'clock I drove my cart round that way, looked at the place, and saw it was undisturbed—I returned again about ten o'clock, found the place open, and the packet gone.</p>

In consequence of a communication, on 21st Dec, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to Sheen, and went to a part where I could see the post described in the second letter—I con<lb/>cealed myself where I had a clear view of the place—I saw Mr. Cain go by with his horse and cart, and several other people—about ten, I saw the pri<lb/>soner coming up the road from Richmond—he came to the corner of Blind-lane, made a stop, and looked about him, directly opposite the post—he then turned up Blind-lane, and passed very close to me, which enabled me to have a clear view of his features—he stayed up the lane four or five minutes, out of my sight, and then returned again to the main road—he then crossed over to where the post was, looked down at the bottom of the post, and bent himself a little down—he then went down Forty-alley, (which leads from the post,) about 150 or 200 yards—he then came to the top of the alley, and stood at the side of the post, looking about him again—he then bent himself down, and with his righthand raked the mould away from the bottom of the post—he took something out that appeared to me like paper—it was white, he put it into his righthand pocket, and turned down the alley again—I gave Holland, who was at some distance from me, a signal to go and see if the letter was gone, and I kept sight of the prisoner—as he was going down the lane, I saw him move his hand, as if throwing something away—Holland got a-head of me, and I saw him stop the prisoner—we then returned together, and near the place where I saw him make the motion, I found these pieces of paper(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), which have the appearance as if coin had been folded in them—I took the prisoner to Mr. Cain, and then to the Richmond station—when I went on watch, I examined the place—there was nothing to attract the atten<lb/>tion of a person who did not know anything beforehand—no one disturbed the place before the prisoner came—I never lost sight of the place all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Church-street, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. Giles', Camber well—the prisoner was in my service for a little more than two weeks—I received her from her father and mother, but she had been in service before—we had a good character with her—on 27th Dec., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was fetched by my daughter, Frances Sarah, from the parlour to the kitchen—it was scarcely light, but there were no candles lighted—when I got to the kitchen I went to the coal cellar, and found it in a blaze, the roof of the cellar is the floor of the pas<lb/>sage—coals and turf were kept there, and shavings, and wood in a box—the flames were proceeding from the box where the shavings and wood were; I got some water and extinguished it—I then returned to the parlour—my wife and daughter were in the parlour with me; and in about an hour after<lb/>wards, between five and six, a lady came to tea—we were sitting at tea, and I heard a noise like a candlestick fall—it seemed to be on the stairs, as if a person coming down-stairs had let something drop—my wife went up-stairs, and cried out that the top of the house was on fire—the lady who came to tea (who lived next door) went in for her brother—I went up-stairs and called for water—I cannot tell who brought it, I was in such confusion—when I got to the top floor I attempted to go in the front room, but I could not, the smoke was so dense—I went up twice—some dresses were hanging on a rail against the wall, and a curtain drawn before them—they were on fire, and that fire had communicated to the hand-rail, ballustrade, and landing—there are two rooms on the floor; one of them the prisoner occu<lb/>pied—some water was brought, and in about a quarter of an hour we extin<lb/>guished the fire—I had no idea that it had extended any further, but I went in the room and found the roof-curtain of a camp bed had been set on fire, and was burnt out—it was calico, and was burnt about four feet square—the foot curtain and the rail of the bed had been ignited—I examined the floor of the landing; it was burnt about a yard square, and some part of it was quite burnt through to the joists—we could not find the prisoner when we were extinguishing the fire—after we had extinguished it I went down in the kitchen and found her whining—I asked her how she could commit such a diabolical act—she said, "I did not do it; you did not see me do it"—I gave her in custody next morning.</p>
