               <p>Connor. I came to Eastmead's House the 1st or 2d of July, about Eleven at Night, with a Gentleman, (one Mr. Fisher) and we staid there all Night, and breakfasted and dined there, the next Day. After Dinner we had a Coach, and Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Eastmead and I, went to my Mother's at Hyde Park, and from thence went round to Brumpton, and Jenny's Whim. I was then dressed in White; and when we came into Piccadilly, I said I would go home, and change my Gown, to keep it clean. So I got out of the Coach, and Mr. Fisher called after me, and bid me come to Eastmond's Bagnio again; he lives in Leicester-Fields. I promised him I would, and when I had changed my Cloaths at my Washerwoman's, I went again to the Bagnio, and asked for Mr. Fisher. Mr. Eastmead told me, he was not there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180003"/> - and if he was, I should not see him: I said, I was sure he was there, and called out, - Mr. Fisher ! Upon this Mr. Eastmead knocked me down in the Entry, and both he, and his Wife, dragged me into their Back-Parlour, or Bed-chamber, and they beat me in a miserable Manner: When I cry'd out, Mrs Eastmead stopped my Mouth with her Hand, and then they stripp'd my Cloaths off, and would have taken off my Shift, if People had not come into the House, - I had much ado to keep it on. They swore at me, and told me 'twas no Sin to kill me, if they had a Knife. They took from me a Pair of Stays, a Green Silk Quilted Coat, and a Hoop-Petticoat, and I have never heard of my Cloaths since. After he had used me ill, I cry'd out, Murder! Upon which he took me up in his Arms, and flung me out of the House, in such a Manner, that my Face fell upon the Flag-Stones, and I bled a great deal. When I got out of the Coach in Piccadilly, in order to change my Gown, I left Mr. Fisher and Mrs. Eastmead in the Coach, and he (Fisher) bid me come to him again, and not stay long. - 'Tis not the first unhappy Girl they have used so. Mrs. Eastmead owned before Mr. Deveil, That she had my Cloaths; and People came to me to offer me Money not to appear against them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Did not you say you would go up Stairs and see for Mr. Fisher?</p>
               <p>Connor. On my Oath I did not: I only called - Mr. Fisher! - at the Bottom of the Stairs, because if he had been in the Parlour, I wanted to have spoken with him: He had told me he wanted to speak with me. I have known Eastmead a great while, but I have not frequented the House much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Whose Stays were they?</p>
               <p>Connor. I bought them of Mrs. Eastmead, and paid her for them. I paid her a Guinea and four Shillings for them: One Mrs. Richards saw me pay her for them, about eight Months ago. I paid her a Guinea all at once, and the four Shillings afterwards.</p>

She came to my House with Mr. Fisher the 2d of July; they lay there all Night, and next Day, they breakfasted and dined together: They had a Leg of Lamb and Green Peas for Dinner, and drank plentifully of Wine and Shrub. In the Afternoon my Wife and they went out in a Coach to Brumpton. He returned to my House, without the Girl, and told me, if Moll Connor should come to enquire for him, I must not own he was there, for she had done him a great Injury.

Fisher came back about Eleven o'Clock, and ordered that the Gentlewoman that had been with him the Night before, should not be admitted to him, In a Quarter of an Hour after this, Connor came in, and insisted on seeing the Gentleman, whereof, she was deny'd; upon which she went into the Parlour and pulled off her Cloaths, - her Stays, her Quilted Coat, and her Hoop, and said she would go up Stairs to him. I was at this Time in the Entry, and stood at the Parlour Door and saw her undress herself. Fisher lay up one Pair of Stairs, and she was going up to him, but my Mistress, (Eastmead) pulled her down again, and she struck my Mistress in the Face, and made a great Disturbance at the Door, and said she would be revenged of them, and would send them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180004"/> Newgate.

               <p>Davis. I can't remember whether any Body went with them, or not. Mr. Fisher returned by himself in a Chair, about Eleven at Night; I saw no more of them, from Seven in the Morning, 'till Eleven at Night. They neither break-fasted, nor dined at our House, - neither Mr. Fisher nor Connor. When he came in at Eleven, he ordered that she (Connor) should not go up Stairs to him, but when she returned, she said, she would go up; so I informed her, the Gentleman desired not to see her, and called my Mistress (Eastmead) to her, who told her she must not go up to Mr. Fisher. She went into the Back-Parlour, and undressed herself; my Master was at the same time below in the Kitchen; my Mistress was in the Parlour with Connor, and I was above Stairs - but I saw her fling her Cloaths off, - for I was coming down Stairs, and telling her, she must not go up. - There was no one but my Mistress in the Room, for my Master was below Stairs, and

            . I don't know Connor, but I had some Acquaintance with one of Eastmead's Maids, and was below in the Kitchen, on the 2d of July, when this Disturbance happened above Stairs, and went half Way up, and heard Mrs. Eastmead say to Connor, you need not undress your self, for here you shall not lie To night. Connor said, she would go up Stairs, and Words arose, and some Blows passed. After this, Connor said, if you won't let me lie here, turn me out. Aye, says Eastmead, go out, - but take your Cloaths with you; No, says Connor, I will not, for I will send you both to Newgate. This was between Eleven and Twelve at Night.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you to be there that Night?</p>
               <p>Ingram. I went to see their Maid Fanny, She and I were below in the Kitchen, and we were coming up Stairs; for I was going away, if this Disturbance had not happen'd. As the Dispute rose higher, I proceeded higher, and stood at the Top of the Stairs, but went no farther. Frances (Prince) went into the Parlour; I saw her go in at the Door: There are two Parlours, - I can't tell which of them she went into, I think it was into the back Parlour, to assist her Mistress; both the Doors were open, but I could not see far enough to have a View of the Place where the Squabble was. I saw no Blood, - not a Drop; nor did I see Mr. Eastmead all that Night: I heard a Man's Tongue, but I can't take upon me to say it was his.</p>

On Monday the 2d of July, I was making some Alterations in their Parlour, and I saw the Prosecutrix there in a Plaid Night-gown, a single Petticoat, and her Smock on; she was shelling Peas with a Gentleman in the Kitchen: I believe she is a common Woman, for I heard her once tell Eastmead, that she was just come out of the Marshalsea, but she need not be afraid, for she would pay her very handsomely.

But when I was got into the next Field, I saw him coming after me, in a Path between some Corn; seeing him coming towards me, I made towards the Hedge-Side; when he came up to me, he made a full Stop, and asked me the Way to Newington? I directed him thither, and turned my Back on him; but I had not gone many Steps, before I heard somebody coming behind me; I turned about, and saw a Man with a Mask upon his Face, and a Pistol in his Hand; he called to me, and said, - Sir, I must have your Money. Money, says I! - I don't know whether I have any Silver or no. However, he came up to me with his Pistol in his Hand, and I put my Hand in my Pocket for my Money; I had a pretty many Half-Pence, about 8 or 9 Penn'orth, and while I was feeling for them, he saw my Watch Chain: Sir, says he, I must have your Watch. I desired him not to take my Watch, but he said he must have it immediately, and he took hold of the Chain, and drew it out himself; then he went away, and did not stay to search me any farther. When he was got some Distance from me, I saw him run; then I call'd out - Stop Thief! Stop Highwayman! Upon the Alarm he was follow'd and taken. I saw him when the People started after him, but not when he ran out of the Ditch, for that was near Three quarters of an Hour afterwards. I remember the Prisoner's Face perfectly well; and though when he robb'd me he had a Masque on, yet by his Voice and Cloaths, I have Reason to believe he is the Man; and no one else could come into the Field in that Space of Time.</p>

            . The Prosecutor lodged at my House, and at the Time he was robb'd I was drinking with a Friend at the Door of a Publick House in the Neighbourhood. While I was there, a Man came up and told me the Gentleman had been robb'd; so two or three of us went after the Thief; - One went one Way, and others another. By the Account I had of the Robbery, I thought the Man could not be far off, and that he could not easily escape. I and two others searched for him in the Field next the Downs, and there we found a Track in the Field, which we follow'd till we came to a Ditch, and under the Bushes I thought-I saw something, and it proved to be the Prisoner. One of the Lads that was with me said, he was sure it was either a Man, or a Sack of Peas that was hid there; I said 'twas a Man; upon which the Prisoner raised himself upright in the Ditch, from under the Bushes, and put on his Hat and Wig, which before were off, and he had no sooner done that, but he held up a Pistol through the Bushes at me. I drew back, and cautioned those that were with me to do so too; at the same Time bidding the Prisoner come out; he accordingly came out, presenting a Pistol in each Hand. We had two or three Dogs with us, and we set them at him, but they would not seize him; so he ran away, with a Pistol in each Hand, and we pursue'd him over the Downs, and towards a Wooden Bridge at the Bottom of the Downs, which goes over a Brook. He ran over the Bridge, and we called to a Man, who was then coming over it, to stop him, but he did not. When he had got a few yards over the Bridge, I saw him shift his Pistols into one Hand, and dropp'd the Watch with the other. I bid one of the Lads take it up, and carry it to Mr. Brown, while we pursued the Prisoner, who ran up a dirty Lane, where some Men were digging Ballast, and we alarmed them likewise. We pursued him out of this Lane, cross Kingsland Road, and through an Orchard, into a large Field of Beans and Peas; and here the People coming thick upon him, he got into a Corner of the Field, and stood with a Pistol in each Hand, and every one being afraid to go near him for fear of his Pistols, a Man called out for a Gun; I said, I would go and get one, upon which the Prisoner called to me, and said he would surrender himself to me; We did not understand him at first; and a Man asked him, whether he would surrender to him? No, says the Prisoner - I will surrender to that Man in his own Hair, (meaning me.) Then I went nearer him, and desired him to drop his Pistols; he told me I might come safely, for he would do me no Hurt; I insisted on his throwing down his Pistols, and while we were arguing, some People got hold of his Arms, and secur'd him. When he was taken we carry'd him to a Publick House, (where he behaved well) and from thence we took him before Justice Norris, and there he said but very little; he told the Justice, - he did not chose to say either one Thing or another. This Pair of Pistols was found upon him, and two or three Balls, and a Pair of Bullet-moulds; one of the Pistols was loaded, but I think it was not prim'd; I don't know whether the other had any Thing more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180007"/> a Ball and a Bit of Paper in it. I was never above twenty or thirty Yards from him, from the Time of his being started out of the Ditch, to his being taken.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner from a Child: I knew his Parents; they lived next Door to me, in St. Clement's Parish, in Ipswich. His Mother was many Times beside herself; she made many Attempts to destroy her Life, and at last she hang'd herself; I was upon the Coroner's Inquest, and she was brought in Lunatick, for she had been reputed as such. The Prisoner lived at Ipswich till he was twelve Years old, and behav'd well; then he was put out Apprentice at Colchester, and during his Apprenticeship, I only saw him when he came to visit his Friends. His Father was several Times out of Order: - Once I remember he came to our House, and my Wife perswading him to eat something with us, he said, he could not, for if he did he should be choak'd, and should die at the next high Water.</p>

Then they put a Pistol to my Breast, and two to my Head, swearing they would shoot my Brains out if I made any Resistance. They took from me, a Silver Watch, and after they had got that, they took my Money out of my Pocket, and bid me go about my Business. 'Twas then nigh Ten o'Clock at Night. When they had got my Watch and Money, one of them bid the others see if I had no Rings; I said I had no - Rings, for I had but - one; and at the same time I endeavoured to shuffle it off, with my Glove, but one of them guessing what I was about, cry'd - d - mn you, are you going to serve me so, and catching hold of my Glove, he tore it off, and took my Ring, - 'twas a Mourning Ring, set with a Chrystal Stone. I advertised the Watch, and Mr. Gardiner brought it to me, but the Ring I never had again. I can't swear to the Prisoner, he has been fetched up a great Way out of the Country, but he agrees with the Height of one of the Persons.</p>

             went out from Crown Court, in Chick-Lane, on Tuesday Night, in order to rob somebody or other. We went to a Place between Shoreditch and Kingsland, and staid sometime on the Causeway; and not seeing any body come by, we went past Kingsland Town, it was about half an Hour after Nine, when we had got beyond the Town, about a Quarter of a Mile, we met this Chaise, with a grey Horse: The Horse trotted, and we followed it to Kingsland Town, then it walked, and we ran before the Chaise, till we came to a vacant Place, where we thought proper to stop it. 'Twas just at the Stone Watch-house, when two of us went on one Side the Chaise, and two on the other, and stopped it. The Prisoner was on the Off-side of the Horse; Nash and I were on the other. Nash ordered the Gentleman to come out of the Chaise, and when he had got out, Nash stepped in, and bid me rifle his Pockets: So I took his Watch, and Gooby searched for Money. The Watch was an old-fashion'd Silver one, without a Minute Hand, but had a new outside Case, and a Silver Chain, and Seal. We took likewise, a Mourning Ring with a little Stone in it, and five Shillings and Sixpence in Money; these Things we took from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180009"/> Mr. Reynolds. Nash took from the other Gentleman, a large Silver Watch and Silver Chain, and the Name on that Watch was Barrow, and a Gold Ring, with the Name Atwood in the Inside, and between eight and nine Shillings in Money, and his Hat. Then we went directly to Chick-Lane, and stay'd there all Night. Next Morning we went to a Shop in the Minories, and Gooby went in and sold the Watch: He had at that Time this Coat upon him, which I have on now. 'Twas Mr. Reynolds's Watch we sold there, and got 12 s. for it: The Silver Seal we had taken off before. When we had sold the Watch, we went to the Sign of the Pack Horse, in Goswell-street, where the Prisoner's Wife lived, and from thence to Chick-Lane. From Chick Lane we went to St. Giles's, to Nash's Sweetheart's Lodging; from whence we all went together to Bedlam, and spent most of the Money which we had divided between us for the Watch and the Hat; we gave Money to the Prisoners in Bedlam, and when we came out, we had a Supper in that Neighbourhood, and then we all went together to the Pack-horse. The next Morning we sold the Ring for nine Shillings, and parted the Money equally. The Prisoner was concerned in this, and in several other Robberies: He sent up his Confession from Ipswich to London, not knowing that I had made an Information.</p>

            . I bought the Watch on the 21st of March, which Mr. Reynolds was robbed of; and the next Morning I saw an Advertisement at the Coffee-House, in which the Watch was described; upon which I carry'd it to him, and he owned it. Neither the Prisoner nor the Evidence, was the Person I bought it of. The Man who brought it to me had the same Coat on, or one very much like that which the Accomplice has on now. 'Tis an old String Watch, and goes but twelve Hours: The Movement not being worth a Farthing, I gave 12 s. for it, which was 2 s. more than the Worth of the Silver. The Fellow brought it to me about Ten o'Clock in the Morning, and asked me two Guineas and a half for it: He told me he bought it at Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and had paid so much for it there. After I had paid him the Money, he said, - Sir, if my Brother wont take this Money for it, you'll let me have it again? Aye to be sure, says I: So he went away, and came back again to me, and said, his Brother did not chuse to take that Money: Upon this I gave him the Watch, and took my twelve Shillings again. After this, he brought it to me again, and said, - Sir, you are a very honest Man, I have been with it to a Watch-maker in Whitechappel, and he will give but half a Guinea for it: So I brought it you again. There were three other Men at the same time hanging over my Show-Glass; if I had known them, I could have taken them all together.</p>

            . The Prisoner, on the 5th of June, came to me, and told me, That his Wife was murdered, and that he had stabbed her in the Breast with a Knife, and that she was dead. I asked him if his Wife was dead? He said yes, and lay dead on the Floor. He told me, he was eating a Piece of Bread and Cheese, and held his Knife against his Breast; with the Point outwards, and she flew at him in a violent Passion, and stabbed the Knife into her Breast. I asked him what Knife she was killed with? And if it was with the Clasp-Knife which he carried in his Pocket? He said, no, it was with a Butcher's sharp-pointed Knife with a white Handle, or an Ivory Handle, and he could not find the Knife, nor half a Crown which she had in her Pocket. He seemed to me to be very much in Liquor, and was all over bloody. There was a large Patch of Blood on his Back, and another on his right Leg. I told him, he had either been doing Murder, or had been fighting, and he told me he had not been fighting, - his Wife was murdered. I went with him to the House where he lodg'd, and asked the Man of the House where the Prisoner's Wife was? He told me, she had not been at Home all Night; why says I, her Husband tells me she is murdered, and lies dead upon the Floor. The Prisoner then told the Man, that his Wife lay dead upon the Floor, but the Chamber-door was lock'd, and the Prisoner either would not, - or could not find the Key; so we got a Ladder, and set it up to the Window, and a little Boy went up, and look'd in, and said, - she was dead upon the Floor. After this I went up, and found it true. I observed the Skin was off his Nose, and off some Part of his Eye-brow.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire he may be ask'd, how long he imagin'd the Woman had been dead?</p>
               <p>Wilsted. She seem'd to me not to have been long dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you desire me to go off, and I said I would not, but would go with you, and stay till a Constable came, because I knew myself innocent?</p>
               <p>Wilsted. Yes; I did advise him to go off, and I believe it would have been better for him if he had; but he insisted upon taking a Trial for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ask him for the Key of the Room?</p>
               <p>Wilsted. Yes; and he either would not, or could not produce it; but it was produced before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If the Key had been found, they could not have got into the Room; for there's an Iron Bar, which runs cross the Back of the Door, and when the Door is shut, and that Bar not taken off, (which falls into a Hook) no one can get in, but through the Window.</p>

He was so much in Liquor, that he had like to have fallen down in attempting to sit: A Neighbour that was then in the House told him, if he would go home, she would go with him, which he agreed to, and his Wife, and he, and the Woman went home together. Sometime after this, the Deceased came down Stairs again, and went to the White Horse in Baldwin's Gardens for two Pots of Beer, which were carry'd up to their Lodging. I saw no more of them till next Morning, and then, after the Boy that went up the Ladder had told us the Woman was dead, I went up, and found the Deceased on the Floor; the left Side of her Forehead was blue, there was a little Mark on her right Temple, and a Stab above her right Breast, and her Fingers were all bloody.

The Deceased desired my Wife to get the Prisoner home; accordingly she led him home, and I follow'd them in four or five Minutes. The Prisoner asked me to stay and sup with him; I refused, and he said, - then I should drink with him, and he would have sent for two full Pots of Beer, but I oppos'd it; then the Prisoner storm'd at the Deceased, stamping with his Feet in an angry Manner, and bid her fetch him Half a Pint; the Deceased ran in great Haste, and fetched half a Pint of Gin and we drank a Dram a-piece out of a broken Tea Cup: There was a Quarter of a Pint left in the Bottle when we went away.

            . I am a Lodger in the House where this Thing happen'd: I saw the Prisoner and the Deceased come Home together between Eight and Nine in the Evening: Mrs. Slackman led him Home, for he was very much in Liquor. They had not been long at Home, before I saw the Deceased go out for Half a Pint of Gin, and a Half-penny Candle, and I saw no more of them till Ten o'Clock at Night, and then I saw him, with a Stick in his Hand, carry out his Child, which was dropp'd that Night near my Daughter's House.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old was the Child?</p>
               <p>Shields. About Six Years old.</p>
               <p>Jury. What do you mean by dropping a Child of Six Years old?</p>
               <p>Shields. The Child did tell the People (who found it) where it lived. That Night I saw no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180012"/> more of him; but about Twelve at Night I heard the Bar of his Chamber-Door fall, and the Door shut, and I heard somebody go out of the Room. The Reason I have to believe it was the Prisoner who went out, is this; I heard his Voice when he got in at the Window by a Ladder at Eleven o'Clock, which was an Hour before I heard somebody go out of his Room, and at Twelve I heard the Bar behind the Door fall into the Latch, and somebody went out. The next Morning I met him coming up Stairs; he was then not sober, and as I pass'd him upon the Stairs, I saw the Calf of his Leg bloody, and the back of his Coat. The Child was dropp'd in St. Clement's Parish (in the Strand) and was brought before the Justice when the Prisoner was examined by him. This is the Shirt that was taken from him.</p>

            . The Prisoner and the Deceased came home that Night, (I think) pretty much in Liquor. I lodge in the same House, and not haveing been well, I had taken a Sweat, and went pretty soon to Bed. My Room is over the Prisoner's, and between Nine and Ten, I heard a Noise in their Room, but not a Noise with Talking, - no Noise of Murder, nor any Groaning, but a Thumping about. There were two or three great Bumpings, which made my Bed shake under me, and I thought the Things upon the Shelves in my Room would have been shook down. I supposed they were fighting, for they were given to quarrel, but I never had any Concerns with them, and I thought 'twas no Business of mine. Sometimes they would quarrel, and sometimes they'd be good Friends. When the Man was sober, he'd be pretty well, - when he was drunk, he'd abuse every body, and she was a very passionate Woman. I did not see the Prisoner after this, (Noise,) till next Morning, and then he had confess'd, and had brought People home with him, The Woman was kill'd, - I saw; but I did not kill her, and I have no more to say.</p>

            . The Morning after the Murder, I was standing at my Door about Eight o'Clock, and saw the Prisoner and Mr. Wilsted come by. I took him to be a Constable, and imagined there had been some Quarrel among the Lodgers. I saw Wilsted go in, and the Prisoner stood at the Door: I having some slender Knowledge of him, he beckon'd to me; I went to him and he took me by the Button, (of my Coat,) and said, - She's dead! Who's dead, said I! My Wife, said he! God forbid, said I! 'Tis true, reply'd he, and she lies weltring in her Blood, - You'll come and give me a Pot when I am in Newgate. I took the Prisoner to be a quiet peaceable Man. I am sorry I have so much to say against him.</p>

            . The Prisoner has lodged in my House about 16 or 17 Months. I have often heard him and the Deceased quarrel - by way of Words; but I never saw them fight. She once, indeed, had a black Eye; but how she came by it, I can't tell. On the 4th of June, I saw the Prisoner go out early in the Morning, and I saw him no more that Day, till he was led home by a Woman, very much in Liquor, and his Wife walk'd before him. A little after Nine (the same Evening) he came down Stairs into my Shop, with his Child, and said, Landlady, - Shall I leave my Candle upon the Counter? I ask'd him where he was going at that time o'Night with the Child? He said, he was going to carry the Child to its Mother, who was at the Child's Aunt's, and he was then going to her. I desired him not to stay, for I should shut up Shop at Eleven, and he told me, he should return immediately.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did he appear, when he came down with the Child?</p>
               <p>Miller. Very brisk; - but he was in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you know that his Wife was then at Home?</p>
               <p>Miller. No; I did not know but she might have gone out again. About Eleven he return'd, and took his Candle; I ask'd him, what he had done with the Child? He told me, he had left it with his Wife, and asked me if I had any Key that would open his Door; - for he hadleft the Key of his Room, (he said) with his Wife. I told him I had no Key that would do; so he got a Ladder, and set it up against the Window, and went in; He was then in Liquor, and I was afraid he would have tumbled; for he work'd the Ladder among the Sugar-Loaves at the Top of the Window, and I was forced to hold it, left it should tilt. When he got to the Top of the Ladder, he threw up the Sash, and tumbled in at the Window, Head over Heels; which made the Neighbours laugh, and say he had got a Fall. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180013"/> I went in Doors, my Husband said, - 'twas a little odd that his Wife should be gone, and his Child gone, and that he should get in at the Window; I am afraid he has some Design to rob the Lodging (for it was ready furnished); I told him, we would go to Bed, and I would keep awake. About Twelve, or a little before, I heard his Door go, and somebody come out of his Room, and open the Street Door, and go out; upon which I got up, and fasten'd it, that he should come in no more that Night. I heard no more of him 'till next Morning, when he came with Wilsted (the first Witness), and then a Woman got in at the Window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I had been out with my Wife the best Part of that Day, on some Affairs of her own, and we went to several Places, where we drank pretty much: Between Eight and Nine in the Evening we came home, as the Witnesses have said. That Man's Wife, ( Slackman's ) came Home with me, and he followed. I ask'd him to stay and sup with me upon some Roast-Beef, which we had had for Dinner on Sunday: He refused, and then I press'd him to drink, but he would not: May be, says I, you don't chuse to drink Beer; fetch me, says I, (to my Wife) Half a Pint of Geneva; she did, and had like to have tumbled down Stairs at the same time. When Slackman and his Wife were gone, I told my Wife she had drank a great deal, and she had better eat something. No, - she would not eat, but would have another Dram: Won't it be too much for you? No, she said, She'd drink t'other Dram, and would then go to Bed. Well, says I, if you wont eat, I and the Child will. The Child would have Bread and Cheese; so I cut a Slice for it, and another for my self. She was then standing at the End of the Table; I was standing at some Distance from it, and we were talking together, without Passion. At last she began to mention a Difference she had had with one of the Witnesses, and I was for mitigating the Matter; upon which she grew uneasy, and I seeing that, said, Well, we'll omit talking of this till To-morrow. I stood, my Lord, in this Posture - 'tis my usual Posture, with my Knife in one Hand, resting on my Breast, and my Bread and Cheese in the other, - 'tis my usual Way of standing - I saw her Countenance change, and bid her go to Bed, but she stepp'd forward, and fell like a Lump of Lead upon me, and her Head came under my Chin. She was a short Woman, and my Knife took her just above her Stays; had I been farther from her, she would have fallen on her Face. 'Twas about 10 o'Clock when she fell on my Knife and after that, I carry'd out my Child.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Child produced before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, it was before Mr. Poulson, but it is not seven Years old. - After my Wife had received the Wound, she fell from me; I withdrew the Knife, and put it into the Sheath, and clapp'd it into the Bosom of my Waistcoat. She fell from me on her Temple, and I clapp'd my Hand to her Mouth, and found she was dead, without either a Sigh or a Groan. As she fell, her Cloaths flew up to her Head, so I laid her strait, and then the Child crying out, - O my Mammy! - my Mammy! I took him up in my Arms, and carry'd him to my Brother's Door, in Arundel street, where I knock'd at the Door, and left him, before any body came to the Door, because I did not care any of the People there should see me. When I left the Child at the Door, I told him, I would only go and get a Pint of Beer, and then would come to him again. Then I went home, and got a Ladder, and having got in at the Window, I took what Money there was in the Room, and went out again. Then I went to the Watch-house, and told them what had happen'd, but they would not take me into Custody, but bid me go home to Bed. I rambled about all Night very unneasy, and could not rest: Had I had any Mind to have escap'd, I could have gone down to Gravesend, and have got Employment, but knowing myself innocent, I resolved to take a Trial. After this, I bought me a Shirt, and went to Mr. Wilsted's, and told him what had happen'd; and I desired him to go home with me, and acquaint the People of it, and that an Officer might be got to apprehend me: He advis'd me to get off, but I would not; I went with him, and waited till I was took into Custody. I never us'd her ill, nor gave her Blows; - 'tis my Nature to be quiet with all who will be quiet with me. I did not drink a Drop of the Geneva that was sent for, and what was left of it, was found by those who went into the Room. Beer is what I like at all Times.</p>
               <p>Jury. One would think it more natural for the Prisoner to have dropp'd the Knife, after the Accident, than to have put it first into the Sheath, and then into his Bosom.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180014"/>Prisoner. It was as quickly put there as any where.</p>
               <p>The Surgeon was call'd, but Mr. Poulson's Clerk inform'd the Court, that he was subpaena'd to Westminster upon a Trial there.</p>

When I got first acquainted with him, he had a Habitation at Coventry; that was in April three Years ago, but he was personally in London, for he had kept an Inn at Country, and came up to Town, because he could not carry on his Business in the Country any longer, and he employ'd me to go down there, and sell off his Goods. When I got to Coventry, I found most of his Goods were detain'd by his Creditors, the rest I and his Wife sold. I staid there 17 Days, and at my Return to London, I found him in Cold-Bath Fields; he came down once to Coventry, while I was there, but he did not stay above Half an Hour, for fear of being arrested.</p>
               <p>Counc. Give an Account what Discourse you had with him, with Relation to this Business.</p>
               <p>Carter. I had no Discourse with him, till I came to London: He had then 130 l. due to him, and from the Time of his coming to Town, to his receiving this Money, we had frequent Conversation about diminishing the Coin. The first Time I saw him was at the Duke's Head in St. John's Square; he sent for me thither about selling his Goods; but when he received his Money, he liv'd in the Broad Sanctuary, Westminster: He liv'd first in Cold-Bath Fields, then upon Saffron-hill, then at Westminster, and afterwards at Hoxton. As soon as he received this 130 l. - he and I were to go Partners in diminishing the Coin; and accordingly he went about taking a House for that Purpose in December 1736, and did take one in the Broad Sanctuary, after he had received the Money. At that Time he owed me five Guineas, and I went to his House there, and asked for him; he was not at home, but I saw he had provided Charcoal and three or four Crucibles, I saw them in his Lodging, up two Pair of Stairs; one of the Crucibles had been used: They are to melt Gold and Silver in, in a Charcoal Fire; common Coal will do, but Charcoal will do it sooner. I went from his House to the Stable yard, near the Abbey, to look for him, and there I found him at an Alehouse, where we talked about our Design of filing Guineas: I let him into the Affair, and desired him to pay me the five Guineas he owed me. Two or three Days afterwards, I went to him again, and he told me, he had found out my Method of doing it, but he could not do it as well as I; he told me likewise, that he had try'd the Liquor, Aqua Regis, but he could not make that do; then he took me up Stairs, and shew'd me how he could do them, and he fil'd two or three Guineas and an 18 s.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180015"/> Piece in my Presence. This was the latter End of January 1736-7.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Quantity did you commonly take from a Guinea?</p>
               <p>Carter. We commonly took a Shilling a-piece from them.</p>
               <p>Counc. Had you a Vice to put them in?</p>
               <p>Carter. To hatch them afterwards we had. I met him once afterwards, but I did not see him work.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then you don't put it into a Vice to file them?</p>
               <p>Carter. No: He held it in his Hand, while he fil'd it, and placed a Sheet of Paper under it, to catch the Dust that fell. There might be about 18 Grains taken off from the three Guineas, which I saw him file, and when he had filed them, he put them into a Vice, and edg'd them. He fil'd them with a Bastard File, and edg'd them with a three square File, both which he procur'd himself. One File is enough to last three Months, and a great deal longer.</p>
               <p>Counc And in what Manner were they done?</p>
               <p>Carter. Very badly: But after he had fil'd them, he wrapped up the Dust, and then we went to the Fountain, in King-street, where I told him his Method would not do, and that I could not put off any of them, for his Edging did not at all imitate a regular Mill. Some have been done so well, that no one could discover them, but the Work upon these was not like Milling. The Edging was not close enough, nor at regular Distances. After this, he solicited me to come and improve him: I told him, if he would give me the five Guineas he owed me, I would come in a few Days, and improve him. But I thought he intended to be a Villain to me, so I parted from him, and saw him no more, till I li't of him in Monmouth-street: Then he told me he was going to live in the King's-Bench, and I afterwards saw him, within the Rules, in the Mulberry Garden. I have been up Stairs in his House at that Place a great many Times, and have often seen him file Guineas there. The first Time I was there, I saw him file five or six, and he had improved himself very much.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did he or you make use of these Guineas after he had filed them?</p>
               <p>Carter. Yes: He gave me half a Crown out of the Money he had got by his Filings, and then we went to an Inn, at the End of St. George's Fields, and had a Pint of Wine; and from thence we went to the Three Queens and drank again, and after that, we drank at the Ship, in St. George's Fields, and at a House by the Falcon Stairs, at which Places we put off the Guineas when we paid our Reckoning</p>
               <p>Counc. What did he do with the Dust?</p>
               <p>Carter. I can't tell: I told him I sold mine at one Mr. Carpenter's, a Refiner, in Foster Lane, and that I always put a Bit of Copper, or some other Metal into it, to disguise it, and that the Refiner should not find it Standard.</p>
               <p>Counc. When did you see him last before you surrendered?</p>
               <p>Carter. About three or four Months before. The last Time I saw him, was at the Duke's Head in St. John's Square. The Advertisement in the Gazette encouraged me to surrender, and so I sent a Letter to Mr. North, and he came to me the next Day, or the Day after, and I surrendered myself, and was in Custody ten or twelve Weeks. The first Time I saw Mr. North, I impeached the Prisoner. The Advertisement was read which was published in the Gazzette, of Tuesday October the 24th, 1738.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him who hired him to go down to Coventry.</p>
               <p>Carter. He hired me, and gave me a Note of his Hand, before I set out. One Dowth brought me first acquainted with the Prisoner, because he thought me the properest Person to sell off his Goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. I am the Person mentioned in the Gazette, to whom the Persons advertised were to surrender. In August last, a Person came to me, and said he could help me to Carter, and I gave him Encouragement to do so. At length I received two or three Letters from Carter, expressing his Desire to come and make a Discovery and upon this I went into an Alley, in Moorfields, and there I found him, and he told me the whole of the Affair, much in the same Manner as he has done now. He mentioned the Houses where the Prisoner had lived, and where he had filed Guineas. I sent Mr. Sandell to see if he could find out the Prisoner, but he was gone off, and I heard nothing of him, till he was taken at Bath.</p>

I know nothing of the Prisoner, before he hired a House of me, in the Stable-Yard, at Westminster; he lived in it about a Fortnight, and did not seem to me to follow any Employment, but to have been a Man under Misfortunes, and Bailiffs, (as I thought) used to be after him. He begged of me to let him leave the House. I keep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180016"/> a publick House within three or four Doors of that which he took of me, and I have seen Carter with him several Times at my House, - two or three Times in the Fortnight. I never observed him to sit up o'Nights, and I have been in his Room above Stairs, - not in his Bed-chamber, - and I never saw any Charcoal there. Indeed, two or three Days after he left the House there was a buzzing about, of his being a Coiner, or that he followed some such Matters. The people talked likewise about Carter, for he had been with him, (as I understood) at several other Places.</p>

Pieces: I was backward behind the Skittle-Ground, so she called me to the Prisoner, who immediately cry'd - Your humble Servant, Mr. Rogers. I don't know you, said I; but I know you, said the Prisoner. - Can you give me Silver for some Gold? I told him I would, if the Money was good; so he put down eight Guineas, and a 3 l. 12 s. Piece upon the Table; I took up four of them, and one of them was so rough it prick'd my Fingers: Hey! hey! said I, what's the Meaning of this! What Tricks have you been at here! I put on my Spectacles, and view'd them; Why this is rascally Work, said I; some slovenly Fellow did this, I could have done it better myself - some of them were filed into the very Letters. Is not the Gold good, said the Prisoner? I told him I believed it was. Do you apprehend I did it, said the Prisoner? No, said I, not in such a publick Place as this; if you had, I would have apprehended you, - and I wish I had done it then. There was one Guinea dated 1732, which was as fresh as if it had but just come out of the Mint, and that poor Piece was mangled deeper than any of the rest. Friend, said I, to the Prisoner, give me leave to go and weigh these four Guineas, for he had took up all the rest, while I was looking at these. He told me, I might weigh them with all his Heart; so I went to Mr. Gregory, the Tobacconist, he had Grains and other Weights, but he had no Guinea Weight; therefore he put his Hand into the Drawer, and took out 50 or 60 Guineas, and weighed these Guineas against several of his. Three of the Prisoner's Guineas wanted Six or Eight Grains, and the new Guinea would not do at all; Mr. Gregory's went down bump against it. Upon this Mr. Gregory came with me to the Prisoner, and ask'd him if the Guineas were his? He told him they were; then Mr. Gregory weigh'd them before his Face - Well, says the Prisoner, may be they are too light, - but they are good Gold - I took them of Sir

Why, says Burden, you are my next door Neighbour, and you know how to use Charcoal, - I have seen a good deal go into your House. The Prisoner then told us he had a sick Child, and the Charcoal was to air the Room; Burden, after this, pulled out a Crucible, and asked him if he knew how to use that? The Prisoner said, - No; he did not know the Use of them; and, after a good deal of Talk, he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180017"/> us it would be a good natured Action to give him his Money again, and would prevent a great deal of Trouble both to him and me. Well, says the Gentleman, if you'll produce any one Guinea out of the Parcel in your Pocket that is Weight, you shall have them again. No, no, hold there, says the Prisoner, - you have got enough already. We told him again, he should go free, if he could produce one Guinea that was Weight, But he made so many Entreaties, that at last I gave him his Money again, and let him go about his Business. Some time after this he had the Assurance to serve me with the Copy of a Writ for Defamation, and he trump'd up Evidence against me for Perjury, and brought an Action against me for giving him his Money again.</p>

I called there between Three and Four in the Morning, for a Pint of Beer, and the Prisoner being standing at the Bar, with the Landlord of the House, I ask'd her to drink. She said, she did not care if she did; so she drank Part of that Pint, and then I called for another, and she drank Part of that too. When the second Pint was out, I gave the Drawer a Shilling, and he gave me Nine-pence out of it. In the mean time a Man came in and sat down in the Box with her, - I suppose he was one of her Gang, - and he told me he would spend a Penny with me, for a Pint of Twopenny. The Prisoner was then in the Inside of the Box, with the Fellow, and I was on the outside. He threw down his Penny on the Table, and I pulled out my Money, to take a Penny to put to it. Upon which she flung her Hands about my Neck, and said, - my Dear, you shall feel me; and at the same time she switched three Shillings out of my Pocket, and flung herself that Minute from me. I told her she wanted to pick my Pocket, and I looked to see what Money was there, and missed three Shillings. I charged her with taking my Money, and put my Hand down her Bosom to see if it was there but it was not. Then I turned her round in the Box, and said, - before you go, I will have my Money, or Satisfaction. She immediately sat herself down, and pulled out a Box, like a Tobacco-box, and opened it; there was about fifteen or sixteen Shillings in it; and she asked me if that was my Money? After this she stooped, and shifted some down by her Side, and then she cry'd, - now<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173907180019"/> damn you, - you Son of a Bitch, - I will go with you to the Compter, and away she went to the Poultry Compter (a little before 5 o'Clock) and rapped at the Wicket; the Door was presently opened, and she was let in, but they shut me out. There happened to be a Man at this Time sitting at the Compter Gate, and I desired him to go for my Brother: He came to me, and then we knocked at the Gate, and asked for the Woman; they deny'd her, but in the Morning we got her out, and took her to Wood street Compter; and as we were going along, she took out her Box, with the Money, and said, - here you Son of a Bitch, here's your three Shillings again, - I believe you want a Shilling more than I do, and I'll give you another Shilling to take it, and she up with her Fist and gave me such a Stroke on the Face, that she swelled up my Eyes.</p>

            . The Prosecutor sent a Watchman for me, about Five o'Clock in the Morning, and I went directly to the Poultry Compter, where I found him keeping Guard, lest the Woman should be let out. He told me she had picked his Pocket of three Shillings and some Half-Pence. I asked the Turnkey what Time they let People in, to visit the Prisoners. He told me at Six o'Clock. Why, says I, this Woman came in without a Constable, and 'tis not half an Hour past Five now: You let People out to go a robbing; the Woman is in the Gaol, and and I must look for her. He said he would not look for her, and bid me get in, and look for her myself; and be damned; I searched, and could not find her; then I said I would complain to the Sheriff. D - mn it, he did not care if I did, and one Fellow was going to strike me. After this, we search'd for her again, and at last we found her in the Prison, a-bed with a Man. When we had got her out, she said, - now, damn you, what do you want with me, you foolish Dog, - you can only return me to the Place where you found me, - you can only send me home again, no, my dear, said I, you sha'n't go home again, we'll move you to Woodstreet Compter. As we were carrying her thither, she would go cross Honey Lane Market; O, said I, I find you know the nearest Way thither too; and when we were got into the Market, she pull'd out her Box, - Here, - you poor Dog, said she, I know you want Money, - here's your three Shillings again, and a Shilling more for you to take them, and I will go about my Business. No, my Dear, said I, you shall not go. Why, said she, you don't know, you foolish Dog, what you're about, I let my - out to be bowl'd at, and you are to be one of the Bowlers: And when we got her near Sir William Biller's Office, she struck Wheeler in the Face, and gave him a black Eye.
