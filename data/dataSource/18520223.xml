I have seen these furs produced; these rabbit skins are my own, there musquash skins are Mr. Barnard Muller's, a furrier in Aldersgate-street; they were sent to me to dye. I know nothing of Marley—Butler had been in my employ about nine months—he must have known there were rabbit skins kept in that place—these were taken from the warehouse—previous to 7th of Feb. these had been deposited in the pasting room on the first-floor—these were taken from the pasting room—my resi<lb/>dence is half a mile away—I did not go and see the wall broken—I did not miss any skins, but we found fifty-five dozen that were sent down on the 5th—they were in one bag, and they were gone; and sixty-five or sixty-six dozen of wild, and sixty dozen of tame rabbit skins—they were all brought, with the exception of seven or eight skins.</p>

I know the prisoner—I have employed him as an engineer—he put me up a steam engine and boiler, and did other things in a printing-office which I was establishing—part of the arrangement was, that he was to be paid with a bill at nine months—when the hydraulic press was put up he applied to me for a settlement, and stated that a nine months' bill was too long a date for him to use, and requested me to give him one at six months on his undertaking to extend the credit at the proper time when it became due—this bill became due in Nov., he applied to me for it some time in May—in Dec. I had occasion to see him on this business, and I said I did not want the whole of the bill used, and gave him a six months' bill, falling due about 29th or 30th Nov. or 1st Dec.—on 2nd Dec in the morning I received a draft from him for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accepted—the amount of the first bill was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it was renewed to the amount of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accepted his draft for that sum on 2nd Dec., at two months date—it has been paid—it was dated the 1st, accepted on the 2nd, and fell due on 4th Feb,—this is not ray ac<lb/>ceptance (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>)—but it is so close an imitation of my writing that I should not have known it myself unless the other had been paid previously—I did not authorise the prisoner to draw two bills at any time—I never gave him more than one bill for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this is not it—this bill was not written by my authority.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in addressing the Jury, urged upon them that they could not find the prisoner Guilty, unless they were satisfied that the forging or uttering of the bill in question was accompanied with an intent to defraud, which, he submitted, was negatived by the prisoner's conduct, in endeavouring to meet the bill, and so preventing injury to any party. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in sum<lb/>ming up, directed the Jury, that if they were of opinion that the prisoner had either forged the bill, or uttered it, knowing it to have been forged, representing it to be genuine, although he might have intended to meet it before it became due, still they were bound, according to decisions of the Judges, almost as a matter of law, and also as a matter of common sense, to conclude the existence of an intent to de<lb/>fraud. Mr. Baron Alderson (in Reg. v. Hill, Moody's Crown Cases, p. 30), had told the Jury, that if they were satisfied that the prisoner uttered the bill, knowing at the time that it was a forgery, and meaning that the party to whom he uttered it should believe it to be genuine, they were bound to infer that he intended to de<lb/>fraud. Mr. Justice Patteson (in Reg. v. Cooke, 8 Carrand Pagne, 582) had held, "If the prisoner at the time he uttered this bill knew that the acceptance was forged, and meant the bill to be taken as a bill with a genuine acceptance upon it, the inevitable conclusion is, that he intended to defraud: that was the opinion of the Judges in a late case reserved for their consideration: there was an earlier case, of Rex v. James, tried before me at Gloucester, in which I did not lay down this proposition strongly enough, but the law upon the point is as I have now stated."Mr. Baron Parke had also held" a person is guilty of forgery, not withstanding he may himself intend ultimately to take up the bill, and may suppose that the party whose name is forged will be no loser: if in the present case you are satisfied that the prisoner knew this acceptance to be forged, and uttered it as true, and believed that the bankers would advance money on it which they would not otherwise do, that is ample evidence of an intent to defraud, and evidence upon which a Jury ought to act: it appears tha this bill has been since paid by the prisoner; but that will make no difference, if the offence has been once completed at the time of uttering." The result of those opinions amounted to this, that if a man forged or uttered a bill, intending that it should pass as a genuine bill, without informing those to whom he passed it, that it was not genuine, then, in the very act of uttering it he would be guilty of uttering it knowing it to have been forged; and the law and common sense together would bind the Jury to come to the conclusion that he intended to defraud, although it was, of course, in their power to come to a different result.</hi>

I was in the counting-house, at the further end of the shop—the prisoner came in and stood still—I beckoned to him to come forward, and asked what he wanted, he said, "Have you any plated studs at half-a-crown a set?"—I said I did not keep such things—I saw he had a set of studs in his shirts—he went back making a noise with his feet rather louder than ordinary—he went back with a firm step, as if he was going out, and I turned to my writing again, thinking he had gone out—I continued writing four or five minutes; presently I heard a sound of something falling in the shop—I instantly went, and found the prisoner at the end of the counter, which is open at both ends—he was close to the window—I said, "What are you doing here?"he replied, after some little hesitation, "I beg your pardon, I thought you were coming to serve me"—I said, "Why you know I told you I had not got the article, what are you doing?"—I looked in the till to see if anything was missing—I did not look in the window where the rings were—I had nobody in the place with me, and after some hesitation, thinking possibly I might be mistaken, as he had a respect<lb/>able appearance, I asked him his name and address—I forget the name he gave, but he said he lived at 3, Bishopsgate-street—I gave him a caution—I said, "Well, be off, and do not come here again"—I have not the slightest doubt he is the young man—he stood before me some time with the full gas light on his face—when he was gone I thought I would see what it was that made the noise, and I found a diamond ring on the floor in a corner where he had been standing—it had been in a tray in the window—I looked in the window and found the large diamond rings gone—the tray had the prices on it, that could not be removed, the gas branch prevented the window being opened, so as to draw the tray out—it was shut in a glass window—we unlock the windows in the morning, and lock them at night—the middle one opens side<lb/>ways, and the other pushes to—I found it a little open, but I did not think much of that, because sometimes we let a little air in when the gas is alight—I missed from the tray eleven rings, the prices of which were on little cards attached to the velvet, which were left behind—the trade price of the rings was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen them continually—I was not many minutes without seeing them in the course of business—there were two about an inch and a quarter in diameter, mixed up with smaller ones—I had been in and out in the afternoon—I had then been in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—my shopman had gone out with some gold chains to show—he came back in about an hour—I told him I had had a youth in, and he described him fully—I wrote a description of him, and sent it round to six of the chief towns of England, Birmingham being one—in the beginning of Nov. I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated 17th Nov., from the chief of the police of Birmingham—I went there—the superintendent took me round the prison—I saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>there, and immediately said, "You are the boy who was with me on 7th Oct."—he said, "All Oct. I was at my sister's at Kew"—this stud (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the description of stud which the boy wore, and which I described on the paper I sent down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Walton. I went out on this evening some time before half-past 5 o'clock, the rings were safe then; I returned a little after 6—the prisoner has been to the shop about half a dozen times in the three months before the robbery, always asking for plated studs, or mother of pearl buttons; he said nothing about the price till the last time, which was on 17th Oct. between 1 and 2, the day of the robbery, he came and asked if we kept plated studs—I said, "About what price?"he said, "Half a crown"—I said we did not keep them—I recognised him as having been in several times before, and spoke to him very sharply in consequence—he turned to leave the shop, and I went to my dinner; but as I did not hear the door close, I turned, and found him three parts of the way up the counter—he immediately pulled up short on his toes, as if he had been walking quietly, and said, "Can you tell me where I can get them, Sir?"—I told him he could get them lower down—this stud is exactly like the one he wore on that day—he generally came in different dresses, and always when no one was in the shop, about mealtimes—I was generally in the counting house.</p>

I saw a description in the route book, in which we send descriptions round by route; in consequence of which I communicated with Mr. Walton—I saw him when he came down—I saw the prisoner when he was apprehended and brought in on 1st Nov.—I said, "Oh! he is wanted in London for stealing diamond rings"—he replied, "I never was in London"—the turnkey said, "You told one of the officers that you went to the Exhibition"—he said, "Yes, I did go up once to see that"—he remained five days in my custody—I sent him somewhere else, and three months afterwards he was brought here—I got these two studs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the station to which the prisoner was first taken in Nov.—I placed them and his gold watch, and other things before him, and he said, "Give me my studs;" I said, "No; I must keep them, they are necessary to the case"—they exactly correspond with this other stud produced, and which was sent up by letter—when he was appre<lb/>hended, a gold watch and chain, a gold ring, these studs, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner. In Jan., 1850, I shipped as steward on board the bark <hi rend="italic">Alberta</hi>, at Liverpool—she was an English vessel, and sailed under English colours—Captain Benson, a Scotchman, was the master of the bark, and the shipping-agents at Liverpool were Messrs. Wilkie and Simpson—the prisoners shipped, as able seamen, at the same time that I did, and the deceased Peter Getland also—if I am not very much mistaken, he signed the articles next to me, or next to the cook; I know his name was very near first on the articles—Argenti went on board the vessel by the name of Berto Urgent; and we used to call Morati <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Frank Murray</hi>, and sometimes <hi rend="italic">Antonie</hi>—we left Liverpool on 30th Jan.—on 15th April, when we were nearing the American coast, there was a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> forward, between Morati, from what I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> first of all, and Peter Getland—they were fighting—I told the captain, who was at breakfast, and he and the mate came out of the cabin, and they and the rest of the men interfered to separate them—one of the men, I cannot say who, <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out that they had got their knives open—I saw Argenti interfering in the fight; and when some of them <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out that they had their knives, the captain ordered him to be brought aft—I think he was fighting with the rest of them, because they all interfered—I think he was fighting for Morati, as well as I could see—I think he had a stick in his hand, but I know he was fighting, and his mouth was bloody—the captain ordered both Argenti and Morati to be brought aft—they were brought aft, with a great deal of struggling—they were very obstreperous; we could not get them aft very well—I took a large knifefrom inside Argenti's shirt, and a smalt pocket-knife, what they call a <hi rend="italic">jack-knife</hi>, from Morati; and the prisoners were then made fast to the <hi rend="italic">mizen</hi>, by the captain's orders—the whole ship's company assisted in doing that—Getland assisted—they remained fast to the <hi rend="italic">mizen</hi> about an hour or an hour and a half—they then begged the mate's pardon, and said they would not do it any more, if he would let them go—the mate was Mr. Gordon Gold—he set them at liberty, at their request—the captain was asleep at the time—two days after that we were at anchor at Mobile Bay, which is on the coast of Alabama—we were about twenty-five miles from the town, and about five from shore either side—the captain went on shore on the evening of 16th, or morning of 17th—on the evening of 17th, about 10 minutes past 7 o'clock, the prisoners were sitting on the night-heads on the top-gallant forecastle, which is right for<lb/>ward, about six feet above the rest of the deck—Getland was sitting on the wind lass on the larboard side smoking—the windlass is on the deck, just abaft, and below the forecastle Getland was about six or seven feet under where the prisoners were—Getland was talking me about boarding-houses in Liverpool, and Argenti walked along theforesastle, came over his head, and caught him</p>

               <p>over the head with the sharp edge of the axe—Morati was just along side of him, not quite half a step back—the axe struck Getland close to the crown of his head—the wound was about six inches in length, and it penetrated to the brain, for I saw the brain on the axe—there was a great deal of blood flowed, and Wilson carried him aft—as soon as I gave the alarm Argenti made a blow at me with the axe—the proper place for the axe to be kept was in the galley—it belonged to the cook, and nobody used it, except the steward might take it to break a bone sometimes—there was no occasion for it on the forecastle—the prisoners then escaped into the foretop, and remained there all night, and with the ropes they made a sort of bulk-head, or battery, to prevent our getting at them—during the night a knife was thrown out of the foretop, I could not say by which of them—I did not see it thrown—I heard it fall, and it was picked up next morning—no one was in the foretop but the prisoners—it was my knife—we chased them out of the foretop, and asked them to come down, but they would not—a revenue-cutter came on board of us, and the captain of the cutter threatened to fire at them if they did not come down—he gave them five minutes, and then they came down—one of them, I think it was Morati, said they would come down for an American man, but they would not come down for a b—Englishman—one of them said they should only get about a month or so in America for killing a man—I think it was Morati said that; but it is so long ago, it has rather slipped my memory—they both speak English as well as any foreigners do; I think Morati speaks it best—Getland was taken on shore on the morning of 18th, and I did not see him again—this is the axe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, living in King-street, Cheapside. I was employed by the defendants' creditors to investigate the state of their affairs—I saw them both on 5th Nov.; they did not at that interview go into any explanation—I saw them, and they then stated that they had commenced busi<lb/>ness subsequently in Oct., 1850, with a capital of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that has been corrected since—I learnt from them, and from an examination of their books, what their debts were—I had conversation with them afterwards about it—I found that their debts were within a trifle of 5,492<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they represented nothing to me about their assets then—their stock was subsequently sold—it was valued at the cost-price as given by the bankrupts to an assistant of mine—that might have been tested by reference to the invoices—I did not test it; we assumed it to be correct—the stock sold for 1,026<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or thereabouts—that was 45 per cent, less than the alleged cost-price—there were goods at Mun<lb/>caster and Wane's, the pawnbrokers; that was not in addition to the stock-part of the amount of the stock consisted of goods at Muncaster and Warre's—they were stated at that time to amount to about 789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from which we deducted the advances made on the goods, amounting to about 546<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that left the available assets in the hands of Muncaster and Warre at about 832<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the bad debts ascertained at that time amounted to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found a sum of money unaccounted for; as far as we proceeded, allowing for losses upon certain sales they had made, there was about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unaccounted for at that time; the losses on sales as ascertained from them and their books was about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—under the bankruptcy these items have been corrected—they told me that they had sold to certain wholesale houses at a loss—the deficiency between the debts and assets was about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the domestic and trade expenses and money drawn out by the partners was about 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as then ascertained, but finding that the estate was going to bankruptcy we did not follow it out—I state that in justice to the prisoners, that they could not account for it further, we stopped there.</p>

               <p>—they explained the pledging to me—I could ascertain in the books what goods had been pledged, and what goods had been redeemed—I have ascertained since the bankruptcy, that the money received is entered under the words "Loan," and "Borrowed," and the redeemings under the word "Silk," and "Silkman"—from those two words I have been able to ascertain what goods were deposited, and what redeemed—I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that—the pledgings amounted to 1,624<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the redeemings to 1,105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the trade assignees sold the stock by private con<lb/>tract to a Mr. Myers, at 45 per cent, below the cost price—I did not test the cost price by the invoices, but I requested a creditor to go down and look at them—it would have been extremely difficult to test manufactured stock; parasols and umbrellas are made up of different things; I should have had to ascertain the cost price of the cane and silk, and the amount paid for labour—I believe the account the bankrupts gave of the cost price was generally correct—the stock was sold to Myers at 1,026<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods at Muncaster and Warre's were not included in that—the invoice price of the goods sold to Myers was 1,871<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as given by the bankrupts—I believe that included a quantity of cane that was on the premises—I found 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cane on the premises—I cannot tell when it was bought, or whe<lb/>ther it was paid for—that is included in the 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—there was house<lb/>hold furniture and fixtures, independent of the stock; that I valued at 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not aware at what price that was sold—I put a medium price, what it was worth as it stood there—there were also some pianofortes there, which with certain trade furniture, was taken at 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods at Muncaster and Warre's I valued at 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. above the advances—there was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods at Messrs. Pick ford and Roberts—they have stated the amount of goods pledged at about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in their balance-sheet, instead of 789<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bad and doubtful debts are taken at 335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the bankruptcy—the amount of trade and household expenses, and money drawn out by the partners was 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as then ascertained—it has been altogether altered under the bank<lb/>ruptcy—I have not made any inquiries myself since; I have not been at all employed under the bankruptcy, except to sell the stock—I put down about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for trade expenses; I believe Woolf drew out 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his private expenses, it was stated at 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and Mr. Lyons 359<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the application of it I do not know—Lyons has a family—the bankrupts gave me the names of the parties to whom they had sold at a loss, and guessed at the amounts; they did not refer at all to their books then—this is the list of the parties as they gave them to me (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), but I have ascertained that the losses there are greatly exaggerated—I did not refer to the books when they gave me that statement, to ascertain the profit or loss on each transaction—it has been ascertained from the books since, but not by me—I believe, under the bankruptcy, the loss has been ascertained at 1,360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the official assignees of the Court of Bankruptcy. I was appointed assignee in this case immediately upon the adjudication, and have since had all the bankrupts' books in my possession—I have been in communication with them from time to time—I ascertained from them that they commenced business on 12th Oct., 1850, and carried it on up to 19th Nov., 1851—from their balance-sheet it appears that Lyons' capital on commencing business was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Woolf's 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed—money borrowed is not capital, but debt—the stock-in-trade at the time of the bankruptcy was valued by the bankrupts at 2,038<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the surplus on goods in pledge at 332<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the umbrella sticks and pianos are included in the stock—there was also 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in outstanding bills in their hands, which they delivered upas part of their assets—they represented their good debts at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; doubtful debts, 215<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and bad debts, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no cash delivered up, either as being in their hands or at their bankers—the amount of creditors' debts due to parties is 5,476<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—that appears on their balance-sheet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want you to inform the Court how they account for the difference between 2,654<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. assets and the amount owing to creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Losses by goods' account, 1,701<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; sundry losses, 212<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>within 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that discrepancy arises from the creditors holding security for debts owing by the bankrupts to them, amounting to 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the property, as valued by the bankrupts, in the hands of those creditors, 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they put down in their balance-sheet 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the property was really worth—I cannot state when these losses on sales commenced, but taking the amount of the goods purchased, and from that deducting the amount of stock in hand, the loss would appear at 10 1/2 per cent, in the whole course of their dealing—their goods' account shows the price at which they purchased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You make that account after having investigated the whole of the hooks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the result of what they sold, what they manufactured, and what they bought—I took the cost price, the cost of manufacture, then the stock, and gave them credit for the expenses; and the general result of it was that during the whole time they carried on trade there was a loss of 10 1/2 per cent.</p>

               <p>was afterwards taken up by them in the beginning of the year—I made in<lb/>quiries of themes to their capital—Lyons had told me when Woolf joined him that Woolf had brought in some thousands of pounds—they wished to refer a party to me in Jan. for me to vouch for their respectability, and I told Lyons I could not, unless I knew what capital they had—I then asked him if they had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the business—his answer was, "Considerably over," and I gave them the reference they asked for—I told the party who was referred to us what they had said—we continued supplying them with goods after that—about that time I inquired of Lyons as to the amount of their capital, and he told me his partner had brought in some thousands of pounds and had more money, but he did not wish it to he brought into the business, as he, Lyons, did not wish to pay interest on Woolfs money—the amount they owed us in Feb., before the 17th, was 2,190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was only secured by their own acceptances, and not the whole of it—at that time they begged to have more goods, and we did not wish to increase the account; we told them we did not like to go any further—they then said there were certain bills running, we had no occasion to be at ait anxious about the account, the money was per<lb/>fectly safe; but if it would relieve our minds they would take up the accept<lb/>ances which were running—we took them two of the bills amounting to 711<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which they gave us a check, which was duly honoured—in the July following, as they had told me they were about taking stock, I said, "You have been taking stock, I hope it turns out to your satisfaction"—Lyons replied that it had turned out perfectly to their satisfaction, and they were in a better position than a good many men who held their heads a great deal higher than they did—the balance of the account at the end of July was 2,672<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and in Aug., 2,609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no Sept. account, it is all one with the Oct.—up to Oct. 16th here is a Balance of 2,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they applied for more goods afterwards, but we did not supply them—the last balance I have mentioned still remains unpaid—about a fortnight before the bankruptcy Lyons looked out goods to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but we said we should not supply him with them without security—we did not supply them—they said they had been trying to get security, but could not—they told us two or three times they had, but they had not; and on 4th Nov., they both came to us together and told us they must stop payment—I spoke to them about what they had told us about their stock-taking—I required to see the balance-sheet of their stock-taking in July last—Woolf brought the papers, and I found from them that there was 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency—I said they could not be much more deficient in the three months up to the present time, Nov.—they said they did not think they were, but they could not tell—on 10th Sept. we sold them four pieces of goods, amounting to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they must have been sold to Lyons, for Woolf never bought goods—to the best of my belief I sold them myself—I have seen two out of the four pieces at Muncaster and Warre's—they appear to have been pawned on the 12th—I next saw Lyons some days before 25th Sept.—he said he expected a buyer from Manchester, and requested me to send some goods on approbation; he said he would not buy them, but if he could sell any he would, and the rest he should return—on 25th, Fry, their clerk, came to the warehouse, and from what he stated we delivered him sixteen pieces of goods, value 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have seen seven of those pieces since at Muncaster and Warre's; they appear to have been pawned on 15th, 18th, and 20th Oct.—on 16th Oct. we sold the bankrupts a parcel of goods amounting to 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which I have since seen one piece at Muncaster and Warre's, which appears to have been pawned</p>

               <p>two days afterwards, the 18th—the defendants said they made the purchases for making umbrellas; they were umbrella silks, and were not fit for any other purpose—I should say we found somewhere about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of our property at Muncaster and Warre's, not made up into umbrellas, but exactly in the state in which it was sold by us—I was appointed trade assignee—I went over part of the bankrupts' stock at their shop, and saw what the character of it was—there were no umbrella silks at all there—a great portion of the stock was umbrella and parasol sticks and some little silk, a small portion of cane, and a variety of ivory and bone mountings, which were not very saleable—the value of the stock was certainly considerably less than that put on it by the bankrupts—I have not seen all the stock, but I went through all the items—I stand a creditor for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and odd.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">casting it up</hi>)—that is the total of goods sold to them; that, deducting for the debt, leaves 5,336<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—in Sept. last they took goods of us to the amount of 507<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they paid us in that month 845<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which we realised—in the month of Oct. they had about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods of us; and they paid us 282<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not on 23rd Sept call at their place for the express purpose of telling them that I had got some silks which I thought would suit them, and request them to give me a look down; that was about the time they asked me to send them some goods on approbation—I might have said I had goods that would suit them—I cannot say whether I called on them on 23rd Sept., but I was there within a few days of the 25th—I should say I did not request them to come and see the goods, I will not swear positively—when they asked me to send the goods to their buyer, I might have said I had goods to suit them—I swear I did not go and invite them to purchase goods, because the account was heavier than we wished—it is the course of our trade to go and ask for orders—Lyons did not come to me to see the goods, he sent his man, Fry, on the 25th, saying their buyer was in London, and he wished the goods sent down to look at them—I have not seen the buyer from Man<lb/>chester, or ascertained that he came for the goods—I swear that the order for the goods which Lyons' man came to see, was not in consequence of my going there to tell them I had some goods which I thought would suit them—it is usual for umbrella manufacturers to order their goods in the autumn for the spring season—I did not engage in the autumn of 1851, to supply the defendants with goods for the spring season to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they gave me an order for them, and I booked it—I have no minute of it here, but to the best of my recollection it must have been shortly after their stock<lb/>taking in Aug.—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods which Lyons came to our ware-house and looked out, was not a portion of the goods for which I had booked the order for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that, because when we book an order we put by the goods for the parties; we did not put by these goods, they were goods which we had not agreed to furnish, but which we had booked on order for—Lyons said the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of goods would do to come out of his order, but we declined to furnish him with them—I should say it was then for the first time that we asked for security—Lyons told me he thought I was quite right to have security, and he would endeavour to get it for me—I saw him again three or four times—the security was to be for about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with reference to the general account—he told me on two different occasions he</p>

               <p>had not found security; he did not come and tell me so, I went there—he came and told me if we insisted on security he must stop business, that was a day or two before the assignment—when they came to say they were insolvent, we sent for our attorney—I went to their warehouse that day, 4th Nov.—Lyons and Woolf went from our house, and I went with one of their clerks to take account of their stock—an attorney did not go with us, or join us there—there was no one there with the exception of our own servants, that I know of—Ellis and Everington's man was not there, he came in about an hour or an hour and a half after—I had not sent for him—our solicitor had sent a circular round by post, I think, to call a meeting for the next morning "I did not send a young man for Mr. Pawson—nobody made offers to pur<lb/>chase the stock while I was there—I saw Ellis's buyer there, I suppose he came to purchase goods in the usual way of business—I do not think Mr. Pawson's buyer was there; but I do not know him when I see him—I told the bankrupts it was quite right they should execute an assignment for the benefit of the creditors, which was done at Mr. Pawson's—the assignment was not there already cut and dried—I saw it executed; I was one of the trustees—I went from the bankrupts' warehouse to Mr. Pawson's, and met there Mr. Pawson and Mr. Howell, who is one of Messrs. Ellis's partners—I did not ask the bankrupts to sign a declaration of insolvency—Mr. Paw<lb/>son, Mr. Howell, the two bankrupts, myself, I think Mr. Partington, Mr. Parker, and one or two others werepresent—I cannot say whether the bank<lb/>rupts asked leave then to send for their attorney; they asked at our place, and our solicitor said he did not think there was any occasion for it at the present moment—they did not ask permission to do so, they asked if they should send for him—the bankrupts' stock was sold for 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being 45 per cent, less than the invoice price—the bankrupts never lent us money, they gave us a check for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off their account, which I said if they wished back again they should have; I will undertake to say it was not to pay wages—I cannot say, without referring, whether we returned it—the goods sent on 2nd Sept. were on approbation—I made out an invoice of them, and sent it with the goods; this is the approbation-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is an account of all goods which go out of the place—we have no other book for booking goods sold—when they are returned they go into this book, if they are sold; and if they are not sold they go in here, and afterwards they are copied or posted into another—the purpose of keeping this book is to enter goods sent out on approbation—it is not a book I have been referring to before.</p>

               <p>got here, I caused a man named Robinson to he taken into custody for this offence, and he was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey—he was a man on board the vessel—the prisoner had been looked out for previous to my arrival in England, and on my arrival I was on the look-out for him—I charged both him and Robinson with the offence—I found the prisoner last Thursday three weeks, in the parlour of the Mitre Tavern, at Woolwich—I called him by his name—he looked round at me, and said, "Is that you, George Rice, who was in the <hi rend="italic">Firebrand?"</hi>—I said, "Yes;" and I said, "How about the bills you robbed me of?"—he said, "Come outside, and talk to me about it"—I refused to go out, and gave him into custody—the half-note which I lost was the right hand half—it was the half without the "Five" on it.</p>

On Wednesday, 28th Jan., about half-past 3 o'clock in the morning, I went into the White Hart in the Strand with Mr. Jones, who is a friend of mine—there were about twenty people there; I saw Connor there—Mr. Jones took charge of my money—we stayed there till half-past 6, when we came out, and Mr. Jones called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, got into it, and from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window give me back my pocket-book and the money, which was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and eight sovereigns—the sove<lb/>reigns were rolled up in the note in the pocket-book, and I put the pocket-book into my coat side-pocket—I was not quite sober, but knew what I was about—I then went into the coffee-shop next door to the White Hart, and ordered some him and eggs—Connor then came in, told me he was hungry, and asked me if I would give him something to eat—I told him he might have the same as I was having—I then said I Wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Connor said he would fetch one—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was brought, and he was inside it when it came and the prisoner Watts was on the box with the caiman—I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and told the caiman to drive to St. Paul's Churchyard—I felt my pocket-book then safe—the caoman drove to St. Paul's Churchyard and stopped there; Connor immediately opened the door, jumped out, and told the caiman the gentleman inside would pay the fare—I got out, put my hand on my pocket, and immediately missed my pocket-book—I asked the cabman which way Connor had gone; he said he did not know, and said that Watts had gone off with him—I did not see Watts go, but the cabman is here—I then drove to the station and gave the charge.</p>

On the morning of 28th Jan., about half-past 3 o'clock, I went with Ritchie into the White Hart, and we remained there till half-past 6—Ritchie was somewhat intoxicated, but was well aware of what he was doing—I took his money from him, because I thought he was mixing with low company, and thought there might be pickpockets among them, and as I did not intend to mix with them I thought it would be safer with me—I left to go home at about half-past 6—Ritchie went with me as far as the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door, when he changed his mind, said he would not go, and asked me for his pocket-book—I gave him the pocket-book with my left hand through the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window, and the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and seven sovereigns and two half sovereigns with my right—I took the money out of the pocket-book to show him he had got it all—he put the money into his pocket-book, and I think he put the book into his pocket, but I cannot say certainly.</p>

I see you are; you have got my piece of paper in your hand;"that he then asked him for references to his character, and directed him to meet him at Osmond's Coffee-house on the morrow morning, which was Saturday, at 10 o'clock; that he went accordingly, on the morrow morning, and, as he was about to step into Osmond's Coffee-house, the party that he had seen at the Column the day before said, "You are behind your time," and asked him where he had been to, and said he had been waiting for him a quarter of an hour; he (Gerber) replied, "Not so long as that;" the party said, "I have; if you want busi<lb/>ness,</p>

               <p>you must be more punctual;" that he then gave him the check, and directed him to go and get the money for it, and the party who had given him the check walked after him sharply, and said, "Have you any bags to put the money in?"he replied, "No, but I have good pockets;" he told him if he wanted business he must be prepared with those sort of things, and gave him these two bags (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I found on him—Gerber was taken to the police-court, remanded till the Tuesday, and then discharged.</p>

This check for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a forgery—it is not my writing or my partner's, or written by our authority—it was brought to me on 20th Dec. by one of the clerks of the bank—on Friday, 12th Dec, the prisoner Kessler came to our shop, and requested change for some foreign money—he brought thirty-eight thalers and an American eagle or gold coin—I agreed to change them—they came to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in English money, which I laid on the counter—he then said he wanted to send the money to a party in the City-road, and he thought it would be too late for a Post-office order, and asked me which I thought was the best way to send it—I told him as it was too late for a Post-office order, he had better send it by a porter—he said that would be too much trouble, would I oblige him with a check—I said I would, and he threw a sovereign on the counter and told me to write the check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and make it payable to John Asch—I took the sovereign, took the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. difference, and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., keeping 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him a check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you a way of drawing checks under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. different from those of a larger amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I always join the last letter of the amount with the word "pounds," so that it should not be filled up for a larger amount, and in consequence of that I make a particular kind of "P"—I join the two letters together, so that the "eight" could not be altered to "eighty," or "nine" to "ninety"—I did so in the check I gave Kessler—if the check is for a larger amount than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is not my form at all—on the following day I received a letter, which I have not preserved—I do not know whose writing it was—on the Saturday the clerk of the London and Westminster Bank produced to me the check for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which 1 at once said was a forgery—our checks are numbered 6723; we have no checks of No. 6725, which is the number of the forged check—the form of the "P" in the forged check corresponds with my form of making the "P" when I draw under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we very rarely give checks under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of noticing that peculiarity in the check, I proceeded that same day to find Kessler—I went to many places—I went first to Castle-street where he formerly lived, and ultimately to the Cafe National in Cranbourne-street, where I found him—I asked him to tell me to whom he had sent the check that I had given him on Friday, the 12th, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had sent it to the Holloway-road, St. John's Wood—I asked him the number of the house—he said he did not put any number; there was no number put on the letter—I told him that when he obtained the check from me he said he wished to send it to the City-road—he said he thought not, that he was not quite certain whether it was the City-road, the Holloway-road, or St. John's Wood, but he thought it was the Holloway-road</p>

               <p>road—he seemed very much disconcerted by my questioning him, and asked me my motive for making these inquiries as to whom he sent the check—I told him that the check had been imitated, and one forged for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been presented at the London and Westminster Bank that day, and therefore it would be very important for his own character to let me know the party to whom he sent it—he said he would do so, that he would try if he could find out—he then told me how it was he came to send the check—he said he had re<lb/>ceived a letter demanding payment of the money—I then asked him if he had the letter directing him to send the money—he said no, he had destroyed it, he thought, he did not take care of it; he saw it was a demand for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he owed, and having sent it, he took no more care of the letter—he told me that the demand arose in this way, that a French gentleman seeing him change foreign money at his Cafe for one of his customers (he keeps the Café National) asked him to change some for him, and gave him some foreign money which came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that on examination he told his friend he had not English money to pay the gentleman 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the gentleman thereupon said it was of no consequence, he would take the money when he came again, leaving the French money in his hands—he did not come again, but wrote him a letter which he received on the Friday morning, stating that he was about leaving London for Paris, and he was to send him the amount in Post-office orders—I told him that it was very important that he should have kept that letter; I thought his mode of doing business was very careless, and begged of him to try and recollect to whom he had sent it, and I would call again on the Monday morning—this was on the Saturday—I went again on the Mon<lb/>day with Webb, the officer—Kessler said he had used all his endeavours, but he could not recollect where he had sent it; he had even borrowed a "Directory" to try if he could refresh his memory from that, and with that we left—I have never heard from him to whom he se'nt the check—I saw Gerber when he was discharged on 22nd at Marlborough-street—he said he knew the party by sight well that gave him the check, having seen him at the Argyll-rooms and different places of amusement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> On 22nd Dec. I went with Mr. Dean to Kessler's, 24, Cranbourne-street; it is called the Cafe National—I asked Kessler, in Mr. Dean's presence, if he did not go to his shop in Coventry-street on the 12th, with some German and French money, to get changed into English money—he said he did—Mr. Dean then said that Kessler came to his shop on the 12th, about 5 o'clock in the evening, stating that a gentleman had left some German and French money with him, requesting him to get it changed, and that it was alter post time, and would Mr. Dean oblige him with a check; I told Kessler to be particular, that it was necessary I should know to whom he sent the money, or to whom he directed it—he asked what was the matter—I told him that another check had been presented at the London and Westminster Bank for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was an exact copy of the check he had received from Selim and Dean on the 12th, and asked him to try and tax his memory—he said he did not know where he had sent it, whether he sent it to the City-road, St. John's Wood, or anywhere else—I told him that the check which he had told Mr. Dean the gentleman wanted immediately, was not presented for payment until four days alter—he did not make any remark to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that the evidence of this witness could not be received, (he being a party included in the charge,) unless he in the first instance pleaded guilty, or a verdict of acquittal was taken; he was not aware of any precedent for the course now taken; the rule of law in civil cases prevented a party interested in the result from being examined as a witness; that rule applied with greater force to criminal proceedings, and to such a case as the present, where the witness was directly interested in the result of the evidence he was about to give. See Reg. v. Hinks, 2 Car., and Kirwan, 462, and Reg. v. Arundel, 4 Cock's Crim. Cases</hi>, 260. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">called the attention of counsel to a passage from Lord Hale, quoted in Russell, which stated that a party jointly indicted with others need not be put upon his trial at the same time with them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DEARSLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in urging the same objection, thought that the force of the passage from Lord Hale would depend very much upon whether the word "trial" was to be taken in its limited sense to mean the mere trial of the issue joined, or whether it was to be taken as including the plea, the arraignment, and other proceedings connected with it; if the latter construction was to prevail, he contended that the witness having been arraigned, and having pleaded, he was actually upon his trial, and that therefore it was too late for the prosecution to use him as a witness unless a verdict of acquittal were taken.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that no objection upon the latter point could be sustained; the prosecution were clearly entitled to apply, as they had done, that the witness might be tried separately, and that application (not opposed) having been granted, it could not he said that the witness was upon his trial, the Jury not being charged with his case; with respect to the first point, it had now been settled for considerably more than a century, that it was no objection to the competency of a witness, that he, being an accomplice, had received an implied or even an express promise of pardon; he had no doubt therefore that the evidence was receivable. The witness was then sivorn, and examined as follows</hi>:) I have known the prisoner, Wagner, between twelve and fifteen months, or the utmost, might be eighteen months—I have been in the habit of meeting him at his own house, and at Kessler's, 4, Leicester-street, Leicester-square—that is a coffee-house, and there is a room up stairs for gambling—some time previous to this transaction, Wagner said he could show me a way to make money if I would bring him signatures of people—he said, "If you can procure me signatures from people, and people to send for money, I can make money, and you can get your part out of it"—for a time I did not bring him any, but afterwards he had some signatures through me—I do not know that he did any<lb/>thing with those signatures he received through me, he did not tell me; he said they would be made use of, but I have not heard anything of it—previous to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230055"/>
               <p>this check being presented at the London and Westminster Bank, Wagner said to me, "I shall receive a check from Kessler on which we will use the signature, and get 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. money on the name (of Selim, Dean, and Co.,) at the London and Westminster Bank"—he did not mention, the name at that time—I knew that was the name when I saw the check—he said, "I shall get a blank check, and it will be done very soon, and engage me a party who is going for the money"—I said I would try to get a person—he said there would be 10 per cent, to pay away from the money for the blank check, and the rest would be divided into four parts, of which Wagner was to have a quarter, the writer of the check a quarter, and the informant who brought the check a quarter (that was Kessler), and a quarter for the man who went for the money—he said I must make a bargain with the person who was going for the money, what he would give me, if I could get half, well and good, if not I must take what I could get—I was to have as much of the fourth as I could get, the more the better for me—Wagner said the man who was to go and get the money was to advertise in a newspaper for a situation, with his real name and place of abode, whereupon he would receive a letter to call at a certain place, at a certain hour, to meet with an engagement; alter that he would receive at that place a note which would appoint a place where to meet a gentleman who wished to engage him; but he should not mind that appointment as I should instruct him further, as it was only done to save him from trouble, in case he was taken up, by uttering the check—he said I must instruct him further to ask for Mr. Sims; after receiving the note I was to instruct him to call the next day, and take the check to a cer<lb/>tain place which I was to appoint—I have known Gerber several years; I saw him after I had this conversation with Wagner, and I told Gerber I had been ordered to get a man for a certain purpose, and if he would like to go for the money—he at first raised objections, but afterwards when I told him that I was instructed to telt him that the case was so arranged that in case he should be taken up nothing would happen to him, he was satisfied to go, telling me that he had no clothes to put on to appear respectable—I after<lb/>wards saw Wagner, and told him that I had got a man who would go for the money, but he had no clothes to put on, and was poor—Wagner said, "Cannot you give him a coat?"—I answered, "I have only got one, and that is a new one"—he told me to give him that coat, and I should get the money out of the amount that would be fetched, and he gave me at the same time 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give to Gerber to redeem his trowsers and waistcoat out of pledge—I gave the money to Gerber—I cashed this check for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the bank—I got it from Wagner—when he gave it me he asked me to get it cashed; I had seen it before at Wagner's—after Wagner had told me he would get a check from Kessler, he told me in case Kessler came to his house I was to leave the room, because Kessler would not like me to see it; because Kessler did not wish me to know he gave Wagner the check; he did not wish me to know him in the affair; that was before he gave me the check—Kessler came and I took my hat, said, "Good morning," and went out of the room—Kessler was with Wagner about half an hour, and then I was called back, but I cannot say whether it was by Wagner or the girl—when I got back Wagner showed me this check—he did not then give it me—I should say it was four or five days after that he gave it me, and I cashed it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">the advertisement</hi>) is my writing—I wrote it in the coffee-house for Gerber—I told him I had a copy from Wagner how to write out the advertisement—I took him to the coffee-house to write the advertisement himself which I put before him—I had the copy from Wagner how to write it out, but Gerber not being able to spell it properly I said, "I</p>

               <p>will write it for you myself, and you carry it there"—it was for the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> in Fleet-street—this is it—"As messenger or light porter, a young man twenty eight years of age, who writes a good hand, and has no ohjection to the country. Letters, post-paid, A.G. 34, Percy-street, Bagnigge-wells-road"—I gave that to Gerber, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it—I gave him the coat he has on now; I went with him to buy a hat, and he had a satin stock of mine—I made an appointment with him that he should meet me nearly oppo<lb/>site Osmond's coffee-house in the Strand, at 1 o'clock on Friday—that is the coffee-house where he was to ask for Mr. Sims, according to the letter, and I took him I believe on Thursday up the Strand to show him the house—Wagner told me to make an appointment with Gerber at a certain place which I was to choose, and inform Wagner where it was, and he would wait at a little distance and follow us to the bank—that was on the Saturday—I had made an appoint<lb/>ment with Wagner to meet him at his house on the Friday as usual—I met him at his house, 85, Long Acre, on the Friday about 11, and after 12, I am not sure what time it was, I left the house with him for the purpose of going to Osmond's coffee-house—we left the house going towards the Strand—I do not know the names of the streets where we passed, but I know there is on one side a very large urinary going up to Drury-lane—when we got near there the officer Jervis met us, and I told Wagner, "For God's sake there is Jervis coming! I had better go away," and I went away from him up the urinary—I knew Jervis—when I came up the Strand, at the corner of the Strand and that street, I met Gerber and took him into the Crown public-house, which I believe is opposite Osmond's coffee-house—Wagner said he was going to Osmond's coffee-house to leave the note there—while we were in the public-house we bad some pale ale and bread and cheese, and not long after, about 1 o'clock, Wagner came in and called for something, and I told Gerber, "Now it is time for you to go;" Wagner did not tell me where he had been to before he came there, but I noticed—I told Gerber it was time for him to go to Osmond's, as he would find a note there—Wagner had told me he was going to leave that note there—that was before I left in the morning—I went with Gerber at the door, to send him out—I told him as soon as he got the note to follow me up the street right opposite, the street that leads to Covent-garden market—I then came out opposite Osmond's, and turned back again to that street, and walked slowly on—I left Wagner in the public-house—he came after me, and passed me—he did not join me—he said, "It is all right; I have seen him; I am going home," and passed on—Gerber followed me, and I kept in advance of him till we came to Covent-garden, where I turned the corner sharp, and waited at the corner—when he came up I told him, not stopping with him, to meet me that night at my house—he met me at my house that evening, and I told him to call in the morning, I believe at 9 or a little after, at the Giant in Drury-lane—on the Saturday I went to Wagner's about 9, and he placed a check in my hands and some bags—this is the check he gave me (<hi rend="italic">the forged one</hi>), and these are the bags—hesajd, "You place that check in Gerber's hands, and tell him to go for the money; let him ask for ten twenties, and the rest in gold, and you show him the place, and I shall follow you," and the notes were to be taken to the Bank of England, to be changed, or to several money changers for foreign money, and he said that Gerber was to go first to the money changers in the Hay market, and get foreign money for part, and that if he got the money, after that he might know him, Wagner—he did not know him at all until they were placed together at the Mansion-house—Wagner had seen Gerber at the public-house—Wagner said that in case Gerber did not get the money he was to say that a gentleman had sent him, a dark gentleman</p>

               <p>with black whiskers, and some description, and to appoint a particular mark in his face, so that he should not be found, as he said they would take him about to look for the man who sent him—I went to the Giant to meet Gerber, and Wagner followed me—when I got to the Giant, Gerber was waiting opposite—I went in, and he followed me—he had some pale ale, and I placed the check and the bags in his hand, and walked on with him towards the Bank, Wagner following—Gerber went to the London and Westminster Bank—he had on my coat, which was a sort of mixture—when he went into the bank, me and Wagner were waiting outside—we were not together—we walked up and down the street, and into the square—once or twice he came over and spoke to me, and then we separated again—I saw a policeman go into the bank—I told Wagner, and We then left—Gerber was discharged from the police-court on the Tuesday—after that Wagner told me that I should not take the coat away from Gerber, I should let him keep it, and he would give me a sovereign to give to Gerber, and he, Wagner, would give me another coat—on the Friday following he went with me to Mr. Bullock's, and bought me a coat, and another on the Monday—Mr. Bullock's is No. 2, some street of which I do not know the name—it leads into Long-acre—he bought two coats for me, and one for himself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 25). On 8th Dec, from instructions I received, I was engaged with Badcock to watch Wagner's lodgings, No. 85, Long-acre—I know Krakauer—Wagner occupied the second floor—I have seen Krakauer in that second floor with Wagner, I believe daily, from 8th Dec. until 4th Jan.—I know Kessler—I often saw him go to Wagner's from 8th Dec. to 4th Jan.—before the 13th Dec. Krakauer was in the habit of wearing a gray Witney coat—on 13th Dec. I saw him with a kind of brown mixture coat—he wore that from that date I believe up to the 16th or 17th—I believe I should know the coat again—(<hi rend="italic">Lovett here produced a coat</hi>)—I believe that is the coat—after the 16th he wore the same gray Witney coat I</p>

                  </hi>. I am waitress, at Osmond's coffee-house in the Strand. On 19th Dec. I remember a person coming there, and ordering a chop—it was the prisoner Wagner—he said, "If any one inquires for a Mr. Sims, send him in to me"—no one came and inquired while he was taking his chop—after he had taken it, and paid for it, he called for a sheet of paper—I got it him, and then I left the room—when I returned to the room, he gave me this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), and told me to give it to any one that might come and inquire for Mr. Sims—he then left the house, and about ten minutes after Gerber came and said, "Is Mr. Sims here?"—I said, "No, he is gone, but he has left you this strip of paper," and I handed it to him—he read the paper, said "Thank you," and left the house—after Wagner had left, I observed he had left half a sheet of the paper which I had got for him on the table—the note I received from Wagner was no part of that paper—I cannot state the exact time Wagner was there—it was about from half past 12 to 1 o'clock—he wore a coat that came round and buttoned over—I call it a dress coat—his hair was rather dark—I have not the least doubt Wagner is the man, I am sure of it.</p>

I took him to Kirk's house, Kirk was at home, and Gerber said, "How do you do, Mr. Sims?"—Kirk said, "You are mistaken, my name is not Sims"—Gerber said, "Oh, no I am not, you met me at the Duke of York's Column"—Kirk said, "I never saw you before to my recollection;" and I then stopped the conversation—Kirk was afterwards produced before him at the Mansion-house.</p>

In the month of Sept., 1850, I was at Ballycale; in May, 1851, I was in the farm of Kilmory—I did not at that time rent a farm of Mr. Hamilton; I was steward to him—I was never in London in my life till I came up as a witness on this transaction—in Sept., 1850, I saw Mr. Nash on my own land, at Ballycale—he told me he had come on business of the rail<lb/>way, to obtain proxy votes, and he asked me to sign a proxy paper—he said it was for some meeting that was to ensue soon afterwards—he said it was in Captain Owen and Lord Courtown's interest—I had received 196 shares in the Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow Railway Company, from Captain Owen—I told him I should not wish to sign the paper without letting Captain Owen know—he ridiculed me for my fears with regard to hesitating to sign the paper—after some more solicitation, I signed the paper.</p>

               <p>was signed by a sufficient number of shareholders, they would wind up the company—I believe that was the case—that afterwards was not carried out—in Sept., 1850, the shares in that company were not marketable—I am not aware that a great number of persons transferred their shares to paupers—the prisoner sent me a number of transfers, over a period of two or three months—only two of them were registered out of a number of about thirty—no shares can be transferred without the numbers of the shares being given—I decline to register them unless they are complete, and they are not complete without the numbers—that was one of my objections, and the objections to some were the difference between the great period which had elapsed between the period of the execution and the date of the stamp—Mr. Nash told me he would get them re-executed if I wished it—I do not recollect that he told me that he took blank transfers in many cases, and afterwards filled them up—I cannot tell that that was the fact; I might have my own suppositions—a transfer is brought to me, and I then look whether I consider it regular or irregular; if I consider it irregular, I refer it to the solicitor, which I did in the case of all that I received from Mr. Nash.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 11, Bartlett's-buildings, Holborn, as an importer and manufacturer of Bohemian glass. About 19th last July, a person named Samuel Turner called on me, and looked out goods to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., consisting of miscellaneous glass and fancy goods—he gave me references to Mr. John Stanley, of 37, Southwark-bridge-road, and Mr. John Barker, builder, of 1, William-street, Newington causeway—I went several times to 1, William-street, but not seeing Barker, he came to my house with Turner, between 19th and 25th July—Barker is the defendant, Murphy—Turner said, "This is Mr. Barker" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—I have since seen him at 1, William-street, and have ascertained he lived there—he said that Turner was a highly respectable man, and he had known him for the last ten years; that he kept a horse and <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, a one horse chaise, and that he supplied country shopkeepers with this sort of goods, meaning the glass and fancy ware; and that he would be answerable to the amount of 2502. for Turner—Turner had said that Barker was a builder, and Barker said he was building twelve or fourteen houses at Notting-hill, and some at Poplar and Deptford—after that I agreed to let Turner have the goods—that was the second order—Mr. John Stanley was the referee for the first order, which amounted to forty odd pounds—before I executed the first order I went to 37, Southward bridge road, which was the address Turner had given me, and there saw the prisoner Martin—there was no name on the door, but "House and Estate Agent" on a wire blind—I knocked at the door, it was opened by a woman, and I inquired for Mr. John Stanley—I was introduced into the parlour, and stayed there about a quarter of an hour, when the prisoner Martin came in—I said, "Good morning," and he said good morning—I told him I had come to inquire about Mr. Samuel Turner, and asked if he knew him—he said he had known him for the last ten years; he was a highly respectable man, and travelled town and country with miscellaneous goods, and kept a horse and <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>; that his wife had leasehold property, and that he (Martin) collected the rents for her; that he did not mind being answerable to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing had been said about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—after that the second order came, which amounted to 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I went to Barker's, and he said he would be answerable for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I began to execute the second order on 25th July—I think I sent 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s worth—there was a third order in Aug. of about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when Barker came to me, between 19th and 25th, he said I was to</p>

I prepared the brief for Honey man—the first time I heard of, or saw him, was 10th Dec, 1851—I did not take any Bohemian glass of him; some was sent to my place in my absence—I cannot say that it came from Honeyman, except that he called on me about the matter—I took it to deliver it up to the prosecutor; it was left at my house on 5th or 6th June, in two small hampers; and I went immediately to Mr. Brock, and told him it was at his service, and he refused to take it—it was glass of this description, perhaps twenty-five articles in the two hampers—there were no vases like these; there were two Bohemian soda<lb/>water glasses—I know Honeyman by his coming to me in company with a client of mine, Alexander Bell, with reference to an assignment of ground, of which Honeyman was the lessee; he had been once or twice with Mr. Bell; and he came on 5th June, and said he had seen by the papers that some glass which was in his possession had been taken before a Magistrate, and he felt very uncomfortable, and asked me what I thought he had better do—he told me a man named Turner was a tenant of his, for part of the ground on which I was concerned in drawing the deeds; and that Tamer was considerably in his debt for moneys advanced; and he produced his book with the entries of when he made those advances—he asked me what be should do—I told him to go to Mr. Brock, who lived close by my chambers, and give up the things to him—he said Mr. Turner had left the goods with his wife, for moneys he had advanced him in the building—Honeyman is a builder, to a large extent, at New-cross—I do not know whether he has any property at Notting-hill—he left my chambers for the purpose of going round to Mr. Brock's—the property, is now in my cellar, 12, Gray's-inn-square—Mr. Brock has been to see it, and he says I had better let it remain till the trial is over, it was safe enough there; and Mr. Lewis, the attorney, likewise told me to keep it—I was not retained to defend Honeyman till last Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Griffin. I remember the prosecutor being there—I saw the prisoner there for an hour before the prosecutor was in the house—the prisoner came and asked me for the key of the water-closet, about 7 o'clock—I gave it him—it was his duty to let me have it again—he did let me have it, but not that night—it being a busy night, many persons used the place—the prisoner was in the habit of showing persons to the place—all I know is, that when the gentleman lost his watch he ran into the bar parlour, and let me know—I had missed the prisoner half an hour before that—the room where the <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> took place is up stairs—to go to the watering place, they would not pass the bar, but go the other way—when I saw the prisoner half an hour before, he went up stairs—I did not see him afterwards—he could not have gone out of the front door without my seeing him—there was a way to get out at the back through the window—all the other doors were locked—the windows are on the right hand side, in the skittle ground—I had not seen the windows any time that evening—I was in the bar—I did not see the windows till half-past 11 that night—the shutters were not fastened—I cannot say whether they were secure at 7 or 8, because mistress and master were out, and the shutters were not fastened—at half-past 11 I went to shut</p>

               <p>in the windows—I did not take notice of the ground, being rather busy—the windows go towards a cow-yard; by that means the prisoner might go out—there might be a dozen go that way—the ground is about eighteen feet from the bar.</p>

I am not sure—when Mr. Harris came in he was rather in liquor—he called for several glasses of brandy and water—I should say he had four or five glasses, and three different pints of gin; I drew it him—when he <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> this gin he went up stairs—I did not see him afterwards—when he came in and said he had lost his watch, I shut the door—I would not let any one go—the policeman walked in—I am quite sure that when the prosecutor came in he had four or five glasses of brandy and water, and he treated the persons with three pints of gin—when he came in he was drunk; his brother was sober—after the prosecutor took these glasses of brandy and water, he remained up stairs about ten minutes as near as I can tell—I did not see him come down; I saw him in the passage—he <hi rend="italic">hallooed</hi> out to me, and said he had lost his watch—I said, "Who has got it?"—he said, "A man in the ground;" and I shut the door, because there was a lot went to rush in—I noticed Mr. Harris's clothes; they were in about the same state as when he walked first into the house—I did not observe whether his waistcoat was torn.</p>

On 12th Jan., about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I was standing opposite the Red Lion at Rotherhithe—the prisoner came and asked whether I had seen Stubbings—I said, "No"—he said he wanted to speak to him particularly, and he asked me to come down Chilton-street and up the Plough-road, because he did not want his father to see him—I went down the Plough-road, and he said should he go and call for Stubbings—I said no, he might be at tea, or his father might be at home—he went and rung at Stubbings's bell, and Miss Stubbings came out and called her brother, Richard Stubbings—he came out; there were then three of us—the prisoner then hung his great coat on the railings—he had had it under his arm—he then came up to me, took me by the collar, and said, "Now, prove I am a liar!"—he then said to Stubbings, "Did you ever catch me out in a lie, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>?"—Stubbings said, "No"—the prisoner then said to me, "Retract your words"—he said it rather loud, and in a rough way—I said, "You have often called me a liar in a joke, and I have taken no notice of it"—he appeared calm and quite cool—he did not seem to be excited at all; he seemed in rather a bad humour—when I said he had called me a liar, and I bad taken no notice of it, he presented a pistol in my face—I saw him draw it up from his right pocket or his side—he did not say anything, but kept it pointed at me—he took it down again, and in about three seconds afterwards he raised it again and fired it in my face—he had hold of me by the collar with his other hand—he retained hold of my collar the whole time, and kept pinching me tight—the muzzle of the pistol was a few inches from my face when he fired—I felt injured by it—I felt as if my face was all <hi rend="italic">taken up</hi>; it was as if the skin of my face was rolled up—my eye was injured, and it is now affected—I was under a medical man for a fortnight or three weeks—by what I could see, the prisoner ran across the field or up the Plough-road—I did not hear him say a word—I know a young lady, named Payne—I was not paying my addresses to her, not at all; I believe the prisoner was—there has never been any con<lb/>versation between us respecting her that I recollect—I have been in the habit of visiting at her father's house—her brother used to draw, and I used to draw with him in the parlour.</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the evening of 12th Jan.—he was in a considerably agitated state, and had an injury on the left side of his face, which appeared like a burn—it was very likely to have been caused by the discharge of a pistol not loaded with ball—the face was red, slightly swollen, and had numerous small punctured wounds, some of them containing a black substance—the external skin was removed in a small degree, and the eye was injured with these black specks—it is a very slight injury to his present appearance—those black specks will be permanent—he sow complains of weeping, of tears running over the eyelid; whether caused by the injury, or previous to it, I cannot say—the wound was likely to cause it—that probably will be for a long time; whether permanent I cannot say—weeping of the eyes arises from injury to the little duct which communicates with the nose—there are small specks on the white of the eye and the eyelid. Court. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The continuity of the skin was not broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the outward skin; the injury was rather severe—there was a slight appearance</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and reside at Jamaica Level, Bermondsey, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. On the night of 11th Feb. I was going round my premises with a candle as usual, ahout half-past 10 o'clock; and while passing through the yard of my pre<lb/>mises, a quantity of sulphuric and tartaric acid was thrown in my face—it produced most violent pain, and more particularly an irritation of the eye—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230092"/>
               <p>it bled for a time—some of the acid went in my mouth, and it put out the candle—I called for another light, and I rushed out at the side door, the only way the person could escape by, and locked the door after me—that was the only door he was likely to get out of; he might have gone a circuitous way round—I ran and washed my eye with water, and went to the bottom of my garden—I called the assistance of Mr. Phillips; he came to my assistance—he remained at the top of the garden, at the great gates leading to the road, in the first instance—I got a light, and searched my premises—I heard a <hi rend="italic">shuffling</hi> footstep up stairs, in the top loft—I traced them from floor to floor—I first went in the ground floor, then in the floor above that—I heard the <hi rend="italic">shuffling</hi> of feet over my head—I called out to Mr. Phillips that I had them safe, and he might now come to my assistance—I then advanced to the foot of a broad step ladder, leading to the upper floor—there is a trap door in the centre of the building—I advanced to the ladder, and saw some person stand<lb/>ing at the top of the ladder, with two pistols in his hand—I had the light in my hand, which I held above my head—the person had the pistols rather crossways in his hands—they appeared to me to be in this position (<hi rend="italic">crossing his hands</hi>), but the light was indistinct; I could not see exactly—on setting my foot on the first step of the ladder, the prisoner was at the top and fired—the ladder was from seven to eight feet long—the floors are the height of sugar baker's floors, seven feet high—I can undertake to say that the pistol which was fired was loaded with something; that which it was loaded with struck the candlestick out of my hand, and knocked a piece off my fore-finger—the ball struck me on the forehead, and went through the hair of my head—my hand was at that time holding the light above my head—I had a brass chamber candlestick in my hand—I persisted in going up the ladder, and the prisoner fired a second pistol—the contents of that went down my back, making a superficial wound as it passed, passing through my shirt and outer garments—it broke the skin—I cannot say how deep it was—I could not see it myself, being at the back of my shoulder—I believe it was but slight—I went up the ladder to the floor, and secured the prisoner—I took the two pistols from him—I delivered him to the policeman, who had by that time arrived—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the pistols I took from the prisone; they had been recently fired—they have percussion locks—I was present when the prisoner was searched: a sort of steel box was found on him, a few caps, some pieces of lead, and a few watch keys—the policeman took possession of the box and other things, and I handed these pistols to him—these caps were not tried by me, nor I do not know that they were tried in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Jamaica Level, Bermondsey; I am a gar<lb/>dener. On 11th Feb. about half-past 10 o'clock in the evening, I heard a cry for assistance come from Mr. Barber's premises—I saw Mr. Barber and I went to him—I remained outside a short time, and I afterwards went on the premises—I followed Mr. Barber through the lower part of the factory—I went up stairs—Mr. Barber went up to the middle floor of the factory, and as he was about to put his foot, or had put his foot on the lower round of the ladder to go to the upper floor, a pistol was fired from the upper floor—I saw some person standing on the top of the ladder, which I ultimately found to be the prisoner—after the firing of the first pistol Mr. Barber proceeded to go up the ladder, and as he was ascending a second pistol was fired in the same direction—Mr. Barber instantly flew up the ladder, and got the pri<lb/>soner—I assisted in securing him; he had the two pistols in his hand—they were taken away from him—I looked at them; they looked as if they had been recently fired—I handed the prisoner over to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 226). About half-past 10 o'clock at night, on 11th Feb., I went to Mr. Barber's premises—I saw the prisoner there; he was given into custody by Mr. Barber—Mr. Barber told me, in his presence, that he had thrown acid into his face, and had fired two shots, and said, "Is not this a hanging matter?"—the prisoner said be could hang well—on the way to the station, a female, whom I did not know, gave me this black mask—the prisoner saw it in my possession, and he said, "It is mine; I threw it away"—when the female brought it me she said she had picked it up in the road, and she saw the prisoner throw it away—I produce this steel box, I found it on the prisoner, it had tobacco in it; and I found on his person five percussion caps, four pieces of lead, and some watch keys—they were all in one pocket, I believe his trowsers pocket—I saw this bullet picked up on Mr. Barber's premises; it was lying on the floor, in the middle floor of the warehouse—I saw it found by a young man, a friend of Mr. Barber's—it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that on the floor above the ladder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was; the floor on which Mr. Barber was standing—there are two ladders, one from the bottom to the second floor, and then one to another floor—this was not on the floor above the second ladder—I know the floor Mr. Barber was on when he was shot at, it was at the bottom of the ladder on that floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far from the foot of the ladder was this bullet found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On one side of it; I suppose a yard, or a yard and a half from it, it might be—I examined the premises to see if there were any marks of a bullet; I did not find any—I looked on the same floor where I found this—I looked all over every place down below—I examined the wall on the opposite side—we examined the walls and the partition, and found no mark.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, M</hi> 2). I have a knowledge of fire<lb/>arms—about an hour and a half after the prisoner was locked up thia bullet was shown to me; it is lead—it had been recently fired off—it had a damp<lb/>ness about it, and smelt of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the effect of firing a bullet to flatten it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it may go through a person and not flatten it—I have been in the army, and have had five wounds.</p>

               <p>—the constable, Carthy, produced two pistols to me, in presence of the pri<lb/>soner—he asked me if they had been recently fired, and fired with ball—I said I could not tell whether they had been loaded with ball, but I believed they had been recently fired—the prisoner immediately said, "Yes, they were fired, and both loaded with ball."</p>
