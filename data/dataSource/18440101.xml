                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">smith and engineer, No. 90 1/2, St. Giles's.</hi> In Oct., 1842, I advertised a cabriolet for sale, and I believe on the 8th of Oct, the prisoner called on me—I told him the price of the cabriolet was fifty guineas—after some conversation he agreed to give 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said it was not convenient to pay the money then, but he would give me a good reference—I said, if he would give me a good reference I would take a bill—he referred me to Hodges and Parker, bankers, No. 10, Austin-friars—he pulled out his card, which I produce, and at the same time he dropped a loose check out of his pocket-book, similar to one which I produce—I told him I never heard of the name of Hodges and Parker—he said they were merchants and private bankers, and that it was not an uncommon thing for merchants to be private bankers—he said he would call again in the course of the day—after he left I went to No. 10, Austin-friars, and saw the names of Hodges and Parker on the door outside—I saw a person, who appeared to be a clerk, in the outer office—I asked to see one of the partners, and I saw a person who said he was a partner—I do not know who that was—I do not know Parker's person—I do not think it was Hodges—I showed him Mr. Green's card, and told him he had given reference to them—he said that Mr. Green kept an account with them, and it was all regular—I asked, if they had a cabriolet to sell worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, whether they would trust him? and he said most certainly they would—I then returned home—soon after the prisoner called again—I told him they gave him a most excellent character, but that the person I saw was a very young man, and asked him for a reference to some tradesman whom he dealt with—he laughed, and said, "Well, I will give you my coach-builder, Mr. Charles Thompson, of Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square"—I went there, and Mr. Thompson said Mr. Green's family had dealt with him for a long time, and were highly respectable; that his father had been a banker at York, or in Yorkshire, and he was then about selling Mr. Green a second-hand cabriolet himself—I then let him have the cabriolet, and he gave me this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; bill, drawn by myself, payable two months after date at Messrs. Hodges, Parker, and Co., No. 10, Austin-friars, and accepted by himself—I paid the bill away, and it was re<lb/>turned to me, dishonoured, by Mr. Corbyn—I sent my clerk to Hodges and</p>

               <p>Parker's, I did not go myself—two or three days before the bill became due I accidentally met the prisoner in Holborn—he did not know me, but I made myself known to him—he then asked whether I had heard of the failure of the house of Hodges, Parker, and Co.—I do not know what I said, for I had been then informed that they were a gang of swindlers—I did not tell him so—two or three days after the bill had become due the prisoner called on me, and offered me a bill on Captain Farquharson or Ferguson—I asked him for payment of my bill, and he offered me this other bill instead—I asked him to leave it with me, that I might inquire into the character of it, but he said, "No"—I did not take it—I have never got my cabriolet again, or a farthing for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Parker told you that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know Mr. Parker, or any of them—you did not refer to Mr. Thompson at the same time you referred to Hodges and Parker, but when I asked for a reference to some tradesman—Thompson gave you a very excellent character—he said you were about pur<lb/>chasing a cabriolet of him at a price considerably higher than mine, and you yourself told me that you were about purchasing a cabriolet of him, but that mine was better at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; than his at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I did not call on you in Essex-street—I told Mr. Corbyn to do so—you told me you wanted a Cla<lb/>rence for a friend, and I told Mr. Corbyn, thinking to do him a service, as I heard so good a character of you—Mr. Corbyn waited on you for an order for the Clarence—when you told me that Hodges and Parker had failed, you said it would seriously derange your affairs, but you would look in upon me, which you did, and offered me the bill on Captain Farquharson, payable at joint-stock bank, if I would give up my bill—it was a larger amount than my bill—I was to return the balance when the bill became due—you would not leave it for me to make inquiry respecting it—you spoke of leaving some wine warrants with me as security for the payment of the bill, but I thought they were like the bills, good for nothing, and I directly told you you were a swindler, and a gang of swindlers—I never saw Mr. Hodges or Mr. Parker driving about in the cabriolet, nor ever saw or heard it was in their pos<lb/>session.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184401010007"/>
               <p>known the prisoner about three years previously, by his having married into a very respectable family in Sheffield, and, consequently, I did not make the usual inquiries, which I otherwise should have done—I parted with the goods on the faith of his general character and respectability previously—we had executed an order for him three years previous, and it was regularly paid; in fact, I believe the goods he had on his marriage were all obtained in Shef<lb/>field, and paid for regularly—he was then living in Great Winchester-street, and paid me with a check, honourably and fairly—one part of these goods consisted of a case of seventeen or eighteen pairs of plated desserts—that order was given me by Green and Parker together, and they were to be sent to Austin-friars—he then gave an order for a quantity of ivory knives and forks, and razors, which I wrote for and executed—I took a porter with me, and delivered them in Austin-friars, on account of Hodges, Parker, and Co., not to the prisoner—he did not order anything on his own account—his name was not mentioned—this is the invoice—when I took the goods to Austin-friars, the prisoner was there, acting as one of the firm, indeed I sup<lb/>posed him to be the Co.—they were taking lunch together, which I did not like the look of—I stated to them at the time, that I expected cash on delivery—the clerk I saw said they always paid on the first Monday in the month—but when I called on the first Monday of the month, they said I was rather hard, in pressing for the whole amount of this invoice and the other, and they settled the small account, which I believe was about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, begging I would let this stand over till the first Monday of the next month—I think it was the first Monday in May that they paid me the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the amount of the other account was between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the goods were sold at trade price, to sell again—they were supposed to be going to France—they had them at the regular merchant's price—if it had been, a regular mercantile transaction, I should have allowed them two months' interest, or taken a bill at two months, upon satisfactory reference—I received one letter from Parker, while at Austin-friars—I have it not here—I think I should know his hand<lb/>writing—I never saw Hodges—I believe he was here the Sessions before last, and was let out on his own recognizance, and is gone—the trial was put off then because we could not find Green, and now we cannot find Hodges—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I cannot swear to this handwriting—I do not know Parker's handwriting—I only had one letter from the firm—I never saw Parker write, or acted with him upon any letter I received—all the transaction I had with him in writing was the account, when they paid me the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I have never received any money for the other goods—their clerk afterwards called, and told me they had absconded—I think they were broken up in the middle of May, 1842—the goods were ordered in the name of Hodges, Parker, and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Does this bill of parcels contain an account of all the goods that were sold by you to Hodges and Parker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—it is for the goods they have not paid for—the other one that you paid for was a sepa<lb/>rate bill of parcels, and they had a receipt—it was on the former bill that you called, and introduced Mr. Parker—you have got that—the one I have was found on the premises with other papers—it was positively stipulated that the goods should be sold for cash—you were present when I called, the first Monday in the month, and you said you thought I was very hard to wish it settled then, you knew our house was too respectable to mind a month's credit, and so on, and I let it be—the first parcel was delivered on the day you called, and the second parcel a few days after, and you thought it very hard I should include them—goods delivered after the first day of a month.</p>

Thompson—he said he should have either a dividend or money on his own or his wife's account on the 10th of Oct.—I said then he had better wait for the horse till the dividend became due—he said it was very necessary he should have it, as the Parliamentary Session was about to begin—I declined selling the horse without the money—he then gave me a reference to Hodges, Parker, and Co., his bankers, and gave me this check—I did not go there—a friend of mine, Mr. Benton, went to make inquiries, and, in consequence of what he told me, when the prisoner called again I told him I would take a bill upon Hodges and Parker backing it—he brought a bill to me, reporting that it was backed by them—I afterwards passed the bill to Mr. Benton—he returned it to me—I have not got it here—I have never been paid for the horse, and I have likewise refunded the money to Mr. Benton, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., besides expenses—I never went myself to Hodges and Parker.</p>

"and he said, "I think it is;" he said, "Come along with me;" I said, "What for?" he said, "For stealing two rolls of cloth"—I went to the prosecutor's shop; there were about ten shopmen; he showed me up the shop twice, and back again, and asked if they knew anything of me; they said no; but when he said, "Do you know anything of the man that stole the roll of cloth? up jumps one and said, "That is the man."</p>

It is very strange the crown should pass through the Magistrate's hands at Bow-street, and he not see the marks, and that he should ask the witness why he did not mark the piece before he gave me into custody, and that when I came up on the Wednesday following it should be cut, and marked as you now see it; he says I was not more than five minutes out of his sight; whereas he owns it was about half-past nine or ten o'clock that I tendered the crown to him; and he cannot say whether it was not as late as twelve when we got to the station. If any other person was standing at this bar, he would as soon swear to him as me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am drayman to Messrs. Goding and Co., Belvidere-road, Lambeth; the deceased, William Knott, was my mate. On Thursday, the 9th of Nov., he was driving, and I was riding on the front plank of the dray—when the accident happened we were just against the Civet Cat, at Kensington—there is barely room for two omni<lb/>busses and a dray to pass there—the deceased was driving at a moderate pace—just as we were passing a cart, standing at the corner of the street where the Civet Cat is, two omni<lb/>busses came up together, one on each side, but the off one was a little a-head—that was a red one—Clinch drove it—Horne drove the other, which was a blue one—that was on the near side, which was its wrong side—we were all three going towards London—the red one was on the off, its right side, but on the wrong side for passing another carriage—when they came on each side of the dray, the deceased was walking by the side of the dray, conversing with me, against the front plank, which I was sitting on—he was in a place where, if unmolested, he could have had command of his horses, and driven his dray properly—the red omni<lb/>bus was coming furiously, but the blue one stopped just as it came alongside; I did not see at what pace it came up—the red one went galloping by at a furi<lb/>ous rate, and went on—its coming at that furious rate, and their whipping the horses on each side the dray, caused the alarm to our horses—at that time something, I did not see what, took the deceased off his standing, while the omnibusses were by the side of the dray—the horses in the dray made a start from the flogging of the horses on each side of them, and attempted to run away—they ran about twenty yards—Knott was hanging at the front chain of the front pin of the dray at the time the horses started—he was taken off his feet—when I saw the danger, I tried to get hold of him as I was sitting on the dray, but I could not—I jumped from the dray as quick as possible, ran to the fore-horse's head, and stopped the horses—they were some distance from the blue omnibus—it was then stopping—the red one did not stop at all—I looked back, and saw a congregation of persons round Knott, just pick<lb/>ing him up—I did not see the wheel pass over him, because I was in the act of stopping my horses—my back was towards him—Mr. Oak sent for his cart, and his man, and a constable took him to the hospital—I was obliged to go on with my dray—I did not know either of the prisoners before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the deceased properly the driver of the dray, or were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally I was—he was the foreman, but we took it by turns—I was the driver—he was my mate to render me assistance—we generally make it a rule for one to drive out and another home—it is our own rule—the proper place for the driver is not generally speaking at the head of the foremost horse—sometimes we have a young horse in the shaft, and are obliged to attend to him—we had not got a young horse on this occasion—we had an old one in the shaft—no doubt the driver must be at the head of the foremost horse, but if he wanted to ask me a question, he must come back to the dray—he asked me, "Do you know what turn we are going to have? "—we have long journeys sometimes—one man is quite sufficient to drive two horses, and we give one another the chance to rest ourselves on the front plank of the dray—we had put our beer down at the Swan public-house, Hammersmith—the Civet Cat is two miles or thereabouts from there—I drove down the road, and was sitting on the dray coming back, till we came to the Civet Cat—I had not been sitting there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184401010019"/>
               <p>all the while—the deceased said, "Get up, and have a ride"—he had just the same wages that I had—I had not been riding on the shaft from Ham<lb/>mersmith to Kensington—I had been driving my horses as usual, from the Swan to the Civet Cat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not just now say that you took it by turns, one to drive out, and the other home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I drove out, the deceased drove home—he drove all the way from the Swan—I had been on the plank about half way from the Swan to the Civet Cat, for a mile—I had no whip in my hand—I had no command of the horses where I sat—the deceased was talking to me by the side of the plank where I was sitting—he was in a situation to have control over the horses at times—when he attempted to get forward towards the horses the omnibus was alongside of him—if he had been at the head of the horses, he would have been able to stop them, certainly—if he had been in front he could have put his hand to the rein of the shaft horse, and stopped him directly, and if I had been in front instead of riding I could have done it—had not the near-side omnibus been there the deceased would have been at liberty, and could have cleared himself—it was about four or five yards from the place where the blue omnibus stopped to the place Where the deceased fell—I cannot say exactly, for I jumped off the dray when I saw the danger—my back was toward him when I was in the act of stopping my horses—I will swear Horne whipped his horses—I saw them both whip their horses, the blue omnibus was not going at a rapid rate—it was alongside the dray when I first saw it—I attempted to take the deceased by the collar, but could not—I am confident I did not take hold of him—I did not attend the first coroner's inquest—I did the adjourned one—I was not summoned to the first, and knew nothing of it.</p>

I was a passenger by the blue omn<lb/>ibus driven by Horn—I also saw a red omnibus driven by Clinch—we were comiug to London—my attention was first drawn to the red omnibus waiting for the other coming up, nearly opposite Lord Holland's gate, taking up passengers—we passed it—when we got to the National Schools, which is a very narrow part, there was some ob<lb/>struction, but, being inside, I could not see what it was—the red omnibus came up on the off side of us, and we went both abreast at a walking pace until we arrived at the church—we being on the near side, drove round where there is a wide opening to the church, to take the near side—I then perceived a brewer's dray in front of us—we went past on the near side of the dray, and the red omnibus on the off side—my attention was drawn to it from the furious t rate at which the red omnibus was passing—I was looking directly across the backs of the dray-horses, the coachman at the same time flogging both his horses—the blue omnibus was going at a fair ordinary pace—the dray-horses instantly started off into a gallop—my decided opinion is, that it was occa<lb/>sioned from the flogging of the horses of the red omnibus—I did not observe the driver of the dray until the horses took fright—the blue omnibus imme<lb/>diately pulled up, and I saw the driver of the dray hanging to the fare part of the dray, or the shaft—my impression was, that if he let go his hold he was a dead man—I fixed my eye intently, the omnibus stopping—the dray had gone on before us—I saw the near wheel of the dray rise up, and by that I knew the man was under it—I did not see him under the wheel—at the time the dray-horses started off, our omnibus was by their near side—we never went further than that—I was sitting at the back of the omnibus, on the off side—I could command a complete view of the dray, and of the accident which happened—in my judgment the dray-horses were startled by the flogging of the coachman on the red omnibus, and going at the furious rate he was going.</p>

               <p>the dray some distance, on account of the dray going at so slow a pace—the two omnibusses were abreast—we were not able to pass, the road being narrow and vehicles coming from London—when we came to an open space near the church, which stands back, the blue omnibus attempted to pass on the near side—it pulled out a little to pass, and just at that time the red omnibus also attempted to pass, and did pass, just at the time the dray had arrived just by a post at the corner of the Civet Cat—the red omnibus, at the time it passed, was driven at the rate of nearly seven miles an hour, or between six and seven—I cannot say whether the horses were trotting or galloping—I saw the driver of the dray walking along by the side of the horse in the shafts of the dray, with a whip on his right shoulder—at that time the blue omnibus was trying to pass, but by that time the dray had arrived a little further, where the road runs rather narrow, and there was scarcely an opportunity for it to pass—just at that time the dray-horses had started off—the red omnibus was passing just at that time, and had arrived to about the first horse, the leader of the dray—I cannot say what the driver of the red omnibus was doing at the time, for seeing the man hanging to the shaft of the dray took my atten<lb/>tion off—I saw the dray-horses start off into a kind of canter—I cannot say what occasioned them to do so, my attention was directed to the man clinging to the shaft of the dray—at the same time, his fellow-servant, who was sitting on the first plank of the dray, put his hand out, as in the act to catch hold of the deceased, to assist him and hold him on, as it were—it appeared to me as if he let go of the man, and the moment he did so the deceased fell off on his back, rolled over on his face, and the wheel went right across his back—I got off the omnibus, and assisted him up, and he was taken to the hospital—the blue omnibus was standing still at the time.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, by former wife—I believe he is fifty-nine years old—he has been up to a certain period a very good and affectionate father, and was of a quiet disposition—for the last six Of seven months I have observed an alteration in his demeanor and habits—he did not talk so much, and he used to come into my mom, and walk up and down the room, without talking—that had not been his usual habit—his spirits were very high, and he was always laughing and talking—about six weeks ago, we thought at dinner-time that he was much better—he was reading the Bible all that morning—we took him some rice pudding, and said, "Come, hate a little rice pudding; put that book down, and you will be better after "—we tried to give it him once or twice—he seemingly shrunk back—I said, "Come, father, have a little rice pudding"—presently he snatched it out of my hand, and devoured it in two minutes—he threw the plate down at the bottom of the bed, and tried to get hold of me, but I shrunk back—on the Saturday in question he said his dinner was neither hot nor cold—on the day before, he asked me to taste some jelly—I took a spoonful—he said, "Now take an<lb/>other"—I</p>

"—he did not tell me the reason why—I was in the room with Mrs. Caffyn when this matter began—I did not know that the poker was on the fender—I was up stairs all that morning—he was sitting shut in the room about five minutes alone with me—he said, "Maria, she is going to swear against my life"—that was the first time he had hinted anything of that kind. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me—I had dose nothing whatever to provoke him—I did not see him take up the poker—I heard a scream from Mrs. Caffyn, and flew to the door, and as soon as I was there she was—we both ran away—William Sanderson had the care of my father.</p>

"Have you any knowledge of this person?

                  </hi>. I am the wife of last witness. I was at home on the evening of the 27th of Nov., and saw a person with a clock—it was the prisoner James Harvey Smith—I was in the parlour, at needle-work, when he came in—my husband was talking to him—I saw them through the glass of the parlour door—I came into the shop on bearing the words "trouble"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184401010038"/>
               <p>and "distress"—when I got into the shop they were talking together—I did not notice the conversation particularly, but I know it was that he wanted my husband to buy a clock—I went into the parlour for a candle, and they hung it up—I held the candle in my hand till, I think, the prisoner took it out of my hand, in hanging up the clock, to show the hook—I saw the prisoner leave with the clock in a carpet bag—I did not notice the pattern of the bag, and cannot say anything about it—he came back in about ten mi<lb/>nutes—I saw him return, I had not left the shop, and my husband purchased the clock for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again that day week, when my hus<lb/>band brought him into the shop—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the person who brought the clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not before he came with the clock—I had been in the parlour, working, for about an hour—I only remained there two or three minutes after the person came in—the words "trouble" and "distress" brought me out; seeing a respectable looking person, I wanted to know what it was—the words were, "trouble and execution"—I remember one remark the prisoner made when my husband offered him a sum which he did not think sufficient; it was, "Oh dear, it is enough to make a man strike his own father"—I have often talked this matter over with my husband; we have been in a great deal of trouble about it—I do not think we have asked each other about what the prisoner said—my husband has not asked me if I remembered the expression, "It is enough to make a man strike his own father"—he did not remember the words, and I did—I do not know that I told him that expression was made use of; I might have done so—I do not know that he told me he did not remember those words; he may have done so, I really cannot remember—he did not speak of it; I certainly did mention the words to him; I do not know when; I suppose it was at the time it happened—I do not remember his saying, "Very true, I remember well that he did say so"—on the 4th of Dec. my husband did not tell me to take care of the shop before he went out; it was that that so surprised me, because he always does tell me when he leaves the shop—when he came back he called me—I went into the shop directly, and the prisoner was standing with his back towards me—my husband said, "Do you know that person?"—I looked, and said, "Yes, I do; it is the gentleman that sold you the clock this night week," or "a week ago," I might have said—I was aware he was looking out for the person, because he had promised the Magis<lb/>trate he would do his best endeavours—I did not hear him say so, as I was not there, but he told me he was going to see if he could find the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Tilney-court. The prisoners occupied a parlour in my house, underneath my room, since September—on Friday afternoon, the 24th of Nov., about four or five o'clock, I was coming down stain—their room door was open, and I saw them both there—I saw them no more that evening—I went to bed near upon twelve o'clock—I slept in the room over them—I was disturbed during the night, by hearing persons going in and out, a great deal, from the hours of two till four—they came from the parlour—the street door is on the same floor as the parlour—I did not hear that door opened—it is generally open all night.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Smith, I am rather surprised that you did not hear or see something of it, for you were in and out all night"—he made no answer—I had then heard of the robbery—I came down to the place where the wall was broken through—it is about seven or eight yards from the house to the dust-hole, and about eight or nine yards from the house to the hole in the wall—I did not see the other prisoner that morning—in the course of that afternoon, as I was sitting at my work, there was a great smell of smoking of cigars in their room—I had noticed the smell of tobacco before—I did not see what they were smoking—Samuel Smith came home on the Tuesday, as James was taken on the Monday—I do not remember the day of the month—it was more than a week after the robbery—I bad seen them in the meantime working together, not every day—I was at home all day on Friday, the 24th—I cannot tell whether either of the prisoners went out that afternoon—I heard neither of them goout till I was gone to bed—I should think the footsteps I heard were of one person, by the sound of them, and only one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Lower Charles-st., Clerkenwell—it is the dwelling-house of my father, Edward Stephen Jackson. About one o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of Jan., I rEturned home and shut the door after me—the lock catches so as to be secure when I draw it to—the front parlour door was shut when I came in—I slept in the back parlour—I shut that door—between four and five o'clock in the morning I heard a voice calling out, "Thieves," and a noise as if a person was running down stairs and stumbling—I rushed out of bed, and secured the prisoner in the corner of the passage—I found my bed-room door open—it was moonlight—a knock cane to the door—I opened it—the constable was on the step, and I gave him in charge—I found the front parlour door open, and saw that somebody had been sick, and the rim of the prisoner's hat was covered with the same—I was the last person up that night.</p>

"—I said, "Why you ought to have brought it back, if you had taken it away, when I taxed you with it the next morning "—he said, "Well, it is in your hands; I have lost my character and my situation; but if you will apply to Mr. Riles to withdraw the charge, I will give up the gun "—I spoke to Mr. Riles, and he said it was out of his power to make any such promise, it was not his own.</p>

In consequence of information on the 7th of Dec., I went with two officers to a public-house in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's, nearly opposite the prosecutor's warehouse—I waited there from five o'clock till about a quarter past—there was a gas-light burning over the window—we had a. full view of the prose<lb/>cutor's door—I saw the prisoners and another-Walker and the other went to the door with their faces to it—Durall had bis back to them, and bit face to the public-house—he was looking up and down the street—the other two appeared to me to be feeling the door—Durall was two or three feet from them-after that a brewer's servant came towards the door—the pri<lb/>soners separated—Redman and I came down stairs, and partly opened the public-house door—Walker then passed close by the door—the other two were then at the warehouse door—Walker went across and joined them—they tried the door repeatedly, but were disturbed several times, by persons entering the street—the last time I saw Durall, with the one not in custody, stand with their hacks to Walker, and their faces towards me—Walker stood at the door<lb/>way, and I heard the door rattle—I opened the public-house door, and Durall, with the other, went towards Brick-lane—Walker went towards Helmet-row, which was in a contrary direction—I crossed the street, and followed Walker—he crossed Mitchell-street, looked back, saw me, and quickened his pace—I called to him to stop—he commenced running, and paid no attention to me—I said, "Stop, or else I will knock you down"—he turned round on me, with this chisel in his band, which I believe he took out of his pocket—he held it up to me with both hands—I knocked it out of his band with a stick I had, and secured him—I said I belonged to the police, and that he and his gang were breaking into Mr. Pizzie's warehouse, in Mitchell-street—he said he was never there at all—Redman came to my assistance, and we pushed Walker into a baker's shop—I took this bag from his hat, and took him to the station—I then examined the warehouse door—there was a mark on the door, near the lock, which corresponded with the point of this chisel—the door had been painted green, and there was a small piece of the paint near the top of the chisel.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you produce it at all till the Magistrate reprimanded you for treating one of these prisoners severely? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my oath he never censured me for any thing—Walker said I hit him on the hand when he held this chisel up in a menacing attitude—it was not when he com<lb/>plained of my having struck him that I drew forth this chisel as my justifica<lb/>tion—Mr. Pizzie and Redman were with me when I examined the marks on the door, between nine and ten o'clock in the forenoon—there was one very large mark on the jamb of the door, and a small one on the door, which ex<lb/>actly corresponded with the chisel, which was put into the mark after the door was open—there was no force used to make it fit—I had seen Walker six or seven tiroes that morning—his face was familiar to me—I did not strike him more than once—I had a bottle of ginger-beer that morning, and I think Redman had a small glass of brandy—I went out first and crossed the road—in less than two minutes I was followed and joined by Redman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Earl-court, Leicester-square. Knight was my apprentice—in consequence of information, on the 18th Dec. I went with a policeman to Rich's house, in Kingsgate-street, Holborn, where be carries on the printing business—he was not at home—I went into his office, and found some type, some borders, and iron side-sticks, which I claimed—the type was by itself, laid out for regular business—each type was distri<lb/>buted into a case, as we always keep them—I took from the case what I claimed—these are them—I had been missing such type, and side-sticks, and borders, for the last eight or ten months, to the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—when I hid selected these. Rich came in—I said, "You have property on your premise! brought here by Knight, my apprentice"—he made no reply—I said, "Tell me the founder whom you got these things from?"—he said he did not know—I afterwards produced the two side-sticks to him, and said, "These are my property"—he made no answer—Knight was outside the door at the time, is custody—I gave the type to the policeman—Rich did not say anything on that—I then gave him into custody—he and Knight were taken to the police-court—I returned'with the policeman to Rich's premises—I there found some more type and side-sticks, which I claimed—they were in cases in different parts of the office—there was a man named Napier in our company—he col<lb/>lected with me that portion that forms these two lots—I am positive they aw mine—there is about six or seven pounds of type altogether—neither Knight nor any one, had authority from me to lend or dispose of any articles in my business—before I went to Rich's that morning, Knight had been called down into the presence of Napier, and he had identified Knight as the person he alluded to—Knight did not make any answer—there was some type found behind the bed which belonged to me—there is a practice in the trade of one printer bor<lb/>rowing a line of type from another, but it would be kept together—if one printer was to borrow the words "boots and shoes" it would be kept together in that state in his office.</p>

               <p>so gradual as these—Mr. Hopkinson, the engineer, makes them—this gra<lb/>dual slope is my plan—it adjusts the type more accurately—these bars are type as well as the letters—there is nothing in the ban that I can identify—they are not at all uncommon—there is no slant in this"U" or "W"—I can identify them, because I have lost property of this description—other type would not be of the same colour—according to the wear and usage it hat, it loses its brightness—type used the same number of times, would have the same appearance—I do not swear to this type—it forms a complete border—I got this border from his place—neither of these borders on this card are my printing—I do not know Bell—I have seen him—I have heard that he is the person from whom Rich purchased the business—Bell gave me his direction, which I gave to my solicitor—on going to Rich's house, I had this conversation—to the best of my recollection, I am prepared to swear that this was the whole of the conversation—I swear that I first said, "You have property on your premises brought by Knight," and that I said that before I asked from what founder he bought the type—I will swear there were not twenty other questions asked before that—nor ten—nor five—the policeman was present—I only found his wife there—I merely said I was come to search for stolen goods—I did not send her into a fit—Rich came in in about five minutes—I did sot hear his wife say, "Here is a fine thing, Mr. Nichols is here searching this place for stolen goods"—it might have taken place—Rich did not sty, "What business has Mr. Nichols here?"—I do not think he knew my name—I said words to this effect," Mr. Rich, you have got a great deal of my type here"—he did not say, "No, I have not," nor say no, at all—I said, "Oh, my apprentice has told me all about it, and owned to every thing"—I did not say "You may as well assist me in the search"—the officer did not, in my pre<lb/>sence, caution him from saying anything—Rich did not say, "Oh, I do not care, he may search as long as he pleases, and take away what he likes"—that may be the substance of what he said, but they were not his words—I was collecting a lot of type together—he said, "You may as well say the whole office is yours"—I have been acquainted with Napier since the day he was brought into the parlour by my brother—I ascertained that he was in Bell's employ that day—I have offered to take Napier into my employ—I think that must have been on the 2nd examination—it was not on the examina<lb/>tion on which Napier admitted that what he had said before, was false—it waa on the third examination, he said that—it was after my offer to take him into my service—it was not because I thought him a liar that I offered to take him—it was on account of his honesty in the first instance—in fact I did not make the offer, it was suggested—my brother said, "I think this boy deserves to be taken in your place," and I said, "In all probability I may."</p>

On Friday night, the 15th of Dec, I closed the house, and saw it all perfectly safe, at twelve o'clock—I was the last person up, and the first up in the morning—I came down a little after seven o'clock, and found the shutters and window up, of the parlour at the back of the house—the window looked into the back yard—there was a bureau, two tables, and some drawers in the room—on the previous day there was in the bureau a gold watch, two silver watches, above 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in silver, one guinea in gold, and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, which was all gone in the morning—I missed property to the amount of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I went with a policeman to the prisoner's house on the Tuesday, but found nothing then—I went again the same afternoon, and was in the house when two bottles of port wine were found, and some duplicates, but I did not see them found—I did not miss any bottles of wine—it is impossible to miss any—I was present with two policemen, when the marks on the bureau were examined.</p>

Mr. Sproston's house; Orrow will secrete you there until the house is closed, and then he will come to you, and show you where the property is, and assist you to take it"—I said I would have nothing to do with it—Orrow said, "Do, I will assist you"—I said, "No, I will not"—I then went away.</p>

Q.</hi> Look at this bill; did you give this to the prisoners brother to pay for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will swear that—the prisoner did not have any drink given to him on the occasion of our being married—I never I saw him intoxicated in my life—when I first knew him I lived with my mo<lb/>ther at Palmer's-place, Holloway, I think No. 4 or 5—I cannot tell in what year I first knew the prisoner—I think it is about nine years ago—I was not at that time acquainted with any other coachman, I will swear—I know one or two whom the prisoner knew—before I went to Worcester I was not ac<lb/>quainted with any other person who drove coaches—I was not in the habit of kissing my hand as they passed the Peacock at Islington to any but the prisoner himself—I first became acquainted with him by his passing by on his coach—he then came to my mother, she knowing something of him—he then wished to pay honourable addresses to me—my mother did not think him good enough, but I unfortunately was of a different opinion—I knew a person named Blackhurst, in Lincolnshire, in 1837—I knew he was married—I never was drunk—no persons lodged in house in Palmer's-terrace—Blackhurst never came to our place—he was a solicitor, in Lincolnshire—I removed with my mother from Palmer's-terrace to Blackheath—when I left there I went to No. 10, Frederick-place, Goswell-street—I am not aware that Mr. Blackhurst was an amateur performer—I got two situations to perform at country theatres by the prisoner's wish—I performed about six weeks in Lancashire—I never performed with Mr. Blackhurst—a woman named Moore lodged in the house where I was in the country—she went down there as I performer—I should say that is about six years ago—I slept with Moore while I was in the house with her—the prisoner was at that time in London—I did not sleep with anybody but Moore while I was there—upon my oath I was never caught in bed with Blackhurst—I never dishonoured the prisoner in thought, word, or deed—I did not sleep on the sofa one night—upon my oath I did not enter into an agreement with the prisoner, that if for what had illicitly passed between us, he would give me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would never annoy him again—120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; was never named to me—I never signed a bond to that effect.</p>
