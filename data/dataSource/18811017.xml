                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at Oxtead, Surrey—in Septem<lb/>ber, 1880, the prisoner Robinson called on me, and asked me to become a member of the London and Provincial Mercantile Society, at, 48, Bedford Row—I paid him a subscription of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he would send me a subscription card—on 18th September I received these cards; one is headed "The London, Provincial, and Foreign Mercantile Association. Office, 48, Bedford Row." Signed, "Thomas Robinson, Secretary"—the other is "London and Provincial Mercantile Agency, established for the protection of bankers, merchants, and traders." Signed, "Mr. Robinson, Provisional Manager"—they were enclosed in this letter, signed "T. Robinson, Manager"—Robinson called on me after that, and I gave him the names of persons who owed me money—Haynes, of Brighton, was one; his debt was something over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that visit, on 22nd November, I received a P.O.O. for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Haynes directly—on the evening of the next day Robinson called; I advised them by letter on the 22nd that I had received this money, and I had this answer on the morning of the day on which he called; it is dated November 22nd, from 48, Bedford Row. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Yourself and Haynes,—This man is served with a writ; return him the post-office order, or you will be charged with the solicitor's costs. Accounts placed in our hands must not be inter<lb/>fered with by the subscribers. W. R. H.") When Robinson called on the 23rd he said he had come about the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had received from Haynes, and he said I had better hand him over the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as Haynes had been served with a writ, and I must not interfere, and I handed him the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188110170004"/>
               <p>and he gave this receipt—after that Robinson never called on me again—I wrote to him, and went to the office several times—I had several answers, stating that they would pay on the settling day—they had got other moneys of mine; subsequently I went to Bedford Row, and saw Hayes there; he said he would send me a debtor and creditor statement of the moneys they had received, and that I should have the money on their settling day—I have never received a penny of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or of any other money they got for me—they got about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from creditors of mine, I believe—there was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I put into their hands—I thought the society was all right, as I saw the names of other tradesmen in the neighbourhood, and I thought I should be all right—I afterwards saw Haynes, and then applied to the Surrey Petty Sessions at Godstone for a warrant, on which Robinson was arrested at Canterbury—they agreed to collect my debts at 21/2 per cent.; they brought me in their debt 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and wrote me a letter demanding it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Robinson.</hi> You said that I should be charged with solicitor's costs if I interfered—I did not know it had gone into the solicitor's hands—I gave you an acceptance from Haynes, of Brighton, for you to sue upon; the amount was something over 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not propose that you should take the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go towards paying the solicitor's costs; the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had nothing to do with the acceptance—I forget if I sent Mr. Haynes a receipt for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no recollection of consulting Messrs. Rogers and Kent, the solicitors, prior to the meetings of Haynes's creditors—you introduced me to Mr. Kent as your solicitor—I knew that some of my creditors were paying money into the office prior to my receiving this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I never had it—I received a letter from Messrs. Rogers and Kent relative to the meeting of creditors of Mr. Haynes—I knew that they were acting as solicitors to your office—I have received about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from one of my creditors, but I never received any from your office—I don't know who holds the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptance now; I have not seen it since I gave it to you—I did not see it produced at the meeting of creditors in Rogers and Kent's office—I have not received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Dyer—I know no one of the name of Peck—I did not try all I could to get these sums before I put them into the hands of the agency—I only wrote to them for them—Mr. Mann still owes me money—I had about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Parkes's, and I think I had a few shillings of Mr. Roffey—I have never received a halfpenny from your office—I have two of your receipts for money that you received from my customers—I have since placed some of my accounts in the hands of Mr. Rogers, and have got some of the money, not through your agency.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Robinson.</hi> I was not applied to by anybody relative to Mr. Steadman's debt—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Kent, an agent in Brighton, that was a long time after the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was before the meeting of creditors;—I did not receive any acknowledgment for the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Steadman—I wrote to him, and he said he had placed the account in</p>

I replied "Policeman"—then he opened the door, and presented a pistol, and said "Get out, or I will fire"—before I had time scarce to move from the door he fired—he was 3 or 31/2 yards from me then; I saw the pistol in his hand; he took it up and pointed it at me; I heard the bullet; it entered the door of the room close to my head, about 4 feet 9 inches or 5 feet from the ground—he was standing inside the room when he fired—after he had fired I stepped back and he advanced into the passage with the revolver in his hand—I tried to back out of the passage into the street—before I had time to get into the street he fired a second shot towards my face; it passed me and hit a man in the street—he said nothing when he fired—he was about one or two yards from the door—I did not see Eagle shot—when he had fired I got to the outer door, with one foot on the pave<lb/>ment, to go out, and he turned and ran out down the passage and some steps, and I followed him; he turned and came back, and I caught hold of his right hand; he had the revolver in it—he said "All right, I will give if up to you quietly," and he gave it up to me—he said "I have got some shots in my pocket, you shall have them"—he took 42 cartridges from his pocket and gave them to me—he said "I hope I have not injured anyone, have I?" I said "I don't know, I believe you have"—then another constable came and he was taken to the station—I then found out that he had injured this Mr. Eagle—I went back with Inspector Bowles to the prisoner's room—I saw the inspector find five empty cartridges in the bedroom, some close to the fireplace, and some behind the bed; and a spent bullet behind the bed—I examined the pistol, and</p>

I am a mariner, staying at 131, Sun Street, Finsbury—on 20th September last I saw the prisoner at Oberhausen, on the Rhine—from something he said to me he and I came to London together—I brought with me bedding, two large chests, and other articles—when we came to London the prisoner took me and my wife to a coffee-house—the luggage was left at the station—on the following day, the 28th, the prisoner and I went to the railway station in Liverpool Street, where we had some conversation about the luggage, and the prisoner said "We will send the luggage and baggage to the ship France"—I said "Let us go to the ship too;" the prisoner replied "It is not necessary"—a cab was called, and the two chests and other baggage were put upon it—the prisoner spoke to the cabman in English, which I did not understand—we returned to the coffee-house—the prisoner said "You remain with your wife, you had better remain with your family"—from that day until 5th October, when the prisoner was taken into custody, I did not see him—he was then dressed in my clothes, which formed part of the clothes which had been packed up in the chest, and had been sent by the cab—I had never given him autho<lb/>rity to take or wear those clothes.</p>

               <p>went to the station on Thursday, and asked a man about the boxes—there was another man with us—I did not know where the boxes were going, except to the steamer France—I did not exactly charge you with stealing 219 marks—I said before the Magistrate they consisted of gold and silver—before the boxes came back from West Hartlepool I did not find five shirts—I know all my things—they are not all marked—there is neither number nor name—I have one shirt marked "A.

I am an inspector of the Great Eastern Railway Police—on 28th September I was on the arrival platform, when I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor come up with two large boxes—the prisoner asked the fare for a cab to go to St. Pancras Station; I looked at the luggage, and told him the fare—when they were putting the luggage on the cab I noticed that there was no address on the boxes, and I told him it was no use sending the boxes to St. Pancras Goods Station without an address on them and an order to forward, as if they did the boxes would be thrown on the hands of the cabman—the prisoner then took out of his pocket a piece of newspaper, apparently to tear off the white edge and write on it—I said "That won't do; you had better come to my office"—I wrote the address, "Mr. Thompson, 8, Amelia Street," at his dictation—he fastened the cards with that address on to the two boxes, and the cab drove away with the boxes.</p>

I am surgeon to the <hi rend="italic">H</hi> Division of police—on 15th September I saw the prisoner at Leman Street Police-station, about 10 o'clock in the evening; she had been drinking, and was partly under the influence of drink—she said "I have been drinking all day; I went home and nursed my child; I went out again, and came back and found my child dead"—this was said incoherently and unconnectedly—she was continually saying in her drunken sobs that she had killed her child—I asked her some questions in a general way, but only to elicit the same answers as I have given—she gave me to suppose that it was by neglecting it, but she was not clear on the point—it was partly in answer to questions from me—I went to her house with the police-sergeant—I did not gather the direction from the woman—I went into a bedroom on the ground-floor; her husband was there, together with several women, and the dead body of a child on the bed—I examined it; it was very dirty; the finger-nails were black or dark-blue, the lips livid, and the mouth open, from which I concluded that it died in some convulsive struggle; its weight was 6 1/4 lb., which is rather under the average of a newly-born infant—I don't know its age; it had the appearance of a child which had been recently born—the navel string had separated—a child born at the seventh month would be lighter—supposing the child to be born in May it ought to have increased some four or five pounds, if properly nourished and had grown fairly—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion on Saturday 17th; this was the Thursday—I came to the conclusion that the child died from convulsions, from an irritation of the small intestines from pent-up gas—I think that arose from the non-digestion of food that had been given it within the space of a couple of hours—it had evidently had food within that time—there was no food in the whole intestinal track except mother's milk; that portion of the intestines beyond where the obstruction from dilatation of gas had taken place had not received any nutriment for some hours before death, I should say at least 12 hours, and probably much more; in its weak and exhausted state it could not digest the food given later—an infant of that age should be fed every two hours, at least; with in three, except it be asleep; it should never be awakened to be fed—the digestive organs were in a healthy state except being collapsed and pale, so that they were not fit for their functions; they were impaired by the general want of care—that would be brought about by want of sufficient nourishment—I went into the upstairs room; I there found a little crumbled-up bread mixed up with the flock of the bed; that was the only food I saw in the place—it was in a very deplorable, dirty, miserable condition—the proper food for a</p>

               <p>child of this age would be the breast milk, and that alone, unless ordered by a medical man—bread would positively have poisoned it; it was entirely dependent upon its mother's milk—the child's lung was in a very diseased condition—I do not think that caused death, still it might have brought the child into a very low condition—the left lung had never been thoroughly expanded, and besides that it was actually congested.</p>

I live at 52, Back Church Lane, in the same house as the prisoner—she, her husband, and family occupied one room—besides the deceased child there were two, very fine, nice children—the husband works in the docks—I do not know what he earns; he seems to earn enough to pay his way—the two other children were his—the prisoner was confined with this child in May last, I think—sometimes I did not see it for three or four weeks at a stretch, because I was in the habit of going out to work—I might have seen it half a dozen times between its birth and its death—it seemed very healthy when born, but it seemed to pine away very much—I was not present when it died—after it was dead the prisoner put it in my arms, and I took it downstairs—that was on the night of the 15th September—I saw the prisoner suckle it at 7.30 that evening—I had seen her suckle it before—I did not notice whether she was a steady woman, or whether she neglected her home, I had quite enough to notice my own—she seemed very steady whenever I saw her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in the same house as the prisoner—I am her sister-in-law—I saw her very often—I know when the baby was born—I frequently saw her nursing it—she was always at home till she got into company—I remember one night she was out—she knew the child was in good hands; that was about two months ago—she was out all night, and came home in the middle of the day—I heard that her cousin was bad, or something—I brought the child downstairs, and kept it with me all night—she did not ask me to do it—she had got a little drop of drink, and I expect she fell asleep at her cousin's, or else she would have come home to her baby—now and again she would have a drop of drink—she was not an habitual drunkard—she would take a drop, and was very easily led—I was not often with her—I had to mind my work and my children.</p>

I was sent for by the inspector, and saw the prisoner at Leman Street Station—by his direction I went to 52, Back Church Lane, where I saw the child dead; I sent for Dr. Phillips—when I got back to the station the prisoner was charged on her own confession with causing the death of her infant Jane Wiggins, aged three months—the inspector read the charge to her, and she answered "By neglect and intemperance; that is all I have to say"—she had evidently been drinking heavily, and was recovering from it. <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> I saw a loaf on the table when I went to the room.</p>

On the evening of 15th September, about 8.30, I was at Leman Street Station when the prisoner came there—she said "I have come to give myself up for neglecting my child Jane Wiggins; it is dead; I have not done by it as I ought; I have starved it"—I believe the other children are very nice children—the prisoner has been very much given to drink lately—I have seen her in the neigh<lb/>bourhood with other women—I have known her for years by sight—I should say she has been indulging in drink for the last six months—when</p>

I live at 167, St. James's Street—I am a stockbroker—on 4th September I was in Cranbourne Street about 11 o'clock—a man advanced towards me and snatched my gold watch, leaving only two links of the chain—I followed him up the court; there I met three or four more, who kicked me and knocked me down; I bled profusely; when I got up the men had gone—the man who took my watch did not hit me—people came round; the police came up—I after<lb/>wards went to Vine Street and identified the prisoner from half a dozen men—I had been previously shown another man whom I could not identify—there was a gas lamp in Cranbourne Street—Simmonds helped me up; a crowd gathered, and more than one helped me.</p>

               <p>and Simmonds ran by me with a gold chain hanging in his hand; I tried to catch hold of him, but he pushed me on one side—I went down the court and saw Reeder kicking a gentleman lying on the ground—I saw Lamb speaking to a policeman in the middle of the Court; he wanted the policeman to run in a different direction—I have known Simmonds before; I am sure he is the man—I have seen the other prisoners before—I next saw Simmonds in Vine Street; I picked him out at once from about 20—Reeder had a long coat on, not dark but a mixture colour—I gave descriptions of the men to the police—I am sure they are the men—Lamb wore a different hat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were four people in the kitchen preventing my going upstairs, and the moment they heard of somebody falling down-stairs they ran out—there were a whole lot on the landing when I saw somebody lying at the foot of the stairs—it was two minutes alter I noticed deceased lying at the foot of the staircase that I saw people on the landing—the four people" had run upstairs before I noticed the prisoner on the landing—policemen were not in the house before the deceased was thrown downstairs—this staircase is at the back of the house; there is a little bit of a turn to it after you have gone up four stairs—standing in the hall, and looking up the stairs, you can just see the landing—the prisoner had been in the habit of visiting his brother Alfred very frequently, not every Sunday—I had not seen Margaret Hubbard before on that night.</p>

I said "This one"—she said "That is Morris Nicholson"—I and Margaret Hubbard and my brother-in-law, James William Hubbard, then all went upstairs into my father's room—the prisoner went into his brother's room, which was the front room on the same floor—my father had been out while this was going on—he came in, came upstairs, and said "Which one is it struck my daughter?"—he was in his room when he said that—I said "It is Morris Nicholson;" the prisoner was standing close by—then my father went on to the landing, and said "Which one is Morris Nicholson, who struck my daughter?" and then the prisoner said "I am"—some one inside Nicholson's room whom I did not fee said "Let's throw the old b—downstairs, he does not live here," and then I heard something rolling down the stairs, and saw my father lying there—he was picked up by the landlord and policemen—nobody was upon the landing when I saw my father lying at the foot of the stairs.</p>

I communicated with my solicitor, and by his advice applied at the Mansion House for a summons—about two days after the summons was served I received this letter and envelope dated 30th September, 1881, post-mark October 1st—they are also the prisoner's writing.

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of 19, South<lb/>ampton Street, Bloomsbury—on 4th October I was in Drury Lane about 7.15—I saw the prisoner at the mouth of a court—as I came abreast of him he wheeled round and struck me a blow on my chest and laid hold of my watch and chain; he pulled vigorously at it, but it had an indiarubber ring on, and would not come out—he pulled my waistcoat entirely open—the struggle lasted a quarter of a minute—there was a gas-lamp immediately overhead—as soon as my waistcoat opened he bolted down the court—I saw two men at the bottom of the court, and did not go down—I went to Bow Street, related the circumstances, and described the man—a sergeant in plain clothes went with me; we looked in the public-houses, and then came back to Drury Lane—when we reached about 20 yards from the mouth of the court we saw the man leaning against the lamp-post—as soon as he saw us he ran away down the court—the constable ran after him, and secured him—when I came up I immediately identified him as the man who had struck me and endea<lb/>voured to obtain my watch—I could see by the cut of his coat when he was leaning against the lamp that he was like the man—from 10 minutes to a quarter or an hour had elapsed since he attempted to take my watch—the force was sufficient to male the round links oval.</p>

               <p>about 10 minutes—coming from Great Queen Street into Drury Lane I saw the prisoner standing at the end of Prince's Court, leaning against the lamp-post—seeing our approach, he turned sharp round and ran away down the court—we followed him—we did not lose sight of him except for a minute or two—we were about 20 yards off—I saw no one else in the court—turning the court I saw the man still running—I caught him nearly at the end of the court—the prose<lb/>cutor came up, and at once said "That is the man who attempted to steal my watch;" the prisoner said "You are mistaken"—I took him to the station—on the charge being read to him he said "I came to the top of the court to look after my sister; you have got the wrong man."</p>

I have never been locked up in my life before. I told the man I was going to meet my sister, and as I was coming back I was taken.</p>

I am assistant house surgeon at the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital, Spitalfields—I saw the prosecutrix on 4th October; she had been an out-patient before—her right eye shows the mark of a wound which might be caused by the blow of some blunt instrument; an umbrella would cause it—the interior of the eye is dis<lb/>organised—there is no prospect of her regaining her sight—the bleeding took place from the interior of the eye—the other eye may possibly suffer from sympathy, but it does not appear to be affected—I should say she became bund at the time, because there are still remains of the bleeding in the interior of the eye, which could only be caused by the wound—the wound could not be caused by disease—there is a distinct scar on the eye-ball—it must have been the result of great violence—I did not examine her nose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lead and glass merchant, at Stoke Newington—at the end of last year some actions were brought against me by certain creditors, Mr. Russell and Mr. Seale—Mr. Swaine was my solicitor, and I knew the prisoner as his managing clerk—look<lb/>ing at this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I evidently saw Jarvis on the day it is dated, at Mr. Swaine's office—he told me that 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid into Court that day, <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Russell and Seale—I believe that I saw him again the same day, paid him the money, and he gave me this receipt: "Received of W. H. Middleton, 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Russell and Co. and <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Seale, to pay into Court H. Jarvis"—after that I had several conversations with him—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188110170068"/>
               <p>that he could not draw the money out of Court yet, as there were other actions against me, and it would be required—proceedings were being brought against me by Mr. Goringe—about January 22nd I saw Jarvis at the office in King Street—he told me there was an order to pay 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day—I said "It is very short notice to get so large a sum, but I will get what I possibly can"—he said "Do so," and I brought him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes to Groom's Coffee House the day after the conver<lb/>sation, and he said "There is 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already in Court, which I will draw out, and that will make 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we then walked across the road to the New Law Courts—he went upstairs to pay the money in, and I waited for him—he showed me a paper in his hand, which purported to be the pay<lb/>master's signature for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but did not give it to me—he said that it would be all right, they had received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was made a bankrupt in February—an action was brought by my mother against Mr. Swaine—I saw Jarvis about it—he told me that the money could not be taken out of Court until other actions were satisfied—that was previous to my bankruptcy—Jarvis said once that Mr. Swaine was ill, but as he could see him he would write a cheque out and hand it to me, but whether that was after the action of Mrs. Middleton against Swaine I cannot say—Jarvis was trying to arrange with me that part of some money in Court should be arranged with my mother, so that 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money in Court should go to the payment of costs—when I gave Jams the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believed that the 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in Court, and that it would be put to it, and that there was a necessity for paying the money into Court—I knew that on 18th December the execution creditors had been ordered to withdraw, but I can't say whether Jarvis told me that—I saw Mr. Swaine in his office in July; Jarvis afterwards came in, and Mr. Swaine said, "What about this action by Mrs. Middleton and myself?"—I told him that Mrs. Middleton was bringing an action against him; he said that he knew nothing about it—Jarvis said, "You do know about it; I will explain all to you if you will only allow me; I can account for all these moneys if you will only go through my account;" but Mr. Swaine refused, said that he should not touch the books again, and ordered him to leave the office at once.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 40, King Street, Cheapside—the prisoner came to me as my managing clerk in October, 1879, and remained till 27th July, 1881—William Henry Middleton was a client of mine in December, 1880; there were a great many actions against him—Jarvis attended to the business on my behalf, and called on me night and morning, and also on Sundays, and told me of the proceedings in the different actions, I being at that time ill and not able to attend at the office—I had no personal knowledge of the action of Russel v. Middleton or Seal v. Middleton—Jarvis was furnished with proper books; they continued from his predecessor—this is called the receiving-book; it has been my custom for eight or nine years that all sums should be paid into the bank, no matter how small, and all cheques were drawn by me; but when I was ill, instead of paying into the bank, he retained what sums he required for the use of the office, and paid the rest into the bank—if he received 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Middleton in December, 1880, it</p>

I never heard of such a thing; what does it all mean?"—he said, "Well, I can explain, the whole to you"—I said, "Is it the fact that these is an action pending against me for 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Who is the solicitor acting for me? who gave him instructions?"—he said, "I did"—I felt exceedingly angry, at an action being brought against, me and being ripe fox trial without my knowledge, and I ordered Jarvis out of the office—he said, "Let me stop and I can make up all the accounts satisfactorily"—I said, "I have asked you over and over again to let me have your accounts, and you have made all sort, of shuffling excuses, and I intend to make inquiries"—I had asked him to do so many, times, and the books had been brought down to my house, and he made appointments to go through them, but the matter went on for some months—he said, "I should like to make up the accounts," but I refused to have anything to say to him until, he explained, this 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said, "Be good enough, to leave my office," and I locked the door myself—this happened at 6 p.m.—the entries which are in his writing in these books are in the same state as they were then, except this in, red ink—I find here entered on 12th February "Middleton, cash on account 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—it does not specify on what account; it is carried into the ledger in Jarvis's writing, "On account of costs, 12th February, ditto 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—"ditto" means cash; that is in Jarvis's writing—there is no receipt on 22nd February, 1881, in the receiving-book of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Middleton; but there is a payment into the bank on that day on my account of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in his cash book there is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that makes 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; something appears to be dove-tailed in—I have not made inquiries about the numbers of the notes paid in; the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Wilson and Larner, not on Middleton's matter—after I dismissed him in July he had no authority to act in any matters which were in my office—there was a case of Olney in liquidation. I did not authorise him to apply to Mr. Leech to stay execution against Olney; the first I heard of it was on, the morning of his arrest—no sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my credit on any other day on Middleton's account.</p>

                  </hi>. I was unfortunate in business, and was in liquidation this year—Mr. Swaine is my solicitor; Jarvis managed toe entire thing—a creditor named Auguste Guteman and Co. got judgment against me, and there was an order restraining his issuing execution—I saw Jarvis from time to time about the liquidation proceedings; I saw him in August—an order had been made On 27th June under the seal of the Court, and on 29th. July, restraining certain creditors; Jarvis acted for me in obtaining the consent of my creditors to the continuation, of that order, but he informed me that the order had been continued on or about 23rd August; that was the very day I went to Mr. Leach) I under<lb/>stood—it was after I went to Leach—I did not see creditors named Cook and Co., Guteman and Co., or Plunkett and Leader—I found Mr. Hill, the receiver—I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Leach; it was to pay the gas company, and I paid 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were creditors of mine, and I paid it to prevent the gas being cut off—when I employed Mr. Swaine at first he did not attend to the business; I called several times to see him, he was not there, and I saw Jarvis—the he petition was filed, I believe, on 29th July—I asked him to conduct the proceedings for me as there was an execution out against me, and he said he would put Mr. Swaine's name on the proceedings, as he should not like him to think he was taking anything out of the office, and when, he filed the petition, we tried to find Mr. Swaine, but could not—I did not, know that Jarvis had left then—I think Mr. Swaine was away, ill at that time—there were, I think, three creditors appeasing against me then, Barton Cook, and Guteman—Jarvis complained to several times about Mr. Swaine's accounts with him—he went with me to Maidstone to save the estate a, few. days before 23rd August, and again on, the evening of 23rd August I think; that was the very day that the cheque, was given to him—the furniture had been saved.</p>

I took the prisoner on 15th September upon a charge of obtaining 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. McDougall by false pretences—I said "I hold a warrant for your arrest"—he said "Where is it?"—I read it to him; he said "Give it tome"—I said "No, I will read it to you if you like"—he asked me to give it to him again, and then said "I shall not go"—we had a little struggle, and after a little persuasion I took him to the station—this occurred partly in 14, Aster's Row and partly in the street—he was charged on the warrant at the station, and gave his name as the Rev. Charles Edward Clarke—the inspector said "Are you a clergyman?"—he said "Yes, I passed my degree in America"—I said "What is your address?"—he said "Botany</p>

Mace and Co., solicitors—in July, 1872, I became acquainted with Mrs. Trenefidi; she was then living in Upper Parliament Street, Liverpool; I only saw her half a dozen times within three weeks in the early part of July and the beginning of August—I prepared some affidavits for her in an action—she told me her name was Eve Amy Trenefidi, widow; she is in the dock now—she consulted me in reference to the house of Mr. Martin as to whether she or Mr. Martin was liable in respect of some furniture supplied to the house where she was residing in Parliament Street, Clarendon Terrace; I don't remember the number.</p>

I believed you were known there, and I believe ultimately he did—I did not tell him to take you to the police-office—you lay on my father's doorstep at 11 o'clock, and told the people I was your brother, and I denied it—I did not come out and kick you off; I went to the police-station, and said you were a trespasser on my father's premises.</p>

Cameron, and endorsed by him—the cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., though originally crossed, has been marked "Pay cash," and it would be paid to anybody across the counter—as to Boss I first wrote to Cameron and said, "Ross is a new client, and I know nothing of him; is he a substantial man?"—he said, "I knew him several years ago, and have done business with him, although this is the first loan he has had from you, and he is a very respectable man"—on 5th July I advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Ross and Co. on 15 hogsheads and 25 casks of brandy, and received warrants and this acceptance, which is all in Cameron's writing, except the signature "Alexander Ross and Co."—on 14th July I advanced through the defendant 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Loe and Co. on 43 cases of champagne, and also 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 48 cases on 23rd July, and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 27th July on 27 cases of winess and spirits; on 28th July 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Ross and Co. on 25 hogsheads of brandy, and received this acceptance, which is in Cameron's writing, expect the signature—on 29th July I advanced 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 71 cases of champagne; on 5th August 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 44 cases, and on 25th August 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on eight cases of brandy, all to Loe and Co.; that was my last advance—about 23rd August I saw Cameron at 7, Little Tower Street, and he said, "I have an application from Messrs. Culliford for a loan of 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I agreed to advance it; the agreement was drawn up, but I refused to take it or the warrants or the acceptance—I sold a farm in Devonshire, and told Cameron towards the end of August that I should have nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a few days, and after that he said Ollivers had applied for a loan of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some sherry in bond worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per butt; I made inquiries, and then communicated with my present solicitors, who wrote this letter to Cameron.

                  </hi>. I have known Cameron many years—I knew him when he was carrying on a small business in Newgate Street, and sub<lb/>sequently the same class of business in Cheapside—I afterwards heard that he was clerk to a wine merchant in the City—shortly before 21st February, 1881, I had a conversation with him, the result of which was this agreement between us (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), by which he was to be my servant at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and receive 40 per cent, of the profits—my solicitor drew it before entering into it—I inspected some books at Tower Street; they were the ordinary business books, representing the former business, and showing that he had customers all over the country—I made a few loans, and had the greater portion of the goods valued—Mr. Hiscock subse<lb/>quently took them over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of the Poultry—on 10th May, 1880, Death called on me with another person to bring about a settlement between his sister and her husband—she derived property from her first husband, and wanted the Court to enforce a settlement of it for the benefit of her children by him—Death said that the papers were in the hands of another solicitor, Mr. Philp, and went with me to Mr. Philp to get them away, and gave me authority to pay his charges—I got them next day, the 11th, and got Death's order in writing, which was signed on. the 10th or 11th; this is it—I paid five guineas out of my pocket—I Then laid the papers before Counsel—I acted all through for Death only not a word was ever said about costs—I never said or undertook that the whole costs should be covered by 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or I should have put it in the retainer—the business went on—I acted under Mr. Bower's advice, who said that an action was not tenable, and after a (Treat deal of corre<lb/>spondence a settlement was arrived at—I first saw him on 10th May, had the deed is dated 10th June—I received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 14th June I aid 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is the receipt—there was a mortgage on the house which was to form part of the settlement—Wells had taken the deeds away and pledged them—the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the mortgage, not for costs—I don't know whether the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Is included in the costs—the difference between that and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Is 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a balance in my hands of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was applied to three or four times for my bill of costs, and have got the letters here—the decree was not completed till the end of August, and the long vacation ensued, and on 22nd November Death appeared at my</p>

               <p>office with Mrs. Wells—she was very excited and violent, and I saw that I could not talk to Death unless she was out of the room—when she was out of the office Read, my clerk, brought in the bill of costs—I said, "Sit down; here is the bill; go through it"—he looked at the items—I said, "I have not got it copied, I did not know you were coming; here is the draft, you go through it, and we will settle it now"—he said, "I have had certain money on account," and pencilled it all down, and said, "11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Is the balance due to me"—I said, "Very well," and gave him a cheque for it—my clerk was there; somebody else was announced, and Death went into the next room to Mrs. Wells, and said, "I have settled it, come and get the cheque; come along"—not ft word was said about his agreeing for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor did he say that he took that on account—I was sued in the City of London Court for the difference between the amount of the bill and the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first intimation I had of it was this letter from York and Walton, of 7th January, asking for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had had a letter from Boydell before the settlement—I was sued in April—I attended before the Commissioner, who said, "Did you receive 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You paid so and so, and so and so, and you have 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In hand, and you must pay it"—it was rapidly done; no witnesses were examined on either side—I asked for a new trial, and filed an affidavit—there is not a word of truth in the statement that I agreed to do all the work for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Death some time—I made his ac<lb/>quaintance at a meeting of creditors—I did a little business for him once, before—a client of mine prosecuted him for obtaining goods by false pre<lb/>tences; it was not unsuccessful—I did not do business for him till this business—although I had prosecuted Mm I did not take luncheon with him—I did not meet him at Prince's Restaurant; he may have come after me there—this is the letter I received from York and Walton: "We are instructed by Mrs. Wells to apply to you for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., balance of money after paying your costs, and to hand over all documents, and unless the same is paid before Wednesday next, legal proceedings will be taken against you—the prisoner is Mrs. Wells's trustee, and I should think he was the proper person to sue—he did not sue as her trustee in the Commissioners Court—he never went into the box or came forward as the trustee under the deed—I don't think I said at the commence<lb/>ment of the transaction "You know, Death, I shall not hurt you as to costs"—I don't think I said that the old woman was desirous of keeping down the costs as low as possible—he did not a day or two after I gave him the retainer ask me what my charge would be, nothing like it, I swear that—there was no discussion as to costs at any time. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Listen to this: "I hope you will not charge much, as you know, Death, I shall not hurt you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know of anything of the kind, and I am pretty sure he did not say anything of the kind. Before the settlement I was asked three or four times to settle the matter—he called twice or three times; we went through the call-book at the police-court—I did not see him repeatedly outside; I saw him once or twice—I received a letter, in August from Boydell and Co., his solicitors, requesting me to furnish them with my bill of costs; I did not send it because I met Mr. Boydell—I did not furnish any bill of costs till the verdict was given against me in the Commissioners' Court this year, and for this reason, the bill of costs was copied, Mr. Death promised to call for it after the settlement,</p>

               <p>he did not call for it, and I did not know his address, as he had moved, but he might have called the following day, but I do not think he called once, because he could have had the bill—I did not make a claim of set-off because the account was settled for a cheque for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (the cheque is a receipt), nor did anybody on my behalf—the matter was rather hurried, and as soon as he got hold of the cheque he went out, and said to Mrs. Wells "We have settled the matter, and I have got the cheque for the balance of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I swear I heard him use the word "balance"—Mr. Justice Field and Mr. Justice Grove dismissed his application, and Mr. Justice Field said that no did not believe a word of what was in the affidavit—the application was to get the amount of the judgment from Boydell—after I prosecuted him he persisted in claiming this money still—some of the statements in the affidavit may be correct—I showed him the whole of it; was in draft, and it was copied next day—he promised to call for it, and he removed, and I did not know his address—York and Walton were not concerned, and never asked me for the bill of costs'—Mrs. Wells came in in an excited state on 27th November, and said that I had got her money, or words to that effect—she said that the chairs and tables in the room were bought with her money—I had not to put her out by force; Death persuaded her to go out, and I put my hand on the back of her chair and said "Really you must not make a noise in my office; you must go outside"—as to my taking the chair from under her, she slid down—she brought an action against me for assault—I do not think she has asserted that I agreed to do this for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or for a certain price: not to me—I read the affidavit in support of the application for a new trial, and took proceedings upon it—Death did not say to me on 10th June "Why, I have done all the work; I have done aft the messages"—I did not hear it said "You ought not to want more than this, because, I have done all the work"—they did not know what I was going to charge at that time; I swear that—I did not furnish a Mil of costs between July and August, because the work was not done—I was instructed after that to apply for payment of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think that was in August; it was some time after the deed, and I registered that on 20th August—the work I have charged for was completed about the middle of September—I did not know that I had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In hand—the last date in my bill of costs is 21st August, but I think there was some other correspondence which does not appear in the bill—there still is the legal estate outstanding, and I was endeavour<lb/>ing to get that estate retransferred to Death—I did not send in my bill and remit the balance, because my impression was that there was nothing coming to him, not even 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. no doubt I ought to have sent it in before, but my business would not allow me to do so.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 23, Gloucester Street, Pimlico—on 25th August I left town with, my wife, leaving my house safely locked up—I returning on 22nd September received information from a work-man named Bellamy, who had been engaged with others in painting my house—I found the drawers in two wardrobes had been broken open, the contents scattered about, and various articles of jewellery, two clocks, and three shawls stolen, worth altogether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheffonier had been locked—I found this handkerchief produced, on the bed in the back bedroom, first-floor; it is marked "G. Pope," and was covered with blood; there is a ship marked on it, and the words, "All on account of Eliza;" I handed it to the police—there were marks of blood on the end rail of the stairs, on the dining-room table, and in the bedrooms—in the attic a desk had been broken open and papers scattered about, many of which were covered with blood—the glass of the area door was broken, and the cloth which I presume had been used in breaking it was lying in the area.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the handkerchief was produced at the police-court I believe the prisoner said that he had not had it in his possession for some time—I do not think he said, "I know nothing about it," I think he admitted it; he might mean, "I know nothing about that handkerchief being in the house."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 22nd of September, about 9.15, I received information; I saw Bellamy, and went to the area door of 23, Gloucester Street, in which a square of glass had been broken, on the right-hand side farthest from the lock—a person putting his arm through the aperture could unlock the door, as the key was inside—the glass was all removed, and there was considerable difficulty in tailing that it had been broken, unless a person looked very carefully from the pavement—I noticed blood on the banisters leading upstairs and on the side of the wall, as if a person had been feeling his way up—the drawers in the front bedroom were open—I saw blood in the attic; a desk there having been broken open, and the window was open—I communicated with Clough, and on the 26th December he brought the prisoner to the station with this handkerchief which was found in the house—I looked at the prisoner's left hand, and at the marks on the handkerchief, and pointed out to the prisoner that they corresponded—it was spread on the table, and he said "That is my handkerchief."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one else saw the handkerchief; he said that voluntarily before I mentioned anything about the marks corresponding, or before any one ascertained that he had marks on his wrist corresponding—I heard him say at the police-court that he had not seen it for a month; it is impossible to say how the glass of the area door had been cut, as it was cleared away—I believe there was one small corner; the edge there showed that it was not cut with a diamond, it appeared to have been broken out—it is the duty of the constable on the beat to look after the doors, and turn their bull's-eyes on them, but it would be very difficult to see that this glass had been removed—the hole was about seven or eight inches square—there were nine panes altogether; the lower part of the door was wood—the house was reported as unoccupied, and it would be the constable's duty to keep a special eye on it.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother; we live with our father in Rutland Street, Pimlico—we went hopping in September, and returned together to London on the Monday before September 11—on Tuesday evening, 20th September, we went to Birdcage Walk to hear the soldiers play, at 10 o'clock, and then we went round the Haymarket for a walk, and before we came home we found a bottle in St. James's Park; that was as we were going towards the Haymarket—it was about 10.30, when we were returning home—on the way home we were playing with the bottle in the Park, throwing it in the air and trying to catch it, and my brother, in attempting to catch it, fell on it and cut his wrist, and we went home and went to bed—there was a pump in the Park, and I held his hand over it to wash the blood off it, but going home it got saturated with blood again—we went home to our father's house—we got there about 11 or a quarter past—my brother slept in the same bed with me, and in the night he woke me up, and said his hand was very painful, and he thought he would get up and go to the hospital—I got up and went with him to St. George's Hospital—he woke me up two or three times—he would have gone before, only it was raining so hard—he had it dressed by die doctor, and then we went straight home again and went to bed together—he was in bed with me in the morning—on the Wednesday I believe I was in his company all day, but I won't be certain—he slept at home on the Wednesday night in the same bed with me—on Wednesday morning we went to the hospital again—I have seen this handkerchief before, but I have lost sight of it perhaps two months or more; if I had seen it I should have known it by the writing on it—I should have been sure to have seen it if he had it while we were hopping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crosss-examined.</hi> My father is a stoker; I am a labourer—I was looking for employment after returning from hopping—my brother has been on the Warspite for three years—I believe he deserted; he is not in the navy now—he was in a merchant ship, but has not any ship at present—he slept in my father's house on Monday night, 19th—he was not con<lb/>stantly in the habit of stopping out—we have not both been locked out of a night—we are not constantly in the habit of sleeping in stables, because we cannot get into our father's house, but we did so when we went to a music hall with a friend, and he was too late to get in, and we thought we would sleep with him in a stable; that was only once—on this Tuesday night we started from home at a quarter or ten minutes to six—we went for a walk till 9.30 we Warwick Street and round Buckingham Palace Road, and at 9.30 we went to the tattoo, and stopped till it was over—we then went to the Haymarket, and walked about for about ten minutes, and then took our way home, down the Duke of York's Steps and through St. James's Park, but we had picked up the bottle in the Park before we went there, about 10.5—the bottle was thrown too far from my brother's reach; it fell to the ground and smashed, and he fell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188110170114"/>
               <p>on it; it was a champagne bottle—this happened between New Palace Yard and the Duke of York's Steps—we had picked the bottle up about 10.30—we could see it when it was thrown up; it was in the broad part—we carried it about the Haymarket, walked about with it, and brought it back again—we had thrown it up two or three dozen times—the game was, whoever caught it to throw it up again, and we both ran to catch it at the same time, one being a little nearer to it than the other—we started this game just as we came down the Duke of York's Steps, and we broke it nearly opposite Old Palace Yard, and in that interval we threw it up about three dozen times—it was not a light night, but there were lamps—it was not raining—the bottle had no cork in it—we got home about 11.30—we walked down Denby Street that night, and passed Gloucester Street, but we never went near number twenty-three—I have passed it, but how was I to know that it was uninhabited? I did not know it—my brother said at the police-court that he had a witness at the back to prove that he had a splint on his hand, at the time I was there—I did not volunteer to give evidence—he called his father, but I was not there then—I did not tell the inspector at the police-station that the bottle was broken in Battersea Park; I told him nothing about the bottle whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No solicitor or Counsel represented him—we kept walking towards home as we were throwing up the bottle—since my brother left the Warspite he has been several voyages on merchant ships—as soon as I heard my brother was taken I went to the station to know what he was taken for—he slept at home every night after we returned from hopping until he was taken into custody—he may have gone down Gloucester Street on Tuesday night, the 20th; I won't be certain—my brother had nothing to do with breaking into any house while he was in my company, nor have I ever had anything to do with such a thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband at 28, Rutland Street, Pimlico; the Popes live there—I remember the prisoner being away hopping; he returned only two or three days before he was taken into custody—on this Wednesday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I saw his hand was bound up; his mother was dressing it, and I said that it seemed a very bad place—I had gone up to bed before he came home on the night before, but I had not gone to bed; I heard some one come in—I saw him on the Wednesday night at 10 o'clock having his supper in the washhouse—I have seen this handkerchief in the wash—I have done his washing for him over four years; the last time I saw it was in July; I know that, because on 28th July we went to a school excursion at Hampton Court, and I have washed for him every week since, but did not see it afterwards—I asked him what ship it was on it, and he said it was the name of his ship—I said nothing to him about the handkerchief after 28th July, but I never saw it afterwards, though I continued wash<lb/>ing for them up to the last week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The handkerchief was generally downstairs in the washhouse for two or three days—he was at home from July to Sep<lb/>tember, except when he was hopping, and I did his washing every week—I cannot say whether he was ever on board a ship—I washed for him every week when he was at home, but not when he was away; I can't say how many weeks I washed for him after 28th July—I had not seen the hankerchief the week before 28th July; I don't remember whether</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stoker, and have been in the employ of Octavius Smith and Sons, Grove Road, Pimlico, 24 years—the prisoner is my son—he was at one time on the Warspite, and has been on some coasting ships since—the last time he went away was Whit Sunday morning; he was away five or six weeks, but I can't tell you on what day he came back—he then lived with me till he went hopping at Wateringbury, in Kent; that was the last day of August, or a day or two earlier—he returned home on, I think, 19th September; it was a Monday night; he then slept at home every night till he was taken—I remember seeing his hand bound up—I go out very early in the morning, and go to bed about 7 o'clock, and when I come out I ask my wife if the boys are in, and if they are not she says "No"—I never knew my son in any trouble of this kind before; I never knew him to steal a farthing—he has been rather too fond of life and too lively and fond of skylarking, but I never knew him to commit any offence—I am sure there is no conviction against him—I never locked him out at night; when they like to come home they always do so; he has never been in the habit of sleeping out at night that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was not so lively that I would not allow him to sleep in the house when I was at home—I never turned him out; I deny <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> that my sons dare not come to my house when I am at home—I can't tell what he has been doing since July; I have given him board and lodging—he did not like the Warspite, and he ran away two or three times; my wife was very angry about it, and asked me if I would take him back and see if I could not get his discharge, and I went with this detective, Clough, two years ago last August and saw the captain about him; he was discharged at Charlton Pier, where the Warspite was lying—I do not know where the William was, from which he was dis<lb/>charged on 29th July—he was never convicted, but he was locked up for throwing a stone when he was a mere boy at school—he was out hopping three weeks from September 2nd to the 17th, when he was paid off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never saw this handkerchief in the house since 28th July, when I think my mistress was ironing it, and I asked her what those marks were; he had it given to him on the 28th, when he</p>

               <p>was going to St. Gabriel's school treat; I have no doubt that he was at that school treat on 28th July, and his mother gave him the handkerchief clean that morning—it is seven or eight years since he was locked up for throwing a stone in the street; he has also been locked up for bathing in the Thames; also when a policeman went into a public-house with some soldiers, and the boys shouted out that he was drinking on duty, and he took my boy in custody for an assault, but he was discharged; if he had committed any act of dishonesty I should have known it—he had been at home a week or more when he went to the school treat, but I can't say because I work day and night, and sometimes I do not see my children all the week.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—I gave him this handker<lb/>chief clean on 29th July, when he was going to St. Gabriel's, Pimlico, school treat at Hampton Court—I have never seen it since till now—the letters were very bright then—I have never had it to wash since—I remember his hand being cut; I first saw it on Wednesday morning, 21st; he was in bed; it had been dressed by the surgeon then, but I dressed it at 8.30—he came home, I think, in July from his last ship; that may have been a week, I think, before the school treat—I remember his going away hopping and coming back; he slept at home every night afterwards till he was taken in custody.</p>

On 6th September I received a warrant to search the prisoner's house, 171, Church Street, Deptford—I got there about 8 o'clock, and saw the two prisoners in the back room—I called them into the shop and said, "I am inquiring for a piece of woollen cloth stolen from High Street, Deptford"—the man said "I have not bought any;" the woman said "Neither have I"—I took them into the back parlour and read the search warrant—she then said "I did buy a piece of red flannel of the boy"—I directed her husband to fetch it, which he did, and produced this plaid—the sergeants who were with me searched the place—it is what is called a "leaving" shop—there were a quantity of rags there, and old lamps and fiat irons.</p>

I went with Inspector Phillips to the prisoner's house; I corroborate what he says; he remained downstairs, and Sergeant Francis and I went upstairs—I opened a box, saw this piece of dress, and said to Cave, "Here is some more stuff similar to that below; how do you account for that?"—he said, "I do not know," and called his wife upstairs—I said, "Mrs. Cave, here is another piece of stuff; in fact, here are a great many pieces; how do you account for this?"—she said, "I have been in business some years ago, and have had them by me ever since; that is not stolen"—I said, "Well, that may be so"—I saw these other things there, left them there, and went down with the male prisoner and told them both that they would be charged with receiving 40 yards of plaid, knowing it to be stolen—she said, "Yes, I did buy it of a lad, but there was not 40 yards"—the man said, "I know nothing about it"—I went again Best morning by daylight, and brought this piece away, with some other property, and when Mr. Turner saw it he said, "That is mine; that has been stolen"—I said to the female prisoner, "You spoke of that last night, and that has been stolen from Mr. Turner's' shop"—she made so answer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It has happened that I have received the instalments brought by customers, and the prisoner has entered the receipts; that might happen every week, or it might not—when I received money from him in the Borough office I told him to enter it in the ledger; I never entered it myself when he received it—there are two ledgers, one in the City and one in the Borough—the Borough ledger was kept in the prisoner's office, and if he was there he would make the entries; if he was not there I or my partner would enter in it—it was his duty to see customers, and press for money due—he has not actually signed a receipt for money which I have received; when he received it he always gave a receipt himself—it would not be possible that he gave a receipt where I received the money—I may have said before the Magistrate "I have been there when the prisoner has given receipts for money I have taken; when we have both been in the office together the money might be taken by the prisoner and by me, but it was always the prisoner's duty to give the receipt"—if it is in the depositions I said so; it is quite possible that the money was paid to me, and that he gave the receipt—when money was paid to me I put it in a box where the stamps were, and he</p>

I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 13, Garden Row, Southwark; I was married to him nine years ago; he is a basket maker—about four months before this matter happened I left him because of his violence; he said he would kick me out, and I walked out—I went to a friend and borrowed some money to start with, and took a place—he interfered with me; he has thrown pails of water on me—on the Sunday before I went to the police-court something occurred, in con<lb/>sequence of which I took out a summons, and on 24th September I was outside the Lambeth Police-court waiting for the summons to be heard when the prisoner came up to me with something wrapped in paper in his two hands, carrying it in front of him; he asked me what I intended doing—I said I intended to see the Magistrate for some protection—he said, "You do then?"—I said, "I do"—I turned my head away from him to listen to what a gentleman was calling out to see if it was my summons, and as I got on the step I received a fearful blow from some<lb/>thing, I don't know what, on the back of my head; I fell and became insensible, and remember no more—when I came to myself I went to the police-station across the road and had my head dressed—I was wearing this sealskin hat at the time—I have not recovered from the effects of the blow, I am still under care at Guy's Hospital; I have suffered severely, my neck is all in lumps.</p>

I live at 111, Tabard Street, Borough—I am a domestic servant—on 24th September I was at the Lambeth Police-court along with my master and mistress, Mr. and Mrs. Williams—the prisoner lived in our house during the time he was out on bail—I saw the prisoner speaking to his wife; he asked her what she meant to do—she said she meant to punish him for what he had done, and to have protection from him—he then asked us to see if we could come to terms with her, so that she should not go into Court, and so save his brother's bail—he said he would come to any terms; he would pay for the summons, and promise not to interfere with her provided he did not see her with any other man, and those rights he would not give up for any one—Mrs. Searle did not take any part in this conversation; she was just about to enter the Court—she said to her friend Mrs. Jennings, "Come on, or our case will be on;" and just as she was on the steps and going to enter the door I saw the prisoner raise his hand and hit her on the head with a poker that he had in the paper—I could not say how hard he hit her—I did not see her fall down—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him, halloaing "Police!" and when I turned the corner he was caught—he threw what he had in the paper into the road—I had seen the paper in his hand, and I asked him what it was, and he said, "A witness"—I said, "What is it?" he said, "It is a witness that you know nothing about;" he did not say it was a poker—after he hit her some part of it came out of the paper, and I screamed out, "It is our kitchen poker!"—it looked like it.</p>
