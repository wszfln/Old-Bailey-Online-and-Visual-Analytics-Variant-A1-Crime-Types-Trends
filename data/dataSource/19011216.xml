I live at 41, Langdale Street, and occupy the ground floor—Avey occupies the first floor front room—she is married—I do not know what her husband is—on November 21st, about 1 p.m., I was sitting in the kitchen—I heard a noise in the passage—my dresser, which is in the kitchen, began to shake—I went into the passage, and saw two men dragging a box; one of them was Henry Grimme—I said to him in Yiddish, "Why do you drag such heavy things, and knock down my dresser?"—they were with the female prisoner, who can speak Yiddish—I asked them to pay me the damage—a jug had been broken, the damage amounts to £1—they attacked me violently in the passage—I went for a policeman—I did not go up to the room—I saw a van</p>

On November 21st, about 2 p.m., I went to 41, Langdale Street, with other officers—I found the front door open—I saw Avey sweeping the stairs down, and among some rubbish I noticed some loose tea—I said, "We are making inquiries respecting some stolen tea which we have reason to believe is in this house"—she is English—she said, "I do not know anything about it"—I followed her upstairs to the first floor front room, where I saw two chests of tea standing behind the door, one having been broken from a fall in the passage—they have been identified by Mr. Fox—I said to Avey, "How do you account for these?"—she said the room was occupied by her brother and his wife—I said, "How do you account for these?"—she said, "Two men have just brought them up here; my brother is not in this as he is at work on a moving job, I wish I was too, then I should not have been in this mess"—I saw no one else there—I took her into custody, and took charge of the tea—she was taken to the station, and charged with being concerned with others in stealing eight chests of tea value £40, the property of Messrs. Macnamara—she said "I did not know anything about it until the men came up with the tea; I have seen one of the men talking to my brother in the house once before"—I was at the station when George picked out Charles—I had received a descrip<lb/>tion of a man from George—before he picked him out he had not seen anybody else do so—nobody pointed him out to George—the furniture in Avey's room was packed up—the chairs had been placed on the couch, which had been pulled up near the window, and the other pieces of furniture had been laid on top of the bed; it had evidently been cleared away to make room for the chests—there would have been room to put the other six chests as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Kensington Park Gardens—last September I was living with the prisoner at 406, Clapham Road—I am a depositor in the Post Office Savings' Bank, and had a Savings' Bank Book—I have not got it, now—I do not know where it is—it was described as "Hillhead, Glasgow, 2600A"—I last saw it in September last at 406, Clapham Road—I was going away and I thought it would be better under lock and key, and I gave it to the prisoner to put into her safe—I gave her instructions to send it up in October for the interest to be made up, the date of the anniversary of the date when the account began—in October I asked the prisoner if the book had been sent up to the post office for the interest to be made up—she replied that it had been sent to the post office—I was still living with her then—I have not withdrawn any money since I put the book into her care in September—I have not seen the book since—I have not received any money from the prisoner—I never gave her any authority to withdraw any money for me—the signature "Florence Fleetwood Taylor" on this notice of withdrawal, dated October 4th, for £5 is not mine, and was not written with my sanction—the signature on this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) for £5 dated October 4th is not in my writing—this notice of withdrawal for £3 dated October 8th, is not in my writing or written with my authority—this receipt for that £3 is not in my writing, and is not signed with my authority—I think it bears a very strong</p>

I am counter clerk at the Sloane Square Branch Post Office—I was on duty there on October 4th—the prisoner came in and said she had telegraphed to the post office for £5—she produced a deposit book "Hillhead, Glasgow, 2600A"—I looked to see if I had the authority, and I then produced the receipt for the money which I asked the prisoner to sign—she did so in my presence—I compared her signature with the signature in the book—I was not satisfied with it, and I told her she must bring further particulars as to her identity, and she said she would give me proof of her identity—Miss Reader, the supervisor, was in the post-office, and I showed her the receipt—the prisoner went out and returned after about half an hour, and brought a witness with her—she said the lady knew her—I said to the lady did she know her, and she said yes she did—I do not think any name was mentioned—the prisoner signed a receipt form in the presence of the witness, and I got the witness to write her name on the back—this is it "Agnes Wright, 120, Bedford Road, Clapham"—the prisoner also brought a dividend warrant, some letters, and a receipt for some books, all in the name of Miss Taylor—I did not ask the witness if she knew the prisoner as Florence Fleetwood Taylor—I remember the prisoner coming on October 8th—she filled up a notice of withdrawal for £3 in the name of Miss Taylor—I paid her the money as I had paid her the money on the former occasion—she came again on the 23rd, and I paid her 8s.—there was a notice of withdrawal on this occasion also—I saw her on three occasions, and I have no doubt about her—when I next saw her she was at Bow Street.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Biggs of 74, Tufton Street, Westminster—the prisoner has lodged there, for the last two years—he is no relation of ours—on October 18th I had been out, and came home with my daughter about 10.40, and as soon as I got to the kitchen door the prisoner said, "Will you take your things off?"—I said certainly not, my servant will do all—he ran to the fireplace, seized the poker—struck me on my face and knocked me down and said, "Now I will cut your b—throat"; he seized a knife—I put up my hand to save my throat, and he cut me across my hand with one of these knives (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>). I believe it was the little one—he ran to the next room and said, "Oh, I have been and cut Mrs. Biggs throat this time"—I was taken to an hospital—I had done nothing to provoke the prisoner, I have been a mother to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of music of 118 and 120, Charing Cross Road—I came over to London in August of this year to start a school—I went to live at 20, Bloomsbury Street, where the prisoner was living—I became friendly with him—I told him my business, and he said that he could assist me; that he was a jeweller, and that his father had a house in Berkeley Square; that he had stock in his shop at the corner of Gracechurch Street, and other shops elsewhere, and that he was a detective—I asked for his advice—he brought me a power of attorney, dated November 5, 1901, which I signed—I was negotiating about taking No. 118, Charing Cross Road, and I gave him directions to carry out that with Messrs. Salmony &amp; Co.—I had great confidence in him—he bought some furniture from them for me—on October 31st he brought me a receipt for £2 15s. for the furniture, and I paid him that amount—I believed he had paid it, and that it was a proper receipt from Messrs. Salmony—I told him I wanted a brass plate for the door, and he ordered it—on November 16th he told me he had paid £4 17s. 6d. for it, producing a receipt, and on the strength of that I paid him—on November 11th I directed him to get a page-boy's suit of clothes, for which he represented that he had paid £3 12s. 6d., and produced a receipt, which I paid, believing it to be <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>—I also</p>

Baker &amp; Co.—he said, "Oh, all right"—on the following day I went into his room at 20, Bloomsbury Street, where I arrested him, and found in a desk on the second floor the genuine Salmony's receipt—on the evening I arrested him, I went to 118, Charing Cross Road and found one of the rooms locked—I took the key from the prisoner, and opened the room—I found the exhibits produced 4, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, and a power of attorney in a table drawer—they are the genuine receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Clovelly Street, Homerton, and am a turf commission agent—I have known the prisoners a little over two years on turf transactions, and I have also lent them money—on October 23rd I saw Levens at his house at 16, Gainsborough Road, Hackney Wick—he came to the door, I said "Is there any business"—he said, "You have been intimate with my wife"—he used the word "intimate"—I asked him what he meant—he said that I had had connection with his wife—I said "I have not, I wish to be confronted with your wife"—he called her down, and I said to Mrs. Levens "Your husband has accused me of having connection with you, is there any truth in it?"—she said "No, he wants money"—Levens heard that, and said "I want £10 or I will go and tell your wife"—I walked out of the house making no reply, and he followed me and said, "I won't be hard on you, I will take £20"—I said I would not give him 20 pence, and went away—he called at my house the next day alone, and said "What do you intend to do"—I said "What do you mean"—He said "If you don't give me £20 I will make a scene"—I said "What you accuse me of is utterly false, I will not give you a penny, and if you come again I will take proceedings against you"—He went away—I made a communication to Detective Crutchett next day, the 25th, and on Saturday, the 26th, a knock came to the door, and my clerk opened it—Levens was there—I was in the office, my clerk called me, I went to the door and Levens said "I have come to square the matter, I want £20 or I will knock it out of you"—he was alone—I made no answer, and he went away—on the 28th I saw him outside my gate with his wife, and the prisoner Reed and his wife—they knocked, my wife opened the door, and called me down—I went down—Levens was at the door, and the other three were outside the gate—Levens said "Give me</p>

               <p>the money," I said "No, certainly not, you will get nothing out of me"—my wife was there but nothing was said about her—I had told her about his previous visits—he took me by my neck and pulled me off the door-step, inside the passage—there is a little passage about four feet from the door—he hit me on my face with his fist, and I fell—I got up and pushed him up again—we got outside the gate into the middle of the road—he then kicked me in the pit of my stomach and in my groin—I fell, and when I was down Reed came and hit me with this stick (<hi rend="italic">Produced)</hi> behind my ear—he was carrying the stick in his hand; there is lead at the bottom of it—my brother-in-law, Matthew Fitzpatrick, came out and pulled him off me—I was on the ground at the time—Fitzpatrick got the stick—Reed struck me twice—this was about 7.45 p.m., it was quite dark—I only had my trousers and stockings and shirt on, I was changing my clothes when Levens knocked—I have been very deaf since Reed struck me behind my ear—I have suffered great pain, and am under the doctor still—when Levens came to the door on the 28th he asked me to close the door, so that my wife should not hear—I said "My wife knows all."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIRON</hi>. I am a commission agent on the turf, and do a little betting—I have no other occupation—after the interview of October 23rd when the suggestion was made about my conduct with Mrs. Levens, I never went to the prisoner's house again—I was determined to have nothing more to do with him, but he came to my house on the 24th and 26th—up to the time Mrs. Levens came down on the 23rd, nothing had been said about money—I said to her "Your husband accuses me and you of having connection, is there any truth in it"—she said "No, he wants money"—what I said at the police Court was "I called on October 22nd and saw Levens, etc. I asked him to fetch her face to face;" that is true—I was there on the 22nd, but I wasn't accused till the Wednesday—there was no accusation against me on the Tuesday—the accusation was made on the Wednesday—the wife did not say, in her husband's presence, that I had been guilty of impropriety with her, nor did I say "Is not it a matter which can be arranged by money," nor did Levens say "I don't want your dirty money, I will find out all about it, and, unless you have got some explanation of this, I shall bring the matter into Court."—I saw him at my house on the 24th—he did not ask me again whether this had taken place—he came again on the 26th alone, but his wife followed after him—she did not in his presence and in the presence of Fitzpatrick repeat the charge, she was outside the gate; she did not come up—I did not tell her on the occasion that she was lying, nor did I say "Well, go away, and come again on Monday"—Mrs. Reed was also present—I did not expect them to come on Monday—Fitz<lb/>patrick came almost every night—my father was there, he was on a holiday from the north of England—I was not at the door when Levens came, I was upstairs, and I heard my wife talking to somebody—I did not hear Levens say to her "If he is innocent, then let him say so before you and my wife"—I went down when my wife called me—I did not assault him on his repeating the charge—I did not get hold of him till he hit me—he asked me to close the door so that my wife should not hear, when I went down I asked him what he wanted—the first act of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190112160025"/>
               <p>assault was his getting hold of me, and pulling me off the door-step into the middle of the road—I did not seize hold of him, nor did we both struggle till we fell—Fitzpatrick and my father did not then come out—Mrs. Levens and Mrs. Reed were outside the gate—I deny that there ever was any impropriety between me and Mrs. Levens, I never behaved improperly to her.</p>

Reed was only present on the last occasion the 26th—there was not some question of Mrs. Reed being called,' nor did Reed say "Go and call her"—I do not suggest that they both attacked me at the same time—Fitzpatrick did not attack Reed—I was on the ground when Fitzpatrick was fighting with Reed, and Levens was on the top of me, and Reed came and hit me behind the neck—I went my usual round next day to collect slips, and I went to the Court in the early morning to get a warrant.</p>

               <p>—there was a severe contusion on the back of his left ear and another on the muscles at the back of his neck—this stick may have caused those injuries—he complained of his thigh, and I found an abrasion of the skin of his right ham, another at the lower part of his abdomen, and he suffered from general shock—he is still under my care—the deafness which he suffers from would arise from a blow behind his ear—there was more swelling the next day.</p>

It would not be correct to say that he was so deaf that he could only understand by movements of the lips—the mark on his hip might be caused by a fall—the swelling on his groin could hardly be caused in a struggle, and one man falling with his knee on the other; it was most likely caused by a violent blow, and not by his falling on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a portmanteau maker, and am acquainted with the leather trade—I am undergoing eighteen months imprisonment at Pentonville Prison—I pleaded guilty to uttering four cheques, one to Mr. Chance of Smith's Stores, Kew Bridge, for £8 10s.; one to Mr Davies, of St. Margaret's for £9; one to Mr. Holloway, of St. Margaret's, for £12 4s., and one to Mr. Sanders, butcher of St. Margaret's for £12.—I have known Russell about 12 months, Kimpton about 12 months, and Coleman from about the beginning of June this year, by the name of Dr. Ross—the four of us were frequently together from about the beginning of June—we usually met at the Hop Poles public house, Hammersmith—we met there on June 25th the day before I went to St. Margaret's and an arrangement was made that I should go and ask for Mrs. Gregory's accounts as she was going to pay them—I was to bring the accounts back to Russell, he told me where to go—on June 26th I met Coleman, Russell, and Kimpton—Ross and Kimpton waited behind at a public house—Russell pointed out three shops Davies', Holloway's and Sander's—I got the accounts and gave them to Russell who pinned cheques on them and told me to pay them—Ross and Kimpton were present—I got receipts and £23 odd change—I drove back to Richmond in a cab to the Cobwebs public house where we all four met—we went to another public house so that there should be no tracing the cab—as far as I know the money was divided equally, and we then parted—Russell tore up the receipts—the change was in gold and silver and one £5 Bank of England note—soon after we met at the Hop Poles and I went with a cheque to Mr.Woodyard's, a leather merchant—Russell and I went in with the cheque—Russell paid the cheque, received the change and I chose the leather—the change was divided in a public house close by, I got my share, but I do not remember the amount—I remember going to a Mr. Taylor with a cheque—Russell and I only were concerned with the cheque—Kimpton knows nothing about it—Russell changed the cheque and received the change and I chose the leather.—I remember going to Smith's Stores, at Kew Bridge—the first time I was sent by Russell alone, but they did not change the cheque—on the second day I</p>

               <p>gave an order which was written out by Russell and received the change, Ross was not there, but Russell and Kimpton were—it was agreed that Ross should take Russell's share to him—I had my share; I do not know whether Kimpton had his—we all four frequently used the Ship public house at Hammersmith—there is a skittle alley there—I knew the Duke of Sussex, Hammersmith Broadway—I have been very seldom there, and I never used the house with the other three prisoners.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is my second term of imprisonment—I had a, month two years ago—I communicated with the authorities after I understood that Russell had made a statement—Kempton knew nothing of our visit to Mrs. Gregory's at St. Margaret's—I cannot swear that Kimpton had any of that money—I handed it to Russell, but I did not see him give any to Kimpton—with regard to Smith's Stores, I do not say that Kimpton or Ross knew what was going on—Russell called me on one side—I got about £5 17s.—I handed over to Ross, Russell's share—I got half.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was arrested on September 8th and tried at the October Sessions—I remember writing a letter to Sergeant West before being sent for trial—I made a statement to Detective Denny on September 20th, after I had sent the letter and signed it—Russell promised me something for cashing the cheque and paying the accounts, but did not say how much.</p>

                  </hi>. I have pleaded guilty to the uttering charged in this indictment; also to a previous conviction—I have known Kimpton from 6 to 8 years—I knew him as a builder—I have known Boynton about 6 years when I was in business in Shepherd's Bush—in May last I began to know Ross personally as Coleman, and also as Captain Gill—I lent Mrs. Gregory £10 last June 12 months, for which she gave a promissory note for £15—A man named Henry told me Mrs. Gregory was about to move from 16, Netherton Road, St. Margaret's, and that she wanted to sell her home—I told Coleman, and he said he would buy it or could do with some of it—I took him to Henry's house at Twickenham, and Henry took him to Mrs. Gregory—Ross told me to introduce him as Captain Gill—Ross agreed to buy £10 worth of her furniture—he told me to go down to get my money as the things were going—Ross asked Mrs. Gregory about her tradespeople, and she mentioned the named of Davies, Halloway, Sanders and Lenick—nothing was said in my presence about pawn tickets—on June 25th, after that interview, we met at a public house in Hammersmith, I think it was the Ship, we generally met there or at the Hop Poles—Ross, Kimpton, and Boynton were present—it was arranged then that we should go to St. Margaret's and <hi rend="italic">do it on</hi> Mrs. Gregory's tradespeople—Ross proposed how it was to be done—Kimpton said he had got some cheques—next day, I think it was, we went to the Cobweb at Richmond—it was arranged that Boynton should get off the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> at the Crown, and come on to the</p>

               <p>King's Head Twickenham—Ross told him who the tradespeople were—it was arranged that we should wait at the King's Head for Boynton—Boynton handed the bills to Ross, who pinned the cheques to them, and made a note of the amounts on a piece of paper, and told him to meet at the Cobweb at Richmond—we all went there—Boynton came back in a cab, and the cabman came in with Boynton, which annoyed Ross—Ross said, "What the b—hell do you want to come n with the cabman for, you know they are <hi rend="italic">coppers"</hi>—he said "come on out of this," and we all went to another public house, by the fire station there—Boynton handed him the total amount of the money—he reckoned how much it was each—Boynton said the cabman was 4s., and we all had £5 12s. or £5 13s. each—I remember the transaction with a cheque at Smith's Stores, Kew Bridge, and Kimpton bringing me half a sovereign—I knew they were going to <hi rend="italic">do it on</hi> Smith; it was proposed the day before—I think Kimpton produced the cheque—it was arranged that if Kimpton and Ross found the cheques, Boynton and I were to go in with them—the first cheque I had anything to do with was with regard to Woodyard—I met Kimpton and Boynton at Hammersmith—they said they were going up to London, that they knew of a leather shop—Boynton was a trunk maker, and knew Woodyard's system—it was arranged that if I would fill a cheque in, Boynton would go in with it—that was the proposal at Hammersmith Station—I went with them, and when we got to the shop Coleman, Kimpton, and Boynton and myself went to the Museum public house—Boynton was going out without me; he said "You might as well come with me"—I said "No, I have filled the cheque in, and that is bad enough"—I asked whether the cheque was stolen—he said No, it was all right—Kimpton told me that—I said "It is quite bad enough to do the <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> of this, but I will have nothing to do with things stolen"—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it has "Frederick West" on the back—when we went into Woodyard's Boynton gave the order, and I said I was West—I do not know any person named West connected with this cheque system—we got a cheque for £5, and 8s. 6d. in cash from Mr. Woodyard—this is Mr. Woodyard's cheque—I was identified and picked out as the man who got the £5, by Mr. Frost of the public house opposite Woodyard's, when at the police court, but it was Boynton, and Boynton told the Magistrate so—Boynton handed the proceeds to the Doctor, and we had £1 8s. each—I had my share of the cheque we passed on Taylor, a leather merchant, at Norland Road, Notting Dale, for £8 10s.—Kimpton,' Ross, Boynton and myself were present at the arrangement we made to <hi rend="italic">do it on</hi> Taylor—Boynton and I went into Taylor's—Boynton gave the name and the order for the goods, and I received the balance, which I handed to the Doctor at the Duke of Edinburgh or the Duke of Cambridge near Uxbridge Station—Ross divided it—we bought leather at the shop—I knew a man called <hi rend="italic">Alf.</hi> Sutton through Dr. Ross—he was a buyer—I think he is now convicted of buying stolen property—the Doctor asked Boynton and me to get a chepue book in the City Road—Ross gave us the name of <hi rend="italic">Alf.</hi> Sutton, some number in Lever Street, City Road—he told us it was a sweet stuff shop, and said we were to ask <hi rend="italic">Alf.</hi> Sutton if he had a cheque book, and if he had we were to bring it away with us—if Sutton had not one we were to ask him to try to get one—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190112160033"/>
               <p>could not get one—I told Ross, and he said it was a bad job, but he would find one—I left London about the middle of September to go to Bexhill to work at a laundry—a young woman named Louisa Price was with me—she had been in service with Mrs. Gregory 12 months before—she was introduced to Mrs. Gregory by a man named Cooper—at Bexhill, we were living in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Watson—I never got a letter from Kimpton containing a P.O.O.—he said he had written one, and that it had been returned to him—I think that was on account of one of the ironers where I was employed having a relative named Watson, who opened the letter, by all accounts—the cheque passed to Davies by Boynton at St. Margaret's, for £9 is not mine—the back of it is endorsed by Ross—Ross asked me for the promissory note, took it to the window and traced the name there—he said "Have you never seen signatures took, that is the b—way to take signatures?"—he traced it on a piece of paper and then on to the cheque through the window—they were all done at the same time in the same way—the first was Davies, the second was Holloway, the next Sanders—the names on the cheques are all fictitious—the cheque for £8 10s. payable to F. West and endorsed "F. West" is in my writing, including, the signature—I wrote the Smith Stores cheque—Kimpton gave me 10s. out of that, but afterwards I saw from the papers that they got £5 17s.—Woodyard's cheque £9 10s. is not in my writing, but it is my endorsement—Kimpton brought it ready filled in—the cheque for £8 10s. passed on Taylor is not my writing, except at the back—that was filled up ready—they both came from Kimpton.</p>

               <p>time—In June, 1900, I borrowed £10 from Russell on a promissory note for £15, which I was paying off by instalments—by June, 1901, I had paid it all off except £2 15s.—a young woman named Louisa Coleman was in my service—she was introduced as Russell's cousin—she was with me about six weeks; she knew the people I was dealing with—I was leaving my house on June 29th—I had a visit from Mr. Henry about paying Russell's debt, and I asked him to find a purchaser for some of my furniture—after that I had a visit from the prisoner Ross—he proposed to buy some of it and, pay for it by cheque—I had, I think, three visits from Ross—he mentioned Russell's name the second or third time he called—he advised me to see Russell about Russell's debt—at that time I had been served with a summons for £9—Ross said that I should not find Russell hard—I saw Russell the same day—Captain Gill, that is Ross, was present part of the time—I agreed to pay Russell £1 a month—I do not know what was done about the summons—Russell said he would not appear—nothing was said by Gill about the tradesmen—Russell asked me about them—Gill offered to buy my pawn tickets, but I did not accept his offer—they were in my trunk—when Russell was talking about the tradespeople to whom I owed money he said "Do the lot"—I cannot remember whether Gill was there or not—I did not give anybody instructions what to do with the furniture, I thought it was going to be warehoused—Little, from Richmond, was going to take it away—Russell asked me if I had any one to move it, and I said "No," and left the matter to him—part of it was taken away, and I never saw it again—I heard afterwards that judgment had been given against me in the County Court, but I had no notice of that or of the sale—I went once to Arragon Road, where I supposed the furniture was moved to, but it was gone—I never lived there—I had no notice of the assignment of my debt to Russell being made to Ross—I know nothing about the three cheques produced—they are not my endorsements.</p>

L,"—it is impossible that those three endorsements were traced from one document—all the three signatures are very laboured and show shakiness—they are not in any one's natural hand—I do not see any indication that they were traced—If they were traced from one signature I should expect to find them identical—the capital "M's" are not all alike.</p>

On October 31st about 9.30 a.m. I went with Sergeant Allam to 51, Tredegar Square—a van was outside being loaded with furniture—I said to Ludwig, Adolph, and Willie Weiner who were in the passage together "We are police officers, and have reason to believe you have stolen property in your possession, the proceeds of burglaries"—Ludwig said, "I have got nothing, only what is my own"—Willie said "I do not know what you mean"—Adolph said "You have made a mistake"—they all spoke in English—I said we should search the place—I took a hamper out of the van—Adolph said that was his—I took possession of another hamper and a large box in the front room—Willie said "They belong to me"—I took possession of this leather bag which was in the passage—Ludwig said "That bag is mine"—in the first hamper I found this tobacco-jar, which Mr. Dangerfield has identified—in the second hamper I found the cruet stand and 6 large and 6 small knives, which are here—in the big box I found these two overcoats—in the bag were the sugar basin, milk jug and sugar-tongs and puff box produced—the things were put separate as they came from each hamper or box—we labelled them afterwards—I said "How do you account for the possession of all this property?"—Adolph said "I bought the things from my brother Willie "—Willie said "I bought them from some man who came to the door, I forget how much I gave for them"—I asked if he took a</p>

               <p>receipt—he said "No, I forgot to ask for one"—Ludwig said "They are my wedding presents, and were given me on my wedding about twelve months ago"—we kept the prisoners in one room—Inspector Divall arrived, and they were taken into custody—I found this mug and the serviette ring in Adolph Weiner's basket, and the tea pot, sugar basin, and milk jug in Adolph's, and in the bag owned by Ludwig the six fish knives and forks, the fish slice and fork, and the salad spoon and fork—Mr. Durrell has identified them—in Willie Weiner's box in the front room I found the trowel and cup produced—I found this kettle and stand, and tea pot, and the 6 fish knives and forks in the basket belonging to Adolph Weiner and the basin and fruit dish, and the fish slice and fork, in case, in Ludwig's bag.</p>

The Inspector came about 12.30, and later on Whensley and Gill came—we took possession of other property than what is here—the prisoners were moving things out of the house, and the things were in confusion—Willie did not say that he had bought the things from a German lady, nor that he got some from Round, of Sheffield—I took rough notes in this book, and afterwards copied them in this other book the next day—Willie did not give me a list of things and where he bought them—we ascertained that the van was going to 194, Westborne Grove—I did not know that till at the Police Court it was mentioned that he had paid a quarter's rent—some of the things are the subject of other charges, and others are not identified—I am sure this is Ludwig's bag—I never saw another inside it—there were other things in the bag—this trowel was a little more doubled up when I found it—I opened it at the time to see what was inside it—I saw the writing on it afterwards—the hampers were tied down.</p>

I hope they won't find the other stuff in the hole under the table, and the lot under the stone: I say, Hauten, they will see the holes in the doors where you have practised with your drills "Hauten said" Yes, we left them behind, and I suppose they have found them." Salveskie said, "Look here, it is no good talking, we must deny everything, and hold our tongues." Muller said, "I expect they will find the music box at the old woman's, and the marine glasses." Hauten said, "Let me see, the yellow silk handker<lb/>chief, the two table cloths, and the umbrellas all come from the same place, so as it stands they have only one case against us." Muller said, "I wonder whether they will find me out at Holloway? When I was there before I gave the name of Richard Dreseer. I expect there will be someone there who will recognise us." Braum said, "Oh well, my liberty has not lasted long, I have only been out three or four months" Peters said, "I am curious to know whether they will arrest Salveskie." Yates said, "What do they know about me?" Hanten said, "Quite enough, for they have no doubt kept observation on us, and have seen us go there drinking"—Yates said, "I do not think the old woman has much about her place; I dare say Max has taken most of it round to Smith." Salveskie said, "Smith may call at Albert Street to-day, and he will find himself collared by one of the blue ones. Muller said, "Don't you worry, he knows about this affair long before now. There, you see, they will both get off, and we shall have to do time." Braum said, "If they ask me how long I have been here I shall tell them I have only just returned from South America."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Willie Weiner, in his defence, on oath, said that he bought the goods found at Tredegar Square in the course of his business, some of them from a young lady who called on him five or six times and said she had come from his aunt, and some from a Mr. Durmon, a German, but the teapot and the coffee-pot had been in his possession nine or ten months, and a great deal of his property was taken away by the police which had not been produced. (He received a good character.) Ludwig Weiner, in his defence, on oath, said that he was an auctioneer and dealt in these goods, but that some of them were his wedding presents a year ago, and all he claimed was his own except what had been packed with his things for the purpose of removal to 194, Westborne Grove, where he intended with his new wife to set up a boarding-house, as his health was not good enough to enable him to continue to travel. Adolph Weiner, in his defence, on oath, said that he was a Dutch auctioneer; that he had no connection in business with Willie Weiner; that he only went to Tredegar Square occasionally; that he had never been to 13, Ship Alley; that he only went to 5, Albert Street about once a year; that he did not know anybody living there; that he did not know any of the prisoners except his father, his aunt, and his brother; that he had never bought any goods from Bertha Weiner, that he had never bought any of the stolen property pro<lb/>duced; that he had had no dealings with Mr. Swift, and that he had only been there once with his brother; that when he was arrested he was simply bringing goods down from the various rooms to place them in handy positions for moving; that he did not claim anything as his except what was taken out of his wooden box; that he had two hampers and a box at Liverpool Street Railway Station cloak room; that there was a bag in one of the hampers which was his, and that he had never been charged before with any crime.</hi>

The front room at 5, Albert Street was on the ground floor—I found the eight odd socks, the umbrella, and a cold chisel there, the room was occupied by Blaschke, and Hauten, and Peters—In the back room, where I found Mr. Dangerfield's coat, I found Wald sleeping alone—I went to Liverpool Street Railway Station on November 3rd with two cloak room tickets—I got from there a hamper with one ticket, and a hamper and a wooden case with the other ticket—I did not get a bag, but there was a bag in one of the hampers—the wooden case contained two naptha stands, and lamps, and other articles. This (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is not the bag I found in the hamper, this one was found at Tredegar Square—all the property has been labelled, I did not do it, but I remember putting that bag on a four-wheeled cab when we brought Ludwig Weiner and his wife to Leman Street Police Station.</p>

Keeble, and the other by the person who receives the articles—on December 2nd I was taken into custody—some satin and some canvas went out on that day, also some astracan, heliotrope silk, linenette, and Italian cloth—they were taken on the prisoner's barrow by Nathan</p>

I am a porter, and was employed by the prisoner in November and December last—I live at 204, Commercial Road East—on December 2nd I went with a barrow to Keebles' to take some costumes about 12.30, Harris said he had some work for me, he put a parcel on the barrow, and told me to go ho✗e and come later on for the docket—when I got to Brandt's house, the canvas was taken off the barrow before the police came up—Brandt came out and asked me what I had brought, and asked for the docket; the police came up and I was taken into custody, charged with stealing the goods, but the charge was dismissed—on November 27th I went to Keebles for some goods—I was there about 10 a.m.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Whiteway &amp; Co., Stationers, of Woodgate Road, Forest Gate—on Saturday, October 5th, about 9.50 p.m., the prisoner came in for a dozen black lead pencils and two memorandum books, price 6 1/2 d.—he put down on the counter what I thought was a half sovereign, head upperwards—I put it into the till—I did not take any gold afterwards that night—Rosie Benson was serving in the shop—I took no other money that night afterwards—on Monday morning I took out what I supposed to be the half sovereign and found it was a gilded sixpence—it had "sixpence" on it—I got nine pencils and a memorandum book from Detective McMullen—those were what I sold to the prisoner—I identify the sixpence—it has "1900" upon it—I handed it to Mr. Goodenham, the manager—I next saw the prisoner about a month ago at West Ham Police Court on a Monday morning, and picked him out from about ten other men—Mr. Goodenham returned me the sixpence, which I afterwards handed to McMullen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at 94, Brownhill Road, Catford, and have also, since I have known the prisoner, lent money—on November 15th the prisoner owed me £40, which he had had to invest for me—I went to his office on that date—he said he was short of money and wanted £100 to go to America. I said I could not do it as he owed me £40 already—he said he should have to get it from the bank, and mentioned the London and Suburban Bank—I called again, later on, on the same day to see if I could get some of my £40, he then said he could not go to America as they had not the money to lend him at the bank, and that Mr. Harding, the bank manager, had guaranteed it, and he produced this note, dated November 16th, 1900. "Four months after date we jointly and severally promise to pay you or your order the sum of £100 for value received." That is signed by the prisoner, and purports to be signed by Mr. Harding of the London and Suburban Bank—believing the note to be genuine, I said I would give him £60 for it, and gave him a cheque for that amount—I afterwards</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first made the prisoner's acquaintance when he introduced himself to me when I was seeing my patients—I was not a money lender until I saw him—I registered myself as a money lender because I knew if I had to sue anybody I should be fined £100—I lent him money to lend to other people, and the rate of interest to be charged was left to him—I have no record nor any agreement to show that—he told me he only went to America to fetch his wife back—he always seemed to have plenty of money—I do not know that he had within a year a turnover of £3,000 with this bank, or that he had authority to make overdraughts—I had monetary transactions with him after his return from America.</p>

I live at Wellesley House, Sistova Road, Balham, and am a Music Hall artist—in March this year I saw the prisoner, and obtained from him a loan of £60, and signed this promissory note, "C," for £75—the money was duly paid off in four monthly instalments, and I had great trouble in getting back my contracts. which I had deposited with him for security—I eventually got them all back except these three (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this bill for £28 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is not signed by me, and the signature to the assignment relating to these three contracts is not mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I signed the promissory note for £75 in the prisoner's office, and he handed me the £60 in a public house—I emphatically deny signing any other document in the public house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house agent at Queen Street, Cheapside—the prisoner brought me this bill for £28 on or about March 9th, 1901—he said that James Merrilees was a good artist, and that the money would be quite secure—believing the bill to be genuine I lent him £20 on it—he also showed me what purported to be an assignment, and three Music Hall contracts for performances at the Palace Theatre of Varieties; Hackney Empire Theatre of Varieties; and the Star, Bermondsey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a variety agent—I manage my wife's business—her professional name is Ada Alexandra—she is at present following her profession in Nottingham—in August, 1900, I borrowed £25 from the prisoner, and deposited with him, as security, my wife's contracts, in addition to signing a promissory note—that sum was duly paid off, and neither I nor my wife have borrowed money from him since—the signature to this bill (exhibit D) for £55 is not my wife's, nor was it signed by my authority or her's—this letter was written to the prisoner by my wife: <hi rend="italic">Dated December 13th, 1900, and stating that she had received an extraordinary demand from a Mr. Hulbert for an instalment of £11 on a promissory note of hers, which he alleged he received from the prisoner, signed by her—that she had never had any transactions with Mr. Hulbert or with the prisoner in regard to it</hi>—we eventually got a reply to that letter, but I cannot tell you the date.</p>
