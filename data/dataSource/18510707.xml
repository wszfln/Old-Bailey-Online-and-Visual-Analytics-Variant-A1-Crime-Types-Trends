                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William M'Culloch, we are wholesale druggists, at 95, Bishopsgate-street Within. The prisoner has been for some time in our service, as clerk and town-traveller—it was his duty to-collect moneys—in the course of his duty he would receive moneys from Mr. Eddy and Mr. Bates—if he received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 4th Feb., and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 26th May, it would be his duty to pay it to me the same evening, or next morning—that would be his duty in all cases—it was his duty to pay money to me—when I was at home I was cashier—Mr. M'Culloch was in Yorkshire, on 4th Feb.—he returned about eight days afterwards—it was the prisoner's duty to enter in the day-book, the moneys he received—this is the day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are entries in it on 4th Feb., in the prisoner's writing, of moneys received by him, but no entry of the two sums in ques<lb/>tion—he usually made out a list of the amounts he received for my con<lb/>venience—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the list which he handed to me on 4th Feb.—this corresponds with the entries in the day-book—there is no account there of the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 15th June he called on me between 4 and 5 o'clock, with Mr. Cort, who stated they had come on very unpleasant business—I asked what the unpleasant business was—I cannot recollect the words he used, but, in effect, that he was sorry to say Mr. Young had received moneys and not accounted for them, and that he had advised him to come to me,</p>

               <p>explain all, and make a clean breast of it—I immediately declined entering into any particulars, or having anything to do with them, and told them they had better see Mr. M'Culloch, my partner, as I was going out of town that even<lb/>ning. Mr. M'Culloch is now in Scotland, on business—some days after, I received this paper which is in the prisoner's writing, fro Mr. M'Culloch, and he made a communication to me at the same time—here is the name of Mr. Eddy, but no sum against it—(<hi rend="italic">the following items were read from this paper: "Tuesday, Eddy paid to Christmas;" "Monday, bates paid to Christmas</hi>:")</p>

Somerset bank-note, five sovereigns and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Lewis, who went down with me, was present at the latter part of the conversation, and said to the prisoner, "Have you any of my handwriting by you?"—he said, "No; I have not seen your handwriting for this six months; I have kept it well in my eye"—Mr. Lewis told him he had imitated his writing well—the prisoner laughed, and said, "Yes, I have; I can imitate any man's handwriting"—I searched a box which his father said was his, and found a purse with a duplicate in it of a gold watch pledged for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and forty-two medals, imitation half-sovereigns—I brought the prisoner to London, and on the way he told me he had taken a third check; he was not rightly sure about the amount; he thought it was about 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of Lewis; he presented it, and the cashier told him that Mr. Lewis had not got the amount in the bank, and he came out and burnt the check at the first public-house he came to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the police-constables attached to the Post-office. I took the prisoner by Mr. Sculthorpe's direction—in conse<lb/>quence of information I went to Mrs. Oliver's, 1, High-street, Notting-hill, where I obtained a parasol, a pair of cuffs, a quantity of damask, and other articles, which I afterwards showed to the prisoner at Miss Underwood's—when I opened the box they were in she took hold of the shawl, and said, "This is not the shawl I bought of Mr. Griffiths when I changed the note"—she selected this shawl, the damask, cuffs, pair of gloves, and parasol, from the box—I received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mrs. Oliver; and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was found in the tea-caddy, which the prisoner gave me the keys of; and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a purse upon her.</p>

               <p>salesman, in Newgate-market. On 28th June the prisoner came to me, in a butcher's blue frock, and asked for two dead lambs, in the name of Appleton—we have a customer of that name—I pointed them out to him—I do not know what he did with them—he went away, and I have not seen them since—I did not miss them till they were sent for by Mr. Appleton's man, whom I knew—I afterwards went into Newgate-street and saw the prisoner there, dressed differently to what he was when he came to me—I spoke to him about the lambs, and he hesitated, and said he supposed they had gone wrong—he said there were two pigs, and he had no pigs of me at all—he walked away—I followed him down Newgate-street, and he said, "Don't follow and insult me like that."</p>

The prisoner has had our front parlour as a bed and sitting-room, for a fortnight—my bedroom is the back parlour—on 19th June, about a quarter-past 6 o'clock, I was at tea in the kitchen, and heard my bedroom door shut—I know it was my door, by its peculiar sound—I had been there five minutes before, and noticed my watch safe in the pocket of the bed—when I heard the door shut I sent a little girl up, and while she was going up, I heard footsteps going from my bedroom to the parlour—I went up and missed my watch—I called out, "That man has been in my room, out of the front parlour, and taken my watch" and I sent the girl up to Mrs. Sheppard, who lodges on the first-floor—she came down, and I then went into the prisoner's room, and said to him, "You have been into my bedroom and taken, my watch, I heard you shut the door"—he said, <hi rend="italic">"Me</hi> take no watch; <hi rend="italic">me</hi> not been into your room"—I called Mr. Brown down from the top of the house, who said I had better send for a policeman—I sent, two came, and we went into the prisoner's room—the prisoner denied having the watch, and the policeman said he could hear it ticking in the room—he went towards the fireplace—I had no watch on myself—I took the paper ornament away which was hung in front of the grate, gave it to Mrs. Sheppard, and she threw it on my bed in the back-parlour—the prisoner's room was searched, and nothing found, and we could not then hear the tick<lb/>ing—the policemen took the prisoner, and I went with them to the station, locking my bedroom door, and taking the key with me—I came back about 8—I did not go into my room again till about 10, when I took my baby, and as I was laying it on the bed I heard a watch ticking—I looked about, took up the fire paper, shook it, and laid it down again—I listened again, shook the paper again, and then found my watch in it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and this is the fire-paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and occupy a room in Mulberry-court, Whitechapel. On the Saturday in April, before Easter Sunday, two young men came to my room, about half-past 5 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner is one of them—I have a son who gets his living by playing the violin—they inquired for my son, and said he could get a dollar for playing for the night at a raffle—Mrs. Flaherty, a neighbour of mine, was in the room when they came in—I told them my son did not live with me—they then wished for some beer—I said I did not want any—they pressed very hard for it, and Mrs. Flaherty said, "As you press so hard, I will go and bring you a drop of beer," and the prisoner gave her sixpence—they had been there then about five minutes—when Mrs. Flaherty came in with the beer, they asked me to drink—I would have none—Mrs. Flaherty just put it to her lips, and drank a little of it, and they drank it themselves—Mrs. Flaherty then went away down to her own room—the prisoner then asked me how old I was—I told him I was 65; with that, he took hold of me by the throat, I think, with his right hand; he took hold of me so that I could not speak, or call out—the other one then came and took a brown holland bag oat of my pocket, it contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it consisted of one crown piece, and the remainder in half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences—it was money I had worked for, and saved up—I buy old clothes—when the man had got the bag from my pocket, he went down-stairs—the prisoner still had hold of me by the neck, and continued to hold me about three or four minutes, when he threw me on my side on the bed, and left the room—after he was gone, I had no feeling, and no power; but when I recovered, I was quite sensible of what had passed; I got up, locked my door, and went to bed—my throat was very sore next morning, and I was very hoarse for ten days, and my throat was swollen—I did not complain of what had happened, to my son afterwards—I went and told the City police about it on Easter Sunday, next morning, about 11—I saw Mrs. Flaherty about 9 next morning, and told her—that was before I went to the police—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken into custody by Mr. Bateman, two or three weeks ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of Edward Norwood was read as follows</hi>:—"I was on Ux<lb/>bridge-moor, near the new Church, yesterday afternoon, getting May-flies—young Hirons was with me—young Ladyman came over the gap with a gun in his hand—I said to him, 'He has got a gun'—Ladyman then held up the gun and shot me, and stunned me—I had not spoken to Ladyman when he fired at me.

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 4th Light Dragoons. On 29th May I was near the beer-shop kept by Ladyman's father—I had a fowling-piece—I was on the moor amusing myself, shooting sparrows—I discharged the gun about thirty yards away from the house, and took it in and put it on the tap-room table—I had fired the gun three or four times—it was unloaded when I put it on the tap-room table—the prisoner waited on me with some ginger-beer and ale—he asked me if I had any caps—I said I had neither caps, shot, or powder—he said, "I can get some"—I had some business about the house, and did not take any more notice of the boy—I did not tell him to get any caps—I did not see him do anything with the gun—I did not tell him not to take it; after having the ginger-beer, it was about half an hour before I saw him again—he then told me that he had shot a boy, and not to tell any person—he had my gun with him—he gave it back to me.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been in the army? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly fourteen years—this was after dinner, after I left my stables—I am quite sure that I fired the gun off before I came into the house—I fired at a spar<lb/>row within thirty yards of the house—I desisted from shooting, because I had expended all my ammunition—I had no powder, caps, or shots left, or I should not have gone in—I did not load the gun again after I had got into the tap-room—I do not know a man named Hale—I know Gray—two men came into the tap-room some time after I had gone in—I do not know their names—I had only been quartered there for a short time—I did not load the gun again in the presence of those men—I had a shot-belt round my body, and a powder-flask on my shoulder—I am quite confident that the prisoner, in taking the gun, did not take the powder-flask or shot-belt—I did not see him take any other shot-belt or powder-flask away from the house—I did not hand the gun to him, or see him take it—I was engaged with a female in the house, and did not take notice of the boy, or the gun either.</p>

I went to Epsom races on 23rd May—I took with me my Geneva watch, with gold cases; it had the name of "Badollet" on it—I was present at the first race, and after that had been run, I ran to see the horses come in, nearly opposite the grand stand—I felt a sudden push against me—I was rather interested in watching the result of the race, and did not look immediately; but on looking down, a moment or two afterwards, I dis<lb/>covered my watch had gone out of my pocket, and the guard, and bow, and pendant was in the state it is now, broken away from the watch—this is the pendant and the bow—I gave information to the police—on Monday, 16th June, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and I replied to that—some works of a watch were shown to me by Finnis, the officer, on Wednesday, 18th—they were the works of such a watch as mine, as near as I could tell—the maker's name "Badollet" was on the dial, which was with the works—there is a name on the works—my watch had a gold case, with a shield in the centre—the works of this watch are precisely similar to mine—I bought the watch of Mr. Hughes, a jeweller, in the Borough, for nine guiness—I had had it about four years—my impression is, that the works shown me by the officer were the Works of my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in Greek-street, Soho. I supply the trade—I sold one gold watch to Mr. Hughes, on 4th March, 1847; the number of it was 22,908—it had a gold case, with an engine-turned back, and there was a shield in the centre—it had a skeleton movement, a horizontal escapement, and was jewelled in four holes—it had a white enamelled face, with a seconds hand—to the best of my recollection, these are the works of the watch I sold to Mr. Hughes—the number on the plate is the same as the watch I sold, and there is a name on the plate.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the Fire Brigade. On Saturday night, 31st May, I was sent for at 6 minutes past 11 o'clock—I accompanied Fogo to 52, Lime-street—I found the house full of smoke—I have looked at this model—I went in at the private door in Lime-street, which opens into a passage close to the coffee-shop—there is a door on the right at the end of the passage leading into the kitchen of the coffee-shop—when I got into the room behind the coffee-shop, I found there was fire burning through the trap<lb/>door—the flame was coming through, and the room was full of smoke—I procured some water, and put the flame out; and then, with the assistance of the other firemen, we got the trap-door open—it was shut down close—I have got the flap itself here; on the trap-door being open, there is a flight of steps leading down to the cellar—it is correctly represented on the model—there are rafters, similar to these, level with the trap-door—I opened the flap, put it back, and after two or three trials I got down to the bottom of the steps—it is a sort of step-ladder, fixed; as soon as we got the fire out, we made a search—there was a smell of camphine, or turpentine—I smelt that before I opened the trap-door—Mr. Fogo, our foreman, went down with me, and directly under the steps we found this wooden block and this iron-piping (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found it in this state, under the steps, on the ground—there had been some earth thrown up from the bottom, which would raise the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070059"/>
               <p>ground about two feet—the top of this iron-pipe was close to the wooden steps of the ladder—I also found this top, belonging to the pipe, lying very close to it, as if it had fallen off (the place from wall to wall is not above four feet)—it exactly fits the other part—I also found these two iron trays; one of them had cotton in it burnt to a complete tinder—that tray was on the left-hand going down the steps, underneath the steps, between the flooring and the joisting, and directly over the iron piping—it was blocked up with this piece of stone to keep it in its place—the other tray contains cotton, not so much burnt—that was under the wall, and also close to the joists—there is a cavity in the party-wall—the height from the earth to the floor is about four or five feet—there is camphine in this tray, and the other tray also smelt of it, but that was exhausted; the tray in which the camphine existed was further from the piping than the other—it was placed rather too far away, and right underneath, so that the fire could not very well have come to it unless it had burnt a great deal more; Mr. and Mrs. Strong live on the second-floor, over Mr. Taylor's room—their apartments are not shown upon this model——I also found this glass-bottle under the ladder, and a piece of wax-candle in the adjoining cellar, where a hole was cut through the wall—this piece of string, with a seal impression upon it, I found at the bottom of the ladder among the rubbish; and this gimlet was fastened into the trap-door—this is the under-side of it, and here is the gimlet with the handle burnt off—it was directly over the pipe and the ladder, and the string was under it among the rubbish—the trap-door is very much charred—the joists were also very much burnt, equally as much as this; not the whole of them, but the three nearest to the trap-door—underneath the ladder there was a hole communicating with the next cellar, and opposite that hole there is a door—that hole had, no doubt, been cut away by a chisel and hammer—the hole would let in a draught of air, and assist the flames—it was about two feet square—I got through it several times—if my attention had not been directed to the fire when it was, it would certainly have communicated with the rest of the building—there was nothing to prevent it—I should think the house would have been all down in 10 minutes, the second-floor as well as the first—I found this piece of wire at the bottom of the iron-piping in the draught-hole, and this burnt cotton was inside, down at the bottom of the pipe, and all round outside it, and some of it was lying on the earth below—it appeared to have been placed there—it could not have fallen there out of the trays—this cotton was all up the ladder, between almost every step, evidently placed there—at the bottom of the wooden block I found some melted wax, which I produce.</p>

I was residing there on the night of the fire—some time ago there had been an Insurance Com<lb/>pany, called the Colonization Corporation, carrying on business there—the prisoner was a director of that Company—the business of the Company was moved to King William-street—I look after the premises there—I went there last Oct.—there was furniture in the house after that, of Mr. Huggins, in the first floor—Mr. Taylor occupied that room—there was no furniture in any other room, except half-a-dozen cane-bottomed chairs that were on the second floor—after the removal of the Corporation, some of the fixtures were taken down and removed by Mr. Wood—on the evening of 21st March the prisoner came and rang for a candle—I gave him a whole one—that was in the back-room, behind the coffee-room—I went up-stairs to my own apart<lb/>ment—I saw him again, in about an hour and a half, in the same room—the candle was then burnt down gradually, I cannot say how much—his clothes looked rather dusty and dirty, all white, like mortar and brick dust—I did not notice his hands—he rang the bell, and asked for water, a towel, and a clothes-brush, which I took down to him—it was in consequence of his ringing the bell that I saw him the second time—the hole in the wall between the two cellars was not there before the evening of 21st March—there is a door to that cellar, leading down the front-cellar staircase—that door was open before 21st March—I am not quite certain whether the key was in it or not; if not, it was on the bunch of keys, along with the key of the other cellar-door, which were removed that day—before then, that bunch of keys hang in the office—after that evening, that door was not opened—we found it locked up that night, and Mr. Huggins took the bunch of keys away with him that night—I have not seen them since—on the day of the fire I saw the prisoner at the house, about half-past two in the afternoon, on the first-floor landing-place—he rang the bell for me, and asked for the key of Mr. Taylor's room—Mr. Taylor was out—I went up-stairs and got it for him, unlocked the door, went into the room with him, and left him there—I turned back again to speak to him, and he was then going down the stairs leading from the corner of Mr. Taylor's room to the coffee-room—the trap-door is at the foot of those stairs—I went up-stairs again—I spoke to him at that time—he brought the key up to me about an hour after—I did not see him any more that day, but I heard his voice at half-past 4 in the afternoon—he was then on the first-floor lauding, talking to Mr. Taylor—at 7 o'clock that evening I went to the offices in King William-street with my husband—I came back at 10, and found my husband walking up and down outside—we went into the house—on entering I smelt something like the burning of turpentine or resin—I went and looked all over the premises—I Went down to the front-cellar, took up the sawdust and smelt it, but could not see or smell anything of burning—I did not know what it was, and I laid it to the drain, which had been stopped up—after that we had our supper—We did not smell anything after we got up-stairs—at 11 I went to my bedroom, and it was full of smoke—I ran down-stairs into the street, and called for the police, and my husband went for the firemen—the firemen afterwards came—on Monday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070062"/>
               <p>morning I was sent for to the prisoner's offices, in Copthall-court, Throg<lb/>morton-street—he was not there—I spoke to the clerks, and as I was going down-stairs he came in—he said, "This is a sad affair, Mrs. Strong"—I said, "Yes, it is, sir"—he asked had I any idea who had done it—I said I knew no one that had been in the habit of being on the premises but himself—he asked could I not form any idea who did it, and what my real opinion was—I said I did not know, but whoever was guilty of doing it was worse than a mur<lb/>derer; they had better have come and murdered me in my bed than set fire to me—I asked him how the hole was made through the cellar-wall, and why that cellar-door had been kept locked for the last three months—he said it was made when the men were at work there—nothing else particular took place—there were so many persons coming in, I went away.</p>

I was staying with them at 52, Lime-street—I remember on one occasion opening the door to the prisoner when he had a leather bag, and a tray with him—the tray was covered in brown paper—I know it was a tray, because Mrs. Strong has had it since, and I have seen it—that was about eight or nine weeks ago—the bag had something in it—the prisoner told me he wanted to go into the back kit<lb/>chen—I went up to the second-floor, and went down the other stairs leading into the coffee-shop, unbolted the door, and let him in—I left him there—I cannot fix the time nearer than eight or nine weeks ago—I have let him in before that, when he has come into Mr. Taylor's room—I remember his coming, and asking for a light, and giving him a candle before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, living in Clarendon-street, Somers-town. I had offices, at 52, Lime-street, which the prisoner offered me the use of in Dec. last—he told me then that the house was to be pulled down, and that I might have the offices until that took place—he directed me to make plans for the rebuilding, which I accordingly did—I knew the prisoner when he was a director of the Colonization Insurance Company—I recollect the 31st May, the day of the fire—I was at my office the day before—the pri<lb/>soner came there that day about half-past 5 o'clock—he had a travelling-bag with him, and a parcel—I do not know whether the bag was a carpet or lea<lb/>ther one—it appeared full—the parcel was rather large, and in brown paper—I took it for a poker—there is a staircase leading from my office to the coffee-shop below, which at that time was unoccupied—the prisoner left my room by that staircase, taking with him the bag and parcel—I offered to help him down with it—he very courteously refused, and said he was taking those things down to put with some other things which he had down-stairs—I did not ask him what it was—I asked him if that was a poker in the brown paper parcel—he did not give me any reply—he remained down-stairs probably ten minutes—I left the room, and when I came back I found him in the office—I accompanied him to look over some property that was to be let—he left Lime-street about a quarter-past 6—he came again on the Saturday—I had in my possession some plans that had been made by another surveyor—they were valuable plans, but not plans that we should have adopted—a surveyor would charge probably 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—there was furniture belonging to the prisoner in my room—a large dining-table, and a small one, two easy chairs, and twelve mahogany chairs—the prisoner rolled up the plans, and was going to take them away on the Saturday, and I offered my boy to take them, which he did—I have known the prisoner for some time—I was not paying him rent for these offices—he allowed me to use them—he left about half-past 6 on the Saturday—I saw him again the same evening about quarter-past 7—he had not made any appointment to see me again—I saw</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 528). I went over the house, 52, Lime-street, on the Friday after the fire—the firemen were then there—I did not go over where the furniture was, only where the fire occurred—I found in the cellar some paper, and part of a newspaper, down the pit—the top of this funnel was given me by the fireman in charge of the place—we found a camphine can and four screws—in consequence of directions I received on 9th June, I went with Bailey to the prisoner's house, in Loughborough-park Cottages—(before that I had seen Mr. Kemp, and made inquiries)—I saw the prisoner—I had the block of wood and the iron funnel with me—it was about 7 o'clock in the evening—we waited till he bad had his dinner; we did not send word to him who we were—we were in plain clothes—as soon as he came in, we told him that we were two City-police constables—I asked him if his name was Huggins—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had any pro<lb/>perty in Lime-street—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had heard of the fire; he said, "Yes," and asked me if Mr. Marchant was my inspector—I said he was—he said, because he had sent for him or seen him, and he had had a conversation with him about it in consequence—I told him that had nothing to do with us at all—(Bailey was with me)—I then produced on the table, before him, this block of wood and funnel as it is now, and asked him if he could give me any account of these—he said he would answer no questions; he had been told that Mrs. Strong and others had been saying something about him, that he was a suspected party—I asked him three times distinctly if he would give us any account of this block and funnel, and he said he should answer no questions, as he was suspected—I told him he must consider him<lb/>self in custody—he said he did not understand the criminal law, he did not think we had the power; he could understand a summons, or a warrant from the Lord Mayor—I said we had sufficient power, and offered to show him our warrant cards to that effect; he then put his hat on, and went with us—I told him I must take him to London, and if he liked to satisfy my inspector about the block and funnel, that would be at his option—I took him to London, to the Fenchurch-street station—I stated to the inspector there what had passed between us; the prisoner said it was all true, it was the same as he should</p>

I have been in the prisoner's employment about five years—he was then living at Sydenham, with his wife and two children; for the first twelve months after I went, he was kind and affectionate to them; I never saw any quarrel—they removed from Sydenham, and I went with them—after that I observed symptoms of irritability in the prisoner: a noise, such as the shutting of a door, or a child crying, would cause him to shake him<lb/>self, and say, "Oh, dear, keep him quiet"—he was excited much in the same way as other people are—I remember, on a Saturday, in 1848, his coming home to tea an hour after his usual hour—I was then nurse—I only heard him rush out of the parlour, and his wife after him; she returned in five or ten minutes—he took nothing with him as if he was going a journey—I next saw him in a fortnight, or rather better—I went with Mrs. Huggins to Grays, on the Thursday after this happened—I did not see him there: he was not there while I was there—I staid there a week, and returned on the night he came home—I was in my mistress's bed-room; he came up-stairs, and I instantly went out, and did not hear a word spoken; I went to bed; I know they did not sleep together that night—next morning he went out to business as usual, and did not return till a week or ten days afterwards, when my mistress went out, and they both returned together in the evening—I have often heard the prisoner raving about the room in the night, and stamping and groaning very much—since he went to Grays, the tendency to irritibility has been much greater, and there has been a very great alteration in his conduct towards his wife—one morning I took him a cutlet for his breakfast, and put it before him; he instantly jumped up and down in his chair, and <hi rend="italic">twitted</hi> himself in his chair, and groaned very much; my mistress asked him what was the matter; he did not answer, but rose up and beat her most violently—I have witnessed that kind of cruelty to his wife rather frequently—about three years ago he behaved very cruelly to her; he threw a wet towel at her when she had scarcely been confined three days; and I have seen him throw knives at her—he has frequently complained about the meat, and said it was diseased, poisonous, and not fit for human beings, when we have all eaten the same, and known it to be quite good; we have had the butcher up to examine it, and he has assured us that it was good—we have returned several joints to the butcher because the prisoner said he would not have it in the house, and they have really had nothing the matter with them at all—he has repeatedly found fault with the butter, and I have taken it away, and brought the same butter back, and he has then accepted it as being good, and said nothing about it the second time—he did not always sleep in his own house; he slept</p>

               <p>in No. 2, an empty house, six doors off, only the room he occupied was fur<lb/>nished—this was between two and three years ago—it was after the Saturday in May—when he has gone away to sleep in the empty house, he has fre<lb/>quently come home in the middle of the night, after we have all gone to bed, and knocked us all up—his conduct, while strangers were present, was very kind and attentive; and always kind to his children and servants whether strangers were by or not—his violence was towards his wife alone—for about three weeks he would remain perfectly quiet, except being nervous, and then he would break out, and it would last about a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nurse in the prisoner's family. I went there last Dec. twelve months—he has always behaved to me and my fellow-servant's with great kindness—he has behaved to his wife with the utmost cruelty—when I had been there about a fortnight, I heard him stamping and raging about in the dining-room very much—I heard him beating his wife, and heard him say, "I will kill you"—I opened the door, and asked what was the matter; as I went out at one door, he followed out at the other—he did not speak to me or my mistress—my mistress said, I am very glad you have come in; he would have killed me"—I have seen him beat her at other times—it has left bruises, from which she has been confined to her bed four days—I have seen him throw chairs and knives at her, and many other things—when he has been treating her in that way, he would tremble, his eyes would bolt as if they would leave their sockets, and he would growl like a savage dog—I never knew his wife say an angry word to him; she always studied him in every respect—I used to make my mistress laugh by saying that it was at the change of the moon that he conducted himself in that way, because I used to notice it every month for three or four days, when he would be in a very violent temper, and then he would be very calm again—for the first five months I knew him, he used to sleep in an empty house in the row, No. 2—I have very often been called up in the night when he has come from there, and asked for a cup of cocoa, and I have made it for him while he laid on the sofa; and he would groan and bowl like a savage dog—he would come in his night-shirt, with his trowsers and coat not properly put on, and a handker<lb/>chief round his neck—sometimes it has been a very wet, cold night, not always—he suffered very much from his head—my fellow-servant used to have to pump upon it every morning—he usually went out from half-past 8 to 9 o'clock—he appeared, as far as I know, to be very much occupied.</p>

I attended Mrs. Huggins during her confinement, the last time was in 1848—on the third day after her con<lb/>finement Mr. Huggins was exceedingly unkind to his wife, and was raging exceedingly loud in the bed-room; I could not think what was the cause of it—I had to go down-stairs, and found him hallooing and railing very much when I came up; he had a towel in his hand, which he threw at his wife with such violence that it quite alarmed me—I observed nothing while I was there that could have caused that excitement—I remained there two months, during which his conduct was exceedingly unkind—she was lying on the sofa the first time she came down, and he took the children up and jumped them violently; I never saw any one so violent as he was—I saw not the least provocation.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I am physician to the Asylum at Hanwell. For the last twelve years I have been entirely devoted to the subject of dis<lb/>eases of the mind—at the desire of the prisoner's family, I have had interviews with him since he has been in prison—after a great deal of conversation with him, I am, as a physician, of opinion that his mind is not perfectly sound, that his judgment is impaired—I have heard the evidence that has been given on his behalf to-day—assuming the facts to be true, they seem to me to describe the character of a man who is on the very verge of insanity; in a highly irritable state of brain, and who, now and then, seems to have been quite maniacal—examples are very frequent of a man's mind being impaired to a considerable extent, and yet he may be able to attend to his ordinary occu<lb/>pations—my experience has satisfied me of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to have lived upon terms of the greatest affection with a woman for seven years, and then suddenly to change his conduct, and to treat her as the object of his most determined dislike, and to ill-use her, without any apparent reason; to what, in the absence of any explanation, would you refer such a change? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is one of the most frequent of the symptoms of insanity—an indisposition to take food on the ground that it is poisonous, is also a very common symptom of incipient insanity—insane persons very frequently exhibit a great deal of cunning and artifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the cunning and artifice that you say insane persons sometimes exhibit, generally tend to their own benefit, or their own injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally, to their own benefit—I do not mean to say that they are more likely to manage things to their own interests than sane persons; I mean that it is a very frequent symptom of insanity to endeavour to do things by cunning and artifice which do not require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But suppose things do require cunning and artifice to do them effec<lb/>tually, and that they are done effectually, do you think it is evidence of sanity or insanity, which? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should find it difficult to say—I should not say that of itself it was evidence, either of the one or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the subject of impaired mind, I suppose any false judgment, or wrong reasoning, is what you would call almost an impaired mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a matter altogether of measure; I do not think there is any clear and strong line of distinction that can be drawn to define the shades of it—I do not say that the mind of any person committing a crime is impaired; I should take each case by itself, and consider all the circumstances of the case, to enable me to distinguish whether it had passed the line or not—if a man, who appeared to be fond of his wife for many years, beat her frequently and violently, I should strongly suspect that he was mad—I should certainly inquire whether there existed a reason for it, before I should consider a man quite sound who acted in that manner—I should not consider a man quite sound that beat his wife, under any circumstances, not a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>; I should take all the circumstances into consideration, the station of the patient, his previous habits, and so on; and, of course, inquire whether any cause of quarrel existed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not consider, for a moment, that this man has not understood right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I imagine that his malady, like the malady of all patients, really and truly does impair their sense of right and wrong; but I feel this to be so important, this question is so often asked, and medical men think so much depends upon it, that, perhaps, you will permit me to say,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070071"/>
               <p>that there are insane persons, and many under my care at Han well, who, I am sure, understand right from wrong, but who would commit the wrong, and who would say, "If I commit the wrong, you cannot punish me, because I am a madman:" therefore, we medical men do not consider that a question of distinction at all—I should question the power of a mind in the state in which the prisoner's has been, to appreciate right and wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You can perfectly understand my question) because, as you say, it is one that is so often put to you; do you mean that at the time he was beating his wife, or at any of the periods that have been spoken to, he could not dis<lb/>tinguish right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am perfectly aware that is the question.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINB</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You can give me your opinion, and I must trouble you for it: in your opinion, could he distinguish right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, sir, I do not understand rightly that question—if you mean positively absolutely, on every subject, I cannot answer you—I could not say that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong, but I say that his power of appreciating it is impaired; his power of reasoning accurately is impaired; the power of controlling or resisting a train of thought tending to criminal actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you apply that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think in many morbid states of mind, the patient is in that condition that ideas will present themselves in his mind having a tendency to crime, which he has not an equal and constant power of resisting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And yet, notwithstanding that, he may perfectly well know the distinction between right and wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He may know it—I think at this time that he has not that sense of the difference between right and wrong that a sane person should have—I dare say he knows the differ<lb/>ence when it is applied coolly to his judgment—I saw him in company with Mr. M'Murdo—I believe he is here now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bragg, a chair—maker, of Bacon-street, Bethnal-green. I have known the prisoner five or six years, he was in the habit of coming to our house—on Thursday, 19th June, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door talking to William Slater, who lodges up-stairs—the prisoner came across the road to me and asked me if my husband was at home, I told him he was not—he told me to come inside, he wished to speak to me—I followed him into the front-room on the ground-floor—there was no one else there—the door was open—he told me he had heard my sister was coming home in six weeks, and I had not told him, but my husband had—there was an attachment on his part to my sitter—he would have paid his addresses to her if she would have allowed it—when he said I had not told him, he appeared very angry, and I noticed he had in his hand an open pocket—knife, which he carried with him—I did not see him open it—I judged from his tone and manner that he was angry, and he came in roughly—I went up to him and told him not to make himself silly in my place—I tried to get the knife from him—I caught hold of his arm as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070076"/>
               <p>well as I could, and he took hold of my right shoulder with his left hand—he had the knife in his right hand, and I received a blow on my left side, just under the arm—I told him I thought I was hurt—he did not make any reply—he left the room, went into the back-room, and I heard him fall—I went after him and found him lying on the shavings—I called a lodger down, and in about ten minutes Ellen Slater came down—the prisoner was then standing at the back window in the room he had gone into, and I was sitting on a chair—I felt my clothes getting stiff—I took them off, and found I was stabbed under my arm, in the same place where I received the blow from the prisoner—after a little time I felt very faint—there was not a great deal of blood—my stays were cut through—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till the examination before the Magistrate—I had never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I know the prisoner, and have had a great number of transactions with him about bills—this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) has "Accepted, James Hodge," on it—this is not my writing, decidedly; it is very little like it—I never gave the prisoner authority to write this for me—I never gave him instructions to accept bills for me; he never accepted a bill in my name, to my knowledge—I became informed of this document shortly after it was presented, for pay<lb/>ment—I was not in the way when it came—it came to my notice tome time in the same day—some time after that the prisoner called on my solicitor; I bad a very long conversation with him, I should think five or six hours, at the solicitors, Messrs. Pritchard and Collette, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Mr. Neal and Mr. Collette were present—the prisoner said he had been in such difficulty for some considerable time past, that he really did not know what he had been driven to do—Mr. Neal immediately said, "Then you intend to admit having committed a forgery?"—the prisoner said he hoped there would be no advantage taken of anything he might have said there—the words were "Of anything I have said now"—I do not know the date of the con<lb/>versation; I think it was Some time in May—I remember the declaration that has been alluded to—I think it was made about a fortnight before he was taken, and I think about a fortnight after the bill was dishonoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Whitton. On 30th June, I came home about half-past 11 o'clock at night, and while I was unlocking my door, Mrs. Jewett, who lives next door to me, was in her house using foul language towards me; she called me a b—, and a rogue—I asked her what she meant, and her husband, the male prisoner, then came out, and struck me across the legs with this well-hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was hanging against the house—he struck me as hard as he could, a great many times, holding it in both hands, and he bruised me very much—Mrs. Hunt then came out of her house, which is next door, and struck me about the back and side, and back part of my head with a poker—Jewett then got me down, and sat across me, and beat me in the face with his fists, and Mrs. Jewett hit me</p>

               <p>with the well-hook while I was down—I managed to get up, and was making my way in doors again, and Mr. Jewett cut me across the legs again, and I found some sharp instrument cut into my arm—no one was near enough at that time to have used it but Mrs. Jewett—I could not see any knife—I heard a woman's voice say, "I will cut your b—heart out"—I cannot say whose voice it was—I at last got away, and a policeman came—the cut bled very much—the doctor attended me, and is still doing so—he is not here—the cut is very painful at times, it is 31/4 inches deep, and I can almost lay my finger in it now.</p>

Matthew Jewett stated, his wife came home very late, being detained very late by William Young and two other men following them, and using very abusive language; Young struck his wife; he spoke to him about it, when he struck him with his fist, before he, Jewett, struck him with the well-hook. Mrs. Hunt stated, she never used a poker, and did not strike William Young at all; she came out of her house,</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hermes—street, Pentonville. On Sunday evening, 29th June, about ten minutes past 7 o'clock, I was standing at 29, Brunswick-parade, in Barnsbury-road, Islington, which is nearly oppo<lb/>site Mr. Wood's house, and saw smoke coming out of the chimney-breast, between the bricks—I knew it could not be a chimney on fire, so I went over and knocked at the door—nobody seemed to come, so I jumped in at the window—I was not long knocking at the door, I knocked loudly—I went up—stairs to the front-attic—I found the door shut, I opened it and saw that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070095"/>
               <p>the room was full of smoke—I went down—stain to the first—floor and shouted on the stairs, "Bring me up some water; I will soon put it out"—I said that in a very loud voice—I went into the back-room, first—floor, which is a bed-room, in order to procure the water—jug and the chamber, if there had been one—I do not remember whether there was any water in that jog or not—there was no fire in that room then, nor any signs of fire—I went up-stairs again to the second-floor, that water-jug was full of water—I took it with me, likewise the chamber, which was half-full of slops—I went up-stairs again to the front-attic, opened the door, went in, and on the left-hand saw a large flame, it appeared to be the bed on fire, it was behind the door—I could not see it until I got into the room—I emptied the jug and chamber over that, and put that out first—there was smoke in the other corner of the room, not flame—I did not observe whether there was any communication between that smoke and the flame—I did not wait to look around me—I went down-stairs again, and then for the first time saw the prisoner in the passage on the ground-floor—I said to her, "Mary, Mary, get me some buckets of water, we shall soon be able to get it out"—her answer was, "My orders are to stop here"—I asked her if anybody was at home, and she said there was no one—I then went and got the water myself, and took a bucket up-stairs with me—there were two other gentlemen, I think, there then, and I believe they went to get buckets, they helped to bring water up—stairs; there were two, if not three—I took the bucket of water up—stairs with me, and when I got up, the comer which I had left smoking was in a complete blaze—there was a pile of paper and manuscripts about three or four feet high and three feet broad—they were papers of an unusally large size—I threw the bucket of water in the corner, but of course the small supply of water bad not the power to extinguish the vast body of flame that was in the corner, it was in a Very terrible state—I shut the window and came out of the room again, and went down three or four of the stairs—by that time we had a good supply of water come up in two or three buckets, and when I had emptied those I observed police—constable 229 in the passage—there were immense packages piled up on some shelves—I did not know what they contained—they looked like papers and books, and they were on some wooden shelves—I sent them all down-stairs by the policeman—they were not piled up for the purpose of being set fire to, but if they had caught fire it would have been a very serious thing—I did not go into the first—floor back—room for an hour afterwards—the firemen did not arrive until we had put the top fire out—we succeeded in putting out the top fire, and as I was coming down—stairs one of the men said to me, "I want a bucket of water, this front—room is on fire"—I went in and found the bed and mattress on fire and the firemen in the room.</p>

Black wood's—I mentioned the circumstance that brought us there, and they said they could say nothing about it; they had placed the matter in the hands of a solicitor—they had heard of it before, as I had previously presented the bills there—the prisoner said she had received the bills from them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Esher-street, Kennington. On Saturday morning, 21st June, I was standing outside Vauxhall-gardens—I saw two gentlemen together, and the prisoner and another person with him—the person who was with the prisoner spoke to one of the gentlemen, and asked if he wanted a fly—I should say that the prisoner could bear what was said—I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket and run away with it—I told the gentleman—he ran after him and called, "Stop thief!"—I ran too, and saw the policeman pick up this handkerchief in the way the prisoner had run—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

Tooley-street, and saw all the prisoners together, about a quarter-past 11 o'clock—I watched them, and in consequence of what I saw, I went for a policeman—when I came back I saw Hill lay hold of Mr. Mann's coat-tail, and the other two were close to him—a cart passed, and prevented my seeing what was done with the pocket—I afterwards saw Hill throw this handkerchief away, and they all three ran under Tooley-street archway—I ran after them—Hill was caught by another man, and I gave him in charge—I then caught Bridget; he struck me and got away, and a policeman caught him—I saw a man pick the handkerchief up, and give it to the police—I afterwards, on the same day, saw Bullpit, and said to him, "You are the one that ran away from me this morning"—he said he was not—I said I was certain of it—he said, "I am done;" and I gave him into custody.</p>
