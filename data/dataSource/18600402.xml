I am a painter, and live in Davis-place, Cremorne-road, Chelsea—I did reside at 1, Winterton-place, Park-walk, Chelsea, for 16 or 17 years—in 1852 proceedings by ejectment were token against me by the prisoner—in consequence of something that transpired the proceedings stood over until October, 1859—the ejectment was then tried and a verdict was given for the lessor of the plaintiff—execution was stayed—the prisoner afterwards distrained upon me for the 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I replevined and got a verdict in my favour—I afterwards proceeded to serve a copy of the rule on the prisoner—on Saturday, 4th February, I went with Mr. Hempson to serve the prisoner with a piece of paper—there was no one with us—I saw the prisoner in the ground adjoining the house—the gate was open and we walked in, and Mr. Hempson gave him the piece of paper—I was close by him at the time—the back-door of the house that I had lived in so many years was open, and I walked into the house; and as soon as I got into the house the prisoner caught hold of me and struck me against the door-jamb, and shut the door and jammed me between the door and the jamb; he squeezed me so that I was hardly able to speak; at last I halloed out "Murder"—I thought I must have died in the place, my breath was taken away—I halloed out</p>

Willis and Willis—I did not know who they were—I employed an attorney afterwards—I heard from him that the Sheriff had given the prisoner possession—Hempson had some paper to serve on 4th February—I went to see it served, and as the gate was open I walked in—I did not consider they were the prisoner's premises—I did not know he was legally in possession—he had not been there from the 12th of the previous January—I believe he said once that he was not in possession, that Miss Calvert was—I do not know whether he was keeping the house for Miss Calvert—I saw him there in the yard—I do not know that he was in posses<lb/>sion from January 12th—I had not been to the house in the interval—I passed by sometimes four or five times a day; it was my business—I did not see the prisoner there all that time—I have seen him there sometimes when I have been going to my work at 6 in the morning—I had never been in the house after my goods were turned out till the day I went with Hempson—I went because part of my property was in the house; some lead pipe—I was told that Beeston had taken the lead pipe off my butt, my butt was turned out and the taps were gone, and I was told that Beeston took it off; and I went to see whether my dresser and shelves and fixtures were there—I went to see if my things were in the house—I thought as the door was open there was no harm in going to see if my things were there—I did not see Humphreys till he pushed me in at the door and released me—I was in the doorway before the prisoner—I never heard the prisoner call out that I had no business there, and tell me to go away—he did not go to the back-door after Hempson had given him the paper—I did not rush after him and try to force myself in—when I was jammed between the door and door-post I was not trying to force myself in, I would have cot out if I could—I said "For God's sake don't kill me"—I could not get either one way or the other; I had no more power than a child; I was not trying to force myself into the house—I was going in when he jammed me in the door—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having obtained a rule, did you go with Mr. Bikher to serve a copy of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I served a copy of that order on the attorney, and then the case remained until the 12th January following before I heard anything further about the order—I then found that a judgment had been signed—an application was then made to the court to set aside the judgment: it was set aside on 31st January, and this rule made. (<hi rend="italic">This being read, ordered judgment to be signed and all sub<lb/>sequent proceedings to be set aside for irregularity</hi>)—After that on 4th February, I met Bikher—I took no one else with me; I had employed no one else—I went by appointment to meet him, and we went to the premises—the dustman was there taking out the dust; Beeston was in the ground—I walked in and served him with a copy of that rule—I then turned round to come out the way I went in, and when I got very near to the door, I heard a cry of "Murderw"—it was near the gate, near the window—it is a gate in the grounds—in consequence of that, I turned back to the back-door of the cottage—I there saw Mr. Bikher and the defendant jamming him against the door-post, between the door and the door-post, just inside the place—I could see the prisoner, ho was pressing the door against him, and swore he should not come in there—Bikher appeared in much pain—a man of the name of Humphreys came almost immediately, and pressed against the door and Mr. Bikher went inside—I came away directly—I never went inside the door at all—I immediately turned away and went home—when I was taken before the Sessions court, Bikher and others who were witnesses for me, were pri<lb/>soners with me, so that I had no witnesses to call—Humphreys was the only person, and I did not know him; he was a stranger to me—I never saw him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Humphreys was not a prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know Goodrich—at the sessions, there were three or four persons called, not on my behalf; not one of these people swore I was there half-an-hour before it all began—I did not hear Earl say so—no one said it—Humphreys is here to-day—Benjamin Moss was called on the part of the other defendants, not on my part—I do not know Joseph Huggis—Sharp and Earl were called; they had nothing to do with me—I do not think they ever said a word about me—I don't think they ever saw me—I had served a copy of the rule on Beeston's attorney, but counsel advised a copy to be served on any person who was on the premises, and that was the reason why the rule was served on the premises—I told Mr. Bikher to meet me there for the purpose of going with me—I could have gone and served it myself without taking him, but, from some information I had received, I thought it necessary to have him with me—I did not say to Bikher when we were outside in the yard, "The door is open, get in"—I did not say any such thing—I heard Bikher cry out "Murder" twice—I heard him cry out, "I am in, I am in," after he had been released—I did not when I saw Humphreys, call to him and tell him to go and help Bikher—I was standing at the door when the man came—I did not know him; I do not know</p>

               <p>whether even spoke to him—I would not swear positively did not—he came up to the door and said something—I did not see Humphreys push Bikher in; he came to the door—I went right away home—I went from the door—he was between the door and the gate—I heard him cry out, "I am in"—I think the action of ejectment was tried last July—I bad nothing to do with it—I am aware that there was a verdict for Beeston as the executor of Mrs. Wilby—that verdict does not still stand<lb/>there was an action brought for trespass—the order made by Mr. Baron Martin set the whole of it aside—after the verdict has been obtained in the ejectment, he stayed the execution that gave Bikher the opportunity of applying to the Court in the following term—in the Interim they seized the goods of Bikher for the alleged sum of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent—that was reple<lb/>vined, and an act on was brought for the trespass; that came on, on the second day of term, before Mr. Baron Martin, after he had heard the case for the plaintiff, the defendant's counsel said he was not going to call any witnesses—Mr. Baron Martin then said if so he should direct the Jury to find a verdict for Bikher, with such reasonable damages as he had sustained, but he suggested that it would be best to let this verdict determine the two actions, and, if not, he should take care the verdict did not stand n the ejectment, and he postponed the trial till the 21st—on the 21st Beeston's counsel went on the case, and after the defendant's case was closed the arrangement there stated was come to—I have the briefs signed by both counsel, and that verdict was set aside—Beeston did not, after he had established his right by the act on of ejectment, distrain for rent—that was long before the act on commenced, I think as long ago as 1852; then he distrained for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an act on for trespass was brought against him for an illegal distress—he knew there was no contract, and no rent was due—Bikher said,"I am not tenant, and therefore you have no right to dis<lb/>train"—when the act on for the illegal distress came on for trial, Mr. Baron Martin suggested that there should be a settlement of the whole matter, and a juror was withdrawn, and no verdict given—Miss Ann Elizabeth Calvert is not the person interested in the property—she is no relation to Beeston—I do not know whether Beeston sued n the character of her trustee—I had nothing to do with that—Mr. Baron Martin said that Miss Calvert was the only person that he saw who had a right to the property—the mother had died—the order was drawn up that Bikher should give possess on in a fortnight—do not know whether Beeston always appeared as Miss Calvert's trustee—I hadnothing to do with the ejectment—Nicholson and Clark were thesolicitors for the ejectment—possess was not given up at the end of the fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the condition on Bikher's part was not fulfilled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, and I can state the reason if you wish it—possess on was not given up; he was in possess on up to 12th January from the 21st November—I do not know that he had barricaded it so as to prevent persons getting in—judgment was signed on 10th, and possess on was given on 12th January—in the case of the ejectment the order was that the judgment should be set aside, and all the subsequent proceedings—I did not get a writ of restitution; I applied for it—the judges refused to make an order—I was not present—believe made an affidavit at chambers on 9th February—I did not state in that affidavit that I had come there to retake possess on of the premises—I can't say whether I stated that Bikher attempted to get in, that he called for help, and that went to his assistance—I will</p>

               <p>not swear I did not; I have no doubt I did say that he wanted help—I was at the police-court, and was held on my recognisances to appear and take my trial at the Middlesex sessions, and the Magistrate ordered Beeston to be held to bail to answer the charge of assault—I and Bikher and the others were bound over; Beeston was not, on that occasion—I did not mean to say that he was bound over to answer any charge at the sessions—I was convicted of a forcible entry, and am now under recognisance to come up for judgment—I came here and preferred this indictment in the regular way, and the defendant was taken into custody ten days ago—I made inquiry about his bail—I did not go and talk to them in such a way as to prevent their becoming bail for him.</p>

I am a widow, of Chalcot Villas, Regent's-park—the prisoner was my coachman—he had the care of my horses at Eastbourne in September last, and it was his duty to obtain corn and hay for them, and to come to me for money to pay the bills—he presented these two bills to me at Eastbourne, and I paid him for them—I never saw either of these other bills until I saw them in the hands of the police constable—I paid the prisoner other moneys for saddlery and sundries about the same time—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 19th September—he presented this bill to me with the stamp on it, and I paid him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bill is for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. purporting to come from Mr. Wall—this account, giving the items (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), was given to me by the prisoner—I never saw this other bill for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

               <p>—I still have the three horses—I had no charge made by him or anybody else for corn during that period—the usual course was, for the prisoner to pay small amounts out of his own pocket, and come to me to be reimbursed, but it was contrary to my orders; I repeatedly told him not—I from time to time sanctioned that act by reimbursing him—he occasionally brought me a few bills which he had paid out of his pocket, and asked me to reimburse him, but very seldom—I believe the only account he brought to me at Eastbourne receipted as having been already paid by him, was the sadler's, and I paid him the amount—I owed him some wages when he was discharged, and also some money which he had paid on my account—it amounted altogether I dare say to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and has not been paid to this day.</p>

               <p>5 o'clock in the evening—I was watching in a position where I could com<lb/>mand a view of the sorting office, but could not be seen myself—the prisoner was in the office sorting letters—he commenced sorting about twenty minutes past 5 at the dividing table, and whilst so doing I saw him examine several letters with his fingers, evidently to ascertain whether they contained coin—the letters that he so examined he placed in a particular place on the table with other letters—when he had finished sorting, he took the letters that he had so placed there, to the north-eastern division—he then sat down on his seat at the north-eastern division, and looked the letters through that he had just placed on the table, and while doing so I saw him take two or three letters from that parcel, and place them on his right hand side, close to his body, on the table—after he had finished looking them through, he shoved those letters that were in front of him further up the table—he then took his pocket handkerchief from his left breast pocket, and appeared to use it to his nose—he then shook his handkerchief out, and dropped it down on the letters that laid on his right hand side—he then crumpled his handkerchief up, and placed it in his right side coat pocket, and the letters were gone too, with the handkerchief—he dropped the handkerchief intentionally—he dropped it down, and his band went with it—Mr. Gardner was with me at that time—the prisoner then rose from his seat and went and collected another handful of letters, which he took and placed on the same table—he then went to another part of the office, where I lost sight of him—shortly after that I went into the comptroller's room, and saw the prisoner there, in the presence of Mr. Gardner—he handed me three letters which I produce—this is the handker<lb/>chief that I spoke of (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was handed to me at the same time by Mr. Gardner—I searched the prisoner, and found in his pocket 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on searching his lodgings—I took him into custody, at the time the letters were given me—Mr. Gardner first came to me about twenty minutes to 6, just at the time the prisoner left the sorting table, and went to the north-eastern road—he was with me at the time the handker<lb/>chief was dropped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior clerks in the general Post-office—On 24th March, I had some instructions with regard to the prisoner, and I watched him—he was in the sorting office—I went there for the purpose of watching him—when I first saw him, he was looking through some letters at the north-eastern division—he is a letter carrier and sorter—his duties on this evening were to assist in what we term the general sorting in the first instance; that consists of sorting into the ten districts for London—he would go to the dividing table for the purpose of sorting, and having got his letters for a par<lb/>ticular district, he would take them to the north-eastern table for the purpose of arranging—first of all the letters for the north-eastern district would be all put together on the sorting or dividing table—when the letters from the north-eastern district have been separated and placed on the sorting table, the prisoner's duty is to collect them and take them to the north-eastern division table—he would then look through all the letters that had been sorted up at the north-eastern division, for the purpose of seeing that they were all for that district, to see if they had been correctly sorted—then his next duty was to have them tied up and placed in a bag for the district—I do not know that he would have to tie them up himself—they would he tied up—if he found any mis-sorts and letters which ought to have gone to another district, among the north-eastern, his duty would be to put them to their proper districts, or to hand them to some other person for that purpose—the prisoner was at the north-eastern table when I first saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020032"/>
               <p>with the letters—he had letters before him—I saw him take his pocket handkerchief from his left hand breast pocket—he appeared to use it to his nose, shook it out, and dropped it over two or three letters lying just at his right hand side—those two or three letters were lying apart from the other letters—he dropped the handkerchief over purposely; that, was apparent—he then crumpled the letters up in the handkerchief, and put them into his right side, coat pocket—when he took the handkerchief up, the letters were gone—I afterwards went round into the sorting office and met the prisoner there—that was about a couple of minutes after I had seen him put the letters into his coat pocket—I took him into the comptroller's room, and said, "You have some letters in your pocket"—he made no answer—he moved his hand towards his right side coat pocket—I at once inserted my hand into the pocket, took from it the pocket handkerchief, shook it on the desk, and from it fell the three letters produced—I said to the prisoner, "Why, here are three letters in your pocket, how did they get there?"—he said, "I don't know, I suppose they got there by accident"—I said, "Oh no, they did not get there by accident; I saw you take them up in your handkerchief, and place them there"—he made no reply—Smee the officer then came into the room—I gave him the three letters, and the pocket handkerchief—the letters have since been opened—at the time I shook them out of his handkerchief they were fastened—two were fastened with adhesive gum, and one with a wax seal—they were opened by myself in the presence of the Magistrate—after I had given Smee the letters, he left the room, and I told the prisoner that I was very sorry to see him in his present position; the more so, as the deputy comptroller had entertained a good opinion of him, and he might have got on; he must have known when committing depreda<lb/>tions of this kind that they would be eventually detected—the prisoner said, "This is the first time, sir"—I said, "Oh, no, it is no use telling me that, for I know better"—he did not say anything to that—one of the three letters is addressed to Mrs. A. Adams, 1, Langham-street, Langham-place, Regent-street, with the letter W. on it—that would go to the western district—when that letter was opened, it contained 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a penny postage stamp—another letter is addressed to a Mr. W. A. Nicholls, Aldine-charabers, Paternoster-row, E.C.; that is the eastern central district—that would have to go to a different table in the post-office, from the western or from the north-eastern—it would be sorted at a different division—that letter contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a penny postage stamp—the third letter is addressed to Mrs. Meyer, 10, Lacey's-lane, Bolton-lodge, off Merrion-street, Dublin; that contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all the letters had been stamped with the stamp of the chief office—they are stamped as soon as they come in, and before they are sorted—it is the stamp of the evening of 24th March, showing that they came in that evening—it is the 6 o'clock stamp—that would be for the 6 o'clock delivery—6 o'clock had not arrived—they are collected at 5, and stamped at 6—they would have gone out for the 6 o'clock delivery, two of them, the one for Dublin would have gone away that evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence (written</hi>). "I take my trial for having in my possession three post letters while on duty at the General Post Office. I am led to believe I have broken the laws of my country by so doing: I shall endeavour to prove to your satisfaction I was performing my duty and nothing more. Among the many regulations and rules in the Poat Office the following is among the number: (<hi rend="italic">Rule</hi>) "It is the duty of all sorters and 'despatching officers' to prevent letters passing through the Post Office with out paying the proper fee; and they are requested to weigh all letters which are 'suspicious' and tax them accordingly." On the 24th day of March last I resumed duties at 4 P.M.; I was called upon by my superiors to 'despatch' the North Eastern Branch; I did so up to the 6 o'clock; there was a very large number of letters at this hour, the chief part of them were circulars, weighing about a quarter of an ounce; among them were those three letters in question, all of them missorts, and seemed to be over the weight. It was my duty as a despatching officer to turn those letters out and have them weighed and taxed accordingly. I did so, and placed them by my right hand with the intention of doing so when I had despatched. When I had what letters I had before me examined some one called out to clear the remainder of the North Eastern letters; I obeyed the call, and brought those three letters in question with me in case my assistant would tie them up with those that were examined, as there are very strict rules against sending down missorts, unexcusable missorts as these were. The duty was heavy, and in the impulse of the moment I put those letters in my pocket before several of the men, and they were quite visible from my pocket. I have done so before: carried letters in my pocket when my hands would be engaged by other articles; I was never told to the contrary. My superior officers have no doubt seen me many times, with others, carry letters to and fro in our Pockets. I was never informed in what precise manner we should carry letters; had I been informed I should not have broken the regulation. You perceive I am tried for breaking a law which did not exist. The letters were in no way tampered with: if plunder was my object I should not have placed them in a pocket quite visible to a passer by, and before so many."</p>

I said, "No, I could not; he ought to know his business best as he had just come from the Company's offices;" he gave it in my charge, and he said "It is too late to get it changed, I will get it changed to-morrow;" he did not get it changed on the Wednesday—I named to him about getting it changed about a quarter to 4, and he said he did not feel very well; he would not go that day—on the Thursday night I spoke to him about it again and told him I wanted the money—he asked me to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the order until he got it changed—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if he would get the order changed in the morning as I wanted the money—he said he would get it changed the first thing in the morning—on Friday morning, about 11 o'clock, he came to me and asked me for the order—I gave it him and he started to go for the money—he returned about 12, and he said, "I have been for the money and I have not got it,' for I asked for it in the Com<lb/>pany's name, and they told me it was not in the Company's name; that it was in the Secretary of the Company's name"—and he said he did not know the Secretary's Christian name, he would have to go to the city to find that out—he promised me he would return about 2, on Friday—he never appeared till about 10 o'clock at night—as soon as I saw him, I asked him if he had got the money, if he had been to the city—and he said he had been to the city, and had met with an accident in grazing his leg, and he had got it covered with plaster, and he was very lamo—on Saturday morn<lb/>ing he got up about 11 o'clock—he was lodging at my house—he said, "I am going up there now"—I understood him to mean to the post-office for the money—he came home about 7 that afternoon; and then I said to him, "Have you got the money?" he said, "No, I have not; I have been down to my home, and from the accident I met with the day before, I felt so cold because I had to leave my stockings behind"—I said if I had known he was going to serve me in the way he had served me, I would have seen him and his, somewhere else—he then put his hand in his pocket, took out the order, and said, "If you think I have not got the money here is the order;" and I said, "I will go and see if I can get the money"—he said, "If you think I have got the money, do"—I told him I would go and see if I could get the money myself—I asked him to sign his name to this—he said he would not sign his name to it—he gave me the order to go and get the money—he refused to sign his name, and I then asked him to give</p>

I am a member of the firm of Jonas Rees and Co. bankers and bullion dealers at Liverpool—early in November last, about the 5th or 6th, the prisoner came to our house with this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he wanted it dis<lb/>counted, but at that time he had not had it accepted by the Bank of Australasia; and I refused to take it—on the 9th he came with the bill accepted by the Bank of Australasia, and a letter from the bank stating that any bank in Liverpool would give him cash for it—he said, "You see this bill is quite right, quite in order; you had no occasion to be afraid that it was wrong—at first I had suspicions, but that day I thought it was all right—I looked among the names of the passengers of the Royal Charter—I did not find the name of Read; and I discounted the bill—I looked at the passenger list of the Royal Charter, because I knew that vessel had been wrecked, and the bill was spotted and discoloured with salt water, or some<lb/>thing; and if the name of Read had been in the list of the wrecked passengers would not have taken the bill—I looked, and could not see it—the name of Read was not there—the prisoner asked me to discount the bill—seeing that the endorsement was wrongly worded, I was afraid something might occur at the time of payment, and I said I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account and pay him the rest when it was due—I allude to the first endorsement, "for me, to A. B. Seymour"—it is often paid in that way, but some might object to it—I gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he endorsed the bill—I do not know whether he endorsed it then, or whether he wrote his name on a piece of paper so that I might see it was his right signature—the first time he brought the bill it was not endorsed by him; it purported to be endorsed by Mr. Read the first time—I asked the prisoner the first day how he got the bill, and he said he got it from a man who bought a watch of him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and he gave him the balance of the money out—he said it was a man of the name of Read—he could not describe to me how he looked—he said it was the man who had endorsed his name—I am sure he said that it was the man who bought the watch of him that endorsed the bill.</p>

I am the solicitor conducting this prosecution—I have examined the book produced—it is partly in German and partly in English—it purports to contain the prisoner's receipts and payments for several months prior to 31st October—it begins on 25th August—a great part is in pencil and rubbed out—he has balanced the book on the day before 31st October—it appears that up to that day, he had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. so that there was a balance of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his favour on that day—he enters his receipts and payments regularly on each of the book, and he has made a casting on Sunday, 30th October, which shows that to be the state of the account—the receipts are for things in his trade, "a clock, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" "an accordian," and so on; and the other side are his expenses for lodging and living—there is no casting after 30th October—the entries go on to 5th November—the time of his going to Liverpool.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he received the bill in question on 31st October, from a person from thirty-four to thirty-six years of age, dressed like a first mate of a ship, of very prepossessing manners, in pay<lb/>ment of a gold watch and chain which he sold him for</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that he asked him to endorse the bill, which he did, left the shop, and he had never seen him since. The prisoner also entered at some length into the nature of his transaction with Mr. Rees, who discounted the bill: and as to the evidence of his handwriting, he asserted it was given by witnesses who entertained feelings of animosity against him.</hi>

                  </hi>. I reside at Croyland in Lincolnshire, about a mile and a quarter from Mr. Stapley's farm—I know Chesterfield, he is a butcher there—his slaughter-house is close to my place—the place where this meat was dressed adjoins my premises—on 23d December I saw a cow being con<lb/>veyed to that place—I saw the cow taken in there—I saw persons dressing that cow—Chesterfield was one of those persons—Stapley was not there while I was there—I saw the hide taken off the cow—the cow appeared in a very bad state of health, and the stench that arose from the carcase was dreadful indeed—I, of course, have seen cattle slaughtered before—when they</p>

               <p>were taking the skin off this animal the veins between the skin and the carcase were full of gorged blood and putrid matter—the putrid matter ran out of the carcase—in my judgment that animal was not fit for food for man or beast—it was not fit for a dog—I know Chesterfield very well—I believe he was in good health that day—I did not see any difference in him—either the next day or the day following he was taken ill—I did not remain there during the whole time—in consequence of what I saw I made a cominnnica<lb/>tion to the authorities in London.</p>

I wish to know whether there is any truth in the assertion. I have been informed that Mr. Stapley intends trying to get out of it by saying that he did not authorise me to send it to London, which is very false; but I have not seen him myself since, but the van man informs me that he called upon Mr. Stapley for the railway charges at the time, which he paid at once, and asked the vanman if he thought there would be anything more said about it, and if there should be he must not know any<lb/>thing. Please to send me your opinion, if there is anything likely to take place. I myself wished him not to have it sent to London at the time.

I am a rag-merchant, residing at Tottenham—on 27th March last, Tuesday, I was at the White Horse public-house—I don't know the time exactly—it was evening—it might be 7 or 8 o'clock—I had offered man some money for a donkey—I offered several different prices—I went up to a sovereign—the prisoner was present—he stood just by me, and he said, "Shew him the money, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, and theu he will take it"—I pulled out a sovereign and two halves—I was going to show the man the money, and the prisoner grabbed his hand over mine and took the two half-sovereigns—the sovereign I stuck to—I tried to hold my money, but could not—I asked him several times to give me the money, and he seemed to laugh at me—I knew what I was doing—I had not touched any beer till quite the afternoon—I took a little between 3 and 4 o'clock—I was not drunk—the prisoner is the man.</p>

On 27th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was passing the White Horse public-house—I was called, by the last witness, to take the prisoner into custody—I found him in the tap-room, with about thirty or forty bad characters in the room—I knew nearly all of them, both by name and character—the house has been licensed many years before I was there—I told the prisoner the charge—he said, "I never had the money"—I asked the witness, in the presence of the prisoner, what money he had had in his purse—he said, "One sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and somesilver"—he showed me his purse, which then contained one sovereign, one half-sovereign, and some silver,—I searched the prisoner after I got him in custody, but only found some silver on him—as I was coming from the magistrate's, after the prisoner had been remanded, he said "I suppose this will be six months for me."</p>

               <p>March, after leaving my master's, I went to Mr. Prior's, 100, Pentonville-road, an eating-house keeper, in company with a friend, a young man named Henry Mason—I saw the prisoner there, he came in afterwards—I had known him before—there were no words spoken at all—we called for our suppers, and I tendered payment for it—the prisoner then told Mr. Prior to look to me for his sixpence, that he had no money—I told Mr. Prior that I was not to pay for it, as I had nothing to do with him—the prisoner then told Mr. Prior that he had better lock us both up—I asked him what he meant by "us," and he said, "you"—I said I should not pay for it—I asked Mr. Prior for my change out of the money I gave him, and Mr. Prior said he must have it from the prisoner—he told the prisoner so—he said nothing—Mr. Prior said he must have the money from him by fair means or other<lb/>wise—the prisoner said he could do which he liked—I then got up to go out, and the prisoner got up and struck me with a knife, and would not let me go—he made an attempt at my neck, but I put down my head, and he struck me down the back—I leant my head forward, on one side, seeing the blow come, to avoid it—it cut right through my coat and waistcoat—it did not cut my shoulder—it did not hurt my body, only cut my coat—I tried to get from him, and he laid hold of me—we fell down—while on the ground be struck me twice in the chest—while we were falling first, he struck the knife into my hand—it is well now—on the ground, he tried to strike me in the chest, and the knife bent up—he struck me twice on the cheat with the knife—it was bent when he struck me in the chest—it did not go through my clothes—the point was bent right round, it could not go through—I do, not know what bent it—I am sure it was straight when he took it up—it was bent in the scuffle—he was on the top of me when he did this—I was down—I then got from him, and the policeman came in—I was sober—before goin into the eating-house, I had seen in the Belvidere with this same friend—I had seen the prisoner there, but nothing had taken place, no words passed, but I heard the prisoner say that he would put a knife into anybody that ever interfered with him—he was sober—I do not know how be came to expect me to pay for his supper—I had never paid for his supper before, or he for mine—I had known him before, by asking him to come and wash my carriage for me as a job—he washed it twice—I gave him a shilling, and some beer and bread and cheese for it—he knew my friend Mason.</p>

I keep an eating-house, 100, Pentonville-road—on the night of 21st March, the prosecutor and his friend Mason came into my house about 10 minutes past 12—they called for some supper—the prisoner followed the two in—they had their supper, and the prisoner also—after that Mason left, and I then went to the door—I came back, and in consequence of something my wife told me, I went and took a shilling back to the prosecutor—he had tendered a shilling to my wife for payment of his supper—I said, "You have given my wife a shilling to pay for the supper—there are three suppers; do you intend this shilling to pay for the lot?"—they had had boiled beef, pickles, and bread—he said, "No, that shilling is to pay for mine, I have nothing at all to do with the others"—I then turned round to the prisouer and said, "I am to look to you then for your supper" he said, "I have no money, you must lock us both up"—I said, "Well, you may please yourself, I will either have it by fair means or foul, I won't be imposed on by you nor any one else"—then he turned round to the pro<lb/>secutor and said, "You had better lock us both up"—the prosecutor said, "What do you mean by us?"—he said, "You"—then a scuffle arose, and I saw the prisoner take a knife off the table—it was a dinner-knife—this is it</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 273). I was on duty in the Pentonville-road on 21st March a little after 12 at night, I saw a crowd of persons at the door of Mr. Prior's eating-house—I was called in—I saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing at the door, and the proprietor of the eating-house as well, asking the prisoner for the money for his supper—at the same time I saw the prosecutor's hand bleeding—I examined it—it was not a very deep cut—it was done by stabbing, not a drawn cut—it appeared to me likely to be done with a table-knife—this knife was given to me by Mrs. Prior—she said this was the knife the prisoner had put down—the prisoner offered to pay for the supper afterwards, in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night in question there were three of us in company; we had been in company all that evening; we went to the public-house, and when that closed we went to the eating-house. Mason called for three suppers, they were brought; as soon as he had finished his supper, he got up and went out without paying; directly after, Thompson offered to pay for his; it came to sixpence. Mr. Prior asked him if he was going to pay for the three suppers, he said, no; that was to pay for his own, he had nothing to do with the other two; on that Mr. Prior said, "I shall look to you for the remainder." I said, "No, I have only money to pay for myself, and cannot pay for anyone else;" that was Mason. He said, "I will not be imposed on by you or anybody else; I will have it by fair means or foul." I said, "Then you had better lock us both up." Thompson then rose up and struck me a violent blow in the face; I struggled with him, and forgot, in the height of my passion, that I had a knife in my hand, and we both fell. I made no separate blows or stabs; he got his hand cut in the struggle; as to attempting to put it into his chest, or saying I would stab anyone, it is entirely false; he is prejudiced against me, having some time ago employed me for eight or nine days, and at the end of that time he gave me threepence, in addition to what he gave me for the work; and I, not thinking it enough, left it with the landlord of the beer-shop where he was employed; and for that cause he is prejudiced against me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general-dealer living at 2, star-place, North End, Fulham—On the night of 13th January I went to bed about 11 o'clock—on the morning of the 14th I discovered that my house had been broken into—when I went to bed I had some bacon, some cheese, some cocoa, and some tobacco—I had also the materials for a lady's dreys and about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper—I missed all these things in the morning—I had seen them safe at half-past 10 the night before, just before I went to bed—the entry had been made by the back-parlour window—a ladder had been procured from next door to us, which is a corner house—they came over the side and then put the ladder over on our side—I found the ladder on our side; and I suppose they got in at the window by that means, and put the ladder back again in making their escape—the ladder was found on our side of the wall leaning against the wall; and the parlour window was left a little way open—I had seen it fast over-night—it fastens by a catch the same as all parlour windows—when the sash is put down that drops over it—the catch was not injured—I can't tell how it was opened, without a knife was inserted up the crack—there were no shutters—a knife between the sashes would have opened it—I think if anyone had got on a ladder they could have reached the parlour window—it would have been high enough—the money was in a cupboard in the parlour—the other goods were in the shop—I am positive the things were safe in the house when I went to bed—the value of the goods is between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

About half past 7 o'clock on the evening of 17th March I was called to the prosecutor's shop, and he gave the prisoner iu custody—another officer was holding the prisoner—when I got in the shop, I saw this basket, and I asked the prosecutor to allow a person to bring the basket and these plates to the statiou where I took the prisoner—these are the prosecutor's two plates and these are two other plates—I found nothing on the prisoner but a brass tobacco-box—I asked him his address, he hesitated a long time and he said two or three times that he had no settled abode, but after being asked re<lb/>peatedly he said he lived in Browns buildings, Stanhope-street, Clare-market—I went there and was told he did not live there, but he was known there, and that he was in the habit of carrying a basket similar to this one.</p>

I am a fishmonger of 23, Queen's-terrace, St. John's-wood—I am not carrying on the business now; I have let it; but I am living in the house—the defendant is a builder in the Queen's-road—I recollect employing him in June last to do some work for me—this is his contract—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "1, Queen's-road, St. John's-wood.—Sir, I will undertake to fix the blind complete, and put rings, cords, and pulleys, for the sum of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. J.

               <p>were before the police-Magistrate—the defendant was examined, and stated that there were pulleys and ropes—my principal point was, that the work never was completed, and that there were no ropes or pulleys—he was sueing me on this contract, I having declined to pay him until the work was completed: he compelled me to pay, and I have paid him—the County Court Judge ordered me to pay 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with expenses—although I have sold my business, I am a lodger in the house now—before Mr. Hibberd was employed there was a meeting of the tradesmen who live in these houses, at the Knights of St. John Tavern, and they all agreed to have an awning or sun blinds put up, so as to form a picturesque appearance, and also to protect the shop-fronts from the sun—ten tenders were sent in—eventually Mr. Hibberd was employed—there are twenty-six houses, and there were fifteen blinds put up—I saw some of them put up before I gave this order—they had no pulleys or ropes, but I told the defendant that I should like my blind to have ropes and pulleys, so that I might furl it and unfurl it—it was upon my saying that, that he brought forward this written contract—there are, to two houses, upright iron bars, fixed above fifteen or sixteen feet distance in the kerb, then a horizontal one, and then two side bars fixed to the house; and over that comes the blind—I suggested that I should like to have rings attached, and a pulley and rope by the side, so as to pull the blind backwards and for<lb/>wards, which he agreed to carry out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sort of pulley; and rope, and rings, were sewn on to the blind—I was not present when the blind was tried—I never saw it tried with a pulley on each side, and the rope through, making a great bulge in the middle when it was drawn up; nor di I swear at Mr. Hibberd, and say that I would not have anything of that kind done—he did not actually suggest to me that I should have a third row of rings in the middle to prevent the blind bulging—there was not a very violent gust of wind when the blind was blown down on Sunday—I never saw that the kerb stone was loosened by the bar from the violence of the wind—I sent the blind back to Mr. Hibberd after it was blown down—after I sent it back the last time, his workmen came to me over and over again and requested me to allow them to finish the blind, and I refused—I said that it was of no use to me after the summer was over, because it was a mere temporary blind to keep the sun off the payement—I said, "I will wait till the spring; Mr. Hibberd has kept the blind the whole of the summer, and now he had better keep it in the winter; and in the summer I will have it up"—Mr. Ruddock saw my blind, and had a blind put up similar to it, but with three pulleys—I saw his blind work once; it did not work well—he uses it—the defendant's man did not come to me over and over again, before my blind was blown down, to put a third pulley and make it exactly like Mr. Ruddock's.</p>

               <p>—I did not tell you so when you first asked me, because I was not aware that you meant the hooks—Edward Hibberd, and two working smiths, and my master, saw me test the blind, and draw the pulleys and the cords—I cannot say that I saw Mr. Ruddock at all, though I believe he was there—I believe it was the next day that I spoke to him about the cords to his blinds—the pulleys were put to Mr. Charles's blind when I spoke to Mr. Ruddock—I went into the shop and suggested to him that Mr. Charles's blind did not work according to his wish, and said that I should like to put a third cord—he did not then look at Mr. Charles's blind, he had looked at it; and as it bulged down in the middle, he did not like it—the pulleys were put up in the morning, and the next day they were taken down again, before the blind blew down—that was to try an experiment on Mr. Ruddock's blinds—I think Mr. Edward Hibberd was there when the pulleys were taken down—we afterwards took the ropes down, that had been used in connexion with the pulleys, and carried them into my master's shop—they were no good after the pulleys were taken away—they are at my master's shop now, if they have not been used—I tried the experiment a few days afterwards—I am not aware that Mr. Charles went and saw the experiment tried on Mr. Ruddock's blind; but of course he saw it, because it was up a month or two—I left the defendant about three weeks afterwards, because I had not got my health—I had been with him nearly twelve months—he had much work at the time I left; sufficient for me and a great many others beside—it was during the strike that I went away—I did not go with my master to Mr. Charles's for the money, or by his direction—I had never heard that Mr. Charles came to the shop—he never came to the place when I was there, but after the blind blew down the second time, he said that he would not have it put up again; but two days afterwards, he allowed it to be put up—the blind ordered in June was not Bent till August, because it took a good time to make all these blinds—we had the others to put up as well, and, of course, we could not put them all up at one time—I am not aware that the de<lb/>fendant was in difficulties all this time—he never mentioned such a thing to me as the Bankruptcy Court, or the Insplvent Court.</p>

               <p>not, to my recollection, explain the kind of cords to the Judge—I do not remember his being asked whether they were completed when they were blown down, and saying that the cords and pulleys were up at that time—I destroyed my notes within forty-eight hours, and before these proceedings commenced—I have looked for them.</p>

               <p>these three dresses from her lap, it appeared to me; I was on the other side of the counter—I could not see her lap—she gave' them a jerk on to the counter—instead of going on to the counter, two I think went on to the floor—I picked them up and put them on to the counter, and they we're then in a crumpled state—she said, "These have dropped down"—the dresses would be shown to her half way open, in the position I picked them up—she was dressed, as she is now, with a cloak and bonnet—this is the dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that I saw her take from the counter—I saw it go, it slipped down—I did not see her hand drawing it, it could not have slipped—the counter is wider than the silk—it was lying flat on the counter—it was pulled down right off the counter—I did not see who pulled it—I did not see her fingers—it was pulled off rather quickly—I don't know anything of that purse or bag, it is not our property—the whole of these silks are worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are the property of Mr. Lonsdale—we sent for an officer—she was first aaked her name, and she said, "My name Sir, my name Sir—is—is—Elizabeth Cooper"—she was then asked where she lived; she hesitated, and at last said, "In the Curtain-road."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener and live at Plaistow, in Essex—I had a child named Ann, she was two years old—on 1st February, I was at work in the road, about seventy or eighty yards from my house—I was engaged with other persons to fell trees—between the tree where I was and my house there is a bend in the road—I could see my cottage quite plainly—about five or six yards from where I was, the road is straight—whilst I was at work I saw the two prisoners—Hollamby was on a white pony and Ellis on a dark one—they were going towards Plashett—about half-an-hour later, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw them returning, and they were mounted on the same ponies—I cautioned them, as they were coming very fast—they appeared to me to be racing—before they returned an elder child of mine had come to me for the chips and had goue back again, and I suppose had left the gate open, and this little child Ann had come out into the road, and when the prisoners came up I called to them to slacken their speed, or they would ride over my child who was in the road—the other child, Ellen, had got to the house at that time—I saw Ann in the road at the time—I called to the boys—after I cautioned them they went on, and Hollamby's pony knocked the child down, and Ellis's pony rode over the child—I saw it quite plain from where I was.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a beer-house keeper of Woolwich—about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, 13th March. I was at the Inverness Arms beer-shop, at Plumstead, in Kent—I was standing in front of the bar—the door of the tap-room was wide open, and I could see in—I saw Robert Ford lying asleep—I saw Holland in the tap-room, standing before the bar—I do not think anybody was with him—there was an old gentleman there reading the paper—I don't think he had anything to drink—Holland had some half-and-half with a man that came out of the street; a man that was working outside, and came in in his shirtsleeves—they had a pot of half-and-half—the man then came out, and Holland after him—the old man that was reading the newspaper was sitting in the same room—I saw the prisoner take the watch out of Ford's righthand pocket; not the guard—I won't be sure whether it was from the waistcoat or not, I would not swear—I saw the watch—I think it was silver—I was some little distance off; it might be three or four yards—I did not see his hand go towards Ford without a watch; but I saw it come, and it came away with one—then Hol'and went into the street—I went out to the door and watched him to the bottom of the street, and there I lost sight of him—I saw him afterwards near Beresford-square, about a quarter or half-past 5 o'clock—I followed him to the bottom of Inverness-place—the Inverness Arms is about the middle of the street—I saw him meet Ford and speak to him—I did not hear what they said to one another then—they came back again into Wool-wich, and another man with them—I joined them—Ford spoke to me, in the presence of Holland, about his having lost his watch—Ford took Holland into the Burridge Arms to give him something to drink—I said that Ford need not go far, for the man was there that had got his watch—I asked Ford whether he was going to give Holland in charge—he spoke to Holland, and Holland said that he would go and get his watch, that he would make the watch right for him, he would get it for him again if he did not give him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020089"/>
               <p>in charge—I then asked him whether he would give him in charge or no, and he said, no; if he would give him some recompense—he would not come to terms with him, and so I went for the constable—I saw the constable take Holland into custody—the constable asked him what he had to say about the watch—Holland did not say that he had not had it—he never spoke to the policeman at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer of the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich—On the afternoon of Tuesday, 13th March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was in the tap-room of the Inverness Arms beer-house, at Woolwich—when I went in there I had a silver watch—when I came out of the tap-room I had not got my watch with me; only the guard and the ring—I have got the ring now—I do not know who took the watch—when I woke up I found it gone—I do not know how I lost it—it was broken off—it was safe when I went to sleep—I was a little the worse for drink—I don't know how long I was asleep—I met Featherstone, later in the afternoon, at the Burridge Arms, where he told me that Holland was the man that took the watch—I asked Holland if he had got it, to give it me, or to give me some recompense for it—he said to the other man, "Will you make it right with him for the watch?"—the man said, "I don't know"—Holland told me he had planted the watch—when the witness went for a policeman Holland ran away from me, and I ran after him—he said, "Don't give me in charge, I will make it right with you for the watch; I have planted it"—when the policeman came I gave him in charge—he did not say anything else to me about the watch—he did not deny having taken it.</p>

I came out again; if he saw me take the watch why did he not stop me; and when I met the man that lost the watch, if I had got it, should I have gone down the road with him again to look for it? I should have tried to get out of his way. He said, "Have you seen a man with a white jacket going down here, as I have lost my watch?" I said, "No; but I will go with you and look for it," and he took me into the Burridge Arms, and then I was accused by Featherstone. I get my living by working hard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Enthoven and Sons, lead-smelters of Rotherhithe—on 6th February, about 20 minutes to 9 in the evening I was on their wharf, and saw Holmes and Turnbull go to the pothouse: they could get on to the wharf that way—I went out a short time after, stood on the crane, and saw Holmes standing on a barge with two or three pigs of lead beside him—it was a fine moonlight night—it was short lead, what we call silver lead—there were four or five piles of silver lead on the wharf, close to the crane, one of which was broken down—I saw Vincent on the barge with the pig of silver lead in his hand, going towards Holmes, who stood next the water—Vincent walked from the edge of the barge</p>

               <p>nearest the wharf—I stooped down, went into the works, and spoke to John Herbert—I went out with him on the wharf, and saw Holmes standing alongside the water-closet on the wharf; he made a bit of a cough, we stepped up towards him, and he came and asked us where we were going to—we said, "To see the ships going out"—he said, "There are none to-night"—I stepped on the crane again, and Holmes got hold of me to pull me off; I still got up, looked over, and saw Vincent going down into the cabin of the barge, and Turnbull standing on the deck—I said, "It is too cold to stop here, I will go inside"—Holmes said, "Was that you that was out a little while ago?" I said, "No; it was my mate, I think"—he said, "That is all right then," and I went inside—I had seen a mail passenger boat six or eight yards oflf smaller than this boat that goes over the water—I went inside and spoke to the watchman—I had not seen the barge after it was loaded that afternoon—she had her hatches on, covered up with tarpaulin, and was loaded with market lead, something like this—the pigs of silver lead on the wharf were five or six yards from the barge—the place they work in is the pot-house—that is where the lead is melted.</p>

               <p>gave him a bit of a pull, but he got up on the crane himself—Holmes got on the top of the fence, and slid down the guide chain of the crane—that would bring him on to the barge—Holmes said to me, "This is a very awkward way of getting over"—that is all I know of it—persons could not very well, at that state of the water, get up from the river bed, or from the wharf, without that chain, so that a person wanting to come to the wharf, would come through the pot-house—at low water I could not get up myself from the bed of the river—I had not noticed whether the guiding chain was fastened back that night.</p>

Enthoven and Sons, of Rotherhithe—these three men have been in my employment, doing Euthovens' work, and other work as well—Vincent and Holmes were to work for Euthoven that day by my directions—Holmes was to work at Woolwich—he had not any business at Enthovens' by my orders—Vincent was at the Rotherhithe wharf—he has no right to do business on his own account for Enthoven's—if he were sent to Enthovens' to do any work, I should send him—Holmes was unloading a cargo of lead at Woolwich—Turnbull had net any work at Enthovens' that day by my orders—I should have given him the orders if he had had any—Vincent was the only man there by my directions that day—he had to load a barge of lead for Wool<lb/>wich, and when the tide served, to take her down—Turnbull had been working for me at the St. Katherine's Docks that day, loading a barge of coffee and wine—I left him at work there covering up the barge—when I left I told him to see everything safe and meet me at the counting-house, at 7 o'clock in the evening—it was then about half-past 4—I went to the counting-house and waited till about half-past 9—he had not been in at that time—I next saw him at my own house at Stepney, about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I think as near as possible—he said he came for his orders—it is not at all uncommon, if they don't meet me at the counting-house, to come to me at my house, if they are late—it is usual when I tell a man to come at 7 o'clock, for him to come—I tell them to come to the counting-house, and if they don't see me there they come to my house, and ask me for orders.</p>

Enthoven's—he could have had no business, in reference to that, to go to Enthoven's, that I am aware of—I don't see what there could be—Vincent had not anything to do with the craft that had been unloaded at Woolwich—Holmes had charge of all the craft that was at Woolwich, loaded—I can't tell you who took the barge down to Woolwich—it was unloaded on the Monday evening—she had been there four days; but who took her down, I do not know—they came and took samples away first, and afterwards came and unloaded them—I have never known it to happen that the men who unload at Woolwich have any papers to bring lack, to any messages to take to Messrs. Enthoven's—Holmes had nothing to do with the barge Vincent was to take, till she came down to his charge at Woolwich—having to unload at Woolwich it might be matter of curiosity to him to know the exact time she would arrive there; and he could find that nowhere with so much certainty as at the wharf itself—I have been in the pot-house myself.</p>
