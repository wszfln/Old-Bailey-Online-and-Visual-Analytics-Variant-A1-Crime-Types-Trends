I was in a procession of brakes; I was the fourth as we went alongâ€”it was very dark; all the brakes were on the near side of the road. I was fifteen yards behind the brake in front of me; I saw this gig in front of me; it was in the middle of the road; the horse and gig stopped, and then ran back on to my off-side front wheel. I pulled up my horses as quickly as I could; I undid my safety brake, and was about to put my reins on the footboard of the brake to get down, but then my passengers shouted out to me, 'Go on;' I looked to see if there was anything wrong; I did not, and so I followed on in the fourth place as before.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, of 68, St. John's Road, Upper Hollowayâ€”I attended Grace Sunman on 24th August, about eight p. mâ€”the mother brought it with Mrs. Wiston, and the prisoner was in the other roomâ€”I examined the child; it was in a very dirty conditionâ€”the lower part of the trunk and thighs were covered with excoriations in a raw state; it was in great pain, and cryingâ€”I</p>

               <p>should say the excoriations were due to the want of cleanliness and proper attentionâ€”the child was wet and dirty, and steaming when broughtâ€”that caused the excoriationsâ€”it vomitedâ€”I prescribed for itâ€”it was brought to me on the 26th; it had improved a little, and its skin had improved considerablyâ€”I attended on the 5th, when it diedâ€”I did not weigh it when brought to meâ€”it was weighed in the mortuaryâ€”it weighed 7lb. 13oz.â€”I was present at the post-mortem examinationâ€”I attribute its death to exhaustion, arising from want of proper care and attentionâ€”I attended the prisoner's house on the 23rd; a Sunday eveningâ€”the evening before the child was brought to meâ€”I went to attend another childâ€”no mention was made of this childâ€”I saw Mrs. Davis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not think it would be correct to say that diarrhÅ“a and improper food accounted for the death of this childâ€”diarrhÅ“a coming from improper food in a child of that age would very likely cause deathâ€”I should not recommend sopped biscuitâ€”in some children it would produce diarrhÅ“aâ€”I do not know that diarrhÅ“a is more common in children in August than in any other monthâ€”I say that death was accelerated by the want of proper care and attention, and the child suffering great painâ€”the diarrhÅ“a would not have produced inflammation if it had been kept cleanâ€”excoriation is not uncommon, if there is want of cleanlinessâ€”diarrhÅ“a and vomiting were from improper feedingâ€”that would account for death; but I said before the Magistrate that death was acceleratedâ€”I said: "I made a. post-mortem examination; I found no organic disease whatever; diarrhÅ“a and improper feeding would account for death"â€”in this case it wouldâ€”(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "And the post-mortem fortified and corroborated my opinion ")â€”I never said that I said, after speaking of weight, "A child of this age should have nothing but milk and water"â€”feeding a child on sops and biscuit is a very common cause of diarrhÅ“aâ€”I was of opinion that its death was accelerated by its previous pain from excoriation of the thighs and the lower part of the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I practise at Wimborne Streetâ€”I assisted Dr. McAusland to make a post mortem examination of this childâ€”from the evidence I heard before the Coroner and my observations at the examination, I came to the conclusion that death was accelerated by diarrhÅ“a, and that the primary cause of death was either improper feeding or an insufficient amount of foodâ€”the excoriations were very slight, nearly goneâ€”it would be difficult to keep a child free from excoriations if it had contracted diarrhÅ“a.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Even under a mother's eye such excoriations as I saw might ariseâ€”Robb's biscuits and condensed milk would be improper dietâ€”that would very likely produce diarrhÅ“aâ€”death, if not caused, was accelerated by diarrhÅ“aâ€”if the child was nursed by the mother night and morning the ill-effects of feeding on farinaceous food and condensed milk would be very much greater than if it was entirely fed on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The diet would not have such a rapid effect unless it caused diarrhÅ“a quite early, and that continued from 20th to 24th Julyâ€”I found no sign of organic disease; it was clearly a case of improper feeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver, at 5, Gough Square, Fleet Streetâ€”in May last Hutchinson came to me and said that he had succeeded to the business of Mr. Sison, an ornamental engraver at Birm<lb/>ingham, and he brought me a rough drawing in pencil of a piece of work which I executed; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the plate, numbered 2â€”he said it was not satisfactory, not the pattern he requiredâ€”on June 3rd he called again, and by his instructions I made, this plate, No. 13; it is an ordinary everyday pattern, of which we keep a large quantity in stock, it is a diagonal line plate, used for tints and backgroundsâ€”the next order he gave me was some time in June, this is the plate, No. 10; I executed that from a drawing he brought me; it is a border with a black centre; he came and fetched the plate after I had worked it outâ€”I said to him, "This looks to me like a coupon, do you know for whom you are doing it?"â€”he said, "A stranger called on me and asked if I could draw," he replied, "Yes, I can draw anything"; that he gave him a little square and said, "Will you make a drawing from that and engrave it?" and he said, "Yes. "Subsequently to that I did another plate, No. 3; I did that from a drawing which he brought; that was to go inside No. 10â€”I afterwards executed plate No. 12, that was in July; that was done from a pattern, the same as the outside of No. 10, but worked in a different direction, longitudinallyâ€”I did No. 12 from verbal instructions by Hutchinsonâ€”f also did this plate, No. 11, in August, I don't know the exact date; I did it from a drawing supplied by Hutchinson, because plate No. 3 carried too much colour for his customer; he wanted it more open, to print lighter; these papers marked "G" and "J" have been printed from these plates.</p>

               <p>me, but not for coupons, but for a commercial purpose, as labels. There is the difference. The plate found upon me I do not know what is written there, as the lettering is backwards, and I brought it, as it was not done according to my wish, to give back and tell him what letters ought to be done on it, because I told him when I left the genuine coupon to engrave not exactly the same, because this one which I leave is a Russian coupon. I cannot say if I said Russian, but I said 'It is a coupon, and cost money.' I explained to him to make some alterations there, as the order as a label, and as not to answer the same purpose as the genuine. Well, he said I will try to make some alterations in it, but I tell him (I mean Mr. Hutchinson) not to forget about the alterations, and in order to prevent any mistake I proposed Mr. Hutchinson to engrave it if it is possible in my presence, in order to indicate what alterations have to be done in my order. He answer me that you can leave the genuine coupon and go to Bristol to have quiet, and without any doubt that the alterations you require will be done as far as possible. I asked him if he did understand me what I told him. He told me, although you do not speak so clear English, and I cannot understand you distinctly, I see that you want alterations, and I will do them. Before going away where I left the genuine coupon, where is written twenty-five roubles in two languages, in Russian, which he could not understand, and in Latin characters; letters, I mean, on the back, which letters can read every Englishman, as they are English, although I told him before that it was a coupon; but I repeated him that he don't want to make for me a coupon. I left the coupon and went to Bristol. This is for the last plate found on me on the date of my arrest. I wish to reserve my other defence. Of the plates found on me on the day of my arrest I saw one alteration, as I could as I thought that the letters were back<lb/>wards, and I could not see distinctly if there was any other alteration is engraved instead of 1891 as is the genuine and the plate is 1892, and I consider that it is not the same, and cannot answer the purpose of any coupon, but everyone can see that it is a label, because who could take it and pay money for it. It is impossible to take it as a coupon and be changed. "</p>

I stood them drinks; that was the manner of settling itâ€”I did not see McDowell afterwards that dayâ€”before I was robbed of the extra Â£1 communicated with the policeâ€”the prisoner's stake and winnings on Garnish came to Â£2 10s., and he had deposited Â£1 on Dainty, making Â£3 10s.â€”I made no communication to the police from the evening the Â£4 10s. was paid until Mr. Bannister called on me.</p>

I am light carman to Mr. Raynerâ€”on 15th August I saw one of his vans empty outside the Anchor and Hope Yard in Bermuda Street, with Tillard and Francis in charge of itâ€”there was no horse in itâ€”Tillard said there were a few chips and broken wood in. the yard, I could have them if I liked for firewoodâ€”Francis heard that, he was about two yards awayâ€”I went into the Anchor and Hope Yard between 3.30 and 4, or later, and there found some bits of broken wood and a few empty tea-chests of plain wood not covered with paperâ€”on 17th August, about 9.30 a.m., I saw Francis and Tillard with Mr. Rayner's van empty, and a black horse with white points of their ownâ€”I have known Tillard for about two years; I had not seen Francis beforeâ€”Jones I only knew by his coming down once with Tillard to Rayner's stable, about taking a little light trap outâ€”I next saw Tillard after 17th August at the Police-court, when he was with two others, I thinkâ€”I identified him as the man I saw with Rayner's vanâ€”afterwards I picked out Jones from a number of men as one of the men who came down with Tillard on one occasion, and as a friend of Tillard's.</p>

I am a carman and contractor, of 181, Mare Street, Hackneyâ€”on Monday, 17th August, at 9.45, I was outside my shop, and saw a van which had broken down, the tyre having burst off the hind off wheel, with a crowd of people round itâ€”Tillard, whom I knew, was in charge of itâ€”he asked me if I had a van I could let him haveâ€”I said, "Yes, there is one at the yard you can go and take "â€”he took the horse out, and my van was brought down to the other oneâ€”in the broken van were sacks, which I thought contained corn or something; the name on. them was "Press Brothers, Yarmouth," to the best of my knowledgeâ€”some tarpaulins were also in the vanâ€”all the sacks were moved from the broken-down van into mineâ€”Francis assisted Tillardâ€”I asked Tillard how long he would be with the van, and he said an hour to an hour and a halfâ€”Jones stood on one side, as a spectator, as far as I could judge, and took no part in loading or unloading; he was clean shaven then, except a moustacheâ€”I went with Tillard and Francis to the public-house and had something to drinkâ€”they left the broken-down van on the near side of the road, opposite the Dolphin public-houseâ€”shortly afterwards Tillard returned, and paid me one shilling and sixpence for the hire of my vanâ€”after it was put back into my yard by Tillard I went to put my horse in to go out on my own work, and I noticed some teaâ€”the horse was a dark cob, what we call a <hi rend="italic">cabber</hi>, straight forelegs the near side, and white points behind; it belongs to a cabmanâ€”the harness was white metal plateâ€”afterwards I went to Mr. Robertson's stables in Hanover Square, and saw the same harness and horse thereâ€”when the van was broken down in the road, Tillard asked Francis to go up to the owner of the van and tell him about it; he did so, and brought back two or three menâ€”I said, "You had better go and get a spanner from my place, and try and get a wheel from my place, and put a barrow underneath"â€”Tillard told Francis to get the van taken away, and he returned to take it away, going to my shop after the spanner.</p>

"â€”he said, "I suppose you buy tea? I can sell you some at sixpence a pound"â€”I should not consider tea at that price was go honestlyâ€”I said, "No, my boy, I will not shake hands with you, neither will I buy tea"â€”there was a lot of tea on the floor, which I took</p>

I am a commission agent at 21, Amherst Road, Hackney, where my wife has an independent business as grocer and provision dealer in her maiden name, Newmanâ€”on 17th August, between 8 and 9 a.m., I came into the shop and saw a pair of scalesâ€”I had a conversation with my wife and gave her certain instructionsâ€”between 10 and 11 she called me into the shop, where I saw Hill, whom I knew, and Drummond, whom I recognised as a man I knew slightly five years beforeâ€”I saw two sacks on the scales, and two carts outside, one empty and the other loaded, or nearly so, with sacks, backed on to the shopâ€”the sacks on the cart were similar to those on the scalesâ€”I saw two men evidently going to take the sacks off the scales; one was Tillard, and I am pretty sure I saw Francis in the neighbourhood hanging about outside, and I think Jones as well, but I am not sureâ€”I do not think I saw Francis in the shopâ€”on the sacks I saw, "Press Brothers, Yarmouth "with a crown and a ring in the middleâ€”I knew that firmâ€”on the empty van was the name, John Angelâ€”all the sacks but two were on the covered van, they reached to the tail endâ€”I saw twelve carried to the covered vanâ€”my wife called my attention to a little heap of tea on the counterâ€”I said, "Halloa, Drummond! How did you get on with your building speculations at Southend?"â€”I had originally seen him there live years before, and I think I had seen him twice in the intervalâ€”I said to Hill, "What does this mean?"â€”he said, "Well, governor, I offered the scales to the missus"â€”I said, "I know about that, and we agreed not to keep them"â€”Drummond said, "Mr. Hutchinson, there is no harm here; it is rummaged tea"â€”I said to Hill, "I wish this had not happened here; I should like to have prevented it; you will take away the scales immediately; you had better clear out at once"â€”he said, "I cannot take away the scales immediately, but I will come for them by-and-by;</p>

I went to Hutchinson's shop to see the stuff weighed, and to see that I had not been done for my money. I gave them that cheque.

               <p>printed some prospectuses for himâ€”he called on January 29th, and said he had just arrived from France, and had not had time to get money from the bank, and was short of money, and asked me if I could cash a cheque for him for Â£25â€”I hesitated at first, but as two American gentlemen had deposited money with him I gave him a chequeâ€”he then gave me his cheque for six hundred and odd francsâ€”I said that I must have the moneyâ€”he said, "The money will be in London in four days"â€”I asked him if it was all right; he said, "Yes, I have just paid in four" or five "hundred francs," I forget whichâ€”he gave me a cheque on the Credit Foncier, and I gave him my cheque for Â£25, payable to his orderâ€”he endorsed it in my presenceâ€”I sent his cheque to my bankers, and it was returned to me with this protest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for which I had to pay a guineaâ€”he had made an appointment to see me in a few days in connection with the prospectus, but he did not turn up, and I did not see him again till he was arrested in Glasgow on a warrant nine months afterwardsâ€”he said he was staying at South Bank, Bromley, except his wife and her sister, who were at Monte Carloâ€”he also said that he was staying at the Hotel Victoriaâ€”I made personal inquiries there, and also at Bromley, and of different tradesmen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Inspector</hi>). On August 27th I took the prisoner in Glasgow, on a warrant, which I read to himâ€”he said, "When I gave Bates the cheque I thought there was more than sufficient in the bank to meet it"â€”I found on him fourteen pawn-tickets, dated from September, 1890, to July, 1891, for jewellery and clothesâ€”the total amount of them is about Â£8; they were pawned at various placesâ€”I found this document in his possession. (<hi rend="italic">A list of pawnings</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The police at Glasgow were informed by telegram; the prisoner was arrested, and I went downâ€”the prisoner was travelling on commission for printingâ€”the first pawn-ticket is September, 1890â€”in the list there is a waterproof coat pawned in the name of G.D. Vaughan, not for 7s. 10d., I take it to be the 7th of the 10th month.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate</hi>: "All I have to say is, in regard to the cheque of Â£25 I had no intention to defraud, and that a cheque for 1,000 francs was drawn on Havre by me prior to my leaving Paris, which I was told, three days after calling, that it being written in figures the amount would not be cashed; therefore I could not get the money, and the cheque consequently would be returned unpaid. On that presump<lb/>tion I considered I had 1,000 francs to credit, but it turned out afterwards that the cheque was paid by the Havre branch of the Credit Lyonnaise, and the money afterwards returned to me. The first cheque for 298f. 50c., which was the first cheque operating on the account at all at that bank, was not paid by the Credit Lyonnaise, on account of the informality of the date being in figures. Some time afterwards that identical cheque followed me to Paris, whereupon I gave a fresh cheque for the same, writing the date in letters; that cheque was duly honoured. The first cheque I believe can be produced."</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager for Mr. George Rice, a furrier carrying on business at the Hudson Bay Works, Stratford, and Great Prescott Street, Londonâ€”I do not know if we have missed nutria skinsâ€”on Thursday, 1st October, I was in our Great Prescott Street premises when Wright came with these skinsâ€”I recognised them as our nutria skinsâ€”they are not in the condition in which we should sell them, as the grease is not taken from the fur, nor the sawdust in which they are cleanedâ€”we do not usually silver them to add to the lustre before we sell themâ€”the value of the skins is about 4s. each, Â£3 altogetherâ€”they were never sold by our firm in this condition.</p>

               <p>makes a mark on itâ€”the flesher and other workmen are not permanently employed by usâ€”there is a mark made by the flesher with a knife, and a mark made by the dresser by puncturing holesâ€”the flesher uses his own mark, which we can identifyâ€”the dresser marks it with a thing with a number of bayonet points which we supply him withâ€”I don't suggest that that instrument is peculiar to our firm, and that no other firm uses itâ€”apart from the flesher's and dresser's marks there is no private distinctive mark of our firm on those skinsâ€”the identification of the skins is partly by the flesher's mark and partly by the dresser's punctured markâ€”these skins would be an imitation of beaverâ€”I have had eighteen years' experience in the trade; I have had no experience in buying skinsâ€”I never heard of honest manufacturers buying skins in that conditionâ€”I should not buy skins in that condition if they were offered to meâ€”we have a stock of seventy thousand skinsâ€”the first consignment of these skins we had this season was early in Juneâ€”we have had nutria skins in stock for five or six yearsâ€”I can identify these as skins of 1891 by the dressingâ€”the skins of 1890 differ from those of 1891 as far as dressing is concernedâ€”1891 is the first time that this dressing has been applied to these skinsâ€”to my knowledge no workmen have been discharged over this matterâ€”no workmen take the skins homeâ€”I am always at the works from nine to six, all over the placeâ€”I have never seen the prisoner talking to any of our workmen, or hanging about the worksâ€”four shillings would be the price for these skins when they were ready for the market; they are not ready now; I cannot say what their value is now; I don't sell themâ€”we should sell them to the retailer at four shillings a skin when finishedâ€”these are not silvered; silvering gives them a gloss and makes the colour lighter, and that makes them of considerably more market valueâ€”the amount of labour and chemicals expended in silvering and dressing up a skin is worth about sixpenceâ€”I do not think we are the only merchants in London who sell nutria skins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These three stabs are the flesher's mark; the flesher takes the waterproof skin from the flesh side, at our worksâ€”our men always use the same mark; if there are only a few fleshers at work their mark is two cuts, if there are half-a-dozen fleshers one gives them two cuts on the shoulder, the second at the side of the head, the third on the other shoulder, the fourth at the tail, and so on, but if there are more than six fleshers they make three marks, and these three show there must have been more than sixâ€”the flesher is responsible for the markâ€”the marks on these skins were made by our fleshersâ€”we insist on the mark being put inâ€”it is the mark of the flesher which we determine; we tell him what mark it is to be; if there are more than six fleshers the seventh has to put the third markâ€”some of the dresser's marks have been cut out, and some have been partly cut outâ€”the dresser's mark is a figureâ€”there would be no honest reason for cutting out the marksâ€”we make our own markâ€”the skins are this year's importation; we imported none earlier than Juneâ€”Mr. Rice can speak to the skins equally with myself.</p>

If these skins came from another firm it would be possible for them to bear marks similar to these if the same number of fleshers were working on themâ€”other firms use perforated marks, but some have larger designs and numbersâ€”I do not know of any firm in England that does not use the perforated numbersâ€”we put no registered</p>

About seven p.m. on Friday, 2nd October, I went with Whitehead to the prisoner's house, having previously been to Brook, and obtained information and an invoice from himâ€”I said to the prisoner, "We are police officers, and we are making inquiry respecting some skins. Those skins are now in the possession of Mr. Rice, at Prescott Street, and he has identified them as having been stolen from his factory. Book says that he obtained the skins from you"â€”I told him Brook said fifteen skinsâ€”the prisoner said, "Yes, I sold fifteen nutria skins to Mr. Brook; I have got a receipt for them, and can tell you where I got them from; but to-day being one of our very strict</p>

There is something I forgot. There were sixteen skins that I sold to Brook, but Brook threw one out. I knew that there was something wrong, and when Mr. Rice comes I shall make a clean breast of it"â€”he was taken to West Ham Police-station, and when charged he asked me to allow him to look at the skinsâ€”I let him to so, and he then said, "These are not the skins which I sold to Mr. Brook"â€”before saying that he took hold of one or two and just looked at them, he did actually handle themâ€”after he was charged he said, "Can I have bail and go with Mr. Rice and have a word with him, and I will tell you what my defence will be?"â€”Mr. Rice was presentâ€”the prisoner was not bailed then, but he was taken before the Magistrate and bailed the next day.</p>

               <p>and placed a plank there which went more perpendicularly into the barâ€”he got down the plank into the bar, came to the counter, lifted the flap, passed through inside the bar past me, and turned to the left to the tillâ€”I lifted up another flap and jumped on to his backâ€”he shouted out in English, "Oh! oh! don't hurt me, don't hurt me!"â€”I took him by the scruff of the neck and kept him till Mr. Cundy, whom we aroused, came down with a lightâ€”Mr. Cundy found the prisoner's boots in my presence, he had none on thenâ€”Willett was with me all the time, and went to the station with me and himâ€”the window does not openâ€”the public-house closes at ten, and we were locked in in front of the bar.</p>

I have lived for six years at 26, Mallam Road, and am Rhoda Brown's motherâ€”on 23rd September Mrs. Gill went awayâ€”on 8th October the male prisoner came to the house in the night, or early in the morningâ€”I had not seen him there before; I had heard a man go into the house before when we were in bedâ€”about two or three in the morning I and my daughter were asleep, and I heard a man knock at the door, and I heard a man come inâ€”in the morning, about nine o'clock, I saw John Pollard go out, carrying two large bundlesâ€”Esther Pollard, his mother, followed him with a little hamper basket, and my daughter was going to see him off by trainâ€”I said, "There is some<lb/>thing wrong; you have got something there belonging to Mrs. Gill"â€”Esther Pollard said, "I am off, good-bye; it is my own"â€”the man did not hear me speak; he was ahead of his motherâ€”soon after they had gone I went to Forest Hill Railway Stationâ€”just before I got there I saw the prisoners; John had no bundles then, Esther had the hamper basketâ€”in the booking office at the station I saw two large bundles; one was wrapped in Mrs. Gill's green cover, which I had carried over many baskets of clothesâ€”my daughter only saw the prisoners off by the trainâ€”I went and gave some information to the police.</p>

I did not notice anything on his head till a day or two afterwards, when I saw a lump on the side of his head; it got worse; I did not notice any discoloration. At eight p.m. on Satur<lb/>day I put it in the perambulator; I noticed it was dying soon after<lb/>wards. I told my sister Alice about the child falling, not my husband till later on. I did not go out on Saturday night and leave the child in bed. Mrs. Harding gave me notice, I do not know why; she did not tell me. When the child was dead, I sent for Mrs. Shollick. I gave it milk on Saturday, it did not have anything else; it had bread and milk on Friday, half a teacupful of milk and small slice of bread, the same as supper; I gave it milk during the night; it was restless. My husband did not return till nine at night"â€”<hi rend="italic">Further examination on Friday</hi>, 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>

Then I noticed a large bump on the head. I asked my husband if he had hit the baby; he made no answer, he was the worse for liquor. He said, "I did not think I hit it so hard.'

I am a M.R.C.S., practising at Guildfordâ€”on 4th August I made a post-mortem examination of the baby of the two prisoners; it was apparently about five months oldâ€”I weighed itâ€”the normal weight of a child five months old, properly nourished, would be about eleven lbs.; this baby weighed seven and three-quarters lbs.â€”it was not particularly small, not a dwarf, the length of the body was twenty-three inchesâ€”externally I found a brown discoloration on the forehead on the right sideâ€”above the right ear I found a dark-coloured lumpâ€”there was a small scar on the outside of the left elbow, about a quarter of an inch in diameter; these were all the external appearancesâ€”the child was very thinâ€”I found a fracture of the skull on the right side of the head, corresponding to the lungs, also ulcera<lb/>tion of the brain with adhesion of the membranesâ€”that was sufficient to cause deathâ€”in my opinion the injury to the brain was the cause of death; the other organs of the body were healthy, subject to the emaciationâ€”there was a little liquid in the stomachâ€”there was nothing in the appearance of the internal organs sufficient to cause deathâ€”if medical aid had been provided in time probably death might have been preventedâ€”I cannot speak positively as to that, but probably life might have been saved.</p>

On 24th August I received infor<lb/>mation about this robbery, between eleven and twelve oclock, and with other officers kept watch upon No. 1<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Glaskin Villas, Lea Bridge Road, Mrs. McMinn's house, all that afternoonâ€”I saw Leigh go into the house several times between four and six p.m.â€”I first saw him and Marshall about two o'clock togetherâ€”I went into the stable just before two o'clock the following morning, and found 1,875 gold and silver watches and forty-six packages of silk, furs, and embroideriesâ€”this board was there with a label on it, marked, "Flenner, 3,721" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)â€”these are probably foreign railway labelsâ€”I have some of the watches here, they were all in boxes similar to these; they had been taken out of the pack<lb/>ing cases, parts of which were there, and this is the lid of one of themâ€”they have been torn open by some instrument, not opened in the regular wayâ€”some of the silks were left in the cases, not unrolled, but piled up on top of the othersâ€”I remained there till 6.30 a.m., when the two prisoners came in togetherâ€”I said, "I am a police-officer, and so are the others with me; how do you account for the watches in the stable?"â€”Leigh said, "I know nothing about this man here," pointing to Marshall; "on Sunday night last he asked me to get a stable to <hi rend="italic">plant some stuff</hi>"â€”I said, "Who are the other men?"â€”he said, "I don't know"â€”I said, "There has been a big jewel robbery at London Bridge, and I believe these to be part of the proceeds, and you will both be charged"â€”I handed them over to the other officers, and later in the day they were charged at Stone's Endâ€”the charge was read over to them, and they made no replyâ€”you can only see the roof of the stable from the road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Leigh made no reply to the chargeâ€”he had told my brother officer that he was waiting for a man named Jonesâ€”before a man gets a licence for a beer-house he must produce evidence of good characterâ€”I do not think he has been at the Tap House very longâ€”it is a very low neighbourhood; I believe he has always conducted it respectablyâ€”there is a glass door in the stable, but no window or stallsâ€”there is a wall; it is intended for a coach-house and stables, and there is a hole in the wall large enough for a man to get through; a sack hung over the hole, and those goods were beyond the wallâ€”a man going into the stable could not see the goodsâ€”I believe the van had a name on the shaft.</p>

I am an insurance agent, and live at Guernsey Lodge, Surbitonâ€”on 24th August, between 10.30 and 10.45 a.m. I was at Waterloo Station, waiting for my train, and having half an hour to spare I walked outside into Waterloo Roadâ€”I was standing looking at a billâ€”there men were standing thereâ€”Green, who was one of them, rushed on me and snatched my chain and seals, and ran away with itâ€”I ran after him calling, "Stop thief!" I ran up a dark street for himâ€”he went up a ladder to escape out of a door leading into Waterloo Station; the door was locked, and just as I was getting hold of him Cornell came up and kicked me on my right foot and left leg, and they pitched me on to my head, and if it had not been for the silk hat I was wearing, I should have broken my head and lost my lifeâ€”I got up and called, "Police!" and they ran awayâ€”the value of my chain and seals was Â£20â€”they did not get my watch, they broke the chainâ€”this is one of the seals; it was afterwards foundâ€”in consequence of this assault I was some time under the doctor's careâ€”on the Saturday following I identified the prisoners from among othersâ€”I have no doubt about them.</p>
