He said, he desired the favour of me to let him have the loan of fourteen hundred pounds, that he had occasion for this money, as he had lately made a purchase in Suffolk or Norfolk, to the amount of twelve or fourteen thousand pounds. I told him, that the title deeds of such an estate were a good security, and if he would leave them, that he might have the money. Mr. Perreau said, that could not be, because the purchase-money was to be paid in the country. Then he said, he had got a bond of a gentleman whose name he was not at liberty at that time to mention, but, that if I knew the person, he was sure I could make no objection to it. I said, every thing depends upon the name, for some mens bonds are as good as other mens mortgages. Then he said, he had a house in Harley Street, Cavendish Square, which cost four thousand pounds: and he would leave with me the deeds of that house and the insurance of it, as a security for this fourteen hundred pounds, accordingly he came the next day, and did leave the deeds of the house as a security; and he received the money upon a note promising to assign the deeds, and to do every thing that was necessary: but as he only wanted it for ten days, I only took a note for it, without any further promise: this was about the 15th or 16th of January. I did not see him again till Tuesday the 7th of March. I was acquainted with him before, as an <rs id="t17750531-1-deflabel7" type="occupation">apothecary</rs>

When he came upon the 7th of March, he made an apology for not having kept his word, as to the fourteen hundred pounds, which he borrowed but for about ten days, and he came then to borrow five thousand pounds, out of which he was to pay this fourteen hundred pounds. He then told me, that he had got leave of the gentleman, whose bond he formerly mentioned to give me his name. I asked my brother Robert to come in to consult about the propriety of lending such a sum as that; the prisoner then produced this bond; as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310004"/> we saw it, we both expressed a disbelief of its being Mr. Adair's bond; and asked the prisoner if it was Mr.

He said, yes, it was, and that there could be no doubt about it; for that Arthur Jones, who was the solicitor of Mr. Adair, was a witness, and Start was his servant. I still expressed my doubts about the authenticity of the bond: upon which the prisoner said, Mr. Adair was his particular friend, that there were family connexious between them; that Mr. Adair had money of his in his hands, and that he allowed him interest for it. I understood likewise from him, but I cannot be certain of that particular fact, that the prisoner at that time said, that this bond was given by Mr. Adair to him as the balance of the account subsisting between Mr. Adair and him. Notwithstanding that, we told him that we did not believe it to be the hand-writing of Mr.

               <p>He accordingly took the bond with him and went away: but in about two hours, he returned; my brother was then gone out, and I saw him alone. He told me, what my brother and I had thrown out respecting the signature to the bond, had alarmed him very much, and that he could not be easy in his own mind till he had called upon Mr. Adair, whom he luckily met before he went to take his ride; that he produced the bond to Mr. Adair; and Mr. Adair said, it was his signature, and that he might possibly have altered his hand, from the time we had formerly seen him write; but that we might let him have the five thousand pounds, and that Mr. Adair said, he would pay the bond in May; though in fact, it was not payable till July. Notwithstanding all this, I still had my doubts; I did not express them so strong, but told the prisoner, that he should leave the bond with me, in order to get an assignment of it, which he did, as I was desirous to get possession of the bond, in order to find out whether it was really a good bond or no. The prisoner very readily left the bond with me without any memorandum given by me; and I bid him call the next morning at eleven o'clock. I gave the bond to my clerk. I am certain this (looking upon the bond in question) is the bond I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>My brother shewed the bond to Mr. Stephens of the Admiralty, a friend of Mr. Adair's. Mr. Perreau was to come again the next day; at eleven o'clock my mother and Mr. Stephens went that morning to Mr. Adair's. Mr. Perreau came to our house that morning about eleven o'clock, and my brother and I both expressed our doubts about its being the signature of Mr. Adair; but from what my brother had told me, of his interview with Mr. Adair, I could have no doubt. Mr. Perreau persisted in saying there could be no doubt about it; for that he had a letter from Mr. Adair, that Mr. Adair always wrote to him in a familiar style, and only signed the initial letters of his name. I understood that he received that letter the night before. He only shewed me the initial letters, to prove the intimacy; we said nothing would convince us of this being Mr. Adair's hand, but Mr. Perreau's going with us to Mr. Adair's, which he most readily assented to. Mr. Perreau and I went together in his coach, I had my carriage at the door, but his carriage being up first, he said you had better go in mine, itis the quickest. Mr. Perreau and I went together in the coach, to Mr. Adairs', nobody else was with us; my brother followed us; we found Mr. Adair at home; upon our entrance Mr. Adair took me by the hand, but he made a bow to Mr. Perreau, as a person he had never seen before; I told Mr. Adair, I came to him upon a disagreeable subject, I produced the bond, and asked him whether that was his signature at the bottom of it. He looked at it, and said, no; upon which Mr.

About that time my brother came in, a great deal of conversation passed backwards and forwards, at last Mr. Perreau said, he had the bond from his sister, Mrs.

I asked him how it was possible for him to say he had received a letter from Mr. Adair, as he pretended, in that familiar stile, from a man he did not so much as know; and I desired to see the letter, which he produced; which letter I thought it very material, as well as the bond, to keep in my possession. We could get nothing from him but that he was an innocent man, and he did not mean to impose upon its, and that his sister could explain all. She did take it upon herself, expressed much regard for

That is all that passed. We were three or four hours together; we sent for

             would you ask this gentleman any questions, or leave it to your council.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I would ask you a few questions, in order perfectly to understand you. The first time that the prisoner came to you with this bond upon your inspection, and your brother's you expressed great doubts of its being Mr. William Adair's.</p>
               <p>Drummond. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose with a degree of positiveness that it was not?</p>
               <p>Drummond. That we had great doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed them over and over?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, over and over again.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed no manner of inclination therefore at that time to advance money upon this bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. None at all, further than telling him to leave the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time he came with the bond, on the 7th of March, you did not desire it to be left?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You expressed no desire then to get possession of the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you perfectly explained to him that you was almost satisfied that it was not Mr. Adair's hand?</p>
               <p>Drummond. We expressed great doubts, there was a delicacy, we did not chuse to say he had brought us a forged bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother with you upon this Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both express your doubts?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay, this first time?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Eight or ten minutes; or a quarter of an hour, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And he returned you that same bond</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call in any body but your brother, when he came the second time with the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Nobody whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed your expression was, that he said, there were family connexions, and he has my money, and pays me interest for it; can you take upon you to say with absolute certainty, whether he said, it was his money Mr. Adair paid interest for, or some of the family's money?</p>
               <p>Drummond. His money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310006"/>Drummond. Yes, I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take away, the bond that time?</p>
               <p>Drummond. He did the first, time but not the second.</p>
               <p>Q. He readily left the bond?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, without even a memorandum.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any hesitation?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer any excuse not to leave it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He complied with your desire of leaving the bond, as the most innocent man would have done?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, readily.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that he said, he himself had seen Mr. Adair when he was going to ride, or that his sister, or any body else had?</p>
               <p>Drummond. I am perfectly sure, he said, that he himself saw Mr. Adair, that he was in his boots, and he luckily catched him just before he was going to take a ride.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the bond to your clerk after Mr. Perreau was gone?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, to the clerk, or my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When you desired him to come the next day at eleven o'clock, did he readily consent?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Very readily; he supposed, then for what I know, that he was to have the money, for he left the bond in order to have the assignment drawn up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during the times he was at your house, he did not once ask to have the bond away with him?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first shewed you this letter, with Mr. Adair's initials, did you desire to read it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He produced that letter merely to shew you the initials?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, I did not read it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he still insisted that the name was Mr. Adair's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Drummond. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first proposed to go to Mr. Adair's?</p>
               <p>Drummond. My brother, or I, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was one of you?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, that immediately upon the proposal being made, he most readily consented to it?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe in his expression, or countenance, or behaviour, the least reluctance to come into the proposal of going to Mr. Adair?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Not the least; for being convinced in my own mind that it was a forged bond. I looked steadfastly on his countenance, and could not see him alter in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went to Mr. Adair's?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said he carried you in his coach?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, he said that would be the quickest way of going, his coach being first at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Adair had denied that it was his signature, and you requir'd an explanation of the business, he almost immediately said, that his sister,

               <p>Q. And as I understood you, he then for the first time appeared surpriz'd?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He proposed to send for Mrs.

               <p>Q. How soon did she come?</p>
               <p>Drummond. I believe as soon as the carriage would go up to Golden Square and return.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular delay?</p>
               <p>Drummond. No, she came as soon as the carriage could well bring her.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said in the gross, that she took it wholly upon herself?</p>
               <p>Drummond. She did,</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do that in the presence of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes, she said he was totally innocent, and she was the person that forged the bond, and begg'd us for God's sake to have mercy upon an innocent man, to consider his wife and children.</p>

               <p>Drummond. She acknowledged the whole, and said no body was meant to be injured; that it would all be paid; that she never meant to injure us or any body.</p>
               <p>Q. She said that she had done it, and that he was perfectly innocent?</p>
               <p>Drummond. She did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you express any doubt whether she could readily write that name in the way in which it appears?</p>
               <p>Drummond. Yes we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her answer?</p>
               <p>Drummond. My brother said, that it was a masculine hand, and he did not think a woman could write it: she proved it, by taking a bit of paper and shewing us she could write it.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was the same hand?</p>
               <p>Drummond. It did appear to us to be the same.</p>

Oh, said he, there is no doubt but it is his hand, it is witnessed by Mr. Jones, Mr. Adair's solicitor, and his servant. Said I, it is very odd, I have seen his hand formerly, this does not appear to be the least like it. I think, I said to him, if I was to take my oath, I would rather swear it was not his hand-writing. I said, the bond is made payable to you, was you present when it was executed? No, said he, I was not present. I believe my brother then said, come to morrow and we will give you an answer. When Mr. Perreau was gone, I told my brother I had great doubts about the signature, and I thought it would not be amiss to have the bond left with us, as it must be assigned if we advanced any money upon it. I went out with a gentleman who was then waiting for me; I returned in two or three hours, When I came back, I asked my brother if he had sent for the bond; he said Mr. Perreau has been here, and has left the bond. Mr. Perreau came again the next morning for his answer, Mr. Stephens and I had been previously with Mr. Adair, and shewed him the bond. I asked Mr. Perreau if this Mr. Adair was the late agent in Pall-Mall, I said, an elderly gentleman, and described him as well as I could. He said it was. I looked very stedfastly on his countenance, and did not observe it had any effect upon him. I said we have our doubts, and till these doubts are cleared up we can advance no money. I said, the only way of clearing up those doubts would be to go to Mr. Adair, if he had no objection. He said no; he looked at his watch, and said, if he is not gone out. I had not been come from Mr.

At first, she asked to speak with Mr. Adair in a room by himself. Mr. Adair declined that, and said, you are quite a stranger to me, and you can have no conversation with me that may not pass before these gentlemen. I had told him before this, that I would send for a constable directly, and send him before a magistrate if he would not tell his accomplices; for accomplices he must have, if he did not do it himself: then it was that he sent for his sister.

               <p>Wilson. The latter end of February, or the beginning of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. I perceive it bears date to the 25th of January.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I recollect I antidated it to the preceding January, at the request of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had so fill'd it up and anti-dated it, did you give it back to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310010"/>Q. And you never had it from any other hand, or gave it to any other hand but the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it fill'd up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. At my house at Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person present?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, except it was some of my family.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you did it by his direction; you had the directions I believe in writing?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Then produce them.</p>
               <p>Wilson. These were the instructions the prisoner gave me: (producing them)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the instructions, or what should be done with them?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He said, Mr. Wilson, I have given you the instructions upon a piece of paper; I desire you will burn it. I told him, there was a minute upon the back of the paper of a petition to the recorder, and I could not burn it then, because of that minute. He desired I would burn it, when I had done with it, and I promised I would; but I put it in my desk and it slipp'd my memory.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no names upon this bond at the time you fill'd it up?</p>
               <p>Wilson. None.</p>
               <p>Q. I see part of these instructions are scor'd through?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that done by?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The prisoner; after I had fill'd up the bond and before he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read what is scor'd through?</p>

               <p>Wilson. Yes. it is

               <p>Adair. Nobody, only her and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did she come to you?</p>
               <p>Adair. She knows a gentleman that I know in the North of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Court. That cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>My lord, it has already been given in evidence, that Mrs. Rudd took it upon herself, and declared the prisoner totally innocent. This letter is exactly to the same purport, and this letter is written, as I understand, the day after she was at Mr. Adair's. The expressions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310011"/> all along go not only to acquit the prisoner of an absolute forgery; but that he was perfectly innocent in the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. Can her letter be stronger evidence than her own personal declarations? Both the Mr. Drummonds declare she took it upon herself; that she did it; that the whole was her's; and he was innocent: that is certainly stronger than her writing it down upon a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>I am perfectly satisfied with your lordship's declaration.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, If I had been wanting in that fortitude, which is the result of innocence, or had found any hesitation in submitting my proceedings to the strictest scrutiny, I need not at this day have stood before my country, or set my life upon the issue of a legal trial. Supported by the consciousness of my integrity, I have forced that taansaction to light, which might else have been suppressed; and I have voluntarily sought that imprisonment, which guilt never invites, and even innocence has been known to fly from. Ardently looking forward to this hour, as the sure, though painful means of vindicating a character, not distinguished indeed for its importance, but hitherto maintained without a blemish. There are many respectable witnesses at hand, and many more, I persuade myself, would be found if it had been necessary to summon them upon a point of such notoriety, who will inform your lordship and the court, how I have appeared to them to act, what trust has been reposed in me, and what credit I had in their opinions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310012"/> for my diligence, honesty, and punctuality. In truth, my lord, I am bold to say, that few men in my line of life have carried on their business with a fairer character, not many with better success. I have followed no pleasures, nor launched into any expences; there is not a man living who can charge me with neglect or dissipation. The honest profits of my trade have afforded me a comfortable support, and furnished me with the means of maintaining, in a decent sort, a worthy wife and three promising children, upon whom I was labouring to bestow the properest education in my power: in short, we were as happy as affluence and innocence could make us, till this affliction came upon us by surprize, and I was made the dupe of a transaction from whose criminality, I call God, the searcher of all hearts to witness, I am now as free as I was at the day of my birth. - My lords, and gentlemen of the jurymen, men who are unpracticed in deceit, will be apt to credit others for a sincerity; which they themselves possess. The most undersigning characters have at all times been the dupe of craft and subtilty. A plain story, with the indulgence of the court, I will relate, which will furnish strong instances indeed of credulity on one part, which at the same time will exhibit a train of such consummate artifices, that are not to be equalled in all the annals of iniquity, and which might have extorted an equal confidence from a much more enlightened understanding than I can claim.</p>

               <p>"of its being a surgery till the interview</p>
               <p>"with Mr. Adair." - Having stated the above circumstances, the prisoner concluded his defence to the following effect:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have now faithfully laid before you, such circumstances which have occured to my memory, as necessary for your information, in the order as they happened during my acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd, under the character of my brother's wife. Many have been the sufferers by artifices and impostors, but never man appeared, I believe, in this or any other tribunal, upon whom so many engines were set at work to interest his credulity. It will not escape the notice of this splendid court, that my compassion was first engaged by the story of Mrs. Rudd's sufferings, before my belief was invited to her representations. Let me have credit with you for yielding up by pity in the first instance, and you cannot wonder I did not with hold my credulity afterwards. It is in this natural, this necessary consequence, I rest my defence. I was led from error to error by such insensible degrees; that every step I took strengthened my infatuation. When Mr. Drummond first hesitated at the hand writing at the foot of the bond, I tendered in the name of 
               <persName id="t17750531-1-person120">
                  William
                   Adair
               <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="surname" value="Adair"/>
                     <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="given" value="William"/>
                     <interp inst="t17750531-1-person120" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
            , if it did not so far alarm me as to shake my belief in this artful woman, from whose hands I had received it, let it be considered that I had been prevailed upon to negociate other bonds of this artful woman depositing them in the hands of bankers who had never spied any defect, or raised the least objection. These bonds had been punctually and regularly paid in due time. The letters sent to me, as if from 
               <persName id="t17750531-1-person121">
                  William
                   Adair
               <interp inst="t17750531-1-person121" type="surname" value="Adair"/>

                     <interp inst="t17750531-1-person121" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
            , critically agreed with the hand-writing of the bond. Mr. Adair did not keep money at Mr. Drummond's: opportunities of comparing his hand writing for many years, had not occured, and the hesitation upon his part, appeared to me no more than the exceptions and I minute precautions of a banker, which could not so suddenly overturn the explicit belief that I had annexed to all that was told me in Harley Street. Can any greater proof be given, than my own proposal to Mr. Drummond of leaving the bond in his hands till he had satisfied his credulity. Can your Lordship, or the gentlemen of the jury for a moment suspect, that any man could be guilty of such a crime, whose proceedings were so fair and open? that single circumstance I am satisfied, will afford my total exculpation. The resort to Mr. Adair was as easy to Mr. Drummond, as to the books in his compting house: it does not come within the bounds of common sense, much less does it fall within the possibility of guilt, that any man living should voluntarily, with his eyes open, take a step so directly and absolutely centering in his certain conviction. But this circumstance, strong as it is, is not all my case. I bless God, the protector of innocence, that in my defence, proofs arise upon proofs, the least of them I trust, will be thought incompatible with guilt: it should seem impossible that a guilty person would propose to Mr. Drummond to retain the bond for the satisfaction of his scruples; but that the same person, should after so long a time for consideration, had passed after my leaving the bond, which was full twenty-four hours, openly and in the face of the day enter the shop of Mr. Drummond, and demand if he had satisfied all his scruples; unless a man from meer desperation had been weary of his life, and fought a dissolution, this I humbly apprehend would be an absolute impossibility; but my lords, and gentlemen of the jury. I had neither in my breast the principle or guilt to commit that high offence against society, which would accompany the act; nor had I that desperate loathing of existence, as should bring a shameful condemnation upon my head: it is true, I have invited this trial, but it is equally true, I have done it in the consciousness of my integrity, because I could not otherwise go through the remainder of my days with comfort and satisfaction, unless I had the verdict of my countrymen for my acquital, and rested my innocence upon the purest testimony I could have on this side the grave. It is plain I had an opportunity of withdrawing myself:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310014"/> how many men are there with the clearest intentions, yet from the apprehensions of being made the talk of the public, and above all, the dread of imprisonment, and the terror of a trial, would have thought themselves happy to have caught at any opportunity of saving themselves from such a series of distress. Greater confidence can no man be in of the integrity of his case, and the justice of his country. When it was found necessary to the designs of Mrs. Rudd, that I and my family should be made the dupe of her connections with the house of Adair; it may well be believed, that nothing but the strongest interdictions would prevent my endeavours to obtain an interview. In fact, this point was laboured with consummate artifice, and nothing less than ruin to my brother and his affairs, was denounced upon my breaking this injunction; it was part of the same error to believe her in this also; a respectable witness has told you, and I do not controvert his evidence, that my confidence in her assertion, and in the testimonials that she exhibited under the hand, as I believed, of Mr. Adair, were such, in my mistaken judgment, as to be equal to the evidence of my own senses, pressed by the forms of business, to say to Mr. Drummond that I had seen Mr. Adair myself, but I neither went to Mr. Adair, nor disclosed those pressing motives which prevented me: no less free to confess my faults, than I am confident to assert my innocence, I seek no paliation for this circumstance, except my temptation and my failings, and I trust it will rather be a matter of surprize, that in the course of a negociation, through the whole of which I was acted upon by the most artful of imposters, that this only deviation was to be found, and yet this very circumstance carries with it a clearer conviction of my being the dupe of Mrs. Rudd's intrigues, than any I have to offer in my defence, and if my subsequent proceedings, and the alacrity I shewed in going with Mr. Drummond to Mr. Adair, together with my conduct before this gentleman, is, as I apprehend it is, absolutely irreconcilable with a conciousness of guilt, the circumstances above mentioned will serve to shew with what a degree of credulity the artifices of Mrs. Rudd had furnished me. - Upon the whole, if in the above detail no circumstances are discovered in which an innocent man, under the like delusion with myself, might not have acted as I have acted, and, at the same time, if there be very many particulars in which no guilty man would have conducted himself as I conducted myself, I should be wanting in respect to your lordships and the jury, if I doubted the justice of their verdict, and which is inseparable from it, my honourable acquital.</p>

             this morning; he by no means would have you do any thing painful to yourself, and if you do not like to apply to Mr. Evans for the money, he desired you would endeavour to get it of Mr. Drummonds, and in order to obviate an objection my brother made to going to Mr. Drummond, Mrs. Rudd said, it was Mr. Adair's desire that he should pay Mr. Drummond the fourteen hundred pounds, for which the papers of my house were mortgaged to Mr. Drummond, out of the five thousand pounds so borrowed. My brother, after a great unwillingness, at last agreed to it, and said he would get a bond filled up. My brother went out in the afternoon, and came in again just as we were at tea; and, in the presence of his wife, the gentleman that assists him in business, and myself, he delivered, her the bond, saying, madam, I have brought you the affair; she took it, put it in her pocket, and no farther conversation passed upon it till Monday the 6th, when I came home and was preparing to go to bed, I saw a letter lying on the table directed to herself; I asked what it was; she said it was the bond Mr. Adair had returned executed for my brother to get the money of Mess. Drummonds. She got up earlier than usual the next morning; she sent for my brother Robert, and gave him the bond, and desired him to go with it to Mess. Drummonds, and endeavour to get the money for Mr. Adair, with the same privacy that he had done upon other occasions. That Mr. Adair was unwilling to have it appear that the money was raised for him, and therefore my brother was desired to lodge the bond with so me confidential friend that would not desire an assignment of it. My brother shewed a vast deal of reluctancy, and said it was a very unpleasant work. And I said, I thought it was so. But as Mr. Drummond had a personal knowledge of Mr. Adair, I thought he could have no objection; upon which he put the bond into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, that your brother believed Mrs. Rudd's representation of her connection with Mr. Adair?</p>
               <p>Perreau. Certainly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you if you believed the same?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I did to my misfortune.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever apply to you to get the bond filled up?</p>
               <p>Perreau. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never desire you to apply to a scrivener?</p>
               <p>Perreau. No, but she desired that five thousand pounds might be borrowed upon a bond of seven thousand five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the dates?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310018"/>Perreau. No, I do not know that there was; it was to be made payable to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when you was at Mr. Adair's, that you was a perfect stranger to the bond?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I said, I had never seen the bond before, I never had, upon my oath, a perfect knowledge of the bond before I saw it in Mr. Adair's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell them, or convey the idea, that you was a perfect stran ger to the whole transaction?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them the story you have told now?</p>
               <p>Perreau. When I came into the room, and saw them in such a state of confusion, I hardly knew what I said, when Mr. Drummond told me it was a forged bond, I was shocked and amazed, knowing it had been managed by Mrs. Rudd. She said, make yourself quiet, your brother is clearly innocent. I told Mr. Drummond, I knew Mrs. Rudd had given a bond to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Drummond that it was that bond?</p>
               <p>Perreau. Mr. Drummond was in that degree of warmth, that I did not know how to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Drummond that the bond was for seven thousand five hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Perreau. I told Mr. Drummond at that time, that I knew there was a bond given by Mrs. Rudd to my brother, upon which my brother was desired to borrow of him five thousand pounds. Mr. Drummond asked me, if I knew my house was mortgaged to him? I told him it was, and I understood it was to be paid out of this five thousand pounds, if it was borrowed of him.</p>

I never could, neither do I now think him capable of the crime he is charg'd with.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner several years, we have lived in great intimacy, and our families visited. On the 1st of November, 1774, he applied to me at my house in Charles Street, St. James's Square, to let him have a sum of money: the particular sum he did not then mention. But, I told him, I had at that time no more cash by me than for my own occasion, and therefore I could not accommodate him. Upon this, he said, there was something of very great importance, and if I could raise the money it would be a great advantage to him. I told him, I did not know any way of raising the money, as I had not cash in my banker's hands. Then the prisoner said let me have some of your Ayre Bank Bonds. I said, I did not think of parting with them; when you asked me to raise the money. But he said, if you will let me have them, I will give you a bond of Mr.

I told him, he should have the Ayre bonds upon that condition. I took out a roll from my bureau of these Ayre bonds to the number of about twenty one, and asked the prisoner how many he would have of them. After some little hesitation, he said, he would be obliged to me for fifteen: they were all of a hundred pounds each. I desired him to take down the numbers of the bonds, which he did upon this paper (producing it.) at the bottom is wrote thus - 1500, Ayre Bonds, bearing date the 29th of June, 1774, and payable to

The Ayre bonds were not replaced in the eight days, according to the promise, but I thought they might be a convenience to Mr. Perreau, and so I did not demand them of him till about the middle of December; when, as I intended to call for the interest due upon them, I thought it proper to give Mr. Perreau timely notice of it, and did so in the middle of December.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310023"/> Upon giving him this notice; Mr. Perreau said, it was very well, and that I should have the bonds. But a few days afterwards he asked me, if I had no other reason to call for these bonds, but on account of the interest? I said, no, I really had not. Then, Mr. Perreau said, he would be much obliged to me, to let the bonds lie in his hands a little longer and he would pay me the interest due upon the bonds. I said, if it was any service to him he was welcome to keep them longer. Nothing else happened till I heard of the prisoner's being in custody. Then I went to Mr. Adair's with the bond, on Saturday: I believe, it was the 11th of March that I heard of this affair breaking out of the Perreaus: at first, I could not believe any such charge against them.</p>

When they came to the pails which run along by the side of the foot path, they turned short round, and Harrison clapp'd a pistol against my breast, and said, stop, Sir. He took my watch out of my pocket, he took half a guinea out of my left-hand pocket and ten shillings out of my other pocket; he clapped his pistol against my breast and said don't look at me, but look another way, but I took such notice of his person that I am positive to him. After Harrison had done this, he went to my wife, put his hand to her pocket and took out some halfpence. The other man that was with Harrison likewise had a pistol. I mentioned the robbery at a public house the corner of Stepney causeway, the first but house I came to.</p>

Harrison was one of those men, and I believe Sell was the other. When we got to the field leading to the Green Dragon, which goes to Stepney causeway.

They passed on to the pails, from whence they might see to Stepney causeway, then they turned short about, and one of them clapped a pistol to my breast, the other went to my husband; I believe it was Sell that put the pistol to my breast, but I am not certain as to him. I am sure Harrison is the person that took my husband's watch and money; Harrison came up to me after he had robbed my husband; my husband gave an account of the robbery at the next public house, and described the persons of the men that robbed him.

I found my apprentice gone a long while; my spouse sent me to look for him; she stood upon the step of the door, as I came out; I saw a man come out of the next house with a bundle under his left arm; I then heard my wife cry out, thieves, thieves: I saw the man turn round, in the cart-way, and he fired a pistol, I believe with his left hand, and dropped a bundle; I was not above ten yards from the man; my wife and I stood together at the door; the pistol was directed that way. I took up the bundle, pursued the man, and cried out for assistance; I was constantly within two or three yards of the prisoner, and I did not lose sight of him while I threw the bundle in the house, nor till I came to White-Cross Street; but, presently heard he was taken, in Old Street, fourteen or fifteen yards from the top of the street. I think the prisoner is the man, by his cloaths, and by his stature. What became of the pistol I do not know. The top of the street may be a hundred yards, or a little more from my house: he was taken about that distance from my house. I examined the place, but I know nothing of the condition of the garret, I saw that a pane of glass was broke there; I judge they came in at the garret window.</p>

I went directly into the middle of the way, and saw the prisoner running from the prosecutor's house. As he passed, I crossed upon him: he said, do not stop me: that gave me a suspicion that he was the guilty person. I run after him about fifty yards; then he turned round and stood with his arm out, and bid me stand off; I did not perceive any thing in his hand; then I ran up up to him and clasped him in my arms round the waist, had him about a minute and a half in custody before any assistance came; then Parker the butcher came up to my assistance, and I took hold of his left hand: the prisoner said, do not use me ill - I am a dead man. I laid hold of his collar, and Parker laid hold of the other side of him: we led him to the constable at the watch-house, and there delivered him up. It was about fourteen or fifteen yards from the end of White-Cross street, in Old Street, where I took him. I felt the outside of his pocket, but I found no pistol; he dropped something, I could not quit him to take it up.

               <p>I was in liquor; I saw a man drop a bundle and went a few paces from it and fired a pistol. I pursued the man; the man might possibly turn down some turning unperceived by me, as I was in liquor. I ran on, not knowing which way to run, as the man had slipped my fight. I had not run far, before a man clasped me round; I said, do not hold me, I am not the man, the man is gone. I was conveyed to the watch-house.</p>

I believe, Whittle was the man who pulled the pistol out of his breast; and I believe Barker was the man who received the money: as to Higgs, I have no remembrance: of his person at all; but one of the four, I remember very well, had a striped waistcoat, which Higgs had on when he was carried to the justice's. Upon my giving them the silver that I had in my pocket, they d - d me, and asked me, what I meant by giving them a few shillings, and swore that I had more money, and more they would have; upon which I gave them two guineas; still they wanted more: I said, I had no more, upon which they said, they must have my watch. I said, it was but a metal watch, and would be of very little value and of no use to them: but they insisted upon having it, and they took it from me: they then bid me go on and not look back; if I did, they would blow my brains out. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310032"/> next day, which was Sunday, I gave a description of them at justice Wilmot's office. The woman I had passed by, was close to me when they were robbing me; they took no notice of her at all. The man with the striped waistcoat on, was the outside of the four, and the woman passed close to me.</p>


               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Watlington. The moon was hardly up, and it was still daylight; it was a public path that I was walking along, and you may see a good way along it, there were passengers both before and behind, and some of them were in that very field; but I believe they were not near enough to see. The next day, at justice Wilmot's, I swore to Whittle and Barker. Whittle said, at the justice's, that he was not guilty, but he knew who was, and told me what I was robbed of within a shilling, and that the watch was sold for half a guinea; that he had the information from one Mich and three others, that came to the sign of the Dog, in Shoreditch; who said, they had robbed a gentleman in Hackney Fields. This was on the Monday, the day but one after the robbery. I verify believe the prisoners to be the men.</p>

On the 6th of May, I saw four young men in a field beyond the Goldsmith's Alms houses; one had a striped waistcoat, who I believe, to be the prisoner Higgs: but as to Barker, I am not positive; as to Whittle, I am very positive he was one, and I was positive to him when I first saw him. Mr. Watlington was coming along the field. I heard them say to him, he must deliver his money, or he was a dead man. I saw Whittle pull out a pistol, and when I saw this, I was as near as I am to your lordship. Being frightened, I walked off directly, as soon as I saw the pistol. I saw nobody else till I got to the Cat and Shoulder of Mutton, two fields off, this field was a large field, and day light was not shut in.</p>

I laid hold of him, but the other man with a truncheon struck me behind the head, that I was obliged to let him go. I got home as well as I could, all in a gore of blood; my landlord and landlady were up all night with me endeavouring to stop the blood but could not. In the morning I saw the prisoner go by; I told my landlord that was one of them that had robbed me. He and the constable pursued him, but lost sight of him, and did not take him till three is the afternoon. I saw him next day before justice Welch, in Litchfield-street, then he was examined and committed.</p>

            . I am a staymaker in Parker's lane; the prosecutor lives with me. On the 6th of May, a little after twelve at night, he came home all in a gore of blood; he could hardly come in, he repeated the circumstances of the robbery as he has done now. We could not stop the blood till a surgeon was sent for next morning. He said the man that robbed him was a short thick man with brown cloaths, and brown hair, upon which I suspected the prisoner, who I knew before by his using a public house just by with bad people, and going backwards and forwards. The next morning between nine and ten o'clock I saw the prisonerin the street with some other men; they appeared to be in liquor; I bid the prosecutor look at them, and see if either of them were the men that robbed him; he pointed out the prisoner, and said, that is the man in brown cloaths, I will swear to him. I heard the prisoner say they were going to the Turk's head, in Dyot-street; I sent for

I watched, thinking they would return, till about half after two o'clock; then the prisoner came to a publick house about six doors from my house; I sent for Wood, and we took him, and carried him to the round house.

               <p>Carter. A moon light night, and there were two lamps just by; it was light enough to distinguish the man: I know the prisoner is the man by his hair, his cloaths and his visage; he was dressed in the same cloaths he is now, his hair hung as it does now, unless it has been cut shorter.</p>

            . I am a footman to colonel Fitroy; on Saturday the 4th of March, the family went to bed about one o'clock, I rose between six and seven in the morning expecting to go into the pantry, I had the key in my hand; I went to the door and found it open; the larder window, which was a leaden casement was cut out and I found the cupboard belonging to it quite open, the knife cases also were open and I missed the chests of plate; I went immediately up stairs again to Mr. Gaines, the steward, and Gaines and I came down together, and when he came down and found the plate missing, he observed one of the chests was left in the coal-hole broke, the plate however was taken out, the iron area gate is never open, not even in the day time, it is always kept shut, the lock was picked; I never saw Jones before; I have seen Ridout who is one of the accomplices; I saw Jones before his examination in Litchfield Street, he was conversing with Hopkins, who was there, Hopkins said to Jones</p>
               <p>"Do you like pork?" "yes," said he,</p>
               <p>"and pease pudding too, and he hoped they</p>
               <p>"should soon get some as good as that they</p>
               <p>"found at Fitroy's" a woman in company upon this said to Jones, where did you get that good living; he said he got that at colonel Fitzroy's, in Albemarle-street, Jones came to me and asked me where my master's taylor lived, I said, what is that to you, he said my master's taylor had used his coat ill, and he would bring his bill against him for it. On the night of the robbery, there was a leg of pork and pease pudding in his house, when I came down in the morning, there was a cloth laid and knives and forks, pepper and vinegar and a great deal eat.</p>
               <p>"On his cross examination, he said, that the</p>

He said, d - n him, he had ripped his coat open, and he would bring his bill for it against Mr. Fitzroy. After that, one Hopkins asked Jones, if he loved pork. He said, aye and pease pudding, by G - d, I hope we shall have some more of it by and by. A young woman asked him, where that entertainment was? He said, at Fitzroy's: this passed in the public room.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said, the great coat was taken on the prisoner's back, that it was taken off on suspicion of it's being Doley's: that the taylor ripped it up to look at the lining, to see whether it was Mr. Fitzroy's servant's or no.</p>

The day after, in the morning seeing an account of the robbery in the news-paper, I went to Jones in Peter-Street, St. Anns; I saw him in a public house, I said to him, I see Fitzroy's house is robbed; upon which Jones said is it, I answered. yes, Jones said, he knew nothing at all about it; I said, I thought it was very odd; then he called me to the door and bid me hold my tongue and say nothing at all about it, and said the property was not disposed of: he gave me no money at that time two or three days after I saw him again, and then I borrowed a couple of shillings or eightteen pence of him: about a week after he lent me half a guinea: at that time, Hawkins was with him; Hawkins lent me half a guinea also: there was nothing said about the property. I have seen Hawkins often with Jones and by himself. I heard no talk about the plate. Jones did say there was some French plate that would not come to any thing, at the time we were talking about the robbery; and he said the property was not disposed of, because the French plate could not be sold for any thing. I did not talk with him with a view of having part of the booty. I cannot say, but I did expected to be paid, but did not take the two half guineas as part of payment. About a week after the robbery, I saw Hawkins and Jones in Peter Street, they were just come from the country; and I observed Jones had better cloaths on than I usually saw him in.</p>

I made answer, why do you bring it to me, why don't you carry it to the men to whom you used to sell it? Upon which, Jones answered, they gave him no price. Hawkins at that time was with him, I asked Jones, who Hawkins was. He said, he was one of his partners. Hawkins told me, that he sold fifteen watches for nine guineas, to

I came on the Monday after, into that court, and began calling old cloaths; upon which Jones came out, and said, he had a great coat and hat to sell.

I have seen Wesselly, and to the best of my knowledge, the two prisoners, two or three months ago: I am not positive to them; but I have seen Wesselly in the back room, and two or three men in company with him; One of the company asked me to write his direction. I don't recollect which it was; but I recollect it was to Duke's Place; and there were three in company, but I cannot swear to them.</p>

            . I went to apprehend Jones at the beginning of March at twelve at night in Ruport-street; he knew what we were come for, felt in his pocket for a knife, swore he would not be taken, and made some resistance; after he was taken he had some conversation with Hopkins about eating of pudding; he said he had plenty of it, he would have more soon, that it was at Mr. Fitzroy's; I had never seen Hawkins before, I know nothing at all of him.</p>

I put the things away, and put the pepper-box on the shelf, and the spoon in a dresser drawer. I had leave of my mistress to go to the play that night; while I was gone, my mistress missed the pepper-box, and the next day she asked where it was; then I missed it. It was found upon the prisoner by Mr. Jealous.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for upon the 23d of May, to Mr. Flower's, in St. Martin's lane, there I found the prisoner in custody; they stopped her as she was going by. I took her to the Brown Bear in Bow-Street, and found the pepper-box under her cloak. She told me she had sold the spoon to a Jew, that has not been found. She confessed it freely.</p>
               <p>The pepper-box was produced in court, and deposed to by Davies.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Flower said, if I would confess she would forgive me.</p>

I told him he was out of town, and desired him to leave his message; he drew back a little, and then said; I should be glad to see him. Can I leave a few lines for him? I said he might. I then thought I knew him, and that he had been an acquaintance of my master; he went into the dining-room, where he sat down and wrote a note. I staid some part of the time while he wrote: I then went and told my mistress a gentleman was enquiring for my master; I told her who I thought it was. She bid me go down again; I went down; he was just finishing the note; he asked for a wafer; there was none in the house; I went to get one, which I brought; he sealed it, and gave it me for my master, to whom he gave his compliments, and should be glad to hear from him as soon as he could.</p>

I missed them on the 3d of May from a chest of drawers, in which I kept them. I saw the square silver snuff-box three days before; but as to the other things I do not know how long they have been missing: they were locked up, but the key was left upon the drawers.

I have recovered nothing but one handkerchief, that I found in the prisoner's possession at Brighthelmstone, a shirt, and a pair of ruffles; I found the ruffles in the prisoner's own portmanteau; in the garret he lay in, after he was gone. At the last examination before the justice, the prisoner confessed he had the two snuff-boxes; but he said, that Mrs. Gallucci gave them to him. I entrusted him and found him honest till this time.</p>

Through a hole in the door, I saw her take a pot, and put it in her pocket. I called Sims, who is a lodger of mine, and we found it upon her. We searched her lodging, and found the other three mentioned in the indictment. She confessed taking a quart pot, and several others, that were melted.</p>

We had a pot of beer or two together: we went from there, to one of their lodgings. I lay on the bed and fell a-sleep. When I awaked, I missed my watch; I got up and found the door locked, and the key in the out-side. Sometime after, Wilson came: on her opening the door, I asked her, if she had played the fool, and got my watch. She said, no. I got a constable, and took her before the justice, She said, she had not the watch, but knew where it was. The other prisoners were taken with the watch, and brought before the justice. I looked at the watch just before I went up stairs with Wilson and Daley. I had half a guinea and some silver in my pocket, but that was never touched; I was a little in liquor.</p>

            . I am one of the patroles employed by the parish of St. Andrew's above the bars. On the 7th of March, my walk was in Lambs-Conduit-Street: near two in the morning, I observed Herbert in Lambs-Conduit-Street, opposite Great Ormond-Street: two men went before him down towards the fields, and he followed them. Knowlan and Reading were the two men that went before, my partner and I thought them suspicious people, and followed them. When we came to the corner of the pond in the Foundling-Hospital-field, we listened, but could hear nothing; then we concluded they were gone another way. As we were returning back, we met Reading and Knowlan: I said to my partner Cameron, they are the two men that passed us first; he said they were, and that he thought it was best to follow them. We went after them, and overtook them by the pond, and asked them where they were going, and whence they came? They said they were going to Tottenham-Court Road, and came from the bottom of Gray's-Inn Lane. By the Foundling wall, I said, How can that be! did not I speak to you at the corner of Great Ormond-Street? No, said they, it was not us: I said, I was sure it was, and that they should go to the watch-house and give an account of themselves: then I asked them where the third man was that followed them? they said, they knew nothing of any third man: upon that the third man came out from a corner of the garden wall and joined in with them: that was the prisoner Herbert. I thought he had a mind to speak to them; but he did not, as I could hear. We told them, they should all go to the watch-house and give an account of themselves. My partner walked before, and I behind. We had not hold of them when we came through the posts in Lamb's-Conduit-Street; Herbert sprung into the middle of the street, and I sprung after him; on that he turned round and fired a pistol at my neck. There were two balls found lodged in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310047"/> handkerchief. When I was carried to the watch-house; there were two holes in my neck: they went in at one and out at the other. I was so close to him, that the powder burnt my handkerchief, and burnt my face. I bled a great deal. Two or three days afterwards another ball was taken out of my neck at the hospital. I am sure Herbert is the man; but he was not taken till eight weeks after. I never saw Herbert before that night; but saw him twice that night before he shot me.</p>

            . I am a watchman: on the 7th of March in the morning, as I was crying the hour two in Lambs-Conduit-Street, I heard a pistol fired; I turned myself short round and saw the wadding of the pistol fired upon him: I was not two hundred yards off. I made towards where I heard the fire. I met Cameron with Knowlan and Reading (looks at Knowlan) I am sure he is one of them; Cameron said, Roan take charge of these two scoundrels till I go and see what is become of Butler; for he was shot. I set down my lantern and staff on the flags, and took one with my left hand, and the other with my right, and detained them till two more watchmen came up and desired them to take charge of the two men till I went to assist Cameron. Going down I met Cameron bringing up Butler: he desired me to go to the constable of the night, and desire him to get a doctor, for Butler was shot. Knowlan and Reading were taken into custody that night: Reading was afterwards admitted to bail because the principal was not taken.</p>

We knocked at the door, but not getting admittance. I lifted Bryant over a wall that is before the house, and he opened the gate and let me in. The gate opens into a garden. When I got up three steps, I saw Broomwich and Morris run out of the right-hand room. I believe, they were alarmed by the barking of some dogs. I ran up stairs and laid hold of them: both of them were in their waistcoats, with their shirt sleeves tucked up, as if they had been at work. Broomwich's hands had file-dust upon them, of a coppery fort of metal. I did not observe the hands of Morris. Broomwich had a pair of trowsers on, and there was file-dust on them. Clarke came up, and desired every thing might be let alone, till he had secured them. I went into the room on the right hand, and saw some base metal shillings lying on two different work-boards. I did not meddle with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of work-boards?</p>
               <p>Phillips. A bench and a table: there were working implements lying by them fit for the purpose of making money. There was a pair of flasks and a press. (They were produced in court by Clarke). There was about three pounds worth of bad shillings in the left-hand room going up stairs, which being rubbed, appeared to be counterfeits. In the right-hand room, there were some crucibles; one of them over the fire with some hot metal in it. ( Producer some straps that they rub the edges of shillings upon; some files, scowering paper, a sieve, and other things, which were all found in the righthand room.) I found a watch in the room below stairs, which was claimed by Broomwich. There was a watch up stairs Morris claimed.</p>

             there. The next day we went to the house, and Morris and Broomwich being taken into custody, I searched Morris, and found upon him two counterfeit shillings and a sixpence. In the right-hand room I found a crucible on the fire, and hot metal in it; there was a pair of flasks in that room, on the window, and a bench, with counterfeit shillings upon it. Somebody must have been at work there, there is no doubt of it. On the same board there was some file-dust, (producing it) it appears to be a composition of silver and copper. On the table, in the middle of the room I found some good shillings, ( produces a good shilling, and two counterfeits.) The counterfeit shillings appear to be cast from that good one. (He produced several other good shillings and counterfeits, that were cast from them, particularly one good crooked shilling, and two counterfeits, cast from it, with a little defect on one side of the good one; and likewise of the counterfeit, and observed, there was a crooked mould in the flask, answering to it. The inside of the moulds are made of sand, and there is a facing that closes the pores, that what is cast may not come out full of spots. The instruments produced, are applicable to coining; they can't work without them: there was some aqua-fortis and water, the use of which, is to force the silver on the outside of the shillings, and by rubbing it comes off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310049"/> again. Morris said, he had been at work in the garden; but on looking at the hands of Morris and Broomwich, they were all over with the dust and filings of the coining business: and on the trowsers of Broomwich was the mark of the laith, which was in the left-hand room, and is turned with the foot, and may be used in the coining business for edging of silver. The dust about the laith appeared to be the same as that on the working board. In the right-hand room I found this piece of box wood, to which a shilling had been fixed, in order to take the edge off: there was no coin, but only filings where the laith was.</p>

            's. When we came there, some of us went to the front door, and I and another went to the back door of the house, where they were supposed to be. There were three houses together, but there was only one entrance to them all; for the other two doors were nailed up: these houses belonged to Fretwell. When we came there, the man who placed himself at the front door, made a noise; upon that, Chapman came to the back door, and Knowles got out of a window at the back of the house. Upon that, I and the person that was with us got in at the back door Chapman had opened; and in one of the lower rooms, we found meat upon the table, where persons seemed to have been at dinner, and Causam was sitting at the table.</p>
               <p>The people that were with me, brought in two, Fretwell and Hipwell in custody, and Chapman and Knowles also were taken: We secured them all. I found upon Chapman four counterfeit half-pence in one pocket, and seven in another; and they all appeared to come from a Die that was then fixed in a press in the house. upon Fretwell I found a shilling and eight penny worth of half-pence in one pocket, and in another I found ten pennyworth of half-pence. Upon Knowles I found two shillings and six pence worth of halfpence. and upon Hipwell five pence in halfpence. They all appeared to be new struck from that die. In the same room there was a quantity of counterfeit half-pence, some in papers, and others loose. In the fore parlour there were other quantities; some in papers, and other loose: all that were wrapped up in paper were to the amount of six shillings worth in each paper; there were some papers with twelve shillings worth, and some with twenty-four shillings worth; they were sixshilling papers tied together. They found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310050"/> twenty-four shillings worth of half pence in Fretwell's bed chamber in a paper, in a draper: We went to the work shop, which is at the end of the three houses; there is a way broke through up-stairs out of one house into the other: There we found a large press, fixed, and a pair of dies in it, (producing them.) and between the two dies a counterfeit half-penny, (producing it.) There is a defect in the die, which is the same in the half-penny; we also found a cutting out press, and some plates of Copper whole, and some others which had the blanks cut, out from them. On the Wednesday following, the 24th of May, we went to the lodgings of Robins, and apprehending him, upon an information given by Causam we found him with a die before him which was warm; he appeared to be in the act of making it. I told him, be had better produce what dies he had, that it would be to no purpose to conceal them; and accordingly he delivered up several other dies to me, which were finished.</p>

            . Chapman and I went to Birmingham the week after Christmas, to bespeak the two presses, one of which is that produced in court; the other is too large to be brought. In the Easter week afterwards, they were accordingly brought to the Bell, in Smithfield, and were conveyed from thence to Fretwell's house, and there they were fixed up. Chapman, Hipwell, Fretwell, Knowles and myself, began to work upon the week after. We were all employed some way or other in making the halfpence. Hipwell only cut out the blanks; Chapman and Fretwell pulled at the fly; Chapman left that work about a week after we began; and Knowles took his place, and pulled at the fly with Fretwell afterwards; but Chapman came back again the Friday before we were apprehended. We made about twelve pounds worth in a day. I was there when Clarke apprehended them all at Fretwell's. Chapman and Siddall, who is absconded, were the master-workmen, and the others were the journeymen. Siddall paid us our wages. Robins made all the dies; I received one pair from his hands, and he told me he made the other pair I received, I paid him two guineas for: I paid that money for Chapman and Siddal. We carried all the dies to Robin's in order to have them engraved; there was one pair carried by my wife, which Robins brought back to me again. My own business was to seed the press. The last pair of dies Robins brought, were in work when the prisoners and I were apprehended. We had no dies but what were made by Robins.</p>
               <p>Q. from Chapman. Whether he thought me in circumstances to carry on such a partnership.</p>
               <p>Causam. Both Chapman and Siddall took the copper up upon trust, at house on Snow, hill.</p>
               <p>Chapman's defence.</p>
               <p>I was not in partnership with Siddall; I was not in circumstances to carry on such a business.</p>
               <p>Knowles, Fretwell, and Hipwell, in their defence said, that they were employed by Siddall.</p>

Going down into the cellar we met Forrester on the stairs, without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310051"/> out his coat, and his shirt sleeves tucked up within his waistcoat. I rushed by Forrester into the back cellar, and under an arch which goes into the fore cellar, I saw a large press with a large fly, and the fly was going round. There was two large candles, one on each side the press, a light. Giles sat down, and the fly was going round over his head; he was feeding the press. I saw an halfpenny struck, and took out, and a blank put in. Dereham and William's I believe, were assisting him with blanks. I don't know who were working the fly. Giles got up to run away. I laid hold of him and secured him. Dereham and Williams were secured by Mardell; they were all without their coat, and their shirt sleeves tucked up: I think Dereham had slippers on. I found some counterfeit half-pence in Forrester's breeches pocket, which had been struck from that die, (producing them) and some half-pence, struck from the same die, were lying about the press, (producing them.) There is a flaw about the head: Mardell and I examin'd the press and found a half-penny between the dies, just struck; there were eight or nine shillings worth struck from the same dies lying about the press. We found a cutting press in the fore cellar, a quantity of copper, one piece in the cutting press, with some blanks cut out of it, a pair of sheers, and six or seven pair of dies.</p>

               <p>Giles's Defence.</p>
               <p>I used to work by the water-side; being out of work I went to the sign of the White Lion the beginning of May last, to inquire for work; a gentleman who was there, told me if I would go with him, he would help me to a job. I went with him to Haddle-hill; there he called for some punch and a pint of beer for me; and said, if I could leave my family a week together, he would give me a guinea a week, and four or five pints of beer a day. I said, I could upon occasion: then he appointed me to meet him on Monday morning at Tyburn turnpike; accordingly I went there, and he came with a chaise cart and took me to Acton. He said, I was only to cut out some copper, and gave me some, which I cut out with shears: he shewed me how to mark it. I knew nothing what it was, for I never saw such a thing before. There was a man cutting with an engine. I asked him what he was about? he made me no answer. The man that employed me, appointed me to meet at a publick-house in town on Saturday following: he did not tell me his name. When I met him, he gave me half a guinea instead of a guinea: he said, he had no more in his pocket; he would give me the rest on Monday. I went again on Monday, and told him to get another man; that I did not choose to stay with him, and should leave him on Wednesday. On Tuesday the witnesses and some more people came and took us.</p>
               <p>Forrester's Defence.</p>
               <p>Last Tuesday fortnight I was going down to Heeling to receive some money that was owing me at Acton. I stopped to have some refreshment: there I met with a woman I knew: she asked where I was going? I told her to Heeling to receive some money. It was a very hot day, and the dust blew very much. She said my face was very dirty; if I would go into the house, she would give me some water to wash my face. I went in, pulled my coat off, and went into the cellar, where there was a well, and washed me. As I was coming-up again, a gentleman met me and pushed me down, and I was taken.</p>
