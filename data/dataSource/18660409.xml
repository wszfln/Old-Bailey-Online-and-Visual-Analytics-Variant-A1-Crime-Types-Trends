                  </hi>. This florin is bad—this metal is the same kind that the florin is made of—there is more tin in it than usual; but the make is not so good, because the metal is rather hard; the coin would not be so likely to deceive the eye, but it would be harder to bite, and it would sound sharper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. This is nothing but spite on the part of the prosecutor towards me. On the Saturday previous, I was at the Old Cranes with a brush and broom hawker, who I recommended to the prosecutor, and he bought two brooms of him, thinking they were hair; but when he got them home, he found they were only made of grass, or fibre, and were of little or no use. I saw them next day in the prosecutor's parlour, and laughed heartily at his being taken in, though I had no ill-will against him, and he looked very hard at me. On the following Wednesday, he took the opportunity of being revenged on me. I gave him a florin; he took it on one side, and presently he returned, put a florin on the wicket, and said that it was bad. I said that I was sorry for it, and was not aware of it, and that I took it at the Bell. Being a little-the worse for liquor, I did not know that I had sufficient copper to pay for my lodging. He took it again, poured some liquid metal on the floor, and gave me in custody. There is no trace of a florin on it now, as it is destroyed, and the prosecution must be destroyed with it. When the policeman searched me, I asked him to allow me to look at his hands previous to his putting them into my pocket, but he would not. He said that the florin was bad before he tested it.</p>

I am a constable employed by the Great Northern Railway Company—on the morning of 22d March, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I was in Lower Thames-street, near Billingsgate, and saw the prisoner in one of the London. Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's vans, delivering boxes and baskets of fish which were in the van—I saw him take out several plaice from the boxes, and some soles from pads, and secrete them under the straw in his van—I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner take a very large plaice from one of the baskets and hand it to Wells, who hid it under</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186604090014"/>
               <p>his jacket and went away with it—a lad named M'Carthy was in the van as guard, and I saw him put some of the soles into a sack which was in the corner of the van—the prisoner then proceeded to deliver the baskets and boxes of fish, and the boy drove the van away with the sack in it, but the police prevented him stopping still, and ultimately the prisoner came up to the van near king William-street, got in, took the reins from M'Carthy, and drove along Thames-street towards Blackfriars—I did not stop the van, but I got up into it, and the prisoner said, "What do you want?"—I said "I am going towards the bridge, give us a ride"—just at that time Jones got up into the van, and I said to Martin, "We are constables"—he said, "I thought you were"—I said, "How many fish have you been stealing this morning?"—he said, "There they are," pointing to where they were under the straw, "there are five or six"—I looked, and said, "There are more than five or six, you are both in custody, charged with stealing these fish, the property of your employers"—I took the prisoner and the boy—I found eight plaice under the straw, and six large soles in the sack—I said, "Is this all you have?"—he said "Yes," but when the inspector ordered me to search him at the station, he took out a handkerchief, and said, "You have not got all; here is a pair here which I did steal, and I intended to take them home to my wife"—I said, "Who is that man that you gave that large plaice to that you took out of the pad?"—he said, "Well, I did take that I know, I do not know him"—from information I received I afterwards went to Wells's address, saw him, and received a plaice, which he admitted to be the same—M'Carthy was afterwards discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see where I delivered the remainder of the fish <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you backed your van against one of the other vans of the Com<lb/>pany, and put the last of your load in, but you had stolen the fish prior to that—I did not see Batt put some of this fish into your van, but you said that he did—when Wells put the fish under his jacket, you said, "You have no occasion to hide it, the b—s cannot swear to it"—when I asked you who you gave the fish to, you did not say that his name was Wells—you did not say he was a fellow servant of yours, but I have ascertained that since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live at Waterloo-buildings, Southwark—I was the prisoner's van-guard on 22d March, and went with him in a van, loaded with fish, from Blackfriars Station to Billingsgate—the fish were in boxes and baskets, with a string over them, and they were directed to people in Billingsgate—the prisoner took several of the plaice out of the pads, and some soles out of the boxes—he put the plaice in the middle of the van, and told me when I got up on the hill, to put the soles into the provender sack—I did so, if I had not I should have been <hi rend="italic">jawed</hi> at—the prisoner was the driver—I saw him put a pair of soles in a handker<lb/>chief—he put them in his pocket, and said that he was going to take them home to his wife—they came out of one of the boxes—I saw Wells there—the prisoner gave him a big plaice out of a pad—he put it inside his coat, and the prisoner said, "You need not be ashamed of it," and then Wells carried it in his hand—I was taken in custody, and examined as a witness at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When did you first know that there were fish in the sack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said to me, "When you get up on the hill, put the soles in the provender sack"—you were not in Batt's van when the policeman turned the horse round, and I took the reins—I do not recollect seeing the porters come up into the van, and take fish out of the boxes—you asked me if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186604090015"/>
               <p>would have a plaice for my breakfast—I said that I did not know how to cook it, and then you said that I could go to breakfast—I helped you lift the boxes out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, L. C. and D. R</hi>.) I went to the police-station, and said to the prisoner, "I am very sorry to see you here, Martin; it is a bad job"—he said, "Yes, it is, but I have told them all I could—I did steal one pair of soles, which I meant to take home to my wife"—I know Wells—he was formerly a carman in the Company's service, but left before this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I have delivered any goods, and found anything short or wrong, did I not always report it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I never heard any com<lb/>plaint against you till this, but I directed the officers to search, in consequence of numerous robberies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was rather late in getting to market with the fish, and the porters and salesmen were all round the van in a great hurry after their different masters' fish—I did not load the van, and some of the boxes wanted out first, were at the bottom—I had to take them out one at a time, and some of the loose soles fell out, but I cannot account for, how all of them came at the bottom of the van. I went round with my delivery sheet, and told one or two of them I wanted a little bit of fish, which they have often given me before; one of the men got up in the van with two fish for himself, and I gave him this one in the van for his breakfast. When I asked the boy if he would have a fish for his breakfast, I had not unpacked the van. When I had got rid of most of the fish, I had seven boxes and several pads left, which I put on the other van and rode off. Batt said, "Do you want two or three plaice?" I said, "No, thank you, there are three or four loose in my van now;" but he threw three or four into my van, either because he had heard me ask for fish, or to send the officers after me. I was ashamed to see so many fish in the van, and when the boy was away, I picked them up, and put them into the sack; the boy is made to tell an untruth about them. I took one pair of soles, which I thought I had liberty to do. I should have given the loose fish in the van, which Batt threw in, to the officials at home. If the officer knew the fish were there, he must have seen Batt throw them there. What the officer says as to my telling Wells not to hide the fish, is a palpable falsehood; I told him to take it from under his coat, that he was not to be ashamed of them, as I was not; be was carrying it as if it was stolen. I have never sold a penny-worth of the Company's property in my life. I should have gone home, if the officer would have allowed me. There are half-a-dozen salesman who would give me a dozen fish, if I asked them, therefore I had no occasion to steal any. I have served the Company a long while and faithfully.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer—on 16th March, about 1 o'clock, I was with Other on Ludgate-hill going westwards, and saw the prisoner and two other men there, going towards St. Paul's—Henry went to the right side of a lady—George was on his right; the other two men were behind—the lady turned to look into a shop window, and the other two men got between her and the window, so as to obstruct her—Henry's overcoat was unbuttoned, and the tail of it partly covered his left hand, which was partly in the folds of the lady's dress—I saw his hand go into her pocket—George was then close behind—the lady shifted about a yard further down the hill, still keeping at the same window—Henry still kept his hand in her pocket, and George shifted as they shifted—at that moment, George struck the back part of his person against Henry, and made a noise with his mouth, I presume as a signal, and Henry immediately withdrew his hand—I seized them, and Ober took hold of them at the same moment and spoke to the lady, who put her hand in her pocket and pulled out her handkerchief—being pressed by Ober she felt again, but had not lost anything—the prisoners gave their names at the station, but refused their addresses—they each said they hoped we should be lenient with them, and let them go, and give them another chance.</p>

               <p>—the next morning I found the florin to be bad—next night she came in again for a glass of sixpenny ale and a biscuit which came to twopence halfpenny—she gave me a bad crown—I asked her where she got it, and she said she had got it, unfortunately, in the street—I gave her into custody—when she came in the second time I recognised her as having been in the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, and live at 51, Green-street, Stepney—on Saturday, 3d March, I was at King's Cross, opposite the Great Northern Railway, at the corner of the triangle—the street there is about 36 feet broad—I saw the deceased on my left as you come from the railway—she touched my left arm—she was coming from the railway side, and stepped into the gutter to cross the road—she had an umbrella in her right hand and a tin can in her left, and was walking at a moderate pace for an old lady—I looked right and left, but saw nothing coming—when she had got about 15 feet, or nearly half-way across, a cart came along very fast, which the prisoner was driving—the horse was running at much the same pace as those steam fire<lb/>engines go to a fire; that is the only thing I can compare it to—I am not a judge of miles—it was a very fast pace—I live close to the Wellclose<lb/>square fire<lb/>engine station, and have an opportunity of judging—the horse was running—I understand it must either be a gallop</p>

               <p>or a trot, I cannot decide which it was, so I give it in favour of the prisoner, and say that it was a trot—when the old lady was half-way across the road the horse knocked her down, and the off wheel went over her head and crushed it—I ran up, expecting to see her alive, but she was dead to my belief—it was a common two-wheeled cart, drawn by one horse, and I understand from the prisoner that there were two cases of rabbits in it—the prisoner stopped about 27 yards in front, and I went up to him—I did not know him before—I said, "Tom, you have run over this poor woman, and the best thing you can do is to get down and go back"—he said, "Have I? I could not help it; I tried to pull up," or words to that effect—it is two months since the accident—the prisoner was partially drunk—I went to the station, and then to the hospital.</p>

I am a traveller of 55, Platt-street, Camden<lb/>town—I was in the Euston-road about half-past two, just in the act of crossing the Caledonian-road, and heard a vehicle coming at a furious rate—I turned round and saw the prisoner driving the cart at the rate of twelve miles an hour, a lad was in the cart with him—I am a judge of the pace of a horse—I was walking at the rate of five miles an hour and I commenced running, which increased my pace to eight, but I could not get anywhere near the cart, which convinced me that the man was going at twelve miles an hour—I followed it because I anticipated that an accident would occur from the furious way he was driving, and also because he was on the off-side in<lb/>stead of the near-side—I heard a crash, followed on and saw something in the road, which, as soon as I got up, the off wheel was in the act of passing over; it was the poor woman's head—I saw that her blood and brains were gone—her face was completely smashed, and I saw part of the blood and brains on the wheel—the prisoner got out of the cart and left the lad in it; he got out to see what had occurred—I sent for a policeman, one he had passed and one came from the palings opposite the station—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

I live at 7 Black Lion-yard, Whitefriars—I have been employed as gas-engineer in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> office upwards of three years—my duty is to see to the repairing of gas, and to see that all is safe before I leave—a person named Latham assists me—on Saturday, 24th March, I and Latham were in the machine-room, which is directly under the paper-room, about twenty minutes past 4—I had just passed the time<lb/>keeper's lodge and saw the time then—about a minute after I got into the machine-room, I heard a clattering over head; a person scuffling or moving about—I made a remark to Latham, and immediately afterwards, the prisoner ran down the paper-room staircase, which is on the left-hand side—I asked him what business he had up there—he said, "What the b—h—is that to you?"—he was running as fast as he could—he had a wild. appearance and seemed in a great flurry—about three minutes afterwards, Latham called my attention to some glass in the ceiling of the paper-room, and I saw that there was a fire—it appeared to be in the right-hand corner, towards the middle of the room—I gave the alarm of fire, and went out into Peterborough-court—I did not see the prisoner there, nor any woman—when the prisoner passed me he did not say anything about the fire, nor give any alarm—I saw a man named Fleming just before I gave the alarm of fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fire engineer to the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> office, and was formerly so to Paddington parish—between a quarter and half-past 4, on 24th March, I was in the machine-room, and the prisoner called to me, "Fleming, Fleming! the building is on fire!"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Oh, my God! can't you hear the windows cracking? Come out into the court"—I went into the court and found the windows of the paper-room were breaking, and the fire was coming out—I immediately put the water on, and the prisoner used every possible exertion to assist me in putting the fire out—I stopped it in about twenty minutes—I afterwards examined the room, and found there had been two distinct fires—I remember the fire on the 10th—my attention was called to that by the prisoner, and it took place about the same time as near as possible—I saw him in the court, and he said, "Fleming, there has been a fire, and I have stopped it; go in and see if it is safe"—I went with him to the cellar of No. 5 house, of which he keeps the key—he showed me where the fire had been—he then jumped on to the dresser and pulled out some paper between the floor and the ceiling, which was burning—that paper had the appearance of having been <hi rend="italic">stuffed</hi> in there and there, appeared to have been three distinct fires—the prisoner had previously told me that there had been a fire in the dust-hole, which he had put out with the hose—he said he discovered it—on the Wednesday or Thursday preceding 24th March, I saw the prisoner at the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> office between 5 and 6 in the morning; in his lobby—I afterwards saw him in the publishing-room—I told him he had no business there at that hour, as his time was 8 o'clock—he told me I was only a fireman—I said I was there to put fires out, and not to make them—I asked him by whose authority he was there at that hour in the morning—he said "Mr. Harvey's"—I went and spoke to Mr. Harvey, and he said he had not authorized him—the prisoner afterwards said he was there to relieve <hi rend="italic">Ted</hi>, meaning Holt—he told Mr. Harvey I had accused him of setting fire to the place—I said I had not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cross Keys-square, Little Brittain, and am the foreman at the Great Northern Railway Company's stables in Mint-street—Bott is a van-shifter, that is a man who moves the empty vans, and does anything when wanted—the Company have a contract with Messrs. Gingell and Sons for the supply of straw—the straw was delivered at the yard—Hollumby has to receive it—Bott has to assist in the stables, in taking the straw in, or in anything else required—Hollumby has to feed the horses—on the arrival of them straw, it has to be delivered to Hollumby, who signs the delivery note—attached to the delivery note is a counterfoil—one part is retained by the Company, the other is returned to the dealer—I know Hollumby's writing—this delivery order of 10th February is signed by Hollumby—Bott has to do anything he is asked to do—all these delivery notes are signed by Hollumby—we send the counterfoil to the Company's offices at King's Cross—I have no doubt it is there entered in a book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ledger clerk in the service of the London and St. Katharine's-dock Company—on 21st February, the prisoner was in the employment of the Dock Company, but was, I believe suspended; that is he was not discharged, but was not allowed to come to duty; nevertheless I saw him in the general office on that day—he came into the division of the general office where I was engaged—I saw him looking over papers—they were documents lodged by the public, warrants lodged for delivery in the wine and spirit department—I did not see at what time he left the docks on that day—I saw him there about the middle of the day—I do not know how long he remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What makes you remember this 21st February? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have many reasons for remembering it—I believe the prisoner was suspended on that day for absence—I don't know at what time he was sus<lb/>pended—I saw him there in the middle of the day—the wine and spirit department is a part of the general office—there are fifty or sixty clerks employed in the whole room, particular corners are called different premises—these clerks come and go wherever the course of business calls them—I am aware the prisoner had a drawer given him in the wine and spirit de<lb/>partment—I said that I saw him looking over documents lodged by the public—I was about six yards off—the desk was straight, and I, therefore, had a better opportunity of seeing then if it had been convex—I don't think he back after 21st February.</p>

He leaves his sheep alongside of a country road, without any enclosure or anything to take care of them but a boy. If he left a boy with them he must have seen the sheep taken. The sheep might go where they thought fit. Isaacs is acquainted with Mr. Coles. He said before the Magistrates he caught the sheep and separated them from the drove, now he says he saw no marks on these sheep; he is the man who must have known these sheep, John Cross never came to recognize me till three months after the sheep were stolen. He never came to recognise me at the</p>

I called the policeman and the prosecutor to order, and they got turned out of Court. One of the witnesses was driving on his near side of the road, and he told me to keep on mine. Adelaide-road is at least, by the wide turning on Primrose-hill, 30 yards wide, and if he and I were both driving on our near sides what opportunity had he of taking such particular notice of the marks on these sheep? I was brought here on another concern. I am innocent. I know nothing about driving sheep—Hitterchey, who is a returned convict, knows all about it. It is through a case that was tried here two sessions ago that I am brought here.</p>

On 9th December, at night, I was sent for to the Volunteer beer-shop, Hornsey-road—I went there in uniform with Dalton and Barnes—we went inside and cleared the house of Starr and another man, a stranger to me, who were fighting inside—I saw Stevens and Watson in the house—we cleared out from fifteen to twenty persons, but the landlord would not charge any of them—it was half-past 10 at night—Starr was stripped to his skin—he had no shirt on—his trousers were on—I advised him to put on his shirt and go away quietly—he refused to do so, and struck me with his fist two or three times on the lower part of my face, kicked me, and stamped on my toes—I then took him into custody, and handed him over to Barnes and Dalton, and went back to the beer-shop, being about 100 yards from it—I found Stevens outside the beer-shop, making a disturbance, and wanting to fight—I wanted him to go away a different way to Starr, but he would not, and went down the road after Starr—I followed him, and he tried to get Starr from the custody of Barnes and Dalton—he laid hold of him by the arms, and wanted to pull him away—he said nothing—I took him in custody—a large crowd got round, who hustled us as far as Hooper-street—I was thrown down several times—Stevens struck me on my face, bit my right little finger, which made the nail bleed, and kicked me on the left side of my right knee, which left a large bruise there—Starr was nine or ten yards further up the street, in the dark—I was thrown down several times by some of the mob, but I still kept hold of Stevens with my left hand; and when I was thrown, he went down as well—he called on the mob to rescue him, and said, "Who are you for? are you for us, or for these b—s"—some of the mob cried out, "We are for you"—Stevens cried out, "Well come on and get us away"—the mob kept pushing us about, but did not get him away—I received a blow on the back of my head with a brickbat, from one of the mob—there were nearly 200 of the mob in Hooper-street—assistance arrived; Stevens was taken to the station-house, and I followed him—Starr had escaped, but I took him and Watson about an hour afterwards, at 38, Mitford-road,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, Y</hi> 151). I was on duty in Hornsey-road, and in consequence of something which was said to me, I went to the Volunteer beer-shop, and saw the three prisoners—Starr had only his trousers on, the landlord said he would charge the prisoners, and we cleared the house—there were half a dozen or a dozen inside—when we got the prisoners out, the landlord refused to charge them, and we advised them to go home, but Starr stamped on Sergeant Foster's toes, and struck him on the mouth with his fist—he gave him in custody, and I and Barnes took him—Sergeant Foster then went back to another disturbance created by Stevens, who said he would help his mate and see that they should not take him—he then seperated from us—we got on one side of the road with Sergeant Foster, and he on the other—we both had hold of Starr, and Stevens called on his mates by name to rescue him—1 forget their names—I told him that after assaulting us in such a manner, we should not allow them to go away, and the other constable told him so also—Starr called on the mob to rescue him, and said he would be b—if he did not fight for liberty—Martin caught me by the collar several times, and asked me to let the prisoner go, and he would take him home—I told him I should do no such thing—Watson said, "Get the b—'s up in the dark, and give it to them," and the crowd then forced us up in the dark, and threw us down—Barnes and I were thrown down, and so was Starr—we fell on our backs, and when Starr was trying to get away from Barnes and me, I saw him stamp on Barnes' chest with his knees, as Barnes laid on his back, with his face upwards—I was lying by his side—Starr was free at that time, and could have gone away without doing it, because nobody had hold of him—he got away, but I got up and followed him—Watson was standing close by Barnes after Starr got away, and I took him in custody, as I had seen him <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> us up into the crowd—I took him at the top of Hooper-street, leading to the Mitford-road—I took Starr a second time, and had him in custody a quarter of an hour, but Watson got him away from me after a severe struggle, and he got in at the door of 38, Mitford road—he got him away by throwing me down, and I had to remain there while he went away—I could not get up to follow him—there were other people besides Watson—I then went back to Hooper-street, where I had left Barnes, and found him leaning up against the wall, quite useless, with his head against the bricks—I then assisted Sergeant Foster to the station with Stevens, and then came back with Foster and other constables to 38, Mitford-road, where we took Starr and Watson out of bed, and took them to the station—Starr appeared to have been drinking, but Watson appeared perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>stood by, and who they said was his landlady, for his clothes, that he might put them on—I do not know whether he asked for them when he came back—I do not know whether somebody tried to put his clothes on—I was at a distance, but when I went in a woman stood with some clothes in her arms, which she said were his—it was before he assaulted me that I saw somebody trying to put his clothes on him, and he would not let them—it was when the landlord gave him in custody—I took him a second time when he came back, because Sergeant Forstergave him in charge for assaulting him, but I did not see that—I did not see him stamp on Forster's toes, but Forster told me so, and gave him custody—Barnes had got Starr round the waist—he could not hold him in any how else, because he had no shirt on—we asked him to put his clothes on, but he would not—they kept singing out, "Put his clothes on;" his landlady might have followed him with them—it was some of the mob who called out, but he said no he would not—that was at the corner of Hooper-street—no one offered them to him in my presence—I held him by the belt of his trousers, round his waist—I cannot tell where Barnes held him—it was rather dark, and the crowd were <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> us about—I did not see Barnes have him by the neck; perhaps he might, but I did not see it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Watson</hi>. When I got to the gate, Starr was in the house. I begged you not to go in and take him. I will take my oath you never caught him against the gate at all; the landlord shut the door. When I got up he had gone in, and the door was shut. I followed Stevens to the station, and when I got to the Hornsey-road, you asked me what I wanted following you. I said, "Nothing." You met a gentleman on horseback, stopped him, and told him about it. Starr would have gone home if they had let him have his clothes, but they would not. They took me in custody. I asked what it was for. They said it was because I had been asking them to let Starr go. I only put my hand on your shoulder to ask you to let me take Starr home. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. You asked me quietly to let you take Starr home, but that was after Forster had given him in custody—you did not ask in a violent manner—I could not do so because he had been given in custody—you said no more then, but you both followed us—I am sure you got me by the collar—I first saw you after getting Starr out of the beer-shop—you were quite sober—I told you several times to let go of my collar in Hooper-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller of Southwood-terrace, Highgate, next door to the prisoner—on Thursday morning 28th December, about four o'clock the prisoner came to my house and asked me if I would go into his house as he had been attacked by two thieves, and wanted as<lb/>sistance—I went to the door and listened and heard a groaning down stairs—I was afraid to go down, and said, "I had better go for the police"—after waiting a minute or two I went to the station, a policeman came back with me—we both listened at the top of the staircase—the prisoner was still at the door when I came back—the policeman did not care to go down, and I did not—he gave me the privilege of going down first, but I did not—I went for a second policeman, and when I came back I found the inspector there—the prisoner seemed to have been drinking; I could hardly say he was tipsy—he said he believed the thieves were still down stairs, and he thought he had marked one of them; he had cut one about a good deal on the arms and legs with a knife—we still heard the groaning, and the prisoner kept saying that he heard the two men in the room—I went down into the back kitchen with the inspector and two policemen—one of them opened the door and we went in. together—we could not open the door at first—I have not a distinct recollection whether a candle was burning in the room, but I be<lb/>lieve it was dark—the light must have been from a policeman's lantern—we went in and found Mrs. Keeble lying against the window at the far part of the room—she had the appearance of having had a violent push and being forced under the window with violence—her head and shoulders were against the wall as if she had been sitting about a foot from the wall and had fallen, back—she was quite insensible—the prisoner was there—I think he said that he thought the thieves must have attacked his wife, and that he had been fighting with the thieves for two hours when he first came to me—I left Mr. Keeble there and went for a doctor—nothing seemed to have been disarranged in the room—there was a sovereign lying on the floor-after an hour Mrs. Keeble recovered her senses, and the first words she uttered were, "Oh, my poor thigh!"—there was a great deal of blood on the sofa, some on the floor, and some on a chair—it was the basement floor used as a sitting-room—there was blood on the prisoner's hands when he came to me; he was dressed, and Mrs. Keeble was fully dressed, but she had one boot off—the prisoner had his slipper on, or one slipper on and one off, I know he had not his shoes on—the police asked him if he had a knife—he said yes, and took a small pocket-knife from his pocket and said that</p>

On Thursday morning, 28th December, I went to the prisoner's house and saw him and his wife and Hazle in the back kitchen—Mrs. Keeble was lying on the floor in a state of insensibility—I found a pool of blood under the sofa and a slipper in the blood, which the prisoner said was his—there was also blood on the sofa and all over the room, and in the further corner of the wall, close by where the prisoner was sitting—he said that thieves came into his house, attacked him and his wife, and in defending himself he cut one of his assailants about the arms and legs—he said, "They have not gone far for I have injured them so that they must be somewhere about the neighbourhood"—he per<lb/>sisted in saying that there were thieves in the house, and I searched the house but found nothing disturbed, and the doors of all the rooms closed—there was no indication of the house having been broken into, the doors were all closed and the drawers and articles all undisturbed—he said that he had wounded one of his assailants, and I found a small pocket-knife on the floor—I asked him if it was his—he said that it was, and that that was the knife with which he wounded his assailants—I asked him if both the blades were broken—he said, "No, only one, the other blade I keep to pare my corns"—that is the knife which was found just now, it has been in my pos<lb/>session ever since—I saw a sovereign on the floor—he saw me pick it up and said, "That is one of two sovereigns I had taken from her pocket to give my assailant to let me alone"—after examining the house I returned to the back kitchen and found the prisoner there, still sitting in the same chair I examined him and found blood on his clothes and hands, and the skin on his knuckles broken which I called his attention to, and he said it was caused by his knocking on the panelling to make the person in the other house hear when he called for assistance—I found on the panel, marks smeared with blood such as would be made by a person knocking his knuckles, smeared with blood, against it—he kept saying to his wife, "Dear Hannah, dear wife, were we not attacked?" and after some time when she became somewhat recovered, she said, "Yes, we were"—when I first went in Mrs. Keeble was lying on the floor, her arms and legs partly uncovered—she was insensible—she did move once and say, "Oh, my poor thighs!"—afterwards she came to a little—she appeared to have been drinking—the prisoner was in a state of very great nervous excitement, trembling and</p>

               <p>shaking all over—I think Mrs. Keeble believed she had been attacked by thieves from what she said—on the same afternoon I saw the prisoner in his bedroom where he was in charge of a constable, in consequence of his excited state, as the doctor said it would be dangerous to remove him—I asked him how he was—he said he felt very miserable—and said, "I am now convinced that I must have injured my wife in the way in which you have seen her, thinking that I was defending myself from an attack of thieves. My wife and I were at the Rose and Crown public-house last evening and I recollect nothing after leaving there until I found myself calling for as<lb/>sistance to Mr. Hazle outside the house"—he cried and was very much affected—he said that he felt convinced no thieves could have been in the house and that it must have been him that did it.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Woodward, who keeps the Rose and Crown public-house, Highgate—Mr. and Mrs. Keeble were visit<lb/>ing me on Wednesday, 27th December—they remained with me till twenty minutes or a quarter to 1 o'clock, and then left—they were very comfortable, and happy and agreeable in every way; they sang together, and spent a very comfortable evening—they were not excited particularly, but they were very merry—it was Mrs. Keeble's birth-day, a day or two before, and they were saying how happy they were, they had lived together so long—they both had a little brandy and water—I did not notice that they were any the worse for drink when they came—they were very merry when they left, but quite capable of walking home: just capable—I have said that Mrs. Keeble was a little excited by drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Highgate—on the morning of 28th December, I was called to the prisoner's house, about twenty-five minutes to 4 o'clock—I found Mrs. Keeble on the floor, in the basement at the back of the house, on the flags, almost insensible, and surrounded with blood—her clothes were stained with blood—I examined her thighs, and found about thirty-one incised wounds altogether—some of them as much as six or eight inches long, and all of them directly across the limbs, as if the instrument had been drawn along—the greatest violence appeared to have been used on her right arm, which was one mass of cuts, almost from the</p>

My husband has always been fond of me, and good-tempered. I was very happy; he never ill-treated me. On Thursday morning after Christmas-day, I had been visiting out; I was in the Rose and Crown; my husband came in. We spoke about my birth-day being the day before; my husband kissed me; we went home together. My husband was merry; we have always been friendly. I sat down in the chair, and was taking off my bonnet and a boot. The light was put out; I was seized, I think, by a smallish man. I think it was a smaller man than my husband; I cried out to my husband to save me. I asked what he wanted, if it was my money, I said 'Take it.' I found myself on the floor. I found I was bleeding, and I recollect no more. No words were spoken, but the man breathed hard, and trembled violently."</p>

I live at 3, Skinner's-place, Bishopsgate-street—on February 23d, about twenty minutes past 12, I was returning home—I had had a little drink, but was quite sober—I was turning the key at my own door, when three men came round me, one took my watch from my waistcoat pocket—I turned round instantly, caught hold of the man's wrist, and turned him round—the prisoner immediately struck me a violent blow on the nose—this is the mark, it cut it terribly—I fell—as soon as I fell I jumped up again and followed the prisoner, and a third man who ran into Bishopsgate-street with the prisoner—when I got up the prisoner was in Skinner-street, about twenty yards from my door—I called out "Police" three times—a policeman came into Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was then crossing in a diagonal direction towards London-bridge—I told the policeman to stop him—he did so—I have not the least doubt about the prisoner—I never lost sight of him.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, at Kentish-buildings, Borough—on 5th February, the prisoner came to me—he looked at a great quantity of butter, value 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said it was difficult to get good butter, and that he was a ready-money customer, and wanted some good butter—I took him to the warehouse—he selected four casks and two boxes—he said he had been living at 43, Vere-street, Clare-market; that he was well known there, and had been there eleven years—after that I sold him the butter—I entered the goods as usual—he said that he would pay the carman when he brought them—I sent the carman the next day with the butter, and a stamp to bring back the cash—I did not know the prisoner's name was Bristow at that time—he gave his name as George Terrell—I believed he had been carrying on business for eleven years—if I had known that his name was George. Bristow I should not have sent the goods, as my opinion was that Bristow was a notorious swindler—I have a man living with me who knows him well—I have heard of George Bristow carrying on business as a coffee-house keeper in Duke-street—the fact of his carrying on business 11 years influenced me—if I had known George Bristow had opened a shop, I should have made some inquiries—some two or three days after that, some bacon was ordered—I sent it to the prisoner, and the man brought it back—I asked him why he had brought it back, and in consequence of what he said, I sent my foreman to the prisoner on Friday afternoon, immediately after the carman's return—I left the warehouse before my foreman came back—on Saturday morning, in consequence of what my foreman said, I went to the prisoner—when I first called I did not see the prisoner—I made some inquiries in the neighbourhood, and found he had only been there a few, weeks—I saw the prisoner the second time I called and asked him for the money for the goods I sent, or the goods—a friend was with me—he said, "Give back the goods, or you will get into trouble"—he said, "I have been in many troubles before, and I dare say I shall get out of this; but do your best and your worst"—he acknowledged to be Bristow because my friend recognised him—I</p>

               <p>went to Stone's End for his apprehension and the goods—I took a constable with me, and arrived there about 8 o'clock—I found the shop closed—when the door was opened, about half-past 10, I ran to it and put my foot in it, and got inside—I did not see him—a policeman searched the house, and finding he was not there, and seeing the butter on the shelf, I thought it belonged to me—I ordered a cab, and took it away.</p>

Mrs. Webb, of Ambleside, that they had belonged to her husband, and she wanted to get them out of her sight, and sell them to a stranger, so as she might not see them again—he said they were sound, and that he had ridden and driven them—I asked him if he had the sale of them—he said, "No; Mr. Milton has the sale of them," and he volunteered to take my brother to Mr. Milton—I stayed while my brother went—he did not say he was the son of Milton—he said he was the Hon. Mrs. Webb's groom—I accompanied my brother to the veterinary surgeon.</p>

               <p>side—the collision occurred, and his wheel struck against part of my vehicle—the wheels of his Hansom came between my off fore wheel and spring, and shook deceased and me off the box, and then his wheel went over, struck at my wheel, and stopped between the two wheels of my cab—it strained the spring—the deceased was taken up by some gentlemen—he fell into the near side gutter—he was taken to a doctor's close by—we then got the cabs apart—I pulled my cab closer to the kerb—the doctor came and asked me if I would take the deceased to the hospital—I took him to St. Bartholomew's hospital—allowing a couple of yards for the width of my cab, there were ten yards between my off wheel and the kerb on the opposite side of the road—it was ten yards from the kerb—the road is about fourteen yards wide, a little under or over—I was sober, and the prisoner appeared sober—my near wheel was between three and four yards from the kerb, to the best of my recollection—there was no other vehicle in sight.</p>

               <p>Rowland (Policeman.) I was watching Mr. Nash's premises—he is a charcoal dealer, of 119, Newgate-street—Spring and Ashley were employed there—I saw Ashley bring out two bags of charcoal at a few minutes past 8—the shutters were up, but the door was open—he took them into Davis's, a charcoal-dealer and stove-manufacturer, next door—I stopped him, and from what he said to me, I went into the shop and saw Davis, in the first-floor back room—I said, "Did Mr. Nash's man bring anything in here?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am pretty sure he did; I saw him bring two full sacks of something, and I must have them"—he hesitated some minutes, and then said, "There is one of them," pointing behind the door of the room—I asked him where the other was—he said, I hope you are not going to make a job of this"—I said, "I must have the other sack"—he pointed into the passage, and said, "There it is"—I went and spoke to Spring, and then returned to Davis's place, and told him I should take him in custody—he said, "I should like to know what you are going to say about this matter?"—I said, "The truth"—I took him to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186604090096"/>
               <p>the station—he beckoned me to him, and said that he wished to speak to me—I went to him—he applied his head to my ear, and said, "Do the best you can for me, and I will give you a half-sovereign"—the bag I found at Davis's contained about a bushel and a-half of charcoal, value about seven shillings—he said he had given the full value for it; he had ordered some, but had got none—I afterwards searched the place, and found four other sacks full of charcoal, one with Mr. Nash's name on it—I was present when Childs searched the premises—he found two empty sacks with Mr. Nash's name on them—some of them were stored away under a flue in the same room—some were concealed, and some were not—some laid under a form.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate, "I found in Davis'a place four other bags of charcoal?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was not asked how many of them were concealed—I found twelve sacks in Davis's place under the flue, and four empty sacks, which were not concealed, under a bench—I had found them before I was examined before the Magistrate—I did not say they were concealed—I believe Davis deals in charcoal—I was not in uniform, but he knew I was a detective—after we got to the station, he asked me to go and get bail for him—that was after he put his head to my ear—he asked me to ask the inspector whether he could have bail—I did so—he did not offer me anything for it—he said, "Do the best you can, and I will give you a half-sovereign"—I believe what he meant was that I was to forsake my duty—I told the inspector that he told me he would give me a half-sovereign—I have been in the force about fifteen years—I told the inspector that I saw Ashley bring in two full sacks—I do not remember warning Davis—he said, "I hope you are not going to make a job of it," without my saying a word.</p>
               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">HOWELL</hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Nash, of 119, Newgate-street—Spring and Ashley have been in their employ, one twelve and the other fifteen years—he had had no business transactions with Davis—these two bags of charcoal belong to him—we always have a large stock on the premises, to which Spring and Ashley had access—they were not permitted to purchase charcoal, and had no right to remove it from the premises—I had not given them instructions for two bags to be taken to Davis—I left the premises as near eight o'clock as possible—we generally close about eight—the shutters were up—the business is really over when the counting-house is closed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of Mr. Nash's bags; each bag is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and contains 30lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-agent and merchant, of 38, Basinghall-street—on 18th January, the prisoner came, and said, "I have sold twenty-four pounds of cigars, the same as I had a sample of; will you let me take them with me?"—I said, "No, not unless you pay for them at the time you take them away"—my father was present—the conversation was with him, but we both said that—the prisoner then asked to have a 6-lb. box to take with him—we said, "No, we will not trust you on any account whatever"—he then asked to have them sent down to his house at Deptford, which we agreed to do, on condition that he paid the money for them, or returned the goods by the boy—he left, and twenty-four pounds of cigars were sent by the boy about 5 o'clock to the prisoner's house, Douglas-street, Deptford—the boy came to the office at 9 the next morning without the cigars or the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you in business for yourself at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot remember whether my name was up at that time—my father's name was up—he has been in business some time—he has had several transactions with him, I believe—I know a gentleman named Miller—he did not come to our office from the prisoner the next day—I have never seen him with regard to the prisoner; not as to this transaction; only at Greenwich Court, when he came to hear the case—the prisoner has once taken cigars from our place, and gone round with our boy from public-house to public-house to sell them, but I refused to let him do it again—I did not refer Mr. Miller to Mr. Davis, the solicitor for the prosecution.</p>

               <p>twenty-four boxes of cigars, the same as he had had before, and wished to take a portion of them with him, I distinctly said we could not part with the goods without the money, and that we never did so without cash—he asked if we doubted him—I told him I did doubt him—he then requested to have six pounds only to take with him—I said, "No, I will not do anything of the kind"—I said, I would send them according to his request; but it must be perfectly understood between us that the goods must come back, or the money—he agreed that the goods should come down—we did so—we had had two previous transactions with him, but never parted with the goods without the money—these cigars were given to Gregory, with instructions not to part with them without the money.</p>

My real name is Kochkowski—I am a commission agent, and have known the prisoner eight or ten years—I saw him five years ago—he came to me four weeks before Christmas—I have received a letter from, and I wrote him a letter, after which he came—this is the note I received by post—I learned from him that he had sent it—I said, "You say in your letter you have some great business with me, I wish to know what business it is"—(<hi rend="italic">Translating</hi>"Dear Brother—I have very important business with you; be so kind as to let me know which day; I am engaged till 8 o'clock in the evening, therefore, perhaps, it may be convenient for you to appoint a time. My best wishes—Yours, Vincent Jankowski."—I wrote him an answer—he is a Pole, as I am—it was at my house, 79, St. Paul's-road, he came to see me—I asked him what business he had for me?—he said, "Well, you will think it very strange I have come to you on such a business as this, but at the same time it is nothing serious"—I asked him what business he had with me—after a short time he told me he had some Polish bonds and Russian bank-notes to dispose of—I said, "What are they?"—he said they were siezed at the Polish rebellion—I asked him what the price would be for them—he said, "Well, it is no use to say anything until I bring you a sample," and promised to call in three days with it—after three days he came to my house and showed me six 25-rouble notes,</p>

               <p>and gave them me as a sample—I said, "I cannot say anything until I make inquiries what they are"—I told him to call in two days, and I would let him know—I asked him the price of the Russian notes—he said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece,"—he left them with me—a rouble is about half-a-crown, or.2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in English money—I made inquiries—he came to me again, and I told him they were not genuine—I said, "Have you heard of the last affair which happened lately?" because this was on the 18th, when some people were convicted here—I had the papers in my hand—I said, "It is a dangerous thing"—he said, "No matter; it is no sin with the Russian Government, because they have robbed and killed their countrymen, besides, I am getting old, and have a large family to support, and you can make a nice little money and start in business"—after more persuasion I said I would see what I could do.</p>

Commis<lb/>sion—he was to have half; I, a portion of his half—he did not show me any of these Polish bonds, because I did not care much for them—I knew they were unsaleable, but I was willing enough to deal in them with Mr. Zaba, because a man asked once for them—I mean to say that after the first inter<lb/>view they were not referred to till five or six days before my arrest, because when I had not got him any money he suggested these things—I did not see the bonds then—I gave two of the 6-rouble notes to Felsenhardt, and I had sent others home to Poland before—I was asked before the Magistrate who I sent them to—I declined to answer—I still decline to answer—I tried to sell the 120 that he gave me in two packets to different people—I do not think I am compelled to say who—if you wish to know I will tell you—I did not refuse to tell before.

As I passed my Missis' bedroom, I called out 'Murder;' in going down stairs my light went out. I found master at the bottom of the stairs; I then returned to get a light, which I got from the fire in my Missis' bed-room. I had been splitting wood in the kitchen, in the evening with a hatchet; while I was doing so, I said to the servant, 'I will go and fasten the pot-house door,' which I did; soon after I went into the cellar to put on some ale, I carried the hatchet down with me, and laid it on a basket at the bottom of the stairs; and some one must have followed master into the cellar when he went to turn off the gas, and then taken the hatchet, and returned to the top of the stairs, and committed the act when master was leaving"—I asked him if all the doors and windows were safe—he said, 'They are, except the door leading to the pot-house yard, which I found closed, but not fastened; and the person who committed the act must have gone out by that door'—I searched the place, and found it all secure—I found no footmarks on the roof—if any one had passed over it, there would have been footmarks, as it was covered with snow—I examined the ladders, and the field at the back—I also examined the prisoner's clothes.</p>

On returning from the cellar, I was struck with a hatchet on the head and on the shoulders. The person who struck me passed by me, and ran up stairs. He had on a coloured shirt and coloured stockings. That is the man," looking towards the prisoner—he said to his son, who was in the room, "You charge him"—I then told the prisoner that he was charged with feloniously assaulting his master, with intent to murder him, and that he need not answer me unless he chose—he made no answer—I handed him over to a constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 63).

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Bridport Old Brewery Company, Belvidere-road, Lambeth—the brewery is at Bridport—the business has been established nearly one hundred years—on 2d January, Kelly and Ellis came to the office at Belvidere-road—Kelly came first, at about half-past 10</p>

               <p>or 11 in the morning—I saw Ellis in the clerk's office subsequently—I don't know at what time he came, but it was about the same time—Kelly said he was a bottled beer merchant and gave the name of Holland, of St. John's-court, King-street, Snow-hill—he said he had just bought a bottled-beer business, and wished to buy some of our ales for the purpose of bottling—William Holland and Co. was the style he meant to carry it on by—he ordered ten barrels of ale, and five barrels of stout—five barrels of the ale were Burton, and five pale ale—that is the invoice made at the time—the value was 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. exclusive of the casks, fifteen guineas; together, 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to send them to his stores, at St. John's-court, Snow-hill—he gave me a card—I have not got it, I gave it to Wheeler, our collector—it was Wheeler's custom to introduce customers to us—he was our traveller—he introduced these people to us—since this has taken place, he has absconded—I told Kelly the money must be paid in three days—he said he had no objection, as it was a small quantity, and he would pay in three days—he did not do so—on 8th January, I went to the stores at St. John's-court—I found there a board, with the name of "William Holland &amp; Co." over the stores, which were locked—I knocked at the door, but could not make anybody hear—I made further inquiries of an ostler at the premises, and came away—on 2d January, Ellis gave me an order for twenty barrels of beer, value 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the casks; together, 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me to send it to his stores in New Ormond-street—he gave the name of Ellis—he mentioned that he had just bought a bottled-beer business, and wished to bottle some of our ale—I told him the way to pay for it; one half in fourteen days, and the remaining half in twenty-eight days—Ellis and Kelly were in the office together—they did not appear to know each other—I did not see them speak to each other—on Saturday, 27th January, I went to 17, New Ormond-street to see Ellis because the money had not been paid—I found Kelly there—I asked him if his name was not Hol<lb/>land—he replied, "Oh no, my name is Kelly"—I then asked him if he was not the man who came to the Bridport Brewery Company, and bought some beer in the name of William Holland &amp; Co. on 2d January—he replied, "Oh no, I don't know him, my name is Kelly—I am quite sure he is the man who came—I had entered the stores by the steps, which was the only entrance, and he was going to pass me to go up those steps, but as soon as I mentioned the name of the Bridport Brewery Company he went out at the further door, apparently leading to the back part of the house—hearing footsteps going up stairs, and believing he was going out at the street door, I ran up the step—I saw him going down the street, and followed him—I missed him for a time, and found he had gone into a grocer's shop—I waited about till he came out, and then went up to him, and said that I had no doubt he was the man, and he must come over to the stores with me—as we were going along he said, "My name is Kelly, I am the Company of Holland &amp; Co."—he also said, "We are all apt to act indiscreetly at times"—he said, he supposed that all I wanted was payment for the beer; that he had disposed of it, and was going to get a bill in payment of it, and would return the casks—I replied that payment was not sufficient for us now, and we must inquire further into his proceedings—I took him to our stores, and left him there with the store<lb/>keeper—I then went to the stores in New Ormond-street, with the object of seeing the others—I saw a cab drive up with three gentleman in it—they got out, and went down the stairs—I saw them take away some parcels—the name of Haines was over the door—I didn't see the name of Ellis there—I went out and got a warrant against</p>

Lime-street, and Kingwell, coach builder, St. Martin's-lane—when I was disengaged I found you talking to the clerks—I invited you into the room—you asked me if the references were satisfactory—I said I didn't much like much William &amp; Co., but I was satisfied with Kingwell, and would send in the ale that afternoon by one of Pickford's vans—after that I took the order for 30 barrels, half in 14 days, less 12J per cent, off; and half in 28 days, with 10½ off—I should observe, that I was satisfied with Kingwell's reference on the statement of Wheeler, our collector—when the first pay<lb/>ment became due you did not call on me shortly afterwards—on the 16th August you asked me to take a bill—I refused to have anything to do with them—the second time you called I was engaged, and came out to speak to you—you did not tell me you were not in a situation to pay, but asked whether Mr. Wheeler had left our employment, and if he had been dis<lb/>missed—I am not aware that you said you couldn't pay—I didn't wish to hold much converse with you—you said you would come again next day, and tell me something that would astonish me—I found Kelly in thestores at New Ormoud-street—I don't know whether they are your stores or not</p>
