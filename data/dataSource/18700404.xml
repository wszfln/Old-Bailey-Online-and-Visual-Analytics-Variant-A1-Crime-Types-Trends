               <p>when this regatta would take place—he said when sufficient money had been collected—I further asked him if he lived at Tottenham—he said he did not—I asked why he was collecting subscriptions—he said because he had plenty of time, and he knew the parties—I then gave him a guinea—I gave, certain directions to my servant, and he was taken in custody—I had never seen Ashton before to my knowledge—I had seen Godfrey, he stutters very much—I think I saw him more than once in 1869, but I could not be cer<lb/>tain as to the exact number of times.</p>

On 8th March I was called to Lord George Hamilton's house, and took Ashton into custody—Lord George Hamilton said in his presence that he should give him into custody for obtaining a guinea by false pretences—after we got out of the house Ashton said, "There is a man down here who gave me this parchment"—I let him walk on, and I walked by his side—he walked up to Godfrey, and said, "This is a pretty mess, Bill"—Godfrey said, "It's all right"—I told Godfrey I should take him into custody for being concerned—at the station Ashton said that Godfrey gave him the parchments, and Godfrey said another man gave them to him, but that he did not know the man—I have been to Tottenham and made inquiries, both at the boat-house and the public-houses—no such thing was ever known as an annual regatta or rowing match—I searched Godfrey at the station, and found on him a farthing and an ink-bottle—on Ashton I found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—I asked Godfrey for his address—he said he had got no fixed residence, be lodged anywhere where he got the money to pay his lodging at night—Ashton gave his address as 5, Elliot Court, Old Bailey—that was correct.</p>

I am the wife of Albert Marshall, and live at 8, High Street, Whitechapel—on the night of 12th March, about 10.45, I was in the High Street—the prisoner came in front of me and caught hold of my throat—he then pulled my watch out of my pocket—he broke it away from the chain, and ran down Half Moon Passage with it—as he was going down Half Moon Passage another man followed him, about the same size—the prisoner was the man who assaulted me—he pressed my throat very much—my watch was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I followed the prisoner till he was stopped by a constable—I did not lose sight of him; I was close behind him.</p>

I am the prosecutor's daughter—on the night of 26th of February I was left in charge of the house—I went to sleep, and woke up and went to bed about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning—when I went into the bedroom I saw the window open, and marks as if two knees had been on the sill, trying to get in at the window, which was shut before; it is never open—I went to my father's bedroom, and saw his cupboard open—I told my father when he came home.</p>

I live at 19, Wargrave Street, Kensington, next door to the prosecutrix—about 4.45, on the evening of 28th December, I was passing the Devonshire Arms—I had an appointment to meet my young man near there, and I saw the prisoner running, and a little girl after him—I saw the prosecutrix afterwards, and her eyes were very much bruised, and her nose was bleeding; she had an awful black eye—she was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Back Church Lane, St. George's in the East, assisting my father—on 15th March, about 12.30, I was returning home through Ship Alley into Wellclose Square, which is about 100 yards from where I reside—I had just turned out of Ship Alley when I was suddenly seized by the throat from behind—I turned partially round, and saw the prisoner Hurley holding me by the throat—I tried to get away, but was tripped up, and fell on my face—I was held there by my throat; he never relaxed his grasp; and I felt a man's hand in my trowsers-pocket, where I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in which three sove<lb/>reigns were wrapped; I also had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some coppers, in the same pocket—the hand was withdrawn, and I became partially insensible from the pressure, but when it was withdrawn I got up and ran after one man who ran away—it was neither of the prisoners—there were six or seven altogether—I was then hit and seized again, and knocked down, and I then lost my senses completely from pressure on my throat; and when I recovered I found I had lost my coat, waistcoat, boots, and the contents of my trowsers pockets—my lip was cut, and I felt very severe pain in my throat, and partial stupor, and I have still the greatest possible difficulty in swallowing solid food—I had a severe cut on my lower lip, and a bruise on my right temple—I did not thoroughly recover myself till twenty minutes after I got home, from the pressure on my brain—I went to, the station the next afternoon, Tuesday, and described Hurley as well as I cow, and on Thursday night I saw him, with many others, at the station, and picked him out—my impression is that Brian is one of them, but I will not swear to him—I value my stolen clothes at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen them since—I was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 79, St. Leonard's Road, Bromley—I have a fish shop on one side of the road and a greengrocer's on the other—between 12 and 1 on the morning of 6th February the deceased came into my shop—I saw Nance standing outside—I saw five young men coming along with two or three girls, singing—all at once, one of them stopped and struck Nance—that was Templeton—I did not hear whether or not Nance had given him any provocation—the deceased, hearing it, came out of the shop, and said "Halloa, what is the matter?" and just as he came out the others turned back again—they had gone on a few steps—before they turned back, Templeton had call out "Harry," or something of that sort—Payne, who was one of them, came up and said "What, have you come out to help him?" and he had hardly said the words before he struck the deceased on the side of the face, just behind the ear, with his fist—the blow knocked him right down, or very near down, and before he could hardly get upon his feet again, Payne struck him again, and knocked him down again—the other men all came up just at the same time, and closed in, and they were all of a heap—I saw Nance struck a good many times—I did not see him try to assist his uncle while he was on the ground—I think he was being struck all the while—a policeman came up—he just saw the last blow struck by Payne on the deceased—there were only two blows—they were both on the right side of the face, and struck from behind—when the policeman came up, they all ran away—the policeman caught hold of one, and held him for nearly ten minutes—most of the people round said he was not the one that struck the blow, and he was let go—at the time the policeman had hold of him, Payne came back, and one or two said "That is the one," and somebody halloaed out to Payne, "Harry, run," and he got away again before the policeman could catch him—the deceased had left a bottle in my shop, containing beer, and he came back for it—he appeared quite sober—he had never spoken a word to the prisoners, or given them any provocation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Poplar Hospital—the deceased died there on 16th February, from blood poisoning, arising from fracture of the jaw—he first came early on the morning of the 6th—he was suffering from compound fracture of the jaw; it was broken in two places, both on the right and left side—I took him into the hospital as an in<lb/>patient on the 11th—his club doctor, Mr. Corner, attended him in the interval—he was bruised about the chest and abdomen—there was a post mortem examination—there were numerous small abscesses in both lungs—the spleen was soft; what is called a fever spleen, and there was evidence of inflammation about the membranes of the brain—the other organs were quite healthy—I found nothing else that would have occasioned death, if he had not received these blows—I attribute the death to the blows.</p>

               <p>at that time—we went into the coffee-room and sat down together—the prisoner said "My friend has rendered you a great service, you had better give us a ring; I shall be gad indeed to wear it"—and I said "Yes, I shall be very glad indeed to wear it"—they did not say anything more about the ring, and the man who dropped the purse said "Gentlemen, I had an uncle who left me," I don't know how much money, but a great deal of money, "for the poor; if you show me that you are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will give you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the poor—the prisoner said "Well, I can show you that I am worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner then said to me, "Are you sure you can get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Yes; I can get even 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I like—the other man said "If you get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I am afraid the office is closed now, and I can't get it"—it was about 5.30 then—I said "I know someone else who will lend me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and the prisoner said "You had better go and fetch it"—I said "It will be very nice if he gives us 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but all the time I was suspecting them—I said I was going to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my correspondent, and I should tell him what it was for—the prisoner said "Oh no, don't say anything to him, because this gentleman says that you ought not to say anything about it"—I said "I am not sure that I shall be back for two or three hours; I am going to New Bond Street"—I then left—I was away about two hours and a half—I went to the police-station in a cab, and brought two policemen back with me to the Bricklayers' Arms—I went inside and saw the prisoner as I was coming out—he said "Have you succeeded?"—it was about 8 o'clock then—the police were behind me at the time, one was in uniform, and the other in private clothes—he asked me twice, "Have you succeeded?" and I said "No—I think be then recognized the policeman, and I thought he was going to run away—I saw a man coming up a dark street, and I thought it was the other man—I then called the policeman up, and gave the prisoner in charge—the other man ran away.</p>

I live at 6, Warwick Court, Holborn—I have lived there twenty years, and am a wholesale perfumer—I am seventy-three years of age—the three prisoners rented the front kitchen from me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as a workshop—I let it to the elder Head—they did not pay the rent, and I gave them notice to quit after the first week—that was about five weeks before the assault—I gave Frost two notices to give to Mr. Head—they still remained on—I could not get the rent, and I put the broker in—I went to bed on the 23rd February, about 11.30, after fastening up the house—I heard several persons going in and out during the night, and about 2 o'clock I fell asleep—about 3 o'clock I heard a knocking at my bedroom door—I said "Who are you, and what do you want?—the younger Head said, "My father, Mr. Head, wants to speak to you"—I said "It is not the hour to come; tell your father to come tomorrow morning, and I will talk with him"—the father then came close to the door and said, "Mr. Pavia, be so kind as to open the door for a few minutes, because I have something of great importance to tell you—I repeated the same to him, and told him to come to-morrow—he said "It will be too late to-morrow; you will repent; open the door for a few minutes and you will be satisfied"—I knew the voices of the two Heads, and I opened the door a little way—as soon as I did so I received several blows on the head—about ten, I think—I fell down at the last blow—I was struck with the leg of a chair—I cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and they gave me another blow, and I fell on my knees quite unconscious—I lost I don't know how much blood—the father struck the ten blows—Frost struck me the last blow and then they went away, leaving me as dead—the younger Head stood opposite the door, looking on—I lost a great quantity of blood; all my shirt was red—I was attended by a doctor—I don't know his name—about half an hour after the assault the elder Head was afterwards brought to my bedside by a constable, and I said "That is the man that struck me"—the leg of the chair laid on the chair at the side of the bed, and the policeman asked the father if he knew it, and he said "Yes, it belongs to one of my chairs in the kitchen"—I was in bed for four days, and when I got up I was so weak I could hardly stand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Pavia—about a week before 23rd February, a notice was given to Frost to give to Mr. Head—I went into the kitchen to get some water, and Frost said the old man could not live long; he should like to give him a bit of this, and he took the knife out of his pocket—he said so to young Head—I told Mr. Pavia of it—I told Frost he had better keep his knife to himself—on the morning of 24th Feb<lb/>ruary I was awakened by hearing cries of "Murder?"—it was about 3.30—I got up and went down stairs—I saw young Head in the passage—I went in the parlour, where the cries came from, and saw Mr. Pavia there—he was covered with blood, like a slaughtered bullock—he was standing, leaning on the mantelpiece—he said the man in the kitchen had murdered him—I ran out into the court—I saw young Head in the passage as I came out of the parlour—he was dressed—I said "You know all about it," or something to that effect—I was so excited I don't know what I did say—he said, "You are in a fearful way, to be sure"—I ran into the court, and called "Murder? and "Police!" and young Head said "I will go for the porter at the gate," and he ran for me—I did not go into the kitchen—I was too frightened—the boy ran to the porter, and he came back with two policemen.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Roberts, of 11, Conduit Street—on the morning of 24th February I was called to see Mr. Pavia, and found him suffering from severe contused wounds on the head—they could have been caused by such an instrument as the leg of a chair—they were dangerous wounds at the time, I expected he would have died—he was out of danger on the 10th March—he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood when I saw him.</p>

               <p>that day—Cooper was not working for me on the premises that day—he had worked on the premises for his brother—his brother took the work—he worked for his brother—he ceased to do so on 18th September—he had not worked on the premises from that time till 8th October—it was the custom for tickets to be left with the bricks, and I signed the counterfoil—no ticket was produced when the action was tried—they stated they had it, and it was adjourned for them to produce it, and afterwards they did not produce it—I did not have 1000 bricks delivered to me on that day.</p>

               <p>that was due to him, which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me no receipt—I saw him on Monday, the 4th; he was then moving away his scaffolding from the place—he was there on the 4th, working for himself—he was there perhaps an hour; he had a carman to assist him, James Tarbard—there was a man named Lea there, not assisting him, and I was there—that was on Monday, the 4th—he did not come on Tuesday—I am sure of that—to my knowledge he had removed all his things away on the 4th—his brother was working under him—when bricks are left, the usual custom is that whoever receives them should receive a delivery-note, see that the bricks are right, and either sign the note or get it signed, and return it to the carman—I have the portion that is left—that is not signed—the port that is returned is signed, and the other left, and I file them—when I was in the way I signed them, and my son when I was not—if they are not there they are left till someone is there; but these bricks never have been Left—if I or my son were not there they would have been undelivered—they deliver the note before they un<lb/>load the bricks—it was impossible that they could be delivered and no one there—if nobody was by, the receipt would be left—that has never happened in my case, so far as I have been concerned, on my premises—I could not tell about other people—it has never happened that I and my son were not there, and they were obliged to leave the note till some subsequent occasion—I mean to swear that—if there was no one on the premises the tickets would be brought up to the house, where myself or my sons would be sure to be—they would be left until they had gone and unloaded the bricks, and they would come and receive it—if there was no one there to sign them, they would not leave them, they would be forwarded to me or my sons—they would receive the ticket—I know that they have not applied for the receipt-note for this 1000 bricks—they stated they had done so, and I have made every inquiry—I heard them state that they had done so, at the County Court, John Asser stated it, Cooper did not—Asser said that he had frequently applied for the delivery-note—he said he had come for it, and I bad sent him word that I was too much engaged to attend him, he must come another time—that was what Johu Asser swore—I hare a little girl with my wife, named Jane Greenwood; she is here now—she was not examined at the County Court—I am a cabinet manufacturer—in that part of the country building is included in that; we are builders and cabinet makers—I was building a workshop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, King Street, and am a seaman and rigger—I do not know Hutchinson, no further than doing a job for him—I have known Dowling about eight or nine years—on a Friday in February I saw Hutchinson and Dowling going in the dock, between 12 and 1 o'clock—they called me on board the <hi rend="italic">Corfu;</hi> both of them called me—they went on board and I went after them, and another man came after me, Wilson—when I got on board I saw a quantity of empty sacks lying on the deck, and a quantity of small rope shakings in the sail compartment, and they told me to commence to fill the bags with these shakings—they were about four bushel bags—we filled two and a half with shakings that were there, and then we went into the cooking department, and Dowling fetched a lot of new rope and filled the remainder of the third sack with that—it was four-stranded lanyard rope, what they set the rigging up with—they all helped to fill up the bags, Hutchinson, Dowling, and Wilson—when they were filled I carried one, Wilson another, and Dowling the other—we went right through the gate to Mr. Dowling's house—Hutchinson was left on board—we left the sacks in Dowling's house and came back again to the ship with a bigger sack, like a sailor's bed-tick; we got that from Dowling's house—we took that on board and filled it with new rope—there was a coil of rattlin line, about a 1/2 cwt. of new rope which had never been opened, and about fifteen fathoms of Manilla three-inch rope—Hutchinson helped with Dowling to put the rattlin line in the bag—there was about 19lbs. or 20lbs. of lanyard rope besides put in the same sack; it was filled, and we took it out at the gate to Dowling's house and left it there—Dowling and Wilson went with us—Wilson carried the sack outside the gate, and then I gave him a spell to the house—Dowling gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my trouble, and his wife gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a half-pint of beer—we afterwards went on board again to ask the ship-keeper for allowance, and he gave us 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between us—it is a regular thing to ask for a drop of allowance when you are carrying a heavy job—altogether about 2 1/2 cwt. or 2 3/4 cwt. of rope was taken out of the ship on the Friday—I saw Humphreys on board; be went aboard before I did.</p>

               <p>while they were packing the first two sacks, I could not tell exactly where—he was somewhere about the house of the ship; he came and looked at us now and then, and then he would go away again about the ship—Humphreys went ashore when we filled the first sack—I thought this was all fair and square, as Dowling was a man that had been in the dock many years, buying rope, and I never saw any harm of him—you cannot get out of the dock without passing through a gate—an officer is supposed to be at the gate, to see everything that comes in and out—I did not see one on this occasion—I have known the docks from my childhood—I was first spoken to about this case on the 23rd—the head-constable of the docks came to mo where I was at work, and said Mr. Ross wanted to see me on the Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hutchinson in his defence stated, that a man named Stapleton, who worked for the owner, came to him on board the vessel, and asked for the old shakings, which he had been in the habit of having from the previous ship-keepers; and thinking he had a right to dispose of them, he sold them for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which Dowling paid him, but he knew nothing of any new rope being taken.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Francis Edward Myers, as hop merchants, at 2 and 3, Hop and Malt Exchange—the prisoner has been in my service about ten years—since September, 1867, it was his duty to take charge of the cash-book, in which he would enter cash received and paid, nearly all relating to petty cash transactions—he would enter cheques handed to him for petty cash—if he required money for petty cash disbursements, he would come to me or my partner for it, and the cheque so given would be debited in the cash-book against him—it was his duty to make up a total of the cash-book each month—I had great confidence and trust in him, from the long time he had been in our service—on 29th January he came to me for a cheque for petty cash disbursements—I said "Have you spent the cheque that you last received?"—that was only a few days before—he gave me some rough particulars as to how he had spent that money—I was not quite satisfied, and asked him whether his cash agreed—he said not quite, that he had stopped the night before until 10 o'clock, and intended to stop another evening or two in the follow<lb/>ing week to set his book right—I asked him to show me the cash-book, which he did, and I found it had not been balanced since September 1st, 1869; it then showed a balance against him of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him whether the balance then agreed with the cash—he said "No"—I got rather angry, and told him to take his hat and go at once—he then asked to speak to me privately—I went with him into the next room, and he said, "I am sorry to have to tell you that I have overdrawn my account"—I asked him how much it was—he said about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he could not say exactly, "But," he said, "I will secure you with a bill of sale on my father's furniture"—his father's furniture had been seized a long time ago, and he had made himself responsible to pay off the debt in weekly instal<lb/>ments—I wrote for him on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and he came—in the interval I had had the books made up, and a balance struck—I have examined the books myself—on 29th January I find that the balance against him was 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him that—he said it could not be so much, it might be 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he added, "I must have had losses"—I asked him if he had taken any <hi rend="italic">lump</hi> sum at any one time—he said no, he had taken it in small amounts of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and it had been going on for two or three years—I said "If the money is not forthcoming, you must expect a policeman to be sent down to take you up"—in October last I had a traveller named Arthur Brodrich—I have my cheque book here—on 25th October I drew a cheque, payable to myself, for Brodrich's expenses—I don't know whether that cheque was given to the prisoner—there is an entry on the counterfoil of a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the word "Brodrich" in the prisoner's handwriting—that cheque is entered by the prisoner in the cash-book, on the credit side, but not on the debit—in the ordinary course of business, it should not have gone into that book at all—I have Brodrich's receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had no authority to take moneys from the petty cash and use it for his own purpobes, without asking me.</p>

               <p>prisoner away I had not the slightest suspicion of anything—I always found him pretty industrious—whin he first came to me he was paid weekly a very small salary, then he had £100 a year, paid quarterly—he was allowed to draw the money weekly, and debit himself with £25 at the end of the quarter—he sometimes attended from 8.30 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m., not generally speaking—our general hours are from 9.30 to 7 in the evening—occasionally he would come as early as 8, and stay till 9 or 10—he had the invoices to attend to, the account sales, the English correspondence, list of amounts, Custom House work, keeping the day-book and balancing the cash-book; those were all his duties—I had access to the cash-book when<lb/>ever I liked—I was frequently in the habit of coming to him for sums of money out of the petty cash, and my partner also—my partner is not here—he left London this morning—you asked me these questions at the Police Court—no memorandum was kept by myself or partner of the turns—the prisoner ought to have kept a memorandum of them—they were only loans from one day to the other—there were no disputes between us as to those amounts—I daresay there were differences; I believe there was on one occasion—there may have been two—if the amount had been against the prisoner he would not have had to make it good—if at the end of the month he had said there was a deficiency, it would have been looked into, and most probably we should have taken the cash-book away from him—I told him if the money was not forthcoming he must expect to be arrested—if it had been forthcoming I don't know that he would not have been arrested—I meant by that, that I wanted the money—he was given into custody, I believe, a fortnight yesterday—that would be five or six weeks after I had discovered the deficiency—he was taken at his own house.</p>

I go out with a coal-dealer's barrow—on 24th March I was sitting on my barrow in Cornwall Road, outside the shop where I am employed, which is near the railway arch, and saw three young gentle<lb/>men—one of them seized Mrs. Chapman behind, another in front, and the third took her watch—I saw it in his hand—I then had to go out with some orders—I have seen the prisoners walking about, and am quite sure neither of them attacked the lady.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 102). On 26th February, about 8 p.m., I met Hardy on Blackfriars Bridge—he was bulky about the pockets, and I and two other officers, Berry and Davis, followed and stopped him—I said "What have you in your pockets?"—he said, "Only a bit of tea," producing this small packet of tea (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Have you anything more about you?"—he said, "Yes, this parcel of sugar"—I asked where he got them—he said, "From the Civil Service in Monk well Street"—the other officer asked if he had anything more about him—he said "No"—I told him he would have to go with us to the station—Berry then put his hand in Hardy's coat pocket and took out four composite candles—we asked him where he got them—he said that he found them among some rubbish at the Civil Service, Ward's Wharf, Lambeth—we charged him with unlawful possession—he said that we should find it all right—we took him to the station and charged him—he was searched in my presence, and two other candles were found on him and a few loose biscuits and some white twine—he gave his address 14, Aldred Street, Bermondsey New Road—I asked him whether he had any similar property there, as it would be necessary for me to go there—he said that he did not know—we went there; Mrs. Reynolds came to the door, and I asked</p>

               <p>her if a man named Hardy lodged there—she said "Yes"—I said, "We are police-officers; he is in custody for unlawful possession of some tea and sugar, and we want to search the room he occupies"—a room on the first floor was pointed out to us as Hardy's—we found two boxes there, which we opened with two keys we had found on him, and found a portion of a raw ham, a large quantity of biscuits loose, some honey-soap, corn-flour, spice, candles and other articles, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—we found in the room a bottle of champagne, and some canvas under the bed, also a pair of new gloves and some night<lb/>lights—I said to Reynolds, "Have you any objection to my searching your room?"—he hesitated a little, but afterwards consented—I asked Mrs. Reynolds if she knew that Hardy was bringing these things home, she said yes, and if she asked him how he came by them he told her to mind her own business, and that was all she could get from him—I searched their room in their presence, and found this canister of tea in the bed, placed where the pillow ought to have been—this portion of ham was in a pan under the bed—I said "How do you account for the possession of these?"—Reynolds said "I do not know how it came there; it must have been put there by Hardy—I found two small packets of tea in a box under the bed which the child was lying on, a small quantity of soap, a bottle or two of scent, four or five tint of mustard, some potted meat, some candles, spice, sauce, night<lb/>lights, and other articles, all concealed in different parts of the room, or in boxes and drawers—the boxes appeared to be the child's bedstead, and before you could ascertain what was there you had to remove the child from the bed—I told them I should have to take them in custody for receiving—Mrs. Reynolds begged me not to do so—Reynolds said "I told Hardy I should not put any more things away for him—at the station Hardy was fetched up and shown the property found in his room, and he was asked how be accounted for their possession—he looked at them and declined to say—next morning I went to his cell with Barry, and asked him if he wished to account for the possession of them then—he said "No; it will not lighten my sentence <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, and I shall not <hi rend="italic">split</hi> on any one"—he made a statement to us in his solicitor's presence, before he was taken before the Magistrate—he was at that time instructing his solicitor, and was attending to these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which were found on him at the station—Mrs. Reynolds said that she did not see why they should suffer for all when there were others in it—Hardy also made a statement the next day; he had been in<lb/>structing his solicitor, and the Reynolds were then doing to, but I do not know whether the solicitor could hear it.</p>
