                  </hi>. I am a broker, and at the time in question lived in James-street, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. In Sept. 1844 I had a warrant against the prisoner's goods, at No. 3 or 4 Colchester-terrace, Old Brompton—I went there with the warrant—the servant was going in with some bread—I went in and found the prisoner there and his two sons—when I got up to the door in the first instance the maid servant screamed out, when she saw us rushing in at the door—I had a man with me—the maid servant then pushed against the door, to stop us from going in—the two sons immediately rushed to the door—I had got myself partly in, and my man was pushing me—the son William Paul Rogers took up a large broom-handle and struck the man on the top of his head—the man ran away directly, leaving me there—I told the father, directly I got into the parlour, I had come to distrain for a year's rent due to Mr. Colchester—he said, "You will just see how we will serve you then"—he struck me three or four times—they had got sticks—I told them they had better not use violence, but see Mr. Colchester, and see what terms they could come to with him; they could do better by mild means than force, but the father said no, he would pay me—he struck me three or four times with a large stick—they had each large sticks, and one had an iron bar—the prisoner had a stick, and struck me across the lions—I was</p>

               <p>standing at the side of the table pulling out my inventory-book, but before I had time to take it out, I was beaten on the loins a very violent blow indeed—I then hallooed out "Murder!" for some one to come to my assistance—it is a very bye place, and very few people there—the prisoner called on his sons to give me a d—d good <hi rend="italic">hiding,</hi> and turn me out of the house—at last I got from them and ran up stairs and pushed up the window—both sons laid upon me with their sticks as hard as they could—William Rogers used an iron bar—I was struck on the head with the iron—the two sons have since been tried—when I was up stairs the prisoner called to his sons to turn me out of the house, and to d—d well pay me—after I got up stairs they forced me from the window—they shut the window and pulled the blinds down, and then forced me down stairs again—on the foot of the stairs the father struck me on the head with a very heavy stick, and I did not see him afterwards—after I got down in the passage, the elder son called out to bring the Turk's knife and cut the b—g—r's throat—one of the sons got it—the prisoner took a way the knife and said, "Oh no, do not use that"—he took the knife away from them with great force, and in the act of taking it away he very much cut his hands—after that I was thrown over the garden wall—I found myself over the wall when I came to my senses—I was laid by, and feel the effects in my head when the weather is bad—I took some physic, and had some plaster on my head—the prisoner has been out of the way till he surrendered.</p>

               <p>in Oct. I had purchased some books from a man where he lives, and amongst them were several odd volumes—he called on me to know the names of those books, because some more books had come from the country, and he thought the volumes wanting might be amongst them—I gave him the names of three books, and he then went away—I saw him again on the Wednesday, the next day but one—he brought two books to me, supposing they might be those I gave him the names of, but they were not—he took them away with him—he said the other person had brought up some books, and he would let me know when it would be convenient for me to see them at his house, No. 11, Lans<lb/>downe-mews—on the following morning I went to his house—I did not find the books—his wife told me they were taken away and sold—I did not see Watts there.</p>

On Wednesday, the 27th of Jan,. the two prisoners came to the shop in a cart—Watts was driving it—my master was at a sale—the cart was stopped just by our shop door—Mr. Love came down, and asked if we were buyers of books—I said, "Yes," and asked him to let me see them—he went to the cart, and brought some books in a while cloth, the "Historical Register," and some others—I asked him the price—he said he had some more—he went to the cart, and brought some books in a while canvas bag—when he came in with the bag, Watts came in with him—as my master was not at home, I went and fetched Mr. Petherham—he came, looked at the books, and asked the price—I could not sat whether Watts was in the shop then, as he kept going in and out to look after the cart—Mr. Petherham asked whose books they were—Love said they were his, that he brought them from High Wycombe—I do not think Watts was in the shop then—the street being narrow the cart was moved from that street to Princes-street—Watts came in and out occasionally—Mr. Petherham eventually agreed to give 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi> for them—Love received the money—Mr. Patherham noticed that the books were imperfect—Mr. Love said he could not tell, as they had been lying about, and the children might have got at them—he said he had been many years col<lb/>lecting them, and his father before him—Watts said he did not think any of the books he had looked over were imperfect, calling the other man "George"—those books have been shown to Mr. Harman, and he has identified them—I have not any doubt about the prisoners being the persons who were there.</p>

Watts came to my master's shop in a house and cart, with some books—there was a person named Love with him—Watts was in and out of the shop from time to time while Love was bargaining for the books—nine sovereigns were paid for them—I remember Mr. Petherham making an observation about the books being imperfect, and Love said they had been lying about, and the children might have got at them, as he had been years collecting them, and the father before him—Watts said he did not think any that he looked over were imper<lb/>fect, calling the other man "George"—amongst the books there was this one, which is "poems by I. D., "and this other book.</p>

                  </hi> I am inspector of the N division of Police. I found Mr. Harman's place broken open—I took Watts into custody for on the 18th of Feb.—I said he must consider himself in custody, for being connected with others in stealing the books from Mr. Harman's—he said he knew nothing about them—I left him in custody of Sergeant Watkins—I afterwards took Box—he said he got the books from Watts, a lady's coachman, in Lansdown-mews—he first said he was to get 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> for them—then he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and then he said all he got above 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi> he was to have for himself—he said he called round at Watts' to know if he had got any waste paper, and watts said he had got no waste paper, but he had got some books, and he said Watts had borrowed his horse and cart on several occasions—I know Charles Love—I have not had any description given to me of him by Mr. Lilly—I have tried to find Charles Love, but have not been able.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Bromley's-buildings, and am employed at Brooks' wharf, Thames-street at times—the prisoners were fellow-workmen there—on 3rd March they said they had a few waste rags, and asked me if I would take them home, and make the best use I could of them—they said they would leave them for me next morning—both prisoners spoke to me about it, and both told the same story—Bartlett spoke to me about it first, when we were at work together—in the course of the day they said they would give me something after I had sorted them; they did not say what—next morn<lb/>ing I went to Brooks' wharf, and saw a person, who I took to be Mills, in the gallery—I cannot swear it was him, as they all dressed so much alike—I did not see that person do anything—I saw Bartlett on the wharf—they had told me the day before where I should find the sack—I picked it up in Brooks' Wharf-lane—I carried it along, and was stopped by the policeman.</p>

Oliver applied to me to change a note—I sent him to the banker's for the Change—I went into the shop, and saw an elderly woman and a man, whom I believe to be Reeves—that is the very strong impression on my mind—I sold them a wedding ring and brooch—I thought they were going to be married— —the woman was about ten years older than him—I was not aware it was a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi> note—when Oliver returned he sold the woman another brooch, which</p>

On Saturday, the 20th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, the female prisoner came for a penny publication, called the "Family Herald"—I served her, and she offered me a shilling—I saw it was had—I bent it and gave it her back—she said she had not another, and was going out, when the policeman came in and took it out of her hand—he then fetched in the male prisoner, and searched him in my presence—I heard some money drop on the floor of the shop—I was a little distance from him—I saw the money at his feet, and the policeman pick it up—I picked up a bit of paper with a bad shilling inside—I picked that up directly the shop was cleared, just where the male prisoner had stood—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) I was in the neighbourhood of Hackney-road on the 20th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner Montriou, whom I used to know by the name of Watson—he was standing near the Refuge, in the Hackney-road—I then saw the female prisoner come out of a shop in Thomas-street—she walked to Montriou, who was about half-a-dozen yards from the shop—I saw something pass between them—I could not see what it was, but I saw a hand pass from the female to the male, and then something passed from the male to the female—the female then went into Mr. Elliott's shop, and the male waited outside, a few yards from the shop door—he remained there, till the female came out, about a couple of minutes—she joined him again, and they went to Mr. Cassell's, a milliner's shop in Hackney-road—the female went in there, the male stood on the opposite side of the way—he crossed—I saw the female come out and join him again, and they went to Mr. Hoane's, in Kingsland-road—the female went in, and the man stood opposite—he crossed the road and looked in at the window, while the female was in the shop—she left the shop and joined him again—I went into the shop directly, and Mr. Hoane gave me a shilling—I said it was bad—this is it—I then went back after the prisoners—I saw them again, and saw something pass from the male to the female, and they went to Mr. Harrison's shop—the female went in, and the male was outside, looking through the window—I then saw him walk away—I went into the shop while the female was there—I saw Mr. Harrison give her black a shilling in her hand, and I seized her by her hand while she had the shilling—I took it out of her hand—this is it—I went out</p>

               <p>immediately after the male prisoner, who was close at hand—I took him some few minutes after—he was standing with his hands in his pockets—I took hold of him by the two shoulders, turned him round, and from his trowsers dropped two shillings—these are them—he turned round, used a bad expres<lb/>sion, and while there he dropped some copper money down the legs of his trowsers—I picked it up—it was loose—it was not bad that I could see—one shilling was afterwards picked up by Mr. Harrison, which she gave me—this is it—I found on him a ball of cotton and this lace.</p>

On Monday, the 15th of March, I went on board a steam-boat at Hungerford—I was in plain clothes—in going through the first bridge I observed the prisoner and three others pa<lb/>rading up and down the boat—I knew one of the others, and I kept an eye on the parties—I afterwards saw Mr. Riddell and another lady leaving the steam-boat—they came up the hatchway on the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>—the prisoner closed up to her, and one of his companions was covering him—the prisoner had this macintosh on his left arm—he put his hand into Mr. Riddell's pocket, and drew out something—I went to her and said, "Have not you lost some<lb/>thing?"—she said, "Yes, my purse"—I said, "Come back with me"—we went back, and met the prisoner with three others—I seized him, and re<lb/>ceived a violent kick from him—I thought my leg was broken—I saw the purse fall, and I tried to get it, but my hat was knocked off, and I could not—I was very much ill used, but the check-taker and another person came to my assistance—I was off duty twelve days on account of my leg.</p>

                  </hi> I live at the King's Arms at Fulham. Before the 25th Jan. I had a snuff-box, a seal, and a watch key in my bar—I afterwards missed them—the box and seal were in a desk in my bar, which was broken open—on the morning of the 25th Jan., about eight o'clock, I found the bar had been entered by turning the screw of the box which the lock shot into—I had locked the house up safe the night before, from half-past twelve to a quarter to one o'clock—on the morning of 2nd March, I was called up by my horse-keeper, about a quarter before seven o'clock—I came down to my tap-room, and sent for the police-constable—I saw the prisoner there appa<lb/>rently half asleep, as if he had been intoxicated—I gave him into custody—under his feet was this snuff-box, which I lost on the 25th of Jan.—it could not have remained in the place where I saw it all that time—I also lost some French coins and various articles beside—nothing was found but this snuff-box, a watch-key, and a seal, which was on the prisoner's person—the prisoner owned the seal himself, he said it was his—a knife of the pri<lb/> soner's</p>

                  </hi> I am a chemist and druggist, and live in High-street, Camden-town. On the 15th of Feb., about seven o'clock in the evening, I received this prescription from Miss Collyer (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is "Compound spirit of ammonia, two drachms; tincture of opium, sixteen drops; prussic acid, Seheeles' strength, four drops; compound strychnine powder, two grains; bitter almond water, six ounces; make into a mixture, of which take two spoonsful three times a day—Feb. 3, 1847. Miss Collyer. Signed, D.C."—the Latin for the words <hi rend="italic">spoons full</hi> is <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi>—it does not state any particular size—there is also a prescription for pills, but that was not made up—when I re<lb/>ceived this prescription I saw I had not got the bitter almond water or the compound strychnine powder—I wrote an order, and sent my boy to Mr. Morson's, a chemist of some eminence in Southampton-row, and told him if he could not obtain it there, to go to Mr. Bell's, in Oxford-street, who is one of the first chemists in London—the boy brought me back a twelve ounce bottle full of bitter almond water—the directions that I gave to the boy and the article which he brought back were precisely in accordance with the bitter almond water named in the prescription—the boy did not bring me any compound strychnine powder—I could not obtain it, and I made up the pre<lb/>scription without it, with the other ingredients—I put in six ounces of the bitter almond water—I filled the bottle up with it, and gave it the witness Johnson—I have been a chemist and druggist twelve years—I never made up such a mixture before—in my experience I had never seen the compound strychnine powder and bitter almond water named as ingredients to be used in medicine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say you had never made up such a prescription before, that is, you never prepared one with six ounces of bitter almond water concentrated in a pint bottle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never prepared one with bitter almond water in my life—I did not know the properties either of the strychnine powder or the bitter almond water—they are not named in the "Pharma<lb/>copæia," and therefore I could not—I have never seen in the <hi rend="italic">Pharmaceutical Journal</hi> a prescription by Mr. Bell as to the mode in which the bitter almond water is to be prepared—it is not named in any recognized "Pharmacopaeia"—the last edition of the "Pharmacopaeia of the London Physicians" was</p>

               <p>published in 1836—I believe that is what is called the "London Pharma<lb/>copaeia"—I believe that with eleven years of experience there has been no recognized edition of the "pharmacopoeia" since—I have read of professor Baron Liebig, and have seen some of the discoveries that have been made in medinal science during the last eleven years—I do not know the purpose or property or compound strychnine powder at all—if it had been for the pur<lb/>pose either of partially neutralising, or in any way dealing with any other portion of the prescription, I should know nothing about it—I left it out, and never mentioned it, but Mr. Bell sent me a private recipe for making it up, and I am sure, if made up according to that, it would have no effect at all—I did not send Dr. Cronin's prescription to Mr. Bell—he did not know whether that which I wrote for, and which was prescribed, was for external or internal use—I wrote precisely in the same words that were ordered—we never send the prescriptions—if I had sent it, he would have seen from it that the bitter almond water was a mere vehicle for the administration of the medicine—I do not know that I put in enough concentrated bitter almond water to kill a horse—I have seen Mr. Gray's "Supplement to the Pharmacopaeia"—I have not seen bitter almond water named there as a vehicle—there are instruc<lb/>tions, there for persons who take upon themselves to mix physician's prescript<lb/>tions or to prepare distilled waters from oils, but we never prepare them from the "supplement"—I do not possess it—I do not know Dr. Periara's <hi rend="italic">Selecta<lb/>e Prescripta</hi>—I do not think that is a book of authority—I have never heard that it is—I have been in a great many chemists' shops, and have never seen it—when the word <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is written in a prescription for a half pint or pint mixture, then we consider it means a table-spoon full, but if in a small phial, it would mean a tea-spoon full—I should have thought that in a bottle of this capacity the physician meant a table-spoonful—I do not know whether anybody in his senses would have doubted it—this is a prescription of a variety of compounds, some of which I think would neuturalize the others—compound spirit of ammonia decomposes prussic acid—I believe the ingredient known by name of <hi rend="italic">aqua amygdalarum amarum</hi> means the water of bitter almonds—I was not aware that that was prepared in a variety of ways, or that it was prepared at all—I did not know that there were five different characters of it—I did not know that in one way of mixing it it was a most deadly poison—if the prescription was <hi rend="italic">aqua amygdalarum amarum concentra,</hi> that would mean the concentrated water, a strong water, of course—it appears on the face of this prescription that it is to be taken internally—it is ordered here as the vehicle for compounding together the different materials of the prescript<lb/>tion; to fill up the bottle—it was filled up with six ounces of the bitter almond water sent to me by Mr. Bell—it was not labelled "concentrated," nor even "poison"—I did not smell it before I put it into the prescription—I poured it from Mr. Bell's bottle into the other—it did not produce on my nerves the slightest possible sensation of the bitter of almonds—it was a twelve-ounce bottle, and held about three-quarters of a pint—the bottle I sent to Miss. Collyer was a six-ounce one—it contained six doses—I think compound spirit of ammonia would decompose prussic acid of Scheeles' strength—it is apparent on the face of this prescription that the bitter almond water is intended merely as a vehicle for taking the medicine.</p>

I received an order upon a paper, on which Mr. Corfield's name was printed, for some bitter almond water and compound strychnine powder—I had no compound strychnine powder—there is no authorized formula for it—I had none myself—I referred to several books for it, and I sent Mr. Corfield the bitter almond water, and a copy of the formula for the powder, which I happened to find in a book, mentioning the authority—I have not recollection of ever having seen bitter almond water ordered in a prescription as a medicine internally—there are formulae on the Continent for it, but I have not seen it in England—I think I have examined about twenty-two formulae since this case came before the public, in the foreign Pharmacopoeias—I have looked at this prescription of Dr. Cronin's—if it were sent to me I should not know what to put in it—I should think it requisite to ask the physician which kind of bitter almond water he meant, or how it was to be prepared—there is nothing in the prescription that tells me of what strength it is to be—any kind of bitter almond water would be equally correct, according to the order—I have known bitter almond water or<lb/>dered externally—the vehicles for the mixing up of medicines are endless—some may be harmless and some poisonous, but if poisonous, their strength should be defined—the strength is not defined in this prescription—the omission of the strychnine powder would have no effect, whatever chemically, on the mix<lb/>ture—it would be the omission of a poison, therefore, it might be rather less poisonous—strychnine is an alkaloid prepared form nux-vomia—the compound strychnine which is intended here is made with a mixture of sugar in that alkaloid, and is perfectly harmless—the strength intended here would be quite harmless—it would not have any effect in qualifying the other ingredients.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, have not you yourself published the fact that it has been in use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have published the different formulae used on the Continent, proving how variable they are—I would certainly not dispute with such men as Professor the Baron Von Liebig, or Orfila, or men of that eminence, but we are nor under their authority in making up prescriptions, we are under the authority of the College of Physicians—I have read a paper at the Pharmaceutical Society upon the subject of the bitter almond water which I supplied in this case, in which it was recom<lb/>mended as an external application, by certain medical men whose names I mentioned in the paper—I have not been the means of giving to the public the history of the distilling or preparation of harmless or innocent bitter almond water—the sort of bitter almond water which I alluded to was that which I sent, which is harmless in a certain dose, but not in the dose taken under the prescription—the dose taken would not have killed a horse, but I think it would have killed any human being—I know "Gray's Supplement to the Pharmacopoeia—Gray has two private formulae of his own, but that is no authority in making up prescriptions—the last edition of the "Pharmacopoeia of the College of Physicians" was published in 1836—there have been very considerable strides made in medicine and chemistry during the last eleven years which do not appear in the "Pharmacopoeia"—if any medical gentleman orders this medicine he orders a certain strength, and if he mentions the word "Gray's," it is an authority, but unless he does, it is not—there may be chemists and gentlemen here who have been in the constant habit of using the innocent bitter almond water as medicine—they might order it by simply using words <hi rend="italic">aqua amygd amar</hi>, if they understood each other—if I had had the prescription I should not have understood what was meant, because no strength is mentioned—any medical man may tell any chemist he pleases what strength he likes made up, and that chemist may know what is intended, but not any other chemist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you published in the "Pharmaceutical Journal" a formula for the preparation of medical almond water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a formula sent to me by a chemist at Brighton for publication, which I put into the Journal, but it is no authority—it is a proposition, the same as a great number of articles which are published, they are simply proposals for improved me<lb/>thods of preparation; but it does not follow because they are published that they become authority, unless they are authorised by the "College of Phy<lb/>sicians"—I published it—it was made from the cake by a particular process (<hi rend="italic">referring to the Journal</hi>)—the proportions were two pounds of bitter al<lb/>monds, having the oil expressed, distilled with eight pounds of water—that would be perfectly innocuous in a proper dose, and so would that which I sent, but this would be nearly as strong as that which I sent—the meaning of "<hi rend="italic">aqua amygd amar concent.</hi>" is concentrated bitter almond water—I sent a bitter almond water which is prepared in distilling the oil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you send the concentrated bitter almond water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know of no preparation which is under any authority designated by that term—it was a concentrated bitter almond water, but it was not so strong as it might have been made—I have examined some twice as strong, of course that would be more concentrated—the word "concentrated" is a comparative term.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would there have been any difficulty in putting the strength of this bitter almond water in the prescription? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it would have been very easy to have stated how many drops of oil and how much water—in cases where there is no authorised formula, it is usual to state the strength—sometimes harmless liquids are used to make up medicines—it does not follow that they should be always harmless—when deleterious ingredients are used it is usual to mention the strength, if there are various infusions—there would have been no difficulty in mentioning the strength that Dr. Cronin intended this bitter almond water to be of—I conceive if it was in<lb/>tended to be taken to any chemist, the strength should have been mentioned—if it were to be made up at his own dispensary it would be perfectly safe, but a chemist not having any understanding of that sort would not know.</p>

                  </hi> I am a plumber, and live in East-road, City-road. On the night of the 22nd February, I was passing along Old Gloucester-street, Hoxton, and saw three or four men, (the prisoner was one of them,) standing talking outside the Duke of Gloncester public-house there—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in the cart then—I crossed, and was going down New Gloucester-street, and then saw the prisoner driving the cart—the horse was going very fast—the prisoner was not doing anything—he had the reins in his hand, I suppose, and the whip—I believe he was flogging the horse at one time, but I was very much agitated when I saw the child in the road—one of the New River men was with me—I ran after the cart, as I saw it was going very fast, and thought some accident might occur—I saw him beat the horse while the cart was going very fast—I am sure I saw him beat it—I saw the deceased child lying in the road, and a person with it—the cart had then gone on—I do think it was out of sight—I took the child to the doctor's—it was bleeding, but very trifling—I cannot say whether there was any other carriage in the street besides the cart the prisoner was driving—I did not observe any—I did not attempt to overtake the cart—my atten<lb/>tion was drawn to the child—there were several people assembled, who called out, "Stop him," or something of that kind—when the cart stood by the public-house, there was a dog in it—while the prisoner was in the cart, I saw him turn round to look at his companions who were behind—I think that was just before the child was lying on the ground—I am not certain whether the pri<lb/>soner looked back before the accident or after it, but I saw his hand waving at or near about that time I saw the child in the road—I cannot say whether he was trying to stop the horse or not, I was so agitated—my attention these more on the child than looking after the man—I dare say I recollected these facts the next day when before the Coroner, better than I do now—at the station-house the prisoner said he had a dog in the cart—I forget what else he said—it was something about the dog having started the horse, or bitten the horse—I made the remark, that he was flogging the horse—I do not think he made any answer to that—I think the sergeant of police, or some one else there, interfered, and said that was not a place for altercation—I saw the prisoner with the whip in his hand, and think he was flogging the horse—I said to him, "The dog had no command over your whip"—I forgot that, as it is so long ago, but that was the remark I made—I think he was flogging the horse—yes, he was on one occasion.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Mr. Bailey, a warehouseman, and live in Devonshire-street, New North-road. On the night in question I was coming down Old Gloucester-street from Hoxton—I saw three or four men at the Duke of Gloucester public-house—there was a horse and chaise-cart there—after that, I was walking very slowly down New Gloucester-street, and saw Mr. Newby`s child on the opposite side of the way, playing with a piece of wood, which flew into the road—the child went to pick it up—it was getting dusk, and at that moment the horse came up, and the fore foot knocked the child on the head—I heard no noise behind—it was momentary—I heard the cart coming along—it was running—it was driving fast—it was coming fast—I cannot say I saw the child struck, because I had my own two little ones with me—I saw it the moment after the cart went on—I saw the man in the cart try to pull the reins—be looked round—I have been examined before—I first heard a terrible driving behind—after the child was knocked down the cart passed on—I think the man turned round and looked, but I cannot recollect more, for I fainted in the street—when examined before the Coroner next day I remembered what had taken place, as nearly as I could—I signed my deposition—I saw the man look round, but did not see him beat the horse—I did not swear that he did—this is my writing—it was read over to me before I signed it—what I say there is true—(<hi rend="italic">This witness`s deposition being read, stated,</hi> "He turned round and looked, and he beat the horse, and it went on at that rapid rate that many ran after it, but could not catch it; the</p>

On the 13th of March, a little after one o'clock in the night, I was passing through Bartlett's-passage, Fetter-lane, I noticed the door at No. 1 open—I sent for Savage—I saw this parcel produced, in a low wall opposite the door—I entered the house, and found the prisoner on the stairs proceeding up to the water-closet door—this carpet-bag laid at his feet—I asked him where he got the property from, meaning the bag and parcel—he said, "From this house"—I asked if he lived there—he said, "Yes"—I aroused the inmates, they came down—I asked them in the prisoner's presence, "If he lived there? "—they said, "No, they knew nothing of him"—I asked, "If they knew anything of the property? "—They said, "NO"—Savage secured the prisoner—I examined the adjoining premises, and at No. 12 I found the owner of the property—a person could pass from the yard-wall of No. 12 to the house No. 1—I found a foot-mark on the white table-cloth, which was close to the bed-room window, on the ground-floor of No. 12—I searched the prisoner at the station—he had two shirts on, white ones, and a flannel one on him, and two waist<lb/>coats and apair of white cotton-stockings—he had shoes on his feet—found a pair of shoes at the house No. 1—the prisoner said they were no this, but after<lb/>wards owned them—Bawton, one of the inmates, gave me a screw-driver, two skeleton-keys, and a dark-lantern—he is not here—I did not see him find them.</p>

                  </hi> I am a letter-carrier of the London district. On the 1st of Feb., in consequence of the illness of Middleton, I assisted the pri<lb/>soner the whole day—I was present at one of the examination before the Magistrate—I was called up and shown the letter produced, and did not re<lb/>collect anything about it—I afterwards went to Mr. Peacock to see the letter, as I remembered a conversation between the prisoner and me about a letter, which I thought afterwards was like this, on looking at the letter—I remembered that at the five o'clock delivery, after he had done sorting, I went to where he was sitting, and began to "set the letters in"—I came to one, read the direction, and asked him where it was to go—he said, "That is not yours"—I said, "Whose is it?"—he said, "I will take it"—I know Henrietta-street, it is not on our said, I mean mine and his—I said, "But it is not in our walk at all"—he said, "I am going there, I will deliver it"—he took it up—I recollect reading "Secretary of the Clerical Club" on the letter—I recollect it was at the five o'clock delivery, because I went that part of the ground at ten and five o'clock, and at ten o'clock I did not attempt to set the letters, and at five o'clock I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you do at Bow-street that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been delivering letter close by, and knowing the prisoner's examination was coming off, went in to hear it—they called me as a witness, and showed me the letter—I did not look much at it—I said I did not know anything about it—the conversation was on the 1st of Feb., and this was on the 16th of March—I said I knew nothing about it—I did not remember it at the time,</p>

               <p>but on consideration I remembered what passed that day—I was only on with him one day—when the letter was shown to me I was taken by surprise, and did not recollect it—I was nervous—I do not know that the prisoner was in the habit at times of hanging up his coat at the place where the letter were sorted at Charing-cross—I will not swear he never did it, I do not remember it—he had a very bad cold that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not leave the coat two hours in the office, on Monday, the 8th of March, so that anybody might have put the letter in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had nothing to do with him that day, I do not believe he wore this coat at all that day, but will not swear it—I did not see it—I did not go close to it and see the breast pocket—I am rather nervous now—when I went to hear him examined I hardly knew I had been on with him on the 1st of Feb.—I went because I felt an anxiety about his being locked up—I never thought anything about the letter being in his coat pocket—after I was examined I tried to recollect all I could about the letter—I recollected some<lb/>thing about speaking to him about a letter before I was out of the Court that day, but not sufficient to go and speak confidently—I considered the matter over, made myself confident, and went to Mr. Peacock next day—I spoke to Mr. Cole first—the words "clerical secretary" on the letter were as plain on the 16th of March as on the next day, but I had been on many different walks since I told the prisoner it was not in our walk at all, and he said, "I will take it; I am going that way, "but I did not think of that on the 16th of March—on my oath that conversation did occur—there might have been thirty men present is the office—the room is nearly as long as this Court, and rather narrow—there were men near to me at the time I was sorting the letter, but there is great noise and confusion there—they are all calling out and asking questions of one another—the check was for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.2<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, drawn by G.

                  </hi> I am a timber-merchant, in partnership with three others, at Waterloo-bridge-wharf, Bridge-road, Lambeth. on the 27th of Feb. the prisoner came and purchased some deals—I had seen Froud some years before, but knew nothing of him—I went into the counting-house to make out the invoice, which was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which I was requested to do in in the name of Williamson—I did so, and he tendered me this check—I gave him. 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi> out of it—it is signed "Charles Kinnear"—I asked him for his address—he wrote on the back of the check." I. Williamson, No. 10, Mar<lb/>garet-street, Cavendish-square"—Froud was present, saw the check tendered, and saw Williamson write the address—I do not know that he could see what he wrote—he was quite near enough to see what was going on—he did not read the check—I paid it into my banker's, and had it returned, as forged—on the Tuesday following I went to Williamson's address, found that no such person lived there, and gave the check to the officer at Bow-street—I read what was on the back of it while Froud was there—I did not read it aloud—I put no question to Williamson afterwards—nobody else was present.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 2, Whitmore-street, Whitmore-road, in the parish of Shoreditch; the house belongs to a man named Osborn; I occupy the first floor; I rent it under the prisoner; he occupies the lower part with his wife and children. On the 5th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came home with three men—I had just got to bed, and one of his friends came and called me—I partly dressed myself, went down stairs, and found the prisoner in company with three men, his wife, and an<lb/>other woman—I took some beer with them in his part of the house—I re<lb/>mained with them about an hour—the prisoner and Mr. Clarke were quarrelling—when I left I said I would go to bed—after I had been in bed about a quarter of an hour the prisoner called to me to come down—I did not answer him—he called again, and said if I did not come down he would set the d— —d house on fire—I said nothing—in a short time he called out to me from the foot of the stairs for a drop of water—I immediately got up,</p>

               <p>opened my door, and the suffocations from the smoke was so great that I could hardly get down stairs—when I went up stairs every body was gone but the prisoner, Clarke, and Clarke's wife—I only left three persons below—they were at the front door—the prisoner's wife was on the staircase, the prisoner stood inside the passage, and Clarke and his wife outside in the act of going—when they were gone there was nobody there but the prisoner—when I got down stairs I found the prisoner in the passage—I opened the street door, and called, "police! fire!"—a policeman came directly—I told him what had happened—he came in, and I gave the prisoner in charge—the fire was ex<lb/>tinguished with water by some men who stood there—I found part of the floor of the front parlour was burnt—it was on fire when I saw it—the wood<lb/>work was not burnt a great deal—a deal box, which stood on the floor close to the bed, was scorched—those were the only places which seemed to have been fired—the prisoner told the policeman he did not intend to set the house on fire—I could perceive from his manner that he had been drinking.</p>

               <p>me, and ran off in different directions—I can swear to Ragan positively, but not to Mara—he is much about the height of the other person—I had not a chance to see his face—when they had gone, my brother spoke to me—I looked at my watch-guard, and found it hanging down on my right breast, and my watch was gone—I am clearly confident it was in my pocket at the time Ragan took hold of me round the neck, and when he let loose his arms, it was gone—I and my brother, and somebody else, followed a little way, but my brother was not the nearest one to Ragan—the watch has not been found.</p>

                  </hi> I am the brother of the last witness, and live with him in Pancras-street—I am working as a smith, at Watford. On Sunday evening, 28th Feb., about twelve o'clock, I was standing with my brother at the corner of Museum-street, in Holborn—we were talking together about our own matter, and the two prisoners came up, along with another one—Ragan threw his arms round my brother's neck, and held him fast, and Mara put his arms round them both, and pushed up against them against a door—I took hold of Ragan by the shoulders, and told him not to kick up a <hi rend="italic">raw</hi> there—in a few seconds he let go, and they all three stood about two or three yards apart from us—I looked at my brother, and noticed his guard hanging out of his pocket, and said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> your watch is gone"—I have no doubt the prisoners could hear that—the guard was hanging out of one the button-holes—hecarried his watch in his waistcoat-pocket—I noticed that the watch was gone at the time I said so—the moment I said so, they all ran away, each a separate way—I am quite sure Ragan is the man who did what I have said, and I am positive Mara was the man I them saw—we had been in a public-house about an hour and a half before, and Mara was there—I am sure I saw him there—I should not have noticed him so much when this occurred, ex<lb/>cept that I had seen him before—I made a remark to my brother—it was in consequence of seeing him before, that I am quite certain he is the man—we ran after them down Drury-lane, and John Williams stopped Ragan—Mara was not taken till the next Saturday night, and I did not see him till about ten days after, because I was out of town—I then walked into the waiting-room at Bow-street station-house, and picked him out of, I should say, twenty or twenty-five people—I recognized him the moment I saw him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live in Bridge-place, City-road—the prisoner was in my service for about six weeks. On the 22nd of March I ordered him to go to market with the cart for my father—he came up to the door, and I ordered him to take a side of beef to the cart—he had got the straw up in one corner of the cart, and I wanted it put about the cart—I went to it, and saw this bundle—I said, "What is this?"—he said, "My dirty clothes"—I looked at it, and found it was some fat of mine—he had no business with it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a coal-whipper, and live in Queen Anne-street, Whitechapel-road—the prisoner, Charles, is my first cousin—the prisoner, Ann, is his wife—I live at No. 19, and they at No. 21—my father lives with me. On the 12th of Feb., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was in bed—I was awoke out of my sleep by a knocking at my window—I heard the prisoner Charles say he would have my wife's life—my wife was down stairs—she had not been to bed at all—I got up—looked out at the window, and saw him and his wife in the street—I got up, went down into the street, and said I would get a policeman—the prisoner Ann flew at me, and I hit her—I saw the prisoner Charles go into his house and fetch out a poker—he came towards me, flourishing it at me—he got close to me, and hit me on the left shoulder—my father came out, and seized him round the arms—I did the same—we threw him on the ground—I told my father to go and get a policeman—he did so, while I was holding him on the ground—Catherine Hurley wrenched the poker out of his hand, and Ann came behind me and struck me on the head with another poker—I turned round, and saw her throw the poker away—I was smothered in blood—I took the poker up, and gave it to Catherine—a policeman came up, and took Charles—Ann went towards her own door—she hit me again on the nose with her fist in the presence of the policeman—I</p>

On 21st March, about one o'clock in the night, I was going home along Oxford-street, and saw a female twelve or eighteen yards before me—when I got opposite Dean-street a man took hold of me, and pinioned my arms behind me—the female who was in front of me then turned back, and attempted to search my pocket—two or three men came up—I saw one on my right, one on my left, and, I think, one or two behind me—they searched my waistcoat and side pockets—I felt the women's hands about me, but am not certain they were in my pocket, but some of the men had their hands in my pocket—the prisoner Higgins is the women, and Wynn is the man I saw on my right side I am certain—after hustling my pockets, as they could not succeed in getting their hands into my pocket at first, I was struck in the face—I cannot say whether Wynn struck me—Higgins did not—they all went away towards St. Giles's—I was getting up off the ground, having been thrown down by the party who were searching my pockets—some of the party came back and kicked me—I believe it was the male prisoner—he said "The old b—, you have plenty of money, and we will have some of it"—I will not swear it was him—I am sure he was one of the three men—he did not search me then—I afterwards gave information to the police, went with the police<lb/>man to a house in Church-lane, and picked out the prisoners as two of the party—Wynn was in the house, Higgins came up stairs afterwards, and I identified her—I was taken to the hospital, and then I missed three keys, ✗ pencil, and some halfpence—my pocket was gone—I had been at the Mischief public-house, in Oxford-street, the evening before, and saw Wynn at the front of the bar—I am certain of him—the pocket produced is mine.</p>

I missed a waistcoat from the chest, which induced me to look further, and the other articles were gone—the chest had been opened by a false key, and the writing-desk, which was in the chest, was broken open—the prisoner was at work at the house as a painter—there was a coat, which was the top thing in the box, and I found that had finger marks of white paint, and over that a piece of brown paper, with paint on it, as if somebody had been at the chest.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner Gayton has lodged at my house about seven months, as a single man—I do not know the female—on 23rd March, I was awoke about two o'clock in the morning, by a disturbance in the house, and being called by name by one of the lodgers—I got up, and found the noise was in Gayton's room—he had come home after I went to bed—I had heard him go up stairs a few minutes before, with somebody—I went to the room door and heard a female's voice, and asked Gayton to turn the women out, and to be quiet—he refused—they were evidently quarrelling—I said, "Then I shall go and fetch a policeman"—he said, "Very well"—I got a policeman, who went up and demanded ad<lb/>mittance—Gayton refused to open the door—at that time they were quarrelling as before, but I could distinguish no words—the policeman put his knee to the door and forced it open—when he got in, Gayton struck him—he had not been in the room above two or three minutes—when I went up stairs, King, the policeman, was struck—I went down and fetched Lumb, another policeman—he went up first—when I got up he had hold of Gayton—I saw the woman throttle Lumb, and in the act of striking him—Gayton was struggling with him—I went down and sent another policeman up, but I did not go up again.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private watchman in Wellington-street, Upper-street, Islington. On the 22d of March, at twenty minutes to four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty there, and saw the prisoner Stevens—I asked him his business—he said he wished to go to the Angel at Islington—he trembled very much, and seemed distressed for breath—one of his coat pockets looked rather bulky—I asked him what he had got about him, and said I should like to search him—he said I might if I thought proper—I did so and took two table and three tea-spoons out of his pocket, wrapped in a hand<lb/>kerchief—they were silver—I asked where he got them—he said he picked them up in the street just before he came there—I took him to the station—he was searched, and two salt-spoons and other property found on him—he had a pair of boots on—he was asked by Inspector Thatcher whether he found the boots as well as the other property—he said, no, they were his own, that he bought them with his own money.</p>

On or about the 12th of Feb. the prisoner came to my house—I left her in the kitchen—I was—away for about two minutes, then came back, and missed a silver watch, a guard-chain, key, and black ribbon—the prisoner was gone—she had given me her address, "Mr. Smith, Elder-walk, Back-road, Islington, opposite Cross-street"—I went there with a policeman, and found she did not live there—I gave infor<lb/>mation at Bagnige-well station—not two minutes elapsed between my seeing my watch safe and missing it—I am positive no one but the prisoner could have taken it; no one else had been in the room.</p>

I bought him back to the prosecutor—I found on him fourpence halfpenny in copper, two duplicates, and one affidavit—as I was pursuing him, I heard money drop from his person, which sounded like a half-crown—I did not look over the place where the prosecutor was—he was in Gray's-Inn-lane when I took the prisoner back—it was in Fox-court that I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together—there was a lamp ten or fifteen yards from the place—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man that got off the prosecutor—I lost sight of him in turning the corner of Gray's Inn-lane—he ran towards the front door of the public-house—he could not get in at the side-door—I pursued him to the side-door to prevent his coming in at the front.</p>

               <p>this money had not been paid—I did not give the prisoner into custody on this charge—a person named Cross did—I never charged the prisoner with receiv<lb/>ing this money before he was given into custody—he was not accounted for the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> which is the subject of this indictment, and for many other sums as well—I never said to him, "Have you received this money from Mr. Horsnaill?"—he never said to me in words, or by letter that he had not re<lb/>ceived it—he received between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of my money—he was in the habit of paying his expenses out of the money he received on his journey—he furnished me with a statement of the monies he received from my cus<lb/>tomers early in Oct.—he has complained that I did not execute the orders he got, but he complained without cause—I believe all the customers in the country were his own connexion that he brought to me—here is the account he rendered to me in the beginning of Oct.—it consists of various items—the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> from Mr. Horsnaill does not appear in it.</p>

On the evening of the 31st March, I was outside the shop—I saw the prisoner come and look at the things in the shop—she went on to the coffee-shop next door, and looked in at the window—I saw that she watched me, and I watched her—some one came and stood between me and the prisoner—she directly lifted up her apron and let it fall over this looking-glass—she took up her apron and the glass, and walked away—I stopped her, and asked what she was going to do with the glass—she said she had not got it—I took hold of it from under her apron—she pulled it, and I let it go—I thought it might be broken—she put it down behind her, and said she had not had it.</p>

On the evening of the the 22nd of March, I saw both the prisoners—when I first saw Doyle he was standing by Chaplin and Horn's van, about the centre of the departure-platform, about six o'clock—I saw him again in about a quarter of an hour—he was coming out of the well where the carriers vans are which bring goods to go by the down-trains—he had this parcel under his arm—I asked him where he got it from—he said, Pickford's—I asked him who gave it him—he said, "A gentleman with a green coat on"—I said he must come with me to see whether he got it honestly or not—a porter from Chaplin and Horne's was taking off the things—he came and identified the parcel—I went to Pickford's in consequence of what Doyle said, and then to Chaplin and Horne's, but could not find the person who gave it him.</p>

                  </hi> Jun. I live at Bromley, Middlesex; my father is a blacksmith. On the 25th March, at five o'clock in the morning, I left home to go to Mr. Tucker's, at West Ham—a boy named Mills was with me—when I got within half-a-mile of the premises, I saw the prisoner, and two more, standing just against a stile—I had a bundle containing some bread, mea✗, butter, and coffee—as I passed the prisoner they all moved on one side—the prisoner took hold of me, took the handkerchief and victuals, and ran away with it—I told my mother when I got home—the prisoner was afterwards taken.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road. On the 30th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was at a public-house at the corner of Cornwall-road—the two prisoners were there, and I treated them—I left the house—the prisoners followed me, and Slaney at<lb/>tempted to get up a fight in the street with another woman, who went away—this caused a confusion, and I asked a policeman to make way for me to pass—he made answer, and said, "I think you had better get home as fast as you can"—I accordingly got away as well as I could, and went into Mr. Fry's, another public-house, and by the time I got in, Slaney and another female had also got in—the policeman was also in, and he attempted to shut the door against a mob of people, one of whom was M' Lean, who was so determined to make an entrance into the house that the policeman could not keep the door closed—I went forwards to assist him to do so, but M' Lean effected an entrance—I laid my hand on his collar, and asked him what was the reason he followed me so pertinaciously into the house—we had a sort of scuffle, and went into a side-parlour—Slaney followed, and while I had my hand on M' Lean's shoulder I lost my watch, but I was not aware I had lost it till I heard a female witness, who is here, exclaim, "The gentleman has lost his watch"—the policeman immediately afterwards asked me if I had lost anything—I said, "Yes, my watch"—he said, "Is this it, sir?"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I do not know who it was took it—I know it was taken the moment after I got into Mr. Fry's house—M' Lean was before me, and Slaney at my back.</p>

                  </hi> I live in New-street, Webber-street. About quarter-past nine, or half-past nine, that morning the prosecutor came into Mr. Fry's, the Cobourg Arms—he came into the bar-parlour, and asked to be allowed to sit there to get away from Slaney, who was following him—during that time the policeman came in and tried to prevent the mob from coming in—M' Lean</p>

               <p>endeavoured to force himself in, and he got one arm and one leg in—he forced himself in with a number of other persons, and the prosecutor went into the little parlour; M'Lean followed him in, and Slaney directly made a grasp at the prosecutor's breast and took his watch—M'Lean was behind him—just as Slaney took his watch M'Lean put his hand on his shoulder, and went back on the chair—I had seen the prosecutor before, and I said "Don't take his pin"—I said to him, "Where is your pin?" and he said "Where is my watch?"—I said, "Slaney took it, and the officer has got it"—I thought M'Lean put his hand to take his pin—he pulled him back, and the chair took him and prevented his falling—the prosecutor said a few minutes after<lb/>ward that he had not lost his pin—the policeman took the remainder of the guard form the prosecutor's neck.</p>
