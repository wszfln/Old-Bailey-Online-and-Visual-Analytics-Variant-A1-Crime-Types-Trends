                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father and brothers as diamond merchants and manufacturing jewellers, at 15 and 16, Brewer Street, Golden Square, under the style of Drayson &amp; Son—I have known Montague Goldsmith for some considerable time; prior to certain trans<lb/>actions with me I had known him as being in the employ of Mr. Harry Emanuel, and other large jewellers—I first became acquainted with Michael Goldsmith about two years ago—I know nothing of Lewis—I have seen Rebecca twice at 66, Conduit Street-Montague Goldsmith carried on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050004"/>
               <p>business there, and Michael assisted him—the first transaction I had with Montague was about two and a half years ago, in October, 1870—down to April, 1872, the transactions between us had not been of a very extensive character—I let him have goods on approbation to show to customers—I would let him have sundry articles to show to customers, and if he sold one or more of them they were charged to him—sometimes they were sold to a specific customer, and sometimes merely on a statement that he wanted goods to show to a, customer—I fixed the price—they were all marked—when a sale was effected I was to be informed of it, and we invoiced it to him; if not sold it was returned—there was no limit within which goods given to him on approbation were to be returned—no limit was absolutely fixed—it was not to pass into his stock except in particular cases—he had no authority from me to sell at a lower price than that which I fixed—in April last year the transactions between us began to increase—up to that time he had paid me by bills and cash—in April, 1872, Montague Gold<lb/>smith gave me a reason for increasing the transactions between us—he told me that he was related to Sir Benjamin Phillips, who had promised to give him some introductions to rich people—I have my books here—during the year 1872 I continued letting him have goods on approbation—some portion of those goods were charged to him, as I have described, and other portions were left in his hands—about the 18th or 19th of December last year I received some communication from Messrs. Charman—in consequence of that information I instituted certain inquiries in reference to the property I had handed to Montague—at that time I had let him have articles of jewellery on approbation to the amount of 6, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those were goods that had been invoiced—he had also a number of goods, still in the appro<lb/>bation book, to the amount of about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is an approbation book as well—when goods were first handed to him they were entered in the approbation book—the approbation book will show when the goods went out of our premises to him—if a sale was effected, and he informed me of it, it would go into the journal first, and then to the ledger—I have the journal here—Montague Goldsmith had already started in business when we first supplied him—the first transaction with him was on the 12th April, when he had eight scarf pins on approbation—I did not make the entry, my clerk did, my cousin, Alfred Drayson—I have no recollection of the transaction—the first transaction that I recollect was on 15th October, 1872; that was a butterfly brooch in brilliants, that he had for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entry is not my writing, my cousin made that, and nearly all the entries in this book; it was his duty to make entries both in the approbation book and the ledger, under my instructions—I find in the ledger that that butter<lb/>fly brooch is charged to Montague on 23rd of that month—at the time he got that he said that he hoped to sell it to Sir Walter Riddell—he made a statement to me, upon which I debited him with the amount—I have not been paid for it—the diamonds of which it was composed have been returned to me by Mr. Whitfield—the next item charged to him is a pearl necklace, worth 3, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 31st October—he said he thought it would suit a cus<lb/>tomer he had—he brought it back to me two or three times, and eventually he told me he had sold it to Alderman Truscott—he made a statement which induced me to debit him with it—at first it was brought back to me every evening—I said it was such a valuable article, and it was safer in our house, as we had persons always on the premises—before it was represented to me as being sold, he kept it for three or four days, telling me that he could</p>

               <p>only see his customer very early in the morning or late in the evening, when our premises were closed—he then mentioned the customer's name—he had it in his possession for about three days before it was charged to him—it was charged to him on 31st October—it has been returned to me since—I got it from Mr. Hennell, a diamond merchant, of Southampton Street, Bloomsbury—that was after these proceedings—on 6th November Mon<lb/>tague Goldsmith came and selected jewellery to the amount of about 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some he selected, and some of it was out on approbation elsewhere, and we sent it to him—he said that he was going to show them to Sir Anthony Rothschild, who was about having a wedding in his family—he said the house was at Gunnersbury—of the jewellery that he then selected he after<lb/>wards returned to me something like 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—among the articles he returned were a brilliant bracelet, an emerald bracelet, some emerald ear<lb/>rings, a brilliant locket, a brilliant head ornament, a ruby and brilliant ear<lb/>ring, an emerald ring, and a sapphire and brilliant ring—they were all obtained within a day or two of the same time; some were delivered to him at the time—the price of the bracelet was 1, 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the emerald bracelet, 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the set of emerald ear-rings, 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a pearl locket, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a bril<lb/>liant head ornament, 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the ruby and brilliant ring, 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not had at the same time; I sent it in consequence of the state<lb/>ment; I did not send it myself, my cousin did, and also the emerald and brilliant ring, and the sapphire and brilliant ring—in reference to the bracelet for 1, 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he mentioned the name of Sir Sills Gibbons, and he showed me two bills of exchange; he handed one to me; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them; they are for 975<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—(<hi rend="italic">these were drawn on</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">by Montague Goldsmith, at six and four months, and purported to be accepted by Sir Sills John Gibbons</hi>)—I don't recollect Michael coming to me about any of these articles—they were charged to Montague Goldsmith—among others, the brilliant bracelet—that is the only one out of the lot that was charged—down to the beginning of December Michael often used to come for goods—I could not particularise which—he would come and ask for goods—I understood they were for his brother—I under<lb/>stood that he was assisting his brother in business—he said he was assistant to his brother—about the beginning of December, Montague Goldsmith came to me, and wanted some drawings made for bridesmaids' lockets for a wedding—he said it was a wedding in the Pakenham family; that a Colonel Pakenham and a Captain Pakenham were going to be married, two brothers—he said there would be two or three expensive presents made, and would I let him have a few things to show—in consequence of what he said to me drawings were made—he called, and the drawings were handed to him—he said he would take them and show them to the parties, and he did take them—he brought them back—he said they were approved of, and gave me the order to make the lockets—there was a mistake in one drawing, in one of the initial letters—that order was put in hand—I think eleven lockets were made—this memorandum is in Montague's handwriting, I believe—"Colonel Thomas Pakenham—bride, Jane Louisa Fitzolarence—Captain C. Douglas Pakenham—bride, Mary Helen Scott—bridesmaids' lockets, Henrietta Fitzclarence, Julia Emma and Annie Fitzclarence, Louisa Scott, Elizabeth Scott, Jane Julia and Maria Scott"—that is the paper that relates to the lockets, this other paper he brought with him—I should say it was in the same writing—he said he thought what he had written on this paper was what would be given as presents to each bride—he asked me if I had such</p>

Emanuels is a house with which we do a good deal of business—when I send them goods I send an approbation note of them, and if they find customers they are invoiced to them, they are not invoiced to them at first—that is our way of dealing, and they pay us sometimes in bills and sometimes in cash—my father and brother are my partners—I began the dealings with Montague—my father is scarcely ever in the business—I treated Montague as the principal—the goods were entered to him in the ledger account—it was simply put in the approbation book "Goldsmith"—</p>

I received from Goldsmith includes all, from the commencement of my dealings with him from October, 1870—the greater part of that 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted of bills which were met—the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes everything that was paid; it does not include the bills that were dishonoured—I received back the necklace from Mr. Hennell some time in January—during this inquiry we threatened him with an action to recover it, and he was also summoned as a witness to the Police Court—he then brought it to us, and gave it up, and said he would not have any more trouble about it.</p>

               <p>was entering the goods on a piece of paper which I had brought—they had not to sign that paper—nothing was said to Rebecca, or in her presence, as to what they were brought for—I believe they asked about the price of one of the articles, casually, in the course of conversation—I left the goods when Montague and Michael came in, and among them were the articles stolen—they were left on 4th November, and about two or three days afterwards I went there for two or three articles which I wanted, and I asked him to make a return of the things he had, the brilliant head ornament and the bracelet specifically—he said that they were out at a customer's—I frequently spoke to Michael about them—I enquired for them four or five times, and he always told me that they were out at a customer's—the last enquiry I made was within a day or two of the explosion of the affair, about the middle of December—I also enquired of Michael about other goods which had been left, and he used always to say if he could not give them to me that they were out at some customer's—on 14th November a diamond cross was charged, I believe it was on Michael's statement, but I cannot remember sufficiently; my cousin has that diamond cross in Court—it was sent on 22nd October, and charged on 14th November—either I or my cousin have seen all these other articles—on 7th November a bracelet, value 420<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was had on approbation, and it is charged on the 16th on Montague's statement—I have since seen it in the hands of Richardson, in pawn—I called many times to make enquiries about it, and generally saw Montague; I don't think I saw Michael about that—on 7th December, Montague came to Brewer Street about a diamond star and some earrings—I told him that they had been standing some time, and I desired to clear them—he said "Those two are sold"—I wrote a memorandum at that time in consequence of what he said, namely, that Michael knew to whom they were sold—I addressed the memorandum to the firm, it is, "Dear Sirs; Please give bearer the diamond earrings, "giving the numbers, "as we have a good chance. Alfred Drayson and Sons, "on the back of which Montague wrote, "Dear Mike: I think you will find the earrings are sold to Lady Truscott or somebody else, if so, please say. "That was sent by a messenger, and this answer was returned, which is I believe in Michael's writing, but they write so much alike I cannot say—it says, "Dear Sir: The earrings (giving the numbers) sold, yours truly, Montague Goldsmith"—Montague was not at my place when I went back—I frequently received letters from them both, which, whether they came from one or the other, were signed "Mon<lb/>tague Goldsmith"—In consequence of that statement, I charged those ear<lb/>rings—I have since seen them produced by a pawnbroker during this enquiry—on 7th November a pair of brilliant three-drop earrings were had on approbation—I don't remember taking them; I went to enquire after them, and I believe I saw Montague—after the goods had been sent for the wedding, Montague called in Brewer Street—I did not deliver them, I sent them by a porter to Conduit Street—I saw the black pearls when they were brought back again to have a head ornament made to match—Michael came down about them one morning about 9th December, and said that the customer was coming to his place to see them with the lady to whom they were to be given, and he wanted them to show them—I said "We cannot very well spare them, the case is going to be re-lined, "but I let him have them, and never saw them again; that was about a week before the catastrophe—I have since seen those black pearls in pawn—about 27th November, Michael came and I let him have about a dozen rings, which</p>

               <p>were all returned but one, which stood open on approbation till the affair exploded, and I hare since seen it in the hands of a pawnbroker—Montague also asked me for a collet necklace, value 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me he wanted it for a customer in the country—when I gave it to him, he said that that was about the thing, and it was sent in a parcel to Conduit Street—I have since seen it in the hands of the pawnbroker—that is not charged, it is still on approbation—when this affair became known I went and received about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Worth of property from Conduit Street—I saw Michael, and said that we were going to take stock, and I should like him to clear up as near as he could all the goods he had had on approbation—I saw one book at that time, but did not see the inside of it to see whether it was a ledger—on 9th October, 1871, a ruby, emerald, and brilliant ring, No.155, was had on approbation; it has never been charged—I conversed with Michael about it about July, 1872, who told me it was with a customer in the City—I have since seen it in the pawnbroker's possession—I did not knew that any of these things were sent to the pawnbroker's, but afterwards I went to Liverpool, and saw Mr. Whitfield, who handed me two duplicates and some diamonds, some of which formed part of the butterfly brooch—he also gave me the centre stone of the diamond, ruby, and emerald ring, which has been spoken of—I can say that this stone formed part of that ring—I have seen the other two stones elsewhere—they constituted the ring—I took the tickets that were handed to me by Whitfield, and have been to the pawn<lb/>broker's and seen our goods—one ticket relates to a brilliant French brace<lb/>let, value 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was sent on approbation about May, 1872—a brilliant half-hoop ring, sent on approbation on 14th September, 1872, value 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is a mistake, it should be a ring of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is not the one re<lb/>turned by Whitfield—the ring pawned at Rowley's, in Ledbury Road, was a brilliant half-hoop ring, value 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was sent on April 20th, 1871, and was charged later on the same day, on the representation that it was sold.</p>

Charman do a very large business with the chief west-end jewellers—it is all approbation business—I can't tell how much they have out at the present time, at times to a very large amount—when an article was kept Montague said, "Charge it, and send an invoice"—I never enquired who his customers were—it was not my business to do so—we received cash 1, 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one was on a bill for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—for the balance, 6, 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we only hold Montague Goldsmith's acceptances—on the occasion that I saw Michael, he said the goods were at a customer's, and he could not disturb them, he said his brother Montague was out—he has also told me that on other occasions, and it was in consequence of that that I called again and saw Montague, when he was at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant and jeweller, of 4, Beak Street—I have known Montague Goldsmith for some time as assistant in various jewellers' shops at the West-end, Emanuel's, and one or two others; they were customers of mine, and I knew him in that way—about April, 1872, my son met Michael Goldsmith, and about that time we commenced business with them—the first transaction was through my son; it was a diamond bracelet, 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—an acceptance was given for that, which was paid—from that time until 17th December I continually sent them goods through the medium of Mr. Harris, and sometimes myself—I don't recollect the exact amount of goods sent on approbation, and afterwards charged for—it was quite 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and additional goods sent on approbation, making a total of 9, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during that time I received cash to the amount of 1, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the bill that was taken up—1,965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, was the exact amount, or probably it may have been less 5 per cent—Mr. Harris, my assistant, supplied the goods—on 5th December Montague Gold<lb/>smith said that he wanted a diamond suite and a pearl suite, as there was a double wedding in a family that he was doing business with, and he wanted them to show—he selected the diamonds and pearls that Mr. Harris has mentioned and took them away, to the amount of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—we afterwards got a portion back, the residue being 3, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th December I received a communication from Mr. Flower, the assistant to Messrs. Ortner &amp; Houle, jewellers, in St. James's Street—I think my jewellery is pretty well known in the trade, and it was in consequence of that that the communication was made to me—it was with respect to a pearl bracelet, which was one of the articles for the double wedding—in consequence of what Mr. Flower told me I went the following morning to Goldsmith's place, in Conduit Street, and there saw Montague, together with Michael—I said I wished to have some of the goods that he had or they bad on approbation—Montague said he was very sorry he could not let me have them, indeed, I think he commenced the conversation by saying he was sorry he could not let me have the goods that had been applied for, they were out on approbation with his lady customer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050015"/>
               <p>—he said he had an appointment at 11.30 to sea the lady for her final decision—he said the appointment was in Portman Square; referring to the Directory, he said it was at 40, Portman Square, and the name was Lady Pakenham—he said she was the customer of whom he had spoken—I told him I should like to go with him to Lady Pakenham's to get the reply, and I did go—he did not seem to know anything about the place—the street was up, and he told the cabman to drive on the other side of the square to No.40—we drove all round the square; ultimately, on finding No.40, it was shut up, the steps were uncleaned, and the place looked entirely as if the family was out of town—he made inquiry for Lady Pakenham, for Colonel Pakenham, and Captain Pakenham, the secretary, and a great many more; but we could not find anybody—I then told him what I thought, that it was a gigantic swindle, and I pushed him into the cab—we went to my office and I sent for my solicitor, and subsequently we went to Conduit Street—I there saw Michael, and in his presence I desired to see the books, and they showed me these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the smaller book is the ledger; it was not then in the state it is now—it called forth a remark from me that I did not think they had ever done a single shilling's worth of genuine business in their lives—and that was the then appearance of the books—this book has been un<lb/>doubtedly added to since—nothing has been scratched out or taken out that I can see, but it has been added to; something has been written in—at that time there was no appearance of business—I did not then remark any ledger account between me and them; I am not sure that I have seen one since, I think I have—there was an approbation book shown to me, a book with the items in it that were supposed to be with customers, and so on—I think this is it, I don't know—after the books were shown to me I said it was a very unsatisfactory matter as far as the books were concerned—he said he could give an explanation, but he failed to satisfy me, and I asked for security pending the explanation that was to be given—he said he had not anything except the bills he had received in payment for the goods he had sold—I desired to see them, and he then asked Michael to get them out of the safe, and he brought them out in an envelope, and gave me bills representing in amount 9, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Michael gave them to Montague, and Montague gave them to me—they are the bills that have been pro<lb/>duced and pronounced to be forgeries; there was not a single genuine bill among them—there was a bill book, it is here—the bills were called out and checked by the bill book by Michael, here are the ticks; Montague then endorsed them and handed them to me—that was the last I saw of Montague; I have endeavoured to find him, and instructed the officers to do so; I took out a warrant against him directly I discovered that the bills were forgeries—that was on 19th December, I think, the day after I discovered the pearl bracelet—on the 23rd I saw Michael and his father, and Michael then handed me some duplicates and pawnbroker's contract notes affecting my jewellery; there were a good many, some applying to my goods, and some to Drayton's, and some to persons that I don't know—he said his sister had given them to him; he did not specify the sister; I gave the parcel to Drayson's, and they selected what they chose from it—the father said "If you will go to Colville Terrace and see my daughter, she is the only person who can give an explanation regarding this matter"—on the following morning I met the elder Goldsmith at the Great Western Terminus, and ultimately went to Colville Terrace—I there saw Rebecca—Michael was present, and her father and mother—the father introduced</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I have been in business 23 years—I am a judge of jewellery to a certain extent, but my business is not confined to jewellery alone, it is a portion of my business, but not heavy diamond goods; the centre-stones are the principal, and what the market price is at present you can hardly get at, for since the discovery of the Cape diamonds they fluctuate very much, particularly at that time; I was not able to give my own opinion, therefore I went to one of the largest houses in London, Messrs. Catchpool, Hill, and Williams, of Oxford Street-Mr. Hill valued the earrings at 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so perhaps you may place them down as worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you had to replace them in the market—diamonds fluctuate some<lb/>times 10, 15, or 20 per cent.; about that—I cannot retain the value of the bracelet in my memory—Mr. Waylett, I think, gave a very fair price, and I got a very small profit, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with which I was satisfied; the earrings were decidedly not of the value of 575<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is undoubtedly an extravagant price—the value of these things depends a great deal on the fashion and the water; they fetch more in the height of the season than in the dull time of the year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, carrying on business at 8, Wigmore Street—I first saw Rebecca Goldsmith in October last year—the first transaction was in respect of a pair of diamond earrings—she introduced herself as a cousin of Sir Francis Goldsmith, and knowing that family to be a wealthy family, of course I bought them of her—she said that her mother had a great quantity of valuable jewels left her by her father, who was dead, and that she anticipated she should be obliged to dispose of them—I gave her about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the earrings, as far as my memory serves me—I afterwards sold them to Mr. Attenborough, of Duke Street, Manchester Square, for about 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about a week or ten days after the transaction with the earrings, she came again, and brought a necklace—there was some conversation then about her being married; it was addressed more to my wife than myself—I said, under the circumstances, I could not think of buying anything more unless she gave me a reference as to her respectability—I asked if she could give me a banker, or any person that knew her, and she said she would write me a note, enclosing a reference; and true enough, on the same evening, a card came with a reference, in consequence of which I went to 199, Portobello Road, and saw Dr. Pickett—on the following day she called with the necklace—she left it for me to show to some persons, better judges than myself, and I purchased it that same day for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it had five stones, and a little ornament, joined together—the stones were diamonds, as near as I can recollect; but I really don't recollect very well—I afterwards sold it to Mr. Hill, of the firm of Catchpool &amp; Williams, Oxford Street—on 9th December I purchased a diamond aigrette of her for 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—she introduced it as pars of the property belonging to her mother—I sold the brooch portion of that aigrette to Robert Attenborough, of Duke Street, and the remaining portion of it to Richard Attenborough, of Oxford Street, for 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively—I also purchased from her a diamond collet bracelet for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sold that to Mr. Hennell, of 4, Southampton Street, for 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't recollect her making any statement about that bracelet—I can't say whether it was at that time or not that the name of Truscott was mentioned—she did mention that name to me; she said she was very likely to be married to Sir Francis Truscott—it was merely a casual conversation that was taking place between my wife and her at the time; it had nothing to do with the transaction—I think at the time this bracelet was brought she said it was to help to make up her trousseau; that she was selling jewels to raise money for the trousseau—on 6th November I purchased a pearl necklace of her for 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I sold it to Mr. Hennell for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not in my possession many hours—she left it in the morning and came in the evening—I went and got the price Mr. Hennell would give for it, submitted the price to her; if she did not wish to take it, it would have been returned—there is no record of these trans-actions in any of my books—I have no books for this sort of trade; it was merely being employed to sell things for other persons—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the top part of the aigrette that I bought, the plume.</p>

The term "false pretences" was not a term of art; it was not like a charge of receiving stolen goods, the word "stealing" having a definite meaning attached to it. The misdemeanour, by this statute, was only a misdemeanour if the goods were received under circumstances which made the obtaining of them indictable.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">See Reg. v.</hi> Mason.) 2 Term Reports, p.681.</p>

It was sufficient that they were received, if it was known that they were obtained by false pretences. The actual false pretence might not be known to the person who received, or even that the goods were obtained by false pretences from the persons to whom they belonged. The gist of the offence was the receiving, and that in itself would be an unlawful act if it be shown that the goods were obtained by false pretences, and that they knew it.

I am now out of a situation—in May last I was servant to Mr. Wells, at 17, Charing Cross—the prisoner worked there as charwoman, but I did not first become acquainted with her there; my mother knew her first—my mother has married again, and has gone to America—I told the prisoner that I expected money from America from my mother, for me and my brother and sister to go over to her—I did not know how much—I left Mr. Wells' service, and went to live at Bath—I had not then received any letter from my mother containing money—I got a letter from my mother just before Christmas, and then came up to London and saw Mr. Watts—I went with him and Chalkley, the constable, to 5, Tur-ner's Court, and saw the prisoner—she said "What is this for?"—he said "It is for the cheque you have cashed in Margaret Gleeson's name"—she said "Don't take me, because of my children"—I have seen the prisoner write, and have had several letters from her—this signature, "Margaret Gleeson, "on the front and back of this cheque is her writing—I had never seen the cheque.</p>

I live at 68, Russell Square—in March last I was a member of the firm of Merton, Hart &amp; Co., 62, Piccadilly, bankers and exchange brokers—I had formerly been on the Stock Exchange—I have known the prisoner as a stock broker for about four months—I saw him at his office in Threadneedle Street, on a Wednesday about March 26th—but previous to that my partner had made a communication to me—the 15th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050060"/>
               <p>and the 31st are the account days—I said "You hare been speaking to my partner about making you an advance on the account day"—he asked me whether I could take in any stock on the account day—I said "To what extent?"—he replied "About 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was a little conversation, which I do not exactly remember, the result of which was that I asked him to put his proposal in writing, so that I might consult my partner—he said that the stock was Turks, Eries, and Varna obligations, which are securities well known on the Stock Exchange—"to take in stock "means to make advances on stock—it is a technical term used on the Stock Exchange—we received this letter from him late on the afternoon of the 26th—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "51, Threadneedle Street, March 26th, 1873, Messrs.

W.A. Roberts.")—This is a copy of my answer, which was sent by poet in the ordinary way; "62, Piccadilly, 26th March, 1873; W.A. Roberts, Esq. Dear Sir,—We beg to inform you that we shall be prepared to advance you on the account day, till 17th April, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Erie and foreign stocks, with a margin of ten per cent. Terms on foreign securities same rate of interest as charged by your bankers, with one quarter per cent, commission; Eries, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per share, and one quarter commission; the loan renewable upon terms subject to arrangement."—After having sent that answer, I went to the prisoner's office next day and saw him—he objected to pay the quarter per cent com<lb/>mission, and said that he thought one-sixteenth was sufficient; and we ulti<lb/>mately arranged to make the advance at one-eighth commission—it was arranged that payment was to be made in the City by cash on an open cheque on the account day—on the same afternoon I received this letter from the prisoner: (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "51, Threadneedle Street, March 27th; Messrs. Merton, Hart &amp; Co. Dear Sirs,—As it is in your way, a friend of mine requires 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of French notes on Saturday or Monday; will you please get them for him, and I will pay you. Yours, W.A. Roberts.")—I under<lb/>stood that as a separate transaction from the other—next day, Friday the 28th, I saw the prisoner, I think it was in Threadneedle Street, and told him it was impossible to get the notes by Saturday—he said "If you can<lb/>not get them to-morrow, Monday will do—I did not see him on the Satur<lb/>day, but I did obtain the French notes, 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, in different amounts—he asked me to buy them, and I got them as I could—I went to the prisoner's office on Monday, the 31st, about 12 o'clock or 12.30, and he told me that if I would call about 1.30 he would give me the securities, but previous to that I had shown him a letter of hypothecation which he would have to sign—he looked at it, and made no demur to it—I called again about 1.30 or 2 o'clock for the securities, and the prisoner gave me 400 Erie shares, 3,000 Turks, of 1871, 3,000 Turks of 1868, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cents., 2,040 Spanish, and 15,000 Atlantics, Third Preferential, that means 15,000 of the shares, 15,000 dollars—each Erie share also represents a dollar—the value of the whole was 10, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I did not give him any money then—I returned to his office at 3.30 or 3.45, and requested he would go with me to my solicitor, in the Old Jewry, that he might witness the transaction—he went with me to Messrs. Abrahams &amp; Roffey, solicitors, in the Old Jewry, and signed the agreement, which we call the hypothecation—I then gave him two open cheques, one for 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the West End Branch of the National Provincial Bank, but payable in the City to Mr. W.A. Roberts, a cheque of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050061"/>
               <p>my firm; and another for 1,000, dated 31st March, payable to W.A. Roberts, Esq., at the West End Branch of the National Provincial Bank, Waterloo Place—both were payable to order, and both are endorsed by the prisoner "W.A. Roberts"—at the same time I handed him 75, 750 francs, which is 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money, corrected according to the rate of Exchange, that made up the advance of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. I paid this sum by open cheques—I cannot say that on the night of the 31st he said in substance that the reason he left the cheque about was that he wished it to appear to his clerk that he had a good balance, and had no intention whatever that the cheque should be paid in to his bankers—I do not recollect his saying that he had the cheque drawn to give an appearance of solvency to his clerk, and that his clerk had paid it in to the bankers—I understood that his clerk had paid it in by mistake—he said something about why he had left it out, but I cannot exactly say what it was—I understood him to say that the cheque was left on his desk for some pur<lb/>pose, and that his clerk had paid it in—he told me for what purpose he had left it out, but I cannot remember the words exactly—he told me in substance that he had left it there for some purpose; I know he told me the cheque had been left on the desk for some object—he said that he was in difficulties.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at Burney Street, Greenwich—on Monday night, 21st April, about 11 o'clock, I was called to see the deceased—she was in great pain all over the abdomen, with her legs drawn up, the stomach was slightly swollen and the whole of the belly, and tender on pressure—there were no external marks of violence—she was in a cold sweat—I did not examine her that night, I did not understand that she had received any</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave her opiates when I saw her, and I afterwards ordered an injection—the inflammation may have been the result of natural causes—and there was nothing within or without the subject to lead me to a different conclusion—if a kick was administered at a particular part you might have the inflammation at that spot, but in this instance it extended over the whole.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Brixton—on 9th April, about 8.45 in the evening, I was called to Mr. Simpson's house—I went there with constable Tee—I found the prisoner sitting by the side of her bed, dressed—I told her to get into bed—I then went down to the back kitchen, with the other witnesses—I found this knife, and saw spots of blood on the floor—I found the body of a female child in the copper-hole—it was perfectly black—there was no fire in the copper-hole—I did not notice that it was heated—I examined the child very cursorily, and gave it to Tee—I afterwards examined it at the station—I, should say it had not long been delivered—I found a jagged incised wound at the back of its neck, extending three parts of the surface of the neck; not externally, but internally—I consider it could have been done with this knife—it was dug in, and out; forced—the spinal cord was divided between the second and third bones of the neck, and the muscles of the back of the neck all divided—that was the cause of death—there was scarcely any blood in the body; about a teaspoonful—that was from the sudden drain on the body, caused by the wound—from my examination I considered the child had been born alive—the wound could have been given after its death—I considered it to have been born alive, from its healthy appearance, and the condition of the head upon opening it—the organs were perfectly healthy; the lungs floated when I placed them in water; that is a test—they were inflated as they might be if the child had breathed.</p>

'—he said "No, I won't go in to-night; I have got some friends, and I will go to them"—he had been drinking, but he walked quite steady, and knew very well what he was about.</p>
