                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi> last year. We sailed from Hartlepool in May to Pont de Galle—she was 508 tons burden—the defendant was the master; Robinson was the first mate, and Gibson the second—there were three apprentices on board, and one of them, Robert Eastick, was the cabin boy—I remember a boy being over<lb/>board on 18th Aug.; on that morning I was at the wheel between 8 and 10 o'clock, and the captain asked me how she was steering; I said, "Middling"—he then went down into the cabin where the boy was, and I heard him say, "What is this knife on this table?"—the boy said, "That is the knife you cut some cheese with for breakfast"—the captain said, "I did not"—the boy said, "Yes, Sir, you did," and then I heard the boy <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "Murder!" and saw him try to come up on deck—he was about two steps below the deck, and the captain caught him by his neck behind, and came on deck in front of him, and said, "Go and do your duty"—the boy said, "No, I shall not if you use me like that"—the captain then came in front of him, and caught hold of his hands while his arm was round the companion sails—his arm was rubbed on the brass, and I saw the skin coming off as he tried to loose him from the companion—the boy said, "You rascal, what are you trying to do? you are trying to break my arm</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260002"/>
               <p>and neck"—he had then hold of the companion, and said, "Hold on, some<lb/>body will take my part by and by;" and he <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "George, George, look what he is trying to do, he is trying to break my arm and neck"—I said nothing, but remained at the wheel—the captain got him loose from the companion, and gave him a kick in front of his head with his boot, and sent him down the companion into the cabin; he fell down at once—the captain was on the deck when he kicked him on the forehead—the stairs are about six feet high—about five minutes afterwards the boy came up on deck; the captain was on deck; the second mate, Mr. Gibson, was there, and the captain told him to let the boy go to his duty—the second mate said, "Go and do your duty," and the boy went down into the cabin to make some <hi rend="italic">duff</hi> for a pudding for dinner—I came from the wheel at 10 o'clock, and saw the <hi rend="italic">duff</hi> in a basin, which he gave to the cook, and complained to him of the way in which he had been treated—I saw his arm at 12 o'clock in the cook's galley; he showed it to me; the skin was off the middle of it, and it was red—in the course of that afternoon I heard a cry of a boy being overboard—I was in the forecastle; I did not see the boy, but I saw his hat in the water—it was a nice, beautiful day—we put the ship about to see if we could see him; Johnson, who was at the wheel, did that; he is not here—no orders were given by the captain when the boy went overboard—I heard the orders from the second mate to keep the ship away from the boy, to see if we could get him—there was no boat lowered; we had boats on board—no life buoy was thrown to him; there was one on board, I do not know how many—no rope was thrown to him—I heard the captain say one day, when he was flogging him with a rope's end, "You b—, I will make you rue the day you came on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>"—I have seen the captain give him a great big handspike to carry on his shoulder, weighing about 25 lbs.—he has sometimes carried it for two hours, and sometimes for four, like a musket—the last time was from 8 till half past 11 o'clock at night—I have seen that twice—I asked the boy what it was done for—I did not hear the captain say what he gave it him for—I saw the captain flog him once besides, with a rope's end about an inch and a half thick—I do not know what it was for—he was about fourteen years old, and was a handy lad.</p>

               <p>boy also at Pont de Galle, to Captain Twining—I do not know whether any inquiry was made—I joined another ship after that, and deserted from it by force—I was not <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> out of the ship—it was the <hi rend="italic">Tamar</hi>—I did not like to go in her—I lost my wages on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, and I did not like to go at the same wages, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—I went into the police at Colombo for three mouths—I sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Tamar</hi> three weeks—this was my first voyage with Captain Doyle—he refused to pay my wages on account of my insolence and neglect of duty—that was because I was frightened to lose my life—a charge, was made against me of insolence and neglect of duty—I was not afraid of my life on board the <hi rend="italic">Tamar</hi>—I told the Magistrate at Columbo that I was afraid of my life, and he was cruel enough to imprison me for three weeks after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook on board the barque <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, from Hartlepool, in May, 1856—the defendant was the captain—that was my first voyage with him—I remember the day the boy went overboard; I heard the cry of "A boy overboard!"—it was about a quarter to 4 o'clock—I had seen the captain beat the boy very severely that day in the cabin—I was in the galley, and heard the boy crying out "Murder!"—I went to the stairs, and looked down the poop, and the captain had got him, beat<lb/>ing him down in the cabin, and he kicked him with his sea boot on the arm—the chief mate was on deck, and, as he did not interfere, I did not go into the cabin, but returned to the galley to see about dinner—I did not hear any more cries then; the boy came to the galley about 12 o'clock for the captain's dinner—his arm was then black and blue, and part of it was red, with the blood ready to gush out, and he said, "Look here, how that fellow has hit me"—I had frequently seen the boy at other times going out, and made to walk the deck, like a soldier, from 8 o'clock at night till 10—I have often seen that; when he did not beat him he starved him—he beat him with a reef point, what they reef the sails with; it is a little smaller than a rope, not so stout as a rope; it has a bit of twine at the end—there was no iron eye to it—I was in the galley when I heard the cry of "A boy overboard!"—the man at the wheel <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> it out; he was a man named Johnson—John Stowe, one of the able seamen, ran forwards, and put the wheel down himself, without any order from the captain—the captain did not give any order at all—no boat was lowered, nor any rope thrown—the captain had the life buoy in his hand, and never attempted to heave it overboard—I did not see the boy's hat on the water—it was smooth water—we were going four or five knots an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, which left Hartlepool for Ceylon. I knew the lad Eastick, who was an apprentice—the defendant was the captain—I had not sailed with him before—there was also an apprentice named Lashbrooke, and another named Potter—I left the vessel through sickness at Colombo—the boy was missing before I left—I do not know how he came overboard—he was much under my eye—my berth was five yards from the captain's cabin—the boy acted as steward, and waited on the captain, and on me, and the first mate, at dinner—he was generally occupied below, and about the captain's cabin—he cleaned out my cabin, but not the chief mate's—I have never heard cries from the boy of "Murder!" or seen the captain flog or strike him—I have seen him when he has been washing himself, and he has been naked to his waist, all but his trowsers, but saw no marks on his back of ill usage—he was never off duty from sickness—hr never made any complaint to me of ill treatment on the part of the captain—I had never seen any indication that he was suffering anything—he took his meals regularly, as far as I know—he slept on the half deck—from there to my cabin is about fifteen yards—I have never known him what I call punished—I have seen the captain order him to walk the deck with a handspike or capstan bar, for negligence, or idle conduct—that is not a cruel or harsh punishment—I have known it employed on vessels—I should say one capstan bar weighs about 10 lbs., and the other about 7 lbs.—as he walked about the deck he could change the position of the capstan bar from one arm to the other—I have seen him rest at intervals when he has been walking about—as far as physical pain goes, a flogging would have been decidedly much worse than the capstan bar—I have seen other of the apprentices ordered to carry a capstan bar when they have had misconduct alleged against them—the youngest boy next to him had to do so when he had done something which he ought not—from my being close to the captain, and having the boy near me constantly, if the captain had been regularly in the habit of flogging "him, and if he had been in the regular habit of crying out "Murder!" I believe I must have heard it—the boy was missing on 19th Aug., 1856—I saw the captain holding the boy by the arm on the companion ladder that day, about 11 o'clock—the boy was standing on the second step of the companion ladder—the captain told him to go below, and clean the cabin out—he said that he would not—I was coming along to get some rope yarn, to make a sail up, and I said to the boy, "Go below"—I immediately went down, and he was in the fore cabin, but he never spoke to me, or said anything—that was all I saw of the companion ladder that day—I was afterwards in bed, and the captain <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to me as he was running up the companion ladder—I jumped up, drew on my trowsers, and there was a cry of "Some person overboard!"—I rushed on deck—the mate was there—we shortened sail, and got the ship on another tack—that was the right thing to do, and the likeliest thing to find the boy—that was done by the captain's orders—if I had been in the same position I should have done the same thing—I could not have done anything better—we got her very nicely on another tack within twenty yards—we continued about an hour looking for the boy—there were two men on the fore top-sail yards—no boat was lowered—the boat was lashed and cross lashed—it would have taken us about half an hour to lower the boats—if we had lowered them, instead of tacking, we</p>

               <p>consider that a more lenient punishment than flogging, decidedly; I have known it adopted in other vessels, and have adopted it myself—I have authority to punish boys when they require it—one capstan bar weighs 7 lbs. and the other 10 lbs.—the boy was in good health on board, he never made complaints to me—he used to wait on the captain and the second mate and me at dinner—he had access to the cooked meat, and could have helped himself to it, and would not have been blamed—my berth is about three feet from the companion—I have seen the boy washing, but saw no marks of ill-treatment on him—if he had been constantly ill-treated and screaming "Murder!" I must have known it—I know Prince Montague—I heard him make a threat against the captain after the hearing at the police court, on 19th or 20th Aug.; he was going from the ship, and I heard him say that he would have his certificate taken away and ruin him from going captain of a ship any more—George Hicks was standing close to him when he used those words—coming home we had, I think, a fortnight longer voyage than we expected—when the boy was overboard everything was done by the captain that could be done to find him; the vessel was put about immediately; a life buoy was not thrown out, but it was ready—the boats were not lowered, because we did not see the body floating; they were lashed and cross lashed, it would have taken half an hour to get them out—the steps that the captain took were the speediest that could be if the body appeared.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was yourself and two mates on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and two half-castes, born in the West Indies—there were myself, the two mates, the carpenter, a young man, and the steward—I had four Europeans to attend the helm—the mates did not take it in turn—there were three half<lb/>caste Spaniards and one Englishman, and a young man, an apprentice, who would sometimes take the wheel—when one helmsman was at work, the others would be below—the only working sailors on the deck would be the Lascars—I had twenty-four Lascars and a boy—I recollect all that was said by every witness last Session—I remember what the serang said—I remember the greater part of what the others said, all that was of much importance—I was in Court all the time the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> was being examined, when the charge was against this prisoner—I heard the other witnesses asked if they spoke to me; they said they had not—Moyadeen had not a moustache—I am confident that on leaving Bombay he had one tooth out—I am not sure that he had not more out—I cannot tell whether any of the other twenty-three men had any teeth out—there is what is called a register for seamen abroad, but it is done away with in England—there are tickets given—they are always given to me—I have not got Moyadeen's ticket here—the loss of a tooth is not a defect that would be mentioned in the ticket—I did not look over Moyadeen's ticket to see whether there was any notice of the loss of a tooth—it takes fifty days, on the average, to come from St. Helena to this country; sometimes it is longer.</p>

               <p>on some occasion, tell the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> to go to h—, would that have been on some occasion of complaint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been—I will not swear that I did not say it to the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi>, and that it was not when the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> was making some complaint, but it was not a complaint of violence—it might be some complaint that the Lascars were not doing their duty—that would not make me angry—I might say so in an angry moment, I will not swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you say, in a matter of importance, the complaint was made to yon by the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi>; would this be a matter of importance if the mate had booked a man down and kicked him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I can swear there was no tacking of the ship when we were about three weeks from St. Helena—I heard the men give a description of what they were doing—they said they were hoisting the side sail, but they were not tacking—what they were doing would make it very important that each man should do his duty in attending to the ropes; sometimes the side sail gets into the water, and would be the means of pulling down the sails—if a man failed in doing his duty, it would be a thing which the mate would be very likely to resent, and push the man away very likely—I did not observe anything different in the appearance of Moyadeen; only about the time that he says this happened, he had a very sore finger, and every morning he came to me, and I used to dress it for him—the mate told me that Moyadeen was a very saucy fellow; he told me that in the beginning when he first came on board, that he was a very saucy insolent fellow, and would not be spoken to—I do not think I punished but one of them—I ordered one of the mates to give him the rope's end—that was the only one I had punished on board—that was because on two occasions he had dropped a bucket of tar close by the side of where the ladies were standing; and the 'next thing, he went up on one of the masts, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> one down, and one came down my companion, on my drawers, and I thought I would make an example of him; and that was the reason I flogged him—the men never made a complaint against me of my beating them—the mates had no right to punish these men without apply<lb/>ing to me—I was not tried here last Sessions, it was the second mate that was tried—he gave a fellow a thump in the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Dominion.</hi> I was tried here on a charge of some brutal usage to some Lascars—I was honour<lb/>able acquitted—I shipped on board the Vessel at Bombay—I remember Moyadeen shipping as one of the Lascars—I saw him the first day he came on board—he had not his full complement of teeth—in the front of his face, on the right side, there was a deficiency—he could not speak without your perceiving it, because his teeth are very large—I did not observe on the voyage, the least difference about his face or mouth—he had a swelled face three mornings running when I was on duty, and one morning he was pulling his teeth—I asked what he was doing, and he said he had a tooth loose, he was trying to get it out—that was all he said to me; I did not notice any swelled face—I said I did not see any difference—during the whole voyage I did not see any violence committed by the chief mate toward Moyadeen—I never saw him kick him, or brutally use him—we had not occasion to tack ship when three weeks from St. Helena—we had not occa<lb/>sion to tack ship till we came to the Channel—I had not sailed with the defendant before this voyage—he was a stranger—I never saw anything im<lb/>proper</p>

               <p>in his conduct towards the crew—he was too kind—I did not, during the whole voyage, hear Moyadeen complain of having been ill-treated by Mr. Greer—I heard the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> examined here at the last trial—I did not hear him say a word about his having told the captain that the assault had been committed by Mr. Greer on Moyadeen—the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> never mentioned such a word—we had to tack ship when we got into the Channel—it was about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, off the coast of Cornwall—on that occa<lb/>sion Moyadeen was on the deck, holding one of the ropes—if the rope which he was holding were let go, it would be dangerous to the vessel, and to the other vessels besides—he let go the rope before the order was given, and Mr. Greer rushed forwards and pushed him away, and took hold of the rope—I did not see him strike him—that was off the coast of Cornwall—I never saw Mr. Greer strike Moyadeen, or pull him by the hair.</p>

Mr. Greer was very kind and humane—I never saw him guilty of any violence, only once, when one of the men let go the main sheet, and he struck him across the mouth—that was Moyadeen—Mr. Greer struck him across the mouth with the back of his hand, and took the rope which he let go—the result of letting go the rope might have been perilous, we were then amongst other vessels—I never heard from Moyadeen or the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi>, any report or rumour of complaint of violence on the part of Mr. Greer—I saw these men shipped at Bombay—when Moyadeen came on board, I noticed that he had one or more teeth out—he has got a very prominent mouth, and cannot speak without show<lb/>ing that—the tacking of the ship was about 5 o'clock in the morning——there was no tacking of the ship before that; we had a fair wind—I did not observe any difference in the appearance of Moyadeen's face during the voyage—Moyadeen can speak English a little—Mr. Greer is not connected with the vessel now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of No. 47, Mark Lane. I am acquainted with persons who are members of the Submarine Telegraph Company, Cornhill—I know Mr. Cadogan by sight—a gentleman named Sandiland, a friend of mine, is connected with the Company—about 4th Aug., I cannot recollect the day, I met the defendant, Evans, at a luncheon house, leading out of Lombard Street—I knew him before—he asked me if I had seen that correspondence in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, about the telegraph, I said that I had not—he said that it was Sir James Carmichael's letter, and that he was going to answer it, and was going to see Mr. Sampson, of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I saw him shortly after that day, either the Friday or Saturday after, I think it was Saturday, 8th—I met him accidentally at the Blackwall Rail<lb/>way Station, about 12 o'clock in the morning; I said, "Evans, I have not seen that letter of yours in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>"—he said, "I have got it in my pocket now, and I will show it to you if you will come with me "—he pro<lb/>duced it, and I read it; he said that he was going to take it to Mr. Samp<lb/>son, to see if he could recommend any alteration in it before it was pub<lb/>lished—I have known Evans two or three years, merely by seeing him is the office of the Submarine Telegraph Company when I used to go there; he was acquainted with persons connected with the Company.</p>

I have the conduct of the City news connected with the <hi rend="italic">Times newspaper</hi> On Wednesday, 5th Aug., Mr. Evans came to me with reference to a letter which had been published, from Sir James Carmichael, in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of the preceding day, that he could contro<lb/>vert</p>

               <p>the statement as far as regards the purity with which the matters of the Telegraph Company were managed; he said that he had been in the service of the Company—I asked him if he had been discharged from their service; he said, "No," and produced a letter, a testimonial, which he stated that he had received from the Company on leaving it—I then told him that I could not enter into his statement then, but that he had better put what be had to say in the form of a letter and send it to me; he said that he would do so, and there on that day the interview terminated—on Saturday, 8th, Evans called on me again, with Mr. Thorn; he then said that he had prepared the letter, and wished me to read it; I did so (it has been cut up for printing)—he said that all the statements in that letter were within his own knowledge—I said, "They may be, except in one case; you make a statement here which you cannot say is the case; you may assume it, and you may believe it, but you cannot positively know it; and if you like to put in the words, "I assume", that will meet it, but this is a very grave affair; you must be prepared to meet it, and therefore you cannot be too cautious "—I see the words, "I assume," put in here; this is the letter—I should think it was about half past 2 o'clock, at the earliest, that they came, and they were there about twenty minutes—Thorn took hardly any part in he conversation, but when I pointed out the serious character of the letter, he made a remark as if he considered that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> must judge of that; it struck me that the remark was intended to throw responsibility on the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with regard to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am by profession a barrister. I was one of the promoters of what is now the Submarine Telegraph Company—from the year 1852 down to the end of 1854, I was constantly at the offices of the Company, and for long periods, daily—at that time the arrangements were almost in embryo, and were being perpetually changed—the internal arrangements in connection with the clubs and other places, and also the Continental arrangements, had to be made—those were all made from 1852 downwards to 1854—I attended constantly at the office during those periods—the course of a message proceeding to the Continent is this: it is brought by the sender to the counter on the, ground floor, where the number of words is computed; the money is paid, and the mes<lb/>sage is taken up by a lift to the transmitting room, the instrument room; the message is then sent to its destination immediately, if there is no other message on the file previously sent up; if there are other messages to be sent by the same instrument, it is placed underneath, and is dispatched in its turn—the duty of dispatching it in its turn would attach to the superin<lb/>tendent of the room in the first place, and to the transmitting clerk at the instrument in the second place—Evans held the position, until he was discharged, of superintendent of the submarine telegraph room—he was also superintendent of another telegraph under the same roof—he was the superintendent of the room in which the submarine telegraphic messages were received and dispatched—there were a good many other clerks, all of them under him—the history of a message coming from abroad is this: it is received on and by the instrument in connection with the foreign and Continental line, or town, as the case may be, say Paris; it is received at an instrument in a room at No. 30, Cornhill; that room contains several instruments, several clerks; in the centre, the superintendent's table, and the superintendent; in one corner is the dispatch office, with a hole in the wall, or door; it is received in manifold; that is to say, the clerk reads off the message, and writes it in manifold; that is done either by the clerk at the instrument or by his assistant—as soon as the message is complete, he hands it to the superintendent sitting in the centre of the room—that is the room where Evans was superintendent; he had complete authority; he was supreme there—having been received by the superintendent, it is read by him, the words are counted by him, the message is prepared for trans<lb/>mission, and all the different formularies are arranged upon it; the hour, etc., is seen to be correct—I believe the time is inserted by the superin<lb/>tendent, but I am not sure, or by his clerk—it is inserted or checked; then it is handed to the clerk, who sits near the door—by him it is put into an envelope, and sealed; he makes some signal, either rings or knocks, I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260021"/>
               <p>know which, and he hands the message, through a trap in the door, to the boy, the next boy on the rota for taking messages—my position is inva<lb/>riably in the boardroom—that is where my desk is, and that is where I sit when I am there—unless I was in the superintendent's room, I could not by any possibility have the first access to the messages—all Government mes<lb/>sages are in cipher, except those that are upon public matters; for instance, I should think the list of killed and wounded, or the history of a battle, would not be in cipher; but, to the best of my belief, all matters of Govern<lb/>ment correspondence are in cipher, wherever it is practicable—it was not my habit to interfere with the transmission of messages, or to have one message placed before another—I have no recollection whatever of a dispatch from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to Lord Clarendon, dated Constantinople, Dec. 3rd, and Vienna, 13th, nor of the funds falling half per cent, in rela<lb/>tion to such a message—I cannot swear that I did not see the contents of such a message—I can swear I do not recollect it—if I did see it I can swear I did not use it for any purpose, or look at it for the purpose of using it in any way, taking it in the broadest possible sense—I have never used the contents of any such message for my own private purposes—I never employed a person named Edenstein, in London, to send a message to a person named Jacquemont, at Paris—I never heard the name until I saw it in the libel—during the time Evans was in the service I frequently looked at the contents of the forwarded, and received Continental messages—I did that for several purposes connected with the administration of the office—I never used that knowledge for private purposes, or for any purpose whatever—I have given instructions to forward news to my private residence, but not in the sense in which it may be contemplated—the only cases in which I can recollect having desired any news to be forwarded was during the war, upon questions in which I was very deeply interested, having relations engaged in the war; therefore, when the news came of the list of killed and wounded, I have on several occasions, when I have not been at the office, had those sent up to my house—they were certainly not sent up to my house until they had been made public—they never came to me until hours after they had appeared in print, or in some public source—I can swear that that was the character of the message—I never had a commercial message sent up to my house, or a message connected with the funds, or pecuniary matters—the messages that were sent to me were purely those which had reference to the engagements in which my brothers and friends were, in the Crimea—I imagine the allusion in the libel to an Indian tele<lb/>graph received by Austrian Lloyds, alludes to this transaction; in 1853 the Company laid down wires to the West End, to four or five club houses; at the time those wires were opened, the Company made an arrangement with a news agent at Paris, of the name of Havarse, who is a general news agent at Paris, to supply them with a summary of news in the afternoon; and that summary of news, which he was in the habit of supplying at a fixed price, was to be sent to the different club houses, into which buildings our wires were taken—we did that more as an advertisement—it lasted a very short time—on one occasion Havarse's message arrived containing the Indian summary which belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and I believe, also, to the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi>, who were associated with them—Havarse's summary contained the fact of this Indian message arriving at Marseilles—it was just then that the Submarine Telelegraph Company was completing its arrangements with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for the reception of its messages, both by Marseilles and Trieste—I gave instructions at the office that this message of Havarse's, containing</p>

               <p>this improper matter, or rather this private matter, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, should be forwarded—at this distance of time, I can hardly tell what the message contained, but I desired it to be sent to the club houses—it was not sent only to my club, Brookes's—to the best of my belief, it was sent to the four or five club houses with whom we dealt, but I cannot swear that I was not at the club at the time—I had a communication with Mr. Mowbray Morriss on the subject, and I explained the matter to him by letter—there were written communications between us—I never ordered a dispatch to be forwarded to Mr. Seymour Clark—I do not know Mr. Clark—I have never seen him to my knowledge—I have never spoken to him—I have not the most distant conception of anything about Mr. Seymour Clark, except that I see his name printed up as manager of a railway com<lb/>pany—the Rothschilds deal with us constantly, daily.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect, at any time, when there has been some convulsion in the funds, a great rush of stock brokers coming to the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have recollected that fifty times during the last six years, and perhaps 100 times—it has been reported to me, I do not know it from my own knowledge; the superintendent has come in and told me so—I never went into the office, selected a message from the bottom of a pile of messages in relation to the funds, and desired that it might be given precedence—I have never, with one exception, given any precedence to a message of Baron Roths<lb/>child's—I never desired one to be taken from the bottom of a pile, and precedence to be given to it—I can swear that Mr. Evans never remon<lb/>strated with me on the subject, and said that it was an improper thing to do—I must correct my last answer; the case to which I alluded, the only exception where I have ordered precedence to be given to a message, for aught I know that message might have been taken from the top or the bottom, I know not where it was taken from—I did not take it, and I had no such conversation with Mr. Evans as is stated in the libel—I have never given any precedence whatever to any business message, or ordered that precedence should be given, with that one exception—we have the contents of the messages in our possession, as there has not been one single message of the Company destroyed, but we have no means of fixing the date or knowing what the message named in the libel is—there is no date given to it—they are all in the hands of the officers of the Company, and they are all here—they amount to above 400—I believe every one of Baron Rothschild's messages are in Court at this moment—I have never acquired information at the office, and used it for my private purposes in any shape whatever—I say that emphatically—I first heard that Evans had been making statements in relation to the Company on Sunday, 8th Aug., about half past 2 o'clock in the day, or between 2 o'clock and half past 2—it was when I got home that I heard it—a gentleman called on me five minutes afterwards; I then learnt from him that a communication had been made to Mr. Trigg and others—at that time I was living at my father's house, No. 138, Piccadilly—when I got home, my servant informed me that Captain Thorn had called, and I saw Captain Thorn by appointment at 7 o'clock—it was not an appointment made by myself, but by him, he had told my servant that he would call at 7 o'clock—from what I knew, I desired my wife, Lady Adela Cadogan, to be in the room when he came—she was there during the whole of the first conversation, and nearly during the whole of the second—when he came in, he stated that his name was Captain Thorn, and he told me that he was come from Mr. Evans, upon the subject of a letter that was to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he told me that he had</p>

               <p>not seen Mr. Evans for four days, that Mr. Evans was laid up at Gravesend with a bowel complaint—he read me a note from Mr. Evans to himself, stating that he was ill, and he showed me Mr. Evans' testimonials in an envelope; one was the testimonial of my own secretary, who is dead now, one of the secretaries of the Submarine Telegraph Company, and other private papers belonging to Evans, stating that Evans had left the matter entirely in his hands; he represented him, as he was unable to be in London himself—I asked him why he brought me this letter; in the first place he gave me the libel to read, and I read it out loud, and returned it to him—I said, "I must have a copy of it"—he objected at first, without assigning any particular reason, but subsequently he said that I should have a copy, but that it was necessary for him to consult a friend before he gave it, but he pledged his word as a gentleman that I should have a copy that night—he repeatedly drew my attention to the fact that he had had heavy pecuniary engagements with Mr. Evans and with gentle<lb/>men "at this end of London," that was his expression, that he was mixed up very deeply in money matters with Evans—he volunteered that repeatedly—I should think he said it half a dozen times—he added that he was in Evans's power, that he thought it very imprudent of Evans to write such a letter, that it must be manifestly to my interest and the interest of the Company that this should not appear; he repeated that several times, and that was pretty much the substance of the conversation, except that it was repeated over and over again—I rather think he said that he was very sorry Evans had written the letter, it was very imprudent, and he would have nothing to say to it—I think he said that, but I am not sure, but it extracted this observation from me, "What is the use of your bringing me this letter, <hi rend="italic">non constant</hi> that Evans may not have sent it to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> at this present minute?"—he said, "Oh no, the matter is left entirely to me; here are all Evans's credentials and his papers, and I am quite certain it will not be sent to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> except through me"—that is the sum and substance of the first conversation; he then left, arranging to come back at half past 9 o'clock, after seeing his friend—he came back at half-past 9 o'clock, and then he said to me, "Mr. Cadogan, I wish you to release me from my promise of giving you a copy of the letter"—I said, "Mr. Thorn, I have no sort of idea of releasing you from your promise; and as I shall certainly take legal proceedings on this matter, I advise you to let me have a copy of the letter now, which otherwise I shall extract from you in a court of law"—he hesitated considerably, but I pressed him very much to let me have a copy, and the result was, that he sat down in the library at my father's house, and he copied the letter, and handed it to me; he signed it, I signed it, and my wife signed it with her initials—at that second interview he again alluded to the pecuniary position that he was in, with Evans, and he brought in this money question by the neck and heels, as before—he mentioned the money question on the second occasion without any allusion of mine whatever to it—he then left—I took an opportunity of communicating these circumstances to the managers of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and on the following Monday or Tuesday I applied to a police court—that is the copy of the letter, signed by myself.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a director of some other companies besides the Submarine Telegraph Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a director of four other companies in that office—there is the Submarine Telegraph Company, of which I am a director, and the European Telegraph Company, in connection with it—the Railway Signals Company, which is on the same premises, and on the same floor; one is a Steam Ferry Associa<lb/>tion—that is an embryo, and the other is a patent that was taken out by myself and the chairman of the Company, for transporting <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> for the army—it is known in the office as Balance's Patent—I am a director of all those companies—it was the instrument room that Evans had the super<lb/>intendence of—I was at times constantly in that room, at other times not for almost months together, or many weeks together, sometimes—I have not been into the instrument room once a month, or twice a month, for a long time past—I have been occasionally there, continually, day after day, and several times in a day—I should have an opportunity of seeing one of each pile of messages; the top one of each pile, if I did not look further—if I looked further, of course I should have an opportunity of seeing every one—my attention was very frequently drawn to them by Evans; certainly not to every one, but to a great many—I frequently went and examined the messages of my own accord—the Government always adopt a cipher—I should imagine that nobody would know that cipher except the Govern<lb/>ment—I have been trying to recollect how many messages I have had sent up to my private house—I have never had any since the war was over, and during the war I should not think I have had more than half a dozen at the very utmost—I state that as my belief—I have constantly received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260025"/>
               <p>messages at my private house, private messages, such as any individual might receive—I have had messages from different parties, as any one else may have, and I have had messages on service very often—I have used our telegraph to the out stations, to Dover and those places—these were not always messages connected with the working of the office—they were frequently pri<lb/>vate messages of my own, frequently from abroad, entirely of a private charac<lb/>ter—I believe I have not constantly received public messages at my private house, sent from other parties to other parties—I cannot recollect receiving more than half a dozen messages of the description you allude to; they were only the battle messages and the events of the war, and I have had none since of any sort or kind—there is no file of public messages—I tell you, as I told you before, I have occasionally had constantly to examine the file of messages—I was not in the daily habit of examining the file of messages—it may have occurred several times a week, not examining the messages through, but doing it for a certain purpose—I am trying to give an answer that will explain the purpose—the tariff arrangements that, are made by the foreign governments were then being perpetually changed, and the working of the office to meet these tariff arrangements was being perpetually changed; there were very difficult technical questions as to the transmission of messages over foreign lines; those subjects were constantly before me, and constantly required my reference—some two or three months ago the foreign governments, if you will allow me to give you an illustration, made another very arbitrary rule about the number of words to be contained in a message at a given price; it was then for us to consider whether the reduction from twenty-five words, I think it was, to twenty or fifteen, could be made; and I should think for two or three days, two or three months ago, the superintendent on duty had constant communications with myself and with other directors upon the subject, and I dare say I must then have seen fifty private messages—it was for that express purpose, but what they were I have not the slightest notion—no particular duty was cast on me at all, but I was generally living in London, and many of the directors do not, the chairman at any rate, does not live in London—I, as one of the promoters of the concern, took a great interest in it, and virtually all the internal arrangements, at least a great many of them, were left to myself and the chairman, and were ratified by the board if they thought proper—as a question of degree, I should think I was the only director that took such an active part in the instrument room; many of the questions came under the view of the chairman as well as myself—there was an order made that nobody was to come into the instrument room without the permission of the secretary; it was made at my request and the chairman's; a printed order, I think it was; we had reason for making it—the order was that no one should go into the instrument room except the directors, unless authorised by the secretary—I do not know whether the directors were excepted in the printed order or not, but they were not <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>, because they were there—to my knowledge, complaints have not been made that I was constantly in the instrument room; never in my hearing; I do not believe it was said by Mr. Brett; this is the first time I have ever heard of it—I have not the slightest recollection of Mr. Brett complaining, in my presence, that I was too often in the instrument room; I could almost swear that he did not; the question has never arisen—I know a Mr. Edwards—I have never been charged, in his presence, with being too much in the instrument room, never that I recollect—you take me by surprise—to the best of my belief, I have not the slightest recollec<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>of it, or of any circumstance that could lead to it—it would not be the duty of the accountant to look at the messages on account of the alteration of the tariff; his duty would be merely to see that the moneys were paid and the tariff complied with—that would depend on the number of words sent—that was not my only object; my object was not to verify the amount taken or received, but upon the general principle; matters were then and are still perpetually being changed—there are no private companies abroad; the whole is in the power of the foreign governments, and they are perfectly arbitrary in their arrangements—I was constantly doing all this until the end of 1854, when I went to the Crimea—from 1852 to 1854 I was constantly at Cornhill, doing this, except when I was away, which was very often—I do not mean to say that there were alterations in the tariff week after week—I was not at Cornhill for the sole purpose of any question of tariff; I was there for matters, as you have extracted from me, in connection with four different companies.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never gone to the instrument room, taken the file of received and forwarded messages, looked at them carefully, and immediately gone out again, without saying anything to any one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have done so, not frequently—it was not my habit—I should think I have not frequently gone into the instrument room, looked at the file of received and forwarded messages, and gone out again without saying anything to the superintendent, or any one else—I certainly have done so—at the distance of four years, I cannot swear positively, but my impression is, I have not done so without speaking to the superintendent—I may have gone to the file of messages, care<lb/>fully read them, and left the room without speaking to any one; that is, carefully reading the message I was seeking, not the whole collectively—message is strictly the property of the party by whom it is sent, and to whom it is sent—we take every possible guarantee that in all our transactions privacy shall be strictly kept—I have availed myself of the messages precisely as the superintendent would—I mean in the same sense as any officer of the Company—I did so, because I was virtually charged, being at Cornhill con<lb/>stantly, and the bulk of my brother directors not being there, and a great many questions of detail arising upon the manipulation of messages, and the transmission of the telegraph business, upon which my opinion was formed by seeing the messages—I was constantly looking over the messages, in order to form my opinion as to how things were going on—in many cases I have read the messages—there were a great many messages to Paris; at certain hours of the day, scarcely anything else—at certain hours of the day the telegraph is almost conclusively confined to stock transactions between Paris and London—I can scarcely answer whether I used to read such a message or not—I might swear this, that I never read it with in object—I was certainly not in the habit of reading such messages—occa<lb/>sionally I must have read such a message among others—such messages are sent everywhere—the messages are all put together; one may be for Vienna, and the next for Paris, and the next for Turin; they all come in a lump—unless I went purposely to look, I should only see the top message; I must lift them up; they are in a sort of clip—I said that I had not given prece<lb/>dence to messages of Rothschild, with one exception; I did once order a message of his to have precedence—I do not know what message that was—Baron Rothschild's agent applied to me on two occasions during my con<lb/>nexion with the office since 1851, to allow precedence to be given to a message of his—the message to which I gave precedence was, to the best of my belief, a message destined for some long distance, and it was at a</p>

               <p>time when our wires were all broken down—that message is no doubt here—we have every message of Rothschild's tied up here, therefore it must be amongst them; but I do not know which it is—(<hi rend="italic">papers produced</hi>)—I have now all Baron Rothschild's messages before me; here is one dated 3rd Feb., and one dated 4th Feb—I cannot tell whether this is the message to which I was asked to give precedence; the libel states that there is a memorandum on the message—I cannot say whether either of these is the message to which I gave precedence, I have every reason to believe not—there is no note of Evans on any one message; there is none on any of Baron Roths<lb/>child's—I have not myself looked over them all for the purpose of ascer<lb/>taining it, but they have beep examined for that purpose—every message is numbered—they are numbered in the instrument room, but at what period of the history of the message I do not exactly know—it is the duty of the superintendent, or the person who receives the messages, to number them according to their order, but I do not know when they are numbered—of course, "first come, first serve" is the great principle upon which we go—there is no message here bearing any mark; all the messages are here that went through' the office on 3rd and 4th Feb—they are numbered consecu<lb/>tively, I do not know whether it is done as they arrive—I say so most dis<lb/>tinctly and emphatically—if half a dozen messages are brought up from down stairs, from where the public have delivered them, I do not know by what machinery those messages are separated and numbered in the course as they arrive—they have consecutive numbers, and they are regis<lb/>tered by those numbers—I think they have almost invariably the time on them at which they are sent, but I think not always—I do not know the date of Baron Rothschild's message to which I gave precedence, I have no recollection whatever—that was the only occasion on which I gave that precedence—I did not. myself go through all these messages before the sum<lb/>mons was heard at the police court, to see whether I could find the message of Baron Rothschild—I gave instructions that it should be done by the officers of the Company—no message has been discovered which I recognize as the one I ordered to be so transmitted—I gave order for the precedence of that message, because. I conceived it to be a case in which I could do so without injury to the public, and without giving it any unfair priority over say other persons—I never did it in more than one instance; it was applied for in another instance, and refused—I may, in the case in point, myself have taken up a message of Rothschild's, and put it forward for transmission—I should think I probably did hand the message to the superintendent to send—I should think so, I cannot swear that I did—I cannot say how many I gave it precedence over; it is quite impossible for me to say; it is three years ago; it was done as a matter of favour to Baron Rothschild—I considered it perfectly justifiable, and perfectly not wrong—that may not be very good English, but that is what I mean—certainly, the bulk of my brother directors were not aware of it, because they were not there; whether the chairman was aware of it or not, I do not know; he was aware of the second case, because I was with him at the time, and we together refused the message on account of its having the price of the funds in it, and because it was not, therefore, a private message, we refused to give it priority—the superintendent brought me the message, with the request that I would give it priority, and I believe the observation was from him, "This message cannot go, because it has got the quotation of funds in it," and we said, "Certainly not"—Sir James Carmichael was with me—I should not think any other director was with me when I sanctioned the priority in the</p>

On Saturday, 8th Aug., from 4 o'clock to a quarter past, Thorn came and asked for Mr. Cadogan—it was at No. 138, Piecadilly—I told him that Mr. Cadogan was not within—he hesitated some time, and asked when he would be in—I told him it was very uncertain during the afternoon, but he would be in by 7 o'clock, and he said he would come at that time—he did so, and stayed some time—I showed him up into the drawing room to Lady Adela, and Mr. Cadogan came home and saw him—he went out, and came again at half past 9 o'clock the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Honourable Frederick Cadogan. We were staying at his father's house, in Piccadilly, in Aug. last—I remember a person named Thorn coming there on Saturday, 8th Aug.—Mr. Cadogan had made some communication to me on the subject of that person before he came, and in consequence of that, I remained in the room during the whole of the conversation which took place between him and Mr. Cadogan—he came about 7 o'clock—he brought a letter from Mr. Evans, enclosing one which Mr. Evans had written to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he gave it to Mr. Cadogan, who read it out aloud at the window in my presence—he said that he thought it would be a damaging letter to the Company and Mr. Cadogan, and that he had better bring it to him—Mr. Cadogan returned the letter, and asked for a copy of it—he said he must consult a friend, and he would bring him a copy of it before 10 o'clock that night—he said that he had not seen Mr. Evans for four days, that he was ill in bed at Graveseud, and had sent him this letter—he had some papers with him, and the letter from Mr. Evans to himself I understood—he could give no particular reason why he came; he said he thought it would be damaging to Mr. Cadogan and the Company, and he thought Mr. Cadogan would wish to know of it; he said that he was the greatest friend of Mr. Evans, and was mixed up in heavy pecuniary engagements with him—Mr. Cadogan said he did not understand why he should come to him about it at all; Mr. Evans could send the letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—Thorn replied that he thought it would be to Mr. Cadogan's advantage, and that of the Company, that the letter should not appear—he was there about a quarter or half an hour—he came again about 10 o'clock I think—I was not present at the beginning, but I came into the room soon afterwards—he was then sitting at a table, copying the letter, which Mr. Cadogan held in his hand; he finished it, and gave it to Mr. Cadogan—he repeated frequently that he was under heavy pecuniary engagements with Evans and with other gentlemen at the west end of town, and that he was in Mr. Evans's power—I put my initials to the copy—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

I came into the office, and, seeing a dispatch of foreign news from M.

It was only on my</p>

Yours very truly, Fred.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260033"/>
               <p>letter in your paper of the 4th inst., and which I presume is intended as a complete answer to your article appearing, under the head of 'Money Market and City Intelligence,' on the 1st inst., I come forward, upon public grounds, to answer one part of the same, and will direct my attention to the sixth paragraph of Sir James's letter, which states, 'Of the cause of the delay of the messages to the East India House and Lord Clarendon, I as yet know nothing, and consequently (unlike the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>) will not hazard an opinion, or even a suspicion. But I do know that during the Crimean war, the submarine telegraph wires were not found at fault in their part of the important duty of conveying the messages of the British Government; and I may also venture to state that, since the establishment of our first telegraphic communication with France, no person in the service of this Company has hitherto been suspected of betraying the trust reposed in him by the public, nor has any message been either tampered with or delayed in any one of our offices, though, of course, we have been liable to our fair share of delays from accidental causes, for which we expected and received blame.' Now, Sir, I beg to say that I was superintendent of the instrument rooms of the Submarine Telegraph Company, at 30, Cornhill, from the 5th Nov., 1852, until I resigned my appointment, in July, 1854; that during the above period one of the directors of the said Company, viz., the Hon. Frederick Cadogan (now, I believe, the deputy chairman) was in the habit of visiting the instrument rooms, and waiting in the board room daily, say from 11 A. M. till 3 or 4 P. M., and I had special instructions from him to send up all messages of importance for his perusal; and, as a consequence, I can instance one particular despatch from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to Lord Clarendon, dated Constantinople, Dec. 3rd, Vienna, 13th, and received by us <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> Brussels, when, within half an hour after the message had been seen by the Hon. Frederick Cadogan, the funds fell half per cent. He suddenly quitted the office, and we almost directly received a message from Eversheim, London, to Jacqueman, Paris, touching this parti<lb/>cular fall. There could be no possibility of these parties having obtained information only through us; and I am positive no clerk quitted the office during that time. That the said Hon Frederick Cadogan frequently looked at the contents of an Indian telegraph received from Austrian Lloyds, Trieste, addressed to the 'Times,' London, being forwarded to the Hon. Fre<lb/>derick Cadogan, at Brooks's club. Another time I remember forwarding the contents of a despatch to Mr. Seymour Clarke, by order of the Hon. Frederick Cadogan. Again, on the arrival of some important Continental news, there occurred a rise, or fall, in the funds (for the moment I cannot say which). The result was, that at about noon there was a rush to the office by the first stockbrokers of the day. The Hon. Frederick Cadogan, being in the instrument room, said, 'Well, Evans, are you busy?' I replied in the affirmative, whereupon the said Hon. Frederick Cadogan took up a batch of about twenty-five messages, lying by the side of the Paris instrument, for transmission, taking out from near the bottom a message from Rothschild, London, to Rothschild, Paris, which he placed on the top of the pile, request<lb/>ing me to give it precedence, although all those which he desired me to jump over were upon the same description of business, and to the same place, viz., Paris. At the time, I told Mr. Cadogan that, all messages were sent in the order received at the counter, and that it was doing the public a great injustice; yet he desired me to do so, and I of course obeyed his commands, which can be proved if the Submarine Company will permit a reference to their file of forwarded messages, as the original message paper has a note of</p>

               <p>mine in ink with regard to these facts, and I challenge the, Company to produce it. I have not stated a single fact in this letter but what I am in a position to prove by officers or servants who now are or have been in the Company's employ, and by reference to my diary of these circumstances I could add more, but for the present will be content with the foregoing statement, which I think, Sir, you will agree with me, completely answers the paragraph I have quoted from Sir James Carmichael's letter, and, I also think, will prove to the chairman and directors of the Submarine Telegraph Company and the public, that you do not 'hazard opinions based upon rumour only.' I in close here with the testimonials I received from the Company on resigning my appointment, and remain, Sir, your obedient servant, Thomas D. Evans, late superintendent of the Submarine Telegraph Company's instrument rooms, 30, Cornhill.")</p>

               <p>you used them to read the messages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say certainly not—I have read several—I should think a week has very possibly passed when I have never looked at one—I looked at them from curiosity—I looked at private messages while I was a director, because they were there—while I was a director I have read private messages out of curiosity, when they were before me—I read them for no purpose whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you read them from curiosity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only say that I read them with no object—I made use of the expression that I read them from curiosity, but it was without any object at all—I never was in the room, but without some other object than to see messages—I read them, because they were before me, and I may have read a few on several occasions—I volunteered to come here and give evidence—the first mention of it I heard was the day the trial was to come on—Mr. Cadogan and I have have never been friends in our lives—he did not order me out of the instru<lb/>ment room—I have been informed by Mr. Evans that Mr. Cadogan has on more occasions than one asked him, "What is he doing in the instrument room?"—I know that the general order is that no person should go in with<lb/>out the orders of the secretary—I did not apply for any order, it was not necessary; when my duty called me I went in—I have not avowed that my feeling towards Mr. Cadogan is a very angry one, nothing of the sort—I never recollect to have made use of such an expression as that I would punish him if I could, or serve him out—I will swear that I have not done so within the last twenty-four hours, or within the last week—you asked me if I did it, I say I have no recollection of it, and I believe I never have—I think I will go as far as to say I never have, that is my answer—I should say I have not said that I had a strong personal feeling against Mr. Cadogan—if I am to say what my feelings may be, I will—I will not swear that I have not said that I have a strong personal feeling against Mr. Cadogan, but I believe I never have.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the defendant Evans, and am clerk in the Admiralty, at Somerset House. On Saturday, Aug. 8th, my brother and Mr. Thorn came there to me, between 3 and 4 o'clock—my brother showed me the letter the subject of this inquiry—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was in a sheet to the best of my recollection and belief, half a sheet of foolscap—this would make a sheet if it was put together, and I believe it is the letter; yes, it is—I had been in the employ of the Sub<lb/>marine Telegraph Company, from the opening of the first cable to France, and remained from Nov., 1851, till Jan., 1856, when I resigned my appoint<lb/>ment—my brother and Mr. Thorn left about a quarter to 4 o'clock, as near as possible—I was appointed assistant superintendent at Liverpool—previous to that time I was clerk—during that time Mr. Cadogan was in the office daily—his not being there was quite an exception, unless he was out of town—he never remained long—I have known him come in and out of the instrument room three or four times in the course of the day—the messages that are transmitted are on the file, and those that are received are by the side of the instrument, in a heap, if there is any delay—if the clerk does not take quickly, or the wires are in bad order, there will be about twenty or thirty—if a message is received from Brussels or Paris, or any part of the world, it was the duty of my brother and myself to send that message off—Mr. Cadogan had no duty to perform in sending off messages, or. in their trans<lb/>mission from here elsewhere—I have seen him go to the messages during the time I have been acting as assistant superintendent, and have seen him take up the forwarded and received messages, and look most minutely through through them, reading the contents of nearly each—I have also seen him come and refer to the messages, and without saying a word, he would leave the room with his hat on, and his overcoat—I have seen him do that daily—I know of no matter of business relating to the Company that would render it necessary for Mr. Cadogan to do what I saw him do—it is no part of a director's duty; as in that case a superintendent would be unnecessary—I have never seen any other director do what I saw Mr. Cadogan do—he has given directions to me when leaving for the day; he has said, "Evans, if anything of importance arrives, send it to my house," meaning his private residence, and I have frequently done so; and during the day he has fre<lb/>quently said, "Evans, if anything of importance arrives, I shall be in the Board room"—the messages that I took were any that contained important news, whether addressed to the public, the government, or the press—any message that contained important news—I have made extracts from them in my own hand, and have sent them in an envelope to his own private resi<lb/>dence—that was done by his instructions, distinctly—I have also seen him come in with his hat on, refer to the messages, and return immediately—he has frequently not given any orders—he did not say a word, but looked at the messages, and went out—when the House of Commons' Office was open, and communication was made to the Clubs, at Mr. Cadogan's wish, I was sent to the House of Commons, which was in connection with the Cornhill Office, and also with the Clubs—on one occasion Mr. Cadogan came in from the House of Commons in his wig and gown, into our telegraph office, and asked me to telegraph to Cornhill, and asked if there was any news—I remember a dispatch being received relating to news from the East—it was a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> dispatch, to the best of my knowledge—it was sent to Brooks's club by Mr. Cadogan's order—I recollect the circumstance well, from the word</p>

               <p>"phases" being used in it—I thought it was "phrases," and Mr. Cadogan said, "No, no, 'phases' is correct"—I was also superintendent to the British and Submarine Telegraph Office at Dover—Mr. Cadogan came there once, I believe in passing to the continent—I cannot say that I have ever seen Mr. Cadogan move a message from the bottom to the top of the file—I have never seen any of the other directors deal with the messages in the way that Mr. Cadogan has—I have been nearly two years a clerk at Somerset House—I believe it is the practice of the Company to keep all the messages that are received; at all events for a certain number of years—if the file of messages of 3rd Feb., 1854, were produced, the numbers ought to be consecutive—there ought to be no gap—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the file</hi>) message 103 is not in it's place, if it is here; nor is 105, nor 114, nor 140, nor 147—these are forwarded messages received at the Circus Office, not at Cornhill—numbers 101 and 102 are here, and 103 should follow in the ordinary course; 104 is here—Mr. Thorn did not take any part in the discussion between me and my brother; in fact he was not present when my brother showed me the letter; he was six yards away—I anxiously looked in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Monday for the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the employment of the Submarine Telegraph Company; I left on 11th July last—I entered the Company in 1853, as messenger; I was afterwards employed on the line, and since that I have been assistant porter about six months—I have often seen Mr. Cado<lb/>gan come into the instrument room—in 1852 the instrument room was altered from where it is now; there was a long passage to it, and it was my duty to take messages along that passage, and I have seen him go into the room often—I have seen him read the messages, I may say several times, but being a messenger I had not the opportunity always—I was not employed in the instrument room, and was very seldom in there, but it was my duty to be there to take messages—I have taken messages up to Mr. Cadogan's private house frequently, but I took parcels principally, which were left at the office, but I have taken messages and notes—I have seen Mr. Cadogan there, lately, as late as 12 o'clock at night.</p>

I am one of the directors of the Submarine Tele<lb/>graph Company—I am not solicitor to the Company; I am a solicitor—I take no active part, I am a sleeping partner in London and Bristol—I have not given any evidence to the attorney for the defence, I have merely received a subpœna—from 1852-to 1854, I scarcely missed a Board meeting—I went into the instrument room very seldom indeed, not once in six months—I never on any occasion read the forwarded and received messages—no complaint has been made to me of Mr. Cadogan dealing with the messages under any circumstances—I know that he was in the habit of going into the room, but not so frequently; I had no means of knowing it—he never stated at any of the Board meetings that he was constantly in the habit of reading the messages—I should say that it would be unques<lb/>tionably wrong to transpose a message, and give priority to it, except under some very extraordinary circumstances—the proper judge of that would be, I suppose, under ordinary circumstances, the Superintendent, the Chairman,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Three Colt Court, Worship Street I know Mr. Mudie's shop—about half past 3 o'clock on 9th Oct. I saw several persons come there, and I saw Loveday looking in at the window—Hollyfield was inside the shop—Mr. Mudie had a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in his hand, and was showing it to Hollyfield—Hollyfield came out, and joined Loveday, and they went away together to the corner of King Street about twelve yards from the shop—they went towards Long Alley—I have known Loveday two or three years—I am quite positive he is the person who was at the window—when I went over to the window, he walked away about twenty yards from the shop, and walked back again—he was four or five yards away from the window when Hollyfield came out <hi rend="italic">Loveday.</hi> He did not see me; when I was in Worship Street, he came to me, and said that a policeman was after me, and gave me a bit of card with the policeman's number. Witness. I am sure he is the person—I did not say that a policeman was after him—I did not give him a bit of card with the policeman's number—I watched him from Worship Street to near Spitalfields Market, and when I got there, there were several of his pals, who threatened to knock my brains out—that was after Hollyfield was remanded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 32, Fitzroy Market. The prisoner lodged in the same room with me, and slept in the same bed for about a fortnight—she had an infant named Julia, I understand; it was about three months old—it was in perfectly good health all the week before Sunday, the 13th—after the prisoner had fed it that morning it turned sick—after that she began to give it more of the same food—I said to her, "You are only punishing the child; you see it will not lie on its stomach; why don't you give it the breast?"—she made some sullen, muttering reply, I could not exactly say what—I have seen her rather cross with the child, and once or twice she has said, "I wish you were dead; I wish you were in heaven;" and she has often said, "I know it won't live long"—on Mon<lb/>day morning, about 10 o'clock, as I was washing up the breakfast things, she came to me, and said, "Is there something can be had from the doctor's to make a child sleep?"—I said I did not know, I never had any<lb/>thing to make my baby sleep—nothing more passed then, she left the house about an hour afterwards—I had occasion to go out on an errand, I returned about 1 o'clock, or a quarter to 1, and she came in about half an hour after—the baby seemed very well then; a little girl of the prisoner's, about seven years old, was carrying it about—I have heard that the prisoner has three other children, but not in this country; I know nothing of that myself—she was a stranger to me before this-an old lady was sitting in the corner, with the baby on her knee, when the prisoner came in with a pair of socks; she <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> them down, and said, "What a fool I was to boy them!"—she "afterwards took the child on her knee, and began feeding it out of a tea cup with a tea spoon—after she had given it the stuff, whatever it was, the child went to block it up, and she put her hand on its mouth, and put it back, and made it swallow it—I said, "What are you giving the baby?"—she said, "Nothing but a little cold milk "—I did not see what was in the cup then, I did afterwards—she then called me over, and said, "Come here, and look at the child; I am sure it won't live "—it was then on her knee—I said, "I do not see why you should say that, I do not see any deathly signs about the child"—she said, "Come, and look at its eyes"—I went, and looked at the baby's face; its little eyes looked rather glassy—I said, "The baby is asleep, put it to bed, and let it have a sleep," and she got up, and made a bed on the large arm chair, and put it down, and covered it up—she then came over to the old lady in the corner, Mrs.</p>

               <p>M'Carthy, the landlady's mother, whose is quite deprived of sight, took her finger and thumb so, and said, "I know it will not live long, for its little nose is pinched in here"—she then went up stairs, and began to clean her bedroom up stairs—the baby was asleep, as I thought—presently I had occasion to go over to the drawers, and I saw a bottle with a new label on it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that bottle was in the house all the time I was in it: it was used the day before for aniseed; the label was newly put on; it is, "Laudanum, poison"—I can read—I do not know whether or not the prisoner can read—I took the cork out, and smelt it—I went directly to the cup that she had been feeding the child out of, and smelt it, and it smelt the same as the bottle—I cannot say that I know the smell of laudanum, but it had a wild, fierce smell, something I cannot describe—I then went directly, and looked at the child, for it reminded me of a question she had asked me in the morning—I had heard her at various times speak<lb/>ing to the baby, and the night before I had heard her wishing it was stiff before morning; that was in the course of the Sunday night—when I went and looked at the baby, I saw it lying on its back, and its eyes turned round in its head, the hands out, and the eyes wide open—I called out, "The baby is dead"—the prisoner came down stairs, and said, "Is it dead?—I said, "Yea, it is "—she came over, and looked at it, and then she began to call out, "My baby, my baby "—I said, "The cruel woman, you have been giving it laudanum, you have poisoned the child"—I then sent her for a neighbour, and I sent the little girl to fetch some one—I said to the pri<lb/>soner, "Bring some one, and don't sit there making a noise; bring a doctor, see what can be done for the child"—with the noise the landlord, Mr. May<lb/>nard, came in from the workshop, and Mrs. Ward, a neighbour—Mr. Maynard took the child to the hospital, and I sent the bottle by a neighbour.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner go to the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, with Mr. Maynard—I had only been living at the house three weeks on the Wednesday, as this happened on the Monday—the prisoner was living there before me—I did not go to lodge with her, I took an apartment, and my bed was not ready, and the landlady asked if I had any objection to sleep with the prisoner till it was ready, and I said no—I slept in the same bed with her very nearly three weeks—everything went on well till Sunday, 13th Sept.—she gets her living by carrying milk for a dairy—she went out at 5 o'clock in the morning, and returned at 6 in the evening; sometimes she would not be home quite so soon—when I first went there, an elderly woman was taking care of the baby—when she left I was asked if I would look after it for a day—I said, as I was disengaged, I would, and they must get some one after that—I did so for a week—I saw the baby every day during the time I was there, and almost every hour in the day—I went out, as it suited my business—I am a cook by profession—I go out to cook dinners, but I had not been out while I was there—I attended to the baby the last week; I nursed it, kept it clean, and fed it—there had been nothing at all the matter with the child up to the 13th—I never saw a more hardy, healthy little child in my life, and I have seen hundreds—there was nothing the matter with it during the week I had it; it was in perfect good health, and got quite fat—it had not diarrhoea then, nor while I had it; it might have had it before I came there, I do not know—when I first went there, they said it was purged, and they got a draught from the doctor and stopped it; but it was quite well the three weeks I was there—I was lying in bed with her when I heard her say she wished the child would be stiff in the morning—I had been talking to her several</p>

               <p>times during the night, when the baby was rather tiresome; I said, "Give it the breast "—it was a little restless, as babies will be at times—I know that she had milk to give it. I have seen it suck many a time—she did not give it the breast when I told her—I do not know that there is some stuff sold by doctors to sleep children, I have seen a little aniseed used some times in the food to comfort the bowels—I never heard of Godfrey's cordial—I do not know whether she can read or write; I never saw her write, or heard her read—I never heard of anything being given to children to make them sleep; I have brought up three fine children of my own, and I never gave them anything of the kind—she had taken the child to the hospital about three weeks before; it had a purging, and they gave it a little draught which stopped it, and it was in perfect good health afterwards—on the Sunday night the child was a little fractious—I did not hear it suck—she changed it from side to side several times, and she shook it, and said, "I hope you will be stiff before morning"—she seemed in a passion, rather spiteful.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at University College Hospital, Gower Street On 14th Sept., the baby was brought to me, into the hospital—it was insensible, and apparently from a narcotic poison—this bottle was brought in at the time—there were only a few drops in it, I should think about ten minims; it smelt strongly of opium—I asked the prisoner what she had been giving the child—she said some aniseed—she said she had given it about two hours previously—I gave the child an emetic, which was repeated, it acted very slightly; it was wrapped in flannel, and motion used—I did not apply the stomach pump, owing to the tender age of the child; it would have been difficult and dangerous, I think it would hare suffocated it; moreover it appeared So be almost dead when it was admitted—the second emetic I gave it operated slightly; I got a little warm water down with difficulty—it died fifty-four hours afterwards; it appeared to be dead three hours after its admission, but it revived; I sat up all night with it—it was a flabby, ill nourished child—the day alter its death I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination; I examined the brain, and all the vital parts—the appearances of the body were insufficient to account for death; death did not appear to be due to natural disease—taking into consideration the symptoms during life, and the absence of any sufficient cause of death, I Was convinced that the child died from narcotic poison—poison in a fluid state would be absorbed more rapidly than if it were solid—two drops have caused death in a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the child when it was first brought into the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately—several persons brought it in; the prisoner, I think, followed it—I found it in the out-patients' room—the prisoner fol<lb/>lowed me into the ward—she remained from about 10 minutes past 8 o'clock until she went away with the policeman, about 6 o'clock—the child was not dead then—she was taken away on suspicion—she could not attend to the child between that time and the time of its death; there was collapse of the lungs after death, which is a very common appearance in young children—it is generally an indication of debility, of a failure of power and tone—that had nothing whatever to do with the effects of narcotic poison; it is seen in children dying under many different circumstances, it is not the least indi<lb/>cation of death by poison—it is not an indication of death from something else—I have not known children die from collapse of the kings; I did not say so, I said you frequently find collapse of the lungs in children dying under different circumstances; indeed I should anticipate collapse in this case, or any other where a child dies from failure of power, without any poison at all—I lay no stress upon the collapse of the lungs in this case—I have not known many children die from it; children who die from exhaustion exhi<lb/>bit that symptom—it is an indication of debility, which debility ends in exhaustion, causing death—it has nothing to do with the cause of death, it is a sequence—if I had not been told anything about a narcotic poison, I should have suspected that the child did not die fairly, if there had been simply collapse of the lungs; there must have been something to cause that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260056"/>
               <p>collapse, something first of all to produce the debility upon which collapse of the lungs supervenes—exhaustion from any cause will produce it—what I mean to say is, that collapse of the lungs is an indication of death from debility—I should state that there were some other indications of disease in the child—there was some solidification of the lower lobe of the right lung but I think that had nothing to do with the death; it was subsequent to the other symptom, not antecedent; there was limited pneumonia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the cause of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That might be due, and I think was due, to gravitation, the child being kept in the position it was—it is also a common sequel of opium poison to have more or les solidi<lb/>fication, of the lung, because the respiration is interfered with, and the blood stagnates; it is what medical men call hepatization, which is a common sequel to a narcotic poison—if the child had died at an earlier period, I should say it arose from coma or insensibility, but, the symptoms being so protracted, I should say it was rather due to exhaustion, the effect of the coma having more or less passed off, vegetable poison having a tendency to become eliminated—assuming a larger dose of laudanum than would be consistent with health to be given, I think that would account for debility causing collapse of the lungs, the child living so long—if narcotism imme<lb/>diately proves fatal, it would be by coma; if remotely, it would probably be by exhaustion—collapse of the lungs may supervene upon any state of exhaustion whatever.</p>

               <p>thumb; he put it on the side of my eye in a very severe manner, but I wrenched his hand away; he then took hold of my collar, and tried to throttle me while I was lying on the ground—I called out for assistance, got partly up, and sprang my rattle—he threw me down again, and after a good deal of struggling I got the best of him, and got up, and drew my staff; he took hold of it, and pulled me on top of him; he flung his legs round mine, and said that if I did not let him go, he would jump my b—guts out—I still kept hold of him, and would not—the string of my staff broke, and after a great deal of struggling the prisoner got possession of it, and struck me across the bridge of the nose with it while we were still on the ground—I was not able to more for two or three minutes, and when I lifted myself up, the prisoner was about twenty yards away from me—he came back, and struck me across the head, which caused the blood to flow; he also struck me on the back of the right ear, and I was not able to stir for some time—there was a very great deal of blood; it was flowing from my nose and also from the wound in my head—the prisoner went in the direction of Brentford; I was not able to follow' him—I called a party to assist me to a surgeon's, and gave information to another constable—I saw the prisoner in custody from 2 to half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and I have not the least doubt of his being the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Nicholas Lane, Lom<lb/>bard Street I have a banking account at Hankey and Co.'s—the prisoner was in my employ rather more than a year—he and a clerk named Bunning were the only two clerks I had—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my cheque book—I kept it in the drawer of my writing table, which was locked when I went away at night, but not during the day—I never allow anybody to sit in my room when I am out—my office is at the back, and the prisoner's in front, on the same floor—the prisoner and Bunning sat at one large desk, which was separated—this cheque is not in my writing, or written by my autho<lb/>rity—it is an entire forgery—nearly all my cheques were filled up by myself, but occasionally by Bunning if he was there, or anybody else, and I signed them—I have not missed any cheque from my cheque book, but this cheque exactly corresponds with a foil at the end of the book, where I cut out cheques to carry about with me—it fits here, and nowhere else—my cheques are all one number throughout the book—I receive weekly from my bankers cheques which have been paid in and are cancelled, and about every four or six months it was the prisoner's business to sort them according to the dates, and do them up in a parcel—I have not personally looked into the bundles since this has occurred to see if they are there—it was most probably Mr. Bunning who examined them—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the prisoner write—I believe the writing on the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and on one of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, to be his, but to the other I have some doubts—I last saw him in my office on the morning of 13th June—I left by the 12 o'clock train that day for the country, and the probability is that it was at half past 11 o'clock—I have no doubt he was there when I left—he was there in the morning—I was not aware that he intended to leave me—I sent my clerk to inquire for him after the following Tuesday, hut heard nothing of him till Oct, when he was taken into custody—he is about seventeen years of age—he wore jackets then—he received from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary, which was paid weekly—he was sent to Hankey's probably every day he was with me to pay in money, and get cheques changed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe his family and connections are very respectable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe highly so—up to the time he left, he conducted</p>

               <p>himself entirely to my satisfaction—the writing on these two notes is as like as it is possible to write, and the "5" and the "7" in "1857" are joined at the top in all three, but I never noticed that he wrote "1857" in that way—there is a similarity to his writing—I cannot say that the body of the cheque is his writing, but now you ask, I see that the "5" and "7" are joined in the cheque as well—the writing on the cheque is different from the notes—when I first saw the signature, I had some doubt whether it was mine; it is very like mine—Bunning said that it was very similar to his writing, that he had some recollection of filling up a cheque for something of the kind—I am quite positive that the signature is not mine, and there is no foil for it—I know no person named Farley—I have torn cheques from the book without filling them up—it is just possible that I may have torn this cheque out myself, but not to fill up for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never carry a cheque about with me signed—it might have been lost, and found by some body—I have had this book in use nine months, and during that time three persons have been employed in my office, any or all of whom might have had access to the cheque book—the prisoner was not the only clerk who went to the bank to pay or draw money; they all went—I will not say that the writing in the cheque is the prisoner's—I say again I believe the writing on the notes to be the prisoner's—there is a very great similarity in the style, in two of the notes particularly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs, Clutton, solicitors, is Southwark. I was clerk to Mr. Hewitt nearly two years—I left him about the middle of August, I think—the prisoner was fellow clerk with me, and Sat in the same office—I am acquainted with his handwriting—I believe the writing on this 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, "Robert Silvester, Manor Street, Clapham," to be his—there is so striking a resemblance, that I believe it to be his—I cannot say as to this other one; my impression is not so strong as to the other two—I sometimes filled up the body of cheques for Mr. Hewitt—I have no belief whatever as to whose handwriting it is on this cheque—it is very much like mine—the signature is very much like Mr. Hewitt's—I had not anything to do with the writing, either the body or signature of that cheque—the prisoner, doubtless, knew that I some<lb/>times filled up the body of a cheque, as he changed the cheques generally—he often used to go to the bankers'.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner generally write a round, clerk like kind of hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes he wrote very stiff, and not at others, but in a careless-manner, which would very much correspond with the indorsement on these two notes—the words "Manor Street is very mach more characteristic of the prisoner's handwriting than the other—I believe it to be his—the name of "Farley, Newcastle Street, Strand," appears to be different, and my belief is not so strong as to that—I believe the prisoner might. imitate that writing—I cannot say there is any resemblance to his whatever in that—the writing of the cheque is different from all three—I said it was my writing upon first looking at it—I swear positively now that it is not my writing—I said at first I had some recollection of filling a cheque for this amount, and now I say it is not my writing—I filled up a cheque of a large amount very shortly afterwards, and that led me astray—the signature is a good imitation—if I had seen that signature to a note or order without knowing more, I should have acted upon it as Mr. Hewitt's—I</p>

               <p>can only say, as I have said before, that the" writing is a striking resem<lb/>blance to my own, but I did not write it—the strongest reason I have for saying so is that all the cheques I filled up for Mr. Hewitt I know what the amount was for—I never heard of the name of Farley before.</p>

On Tuesday, 13th Oct, the prisoners came to my shop—Sullivan said, "Show this gentleman a coat," pointing to Bolyne—I showed him some, and he tried on several—Sullivan examined them, and told him whether they fitted—at last they chose one—Sullivan said, "I think that fits you very well," and Bolyne said, "Very well, we will have it"—the price agreed upon was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then asked to be shown a waistcoat—I showed him several—he chose one at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sullivan said to Bolyne, "You had better pay for them," and Bolyne gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I looked at it, and thought it was not a good one—I gave it him back, and told him to write his name and address on the back, which he did—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note, and this is what I saw him write, "William Walters, 16, Princes Street"—I then said, "I must go and get change"—I went out, and showed it to Mr. Clarke, at Bull and Wilson's—I then returned to the shop—I looked in, and, thinking the prisoners were still there, I ran over to Luxmor's to be certain whether it was good or not—when I came back neither of the prisoners were there—I had seen a policeman when I went out, and told him to watch them—I went with him in search of them, and as I returned I saw Sullivan standing in a doorway on the opposite side of the way—I immediately went over to him, and said, "It is a strange thing your friend should go away and leave the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the change; I have the change for him; where is he?"—he said he had only gone to get a glass of ale, he would be there directly—a</p>

On 19th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock at night, I heard a noise in the passage of my house as I was coming down stairs; I stopped a few minutes to ascertain what it was—I came down and heard some one under the stairs, and stopped a minute and saw Williamson with a bag on his shoulder—I asked what it was; he said a bottle he had to carry to the docks, and he was too late for the docks—I did not feel satisfied with the story, and he took the bag and went on towards Paternoster Row—I followed him, and saw him meet Fletcher, and give the bottle off his shoulder on to Fletcher's shoulder, and Fletcher gave him four or five shillings in silver—I let Williamson go down Ave Maria Lane, and I followed Fletcher to the top of Cheapside, where I saw Policeman 428—I took him with me, and we followed Fletcher, and came up with him in Cannon Street—I gave him custody on suspicion of having stolen property—the policeman asked him what he had got, and he said stuff he brought from Blackfriars Road, and he had made it to fry fish with, and was going to take it to some person</p>

Q.</hi> You heard a disturbance in the street before you saw anything, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was what induced me to go out—I went up the street about fifty yards, and saw the deceased lying on his back on the ground—that was after he had been stabbed—I saw the prisoner run away from the crowd—there was a crowd round the deceased.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the station on this Sunday evening—I afterwards proceeded to where the deceased was lying, and found Mr. Stuckey attending to his wounds—he stated in the deceased's hearing that he was dying, and that he could not live more than ten minutes—he died within a very few minutes after he had said something to me—he did not say himself whether or not he thought he should recover. (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE LORD CHIEF BARON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">under these circumstances was of opinion that it was very doubtful whether any statement of the deceased could be received as a dying declaration.</hi>)</p>

I am a surgeon in Wellclose Square—I was called to the deceased on the Sunday evening—I found him in a state of collapse—on undressing him, I found two wounds in the abdomen to the right of the navel, one to the left, and another on the left breast, between the sixth and seventh ribs, and another in the left armpit, and down to the back of the left shoulder—all the three wounds in the abdomen had penetrated the bowels, but not injured the bowels; the one on the breast had penetrated the right ventricle of the heart—he died within ten or twelve minutes of my getting to him—his death was caused by the wounds—such an instru<lb/>ment as this would cause such wounds.</p>

On Friday morning, 16th Oct, about a quarter past 7 o'clock, the prisoner came there and brought some coffee, lump sugar, three coats, some gold scales, a mantle, and a brush—I said, "Good morning, you are out early"—he said, "Yes, I have been at the Coal Hole all night"—he asked my husband to buy this coat, but refused to ask a price for it—he asked half a sovereign for this other coat, but my husband would not buy it—I said, "What are you going to do with these scales?"—he said, "I am going to have new ones like them, as I am going to Australia next week"—I said, "What are you going to do with the coffee and sugar?"—he said, "You can buy it if you like, but do not buy it unless you like, in case it should be stolen"—I said, "If I buy it, I shall give you the full price"—he said that he got them from his lawyer, who had a brother who let him have things instead of money which was-coming to him—I bought nothing, but he made me a present of this small book, which I gave to the constable—while he was there, I went two or three times to Mr. Harris, the publican, and he called a policeman, and spoke to him, but he refused to interfere—I followed the prisoner into George Street, No. 3, I believe, and sent a little boy for a policeman—Ball came, and we both went into the kitchen.</p>

I am one of the firm of Powell and Sons, of Bristol The prisoner was in our employ—it was his duty to account for goods which he received, every month by means of a written order—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his accounts for Feb, and May—in the Feb account he accounts for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Winsor and Newton, instead of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he charges me with 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount allowed—he was not authorised to allow that—the amount of the receipt is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and dis<lb/>count deducted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 14th Feb. there is not the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. accounted for from Mr. Murrell, nor does his name appear—the entries in this book are the prisoner's writing—it is the carman's book—in the May account our account against Corbin and Co. was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; discount 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been deducted, and the prisoner has received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., net cash 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is all he has accounted for from them—these three invoices-are in his writing—they are not the invoices which were sent up from Bristol with the goods—it was his duty to deliver them to the customers, not to substitute others for them—I know of my own knowledge that invoices were sent from Bristol with the goods—it is the uniform custom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose the goods which are sent up are broken, what would be the course? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A deduction would be made to the parties—it was the prisoner's duty to open the packages, to see that they are correct and correspond with the invoices, and if any of them are broken, it would be his duty to communicate with the house, and an alteration would be made in the books—we could not supply the damaged goods at once, because the names of the parties are printed on them—some of them are plain—I am not aware of the number of agents we have—that has been arranged by the prisoner—I never saw James Powell but once, and that was since this charge—I, have heard since that he has been acting as an agent—I have been told that Baker is an agent—it is not usual for me to see every parcel of goods sent from Bristol, but every entry in the books is examined by me or my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am no relation of the prosecutor. I am a dealer in china and glass, and do an immense business among publicans, both in stone and glass bottles, and have done business with Messrs. Powell nearly thirteen years—I have known Mr. Truelove Utley a long while, but Mr. Thomas Utley, I believe, has not been in London long—I introduced the orders of them both to the firm—some years ago, Mr. John Utley, another brother, who was keeping a house in Tower Street, gave me orders for a great quantity of bottles, just before Christmas—they did not arrive in time, and he told me that he would never deal with Messrs. Powell any more; and, owing to that, Thomas Utley never gave them any orders; but in the last two years and a half I have been endeavouring to get their custom for the firm, and ulti<lb/>mately took an order from him for thirty two gallon stone bottles—I cannot tell you the exact date, but they went on the Thursday previous to the bill being paid—on the Friday I was at Mr. Truelove Utley's, soliciting orders for goods, and I said, "Have you heard anything of your bottles?"—he said, "They came in yesterday"—I said, "How do you like them?"—he said, "Very well"—he had told me that he had got a farther order, but would not give it to me till these were delivered—on the Saturday morning, I said to Oliver, "If you go with me down to Mr. Utley's, I have got my cart and will drive you, and no doubt they will pay you, and you can take his order for the others"—it was not my place to receive the money—we went down, and Mr. Utley paid for the twenty-seven two gallons—I said, "Mr. Utley, what about the others?"—he said, "Well, I have got an order for you from my brother at the Causeway"—I took out one of my bill heads, similar to this, and wrote it on that—he gave me an order for another gross and a half of gallon bottles, marked, and of three various sizes; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then gave me an order for half a gross of one gallon stone bottles, and half a gross of half gallon stone bottles; that was for his brother—I then said, "What do you want for yourself?"—he said, "I want one gross of quarts, stone, and one gross of pints"—they were to be lettered, "D. Utley, Eltham Place, Dover Road," and those for his brother were to be printed, "T. Utley, Wine and Spirit Stores, Newington Causeway"—I explained that if the name was on a seal, instead of down the side, one seal would do for all the bottles—he said, "You had better call at the Cause<lb/>way, and tell my brother the difference, as 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would do for the whole three sizes"—we drove to Newington Causeway, at half past 12 o'clock—I saw Mr. Thomas Utley, and said, "I have got an order of your brother for some bottles for you"—he said, "Well, I think half a gross of stone bottles, gallons, would be too many for me"—I said, "As they are ordered, you had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260103"/>
               <p>better have them now"—he said, "I do not know where I shall put them"—he did not seem to care much about it—I came with Oliver up to the stores, and had a similar bill made out, and laid the pen on the desk for him to copy it into his order book—the price was never mentioned—the order was given not to Powell and Ricketts, but to me—I laid this paper on the desk, and said, "I can cart these goods myself, and I will pay you cash when I fetch them away"—I said, "The price I am going to charge for the glass bottles will be 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for pints, and 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the half pints, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the other sizes, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for engraving the seal for the lot"—the price for the gallon stone bottles was to be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the half gallons 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the quarts 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the pints 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote it in pencil against each item, and he copied it to a certain extent—some one came in, and he could not finish it, and I left it with him—on the following week I had occasion to go there for some plain stone bottles, which I paid for and took away, and had an invoice made out in my own name.</p>

On 15th Sept., between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was on board a police galley, and saw a barge laden with butts lying outside the Victoria Dock entrance, made fast with a rope—I saw three men on board of her—I drew my galley closer, and watched for about a quarter of an hour—during that time the barge had been unfastened, and drifted nearer to me—I then saw two of the prisoners on top of a barrel, and the other had a rope in his hand, in the act of checking the barge—I then heard a man in the barge <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, "Is there anybody in that barge?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Why to h—do not you come and hawl your own barge down, for I am d—if I am going to do it," letting go the rope—they then came to the eddy, and the barge was drifting without any guide—a butt was on the stretcher of the barge—that was the one I found tapped—I stepped into the barge, and turned my light on—I had seen something spirting from a hole in the butt, and the prisoners were near enough to touch it—it was about the height of their breasts as they stood up—Wall walked round behind me on the barges behind—I ordered a constable to fetch him, and at that moment Taylor dropped this pint pewter pot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and beer fell from it—I found two pieces of wood, two inches and a half long, projecting from the cask, very clumsily put in, and beer draining from one of them—they were not proper spiles—I drove them in with my knife, and cut the ends off—on searching, I found this piece of wood, of the same sort, and several chips; also, this gallon stone bottle full of beer, without any cork—it had a rope to it—it was in the head sheets—I examined the other butts, and there was no leakage—I said, "Halloo, what game is this? what business have you here? your lighter is Inside"—they said that they had come to assist Taylor—I said, "Instead of assisting him, you are putting him away"—it was Taylor's master's barge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Harman, of No. 17, Dorset Street. I know the house where Davis and his wife lived—my house is facing the door of theirs—my husband being out on the Tuesday, I was sitting up for him; when he came home, I went up to the top of the street with him</p>

               <p>to the William public house to have a drop of beer with him—we came back; my husband went into the yard; I went up stairs—I heard a noise, and opened my window—I heard Mrs. Davis screaming "Murder!" and the little child crying out "You are killing my mother"—a few minutes afterwards Mrs. Davis rushed out of the passage across the road to me, put her hands up, and said, "Oh dear, Mrs. Harman"—I ran down stairs immediately, as fast as I could—when I got to the door, she had got across the road to Mr. Phillips, and fell in his arms—I ran back again as fast as I could, and screamed for my husband to fetch a doctor—her throat was bleeding very fast—I took her in my arms—she died a few steps from her own door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at No. 30 A, Grosvenor Mews. The prisoner and his wife live in rooms adjoining ours—it is a different house, but only the wall separated them—on 17th Aug. I was in company with Mrs. Moody after 11 o'clock at night—when I returned home she was in a neighbour's room—we went to the Coach and Horses, I and my hus<lb/>band, Mrs. Turner and her husband, and the deceased—this was about a quarter or 20 minutes past 11 o'clock—we were at the Coach and Horses about ten minutes—we had half a pint of gin there among the five—the deceased merely tasted it; she drank about a spoonful—I cannot say whether she had had anything to drink before that; I was not at home—she appeared to have had a glass, but was not at all tipsy—I think she had had a little—I left the Coach and Horses with her about 20 minutes to 12 o'clock—I saw her go into her own house—I went into mine—I am able to hear in my room what passes in hers—I am certain she went into her room; I could hear her there—I went to bed directly—between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning I heard the prisoner come home in the next house—I had been asleep, and the dog barking awoke me—the prisoner came into his room, and shut the door, and began d—g his wife, and calling her filthy names—he said, "You d—b—, where have you been? where have you been?"—that repeatedly, three or four times, and "Who have you been with? where did you get the drink? where did you get the money?" repeating the words a great many times—she said, with a cry, "I have not any; I have not been paid"—after that I heard him say, "Hold up your head, hold up your head, hold up your head;" and I heard three distinct blows struck—he said "Hold up your head" after I heard the blows—I heard no more after that—about 8 o'clock the prisoner called me, and I went into his room—he said, "Here is a pretty thing; I came home, and found her beastly drunk"—I said, "No, not beastly drunk; she might have had a glass, but she was not beastly drunk; but I heard you beat her through the night"—he said, "I only hit her with my open hand; I hit her a pat or two with my open hand"—he then said, "What shall I do? we are going out for a day's excursion; I am nearly mad; I have a d—good mind to take the hammer and finish her"—he was very much agitated at the time, but he appeared to be quite sober—he said, "Look on the floor; that is what has flowed from her mouth while she laid on the floor; I do not know how long she had been there"—the deceased was then lying on the bed; she was quite cold—she was not under the clothes, or covered up; she had got her petticoat and stockings on—she had not undressed the previous night; she had her gown off; she never wore stays—I saw something on the floor; it appeared as if she had vomited there—I felt her, and spoke to her several times, but she was insensible—I remained there a few minutes—the prisoner said, "I would give the best 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that ever was, if her face was not like that"—her face was bruised very much, from the back of the right ear down to the neck, and her eye was entirely closed; the lid was very much swollen—I was then called out of the room—I said I would come in again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260115"/>
               <p>presently—when I went back the door was fastened, and I could not get in—I knocked several times, and I went through a person's room to the front door, and that was locked also—there are two entrances, one by my door, and one in Bruton Mews—both doors were fastened—I called to her several times during the day, every twenty minutes or so—there was a little piece of wood in the door that I knocked down, so that I could put my mouth quite inside the door and speak to her, but I never got any answer from her during the day—Mrs. Turner was with me all the day—she fetched a policeman—he broke open the door, and I went in with him, and my husband, and Mrs. Turner—the deceased was on the bed, as I had left her in the morning—she had never moved—the policeman spoke to her first—she was sensible—we roused her, and I asked her if she would have some tea—she said, "Yes," and I gave her two cups of tea—she spoke very little—I went out, and met the prisoner in Cork Street—he said, "Have you seen my beauty to-day?"—I said, "Yes; I have had a policeman, and opened the door, and given her some tea"—he said "I have prayed to God all the day that I might find her a corpse"—I went on—I afterwards went to her room again, and we washed her, and put her to bed comfortable—I and to the prisoner, "Are you going to fetch a doctor?"—he said, "Oh, yes," and he went for one—when I washed her I saw no bruises about her body—she was quite wet with vomit all over the shoulders—I was there when the doctor came—he sent some medicine, which I gave her—I attended to her all the next day, while the prisoner went out fishing—I did not do anything for her after that day, merely ran in to see her from time to time until 29th Aug., when she was taken to St. George's Hospital—I went with her, and the prisoner also—he told the doctors that she had fallen out of bed in a fit—I cannot say to whom he said that; there were five or six round—I had never had any quarrel with the prisoner before this—he was always a very good neighbour—I had a dispute with him afterwards, before this charge was made against him—he used to come out every now and then and abuse me very much—I had great forbearance with him, which he took me before the Magistrate, Mr. Bingham, on 22nd Sept., and made me pay for—I was fined two guineas, or one month's imprisonment—I do not know what it was for—he said that I hallooed up and down the street at him, "There goes the murderer; there goes the thief; that is the man that killed his wife"—I never said such a thing—I told the policeman, who opened the door, the state she was in, and that I did not think she would ever get well.</p>

               <p>the open hand; the appearances were so considerable, they extended over the entire lace and neck—the hand would cover that space, and I believe now that it could have been produced by the open hand—it appeared to me to be more likely to be by the open hand than the fist—the fist would have made a different impression, and there would have been more discoloration—I think it must have required a very severe blow to produce the swelling and contusion I saw—the prisoner remarked, either then or previously, that she must have fallen out of bed, otherwise he could not account for it—the bed was very low; in my opinion, a fall from the bed could not have pro<lb/>duced the appearances I observed—I attended her up to 28th Aug., at their own residence, and on 29th she was removed to the hospital—she had reco<lb/>vered to a considerable extent—she recovered the use of her limb, she was able to stand and walk a little, but finally she relapsed, when she was taken to the hospital—I did not see her there alive—I saw the result of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; I saw the brain—there was considerable effusion of blood; it appeared to be of some days' standing—it would have caused the partial paralysis I had observed—I did not observe any other injury about the deceased, except those on the head and face—the effusion was the con<lb/>sequence of a rupture of some small vessel; any violence affecting the head might produce that—I attribute the cause of death to the violence on the head and face—I observed no other violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The proximate cause of death was the effusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that effusion might be caused either by violence, or by disease, apart from the circumstances of the case—similar appearances would be presented after death in a case of apoplexy, whether the apoplexy resulted from disease or from violence: the appearance of the brain in the two cases would be different—if I had been called upon to examine the interior of the skull, without having been told anything of the circumstances of the case, I cannot say that I should have said that the proximate cause of death was apoplexy—I should have expected to find an indication of the brain, or the vessels, being diseased—apoplexy from disease generally occurs in the centre of the brain, in the substance of the vessels, not where we found it here; this was over the right hemisphere, between the membranes, on the surface—the brain was exhibited to me after it had been taken out of the head—that did not give me so advantageous an opportunity of judging as if I had seen it actually taken out—from only seeing this brain, I should not have been able to decide as to the cause of death, decidedly not—Mr. Holmes showed me the brain—it has been the case that persons have died of apo<lb/>plexy, and, upon a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, no disease of the brain has been apparent, but not with the blood in the position this was found, to my knowledge—anomalous cases are found, and this case was one—you can sometimes trace where the exact rupture is—I did not do so here—in cases of effusion of blood, I believe a vessel must be ruptured, either by disease or by violence—you do not always find fracture of the skull where a vessel is ruptured by violence—it is so as a rule, but not without exception—it is more generally so—extravasation is frequently found between the scalp and the cranium when a blow has caused effusion of blood—the proximate cause of death was the effusion of blood—I certainly do pledge myself that the effusion was caused by violence, knowing the history of the case—I do not think, in this case, that the apoplexy might have been superinduced by intoxication, because I saw the amount of injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am curator to the Museum of St. George's Hospital. I examined the body of the deceased there—there were no bruises about the body—there was an extravasation of blood over the surface of the right side of the brain, between two of the membranes, of very considerable thickness, and apparently of many days standing—it was partly solid and partly fluid, as if the blood had been extravasated or effused at different period, the solid parts having lost their colour a little—I should suppose there had been different extravasations, but it is entirely a matter of opinion—I could not say with what interval—I mean that one extravasa<lb/>tion had gone on and stopped, and then another had occurred at a different period, then a third, and possibly more—the first extravasation must have been of several days' standing, because the blood had partly lost its colour; if it had been of several weeks' standing, I think it would have been more firmly adherent—I think it very possible that a part of that extravasation might have taken place a fortnight before I made the examination, which was on 31st Aug.—I do not think it is possible to date these things with any accuracy—the texture of the brain was perfectly healthy, except that one of the ventricles was slightly distended with fluid—the deceased was stated to be thirty-five years of age—I could not come to any conclusion as to what part of the brain the ruptured vessel was in—I searched pretty carefully, but all the vessels I had the opportunity of examining appeared perfectly healthy—of course there must have been a rupture of some vessel, but I could not find it—there was sufficient effusion on the brain to account for death—that was the cause of death—I showed the brain to Dr. Trouncer—at the time I made the examination, I had heard that the patient had received a blow on the eye—I heard that casually—I forget who told me—there were no appearances of any such blow, or of any external injury at the time I made the examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If you had examined the head without any previous knowledge of the facts, would not your conclusion have been that the patient died from apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in my judgment—that was my opinion, and that was stated in the certificate—Mr. Potter, and several other gentlemen, were present at the examination—apoplexy sometimes takes place where no visible cause is present—there were no external appearances of violence that I could make myself sure of—where effusion on the brain is induced by external violence, we generally find a fracture, more often than not—there was no fracture here—there are cases in which persons have lived for months, and even longer, with extravasation of this kind produced by violence, and</p>

               <p>they occasionally recover altogether—it is usually the case that persons die in a shorter period.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house apothecary to St. George's Hospital. I remember the deceased being brought there, on 29th Aug.—the prisoner and Mrs. Appleton accompanied her—she was then slightly sensible—I asked her if she had any pain in her head, and she tried to put her hand up—she had all the appearances of apoplexy—there was a drooping of the eyelid, and partial paralysis on the right side—there was the very slightest possible mark on the top droop of the eyelid—it was so slight that I took no notice of it—it was a slight discoloration like the end of a bruise—she died on Sunday—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination made by Mr. Holmes—at the time the prisoner came with the deceased, he told me that she had had a fit, and had tumbled out of bed, and he thought she had hurt her head—Mrs. Appleton was present so as to hear that—she made no observation to me at all on it—she did not contradict it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner further say, in your hearing, that his wife had had two previous fits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him if she had ever had a fit before, and he said, "Yes; two"—I attended her throughout as labouring under apoplexy—I saw Mrs. Appleton in the ward after she went to bed, but I never saw her afterwards—she never made any statement to me of any violence towards the deceased—it was my opinion, from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, that she died from apoplexy—I have attended a great many <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations—this was an unusual form of apoplexy, but not one. that you could object to—the effusion was in the cavity of the arach<lb/>noid, and not in the substance of the brain itself—it is most usual to have a fracture of the skull where effusion is produced by external violence, and extravasation of blood under the scalp—intoxication is one of the exciting causes of apoplexy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does death sometimes occur from external violence, without any fracture of the skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there are such cases, but I am not quite prepared to say—they are very rare—if a person were in a state of intoxication at the time external violence was used, she would cer<lb/>tainly be more disposed to have the vessels ruptured, and death would be more likely to ensue, because she would have congestion of the brain.</p>

               <p>give us every assistance in his power—I told him that at 12 o'clock that night the affair would be out of my hands entirely, but that I should return again in half an hour, when I expected he would have a statement to make that would prevent further disagreeable proceedings—I then left him—I returned in half an hour, and asked him if he had anything to say—he said that he had been over to a friend of his, but that his friend was out of town till evening, and would not be there till next day—I asked the name; he Briley—I asked the address; he said No. 78, Kent Street—I told him to remain where he was, and that I should go round to Briley's—I went round to Briley's place, but did not see him—I subsequently saw him in the neighbourhood with an officer, and he accompanied us; but when I found that Briley was not there, I went back to Pritchett, and took him with me to show me Briley's stables, and when I came back with Pritchett, Briley was standing outside his door in Kent Street—the stables are in Castle Street—Pritchett pointed him out as Briley—after searching the stables we all went back to Pritchett's house—I told Pritchett that the more I saw of it the worse it appeared, that it seemed more and more suspicious; that he had a name and a business, and that if he knew of the thieves or of the property, to give me the information in reference to it, and on my word of honour as a gentleman, I would assist him to the best of my power—he said, "Do not move in this affair any further till 9 o'clock to-morrow, when every hair you have lost shall be returned to your office"—I said "No; the affair is gone too far for any compromise, and to-night shall settle it"—we then went on to Pritchett's house, went in, and saw the foreman with a spade in his hand, and saw a cask buried in the earth, but not covered—on opening that cask we found the bristles which are produced here—they ought to have been all in blue paper, each done up in a parcel—when they are used as samples the paper is torn off—we always send them out in blue paper—the bundles would tumble to pieces if the paper was torn off—these cost 800 francs the case, less 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. discount—the cost is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, reckoning the freight and other expenses—the selling price was then about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that these were bought very cheaply—I asked Pritchett to give me the proportions of the case which the man had given to him, and the weight of each size of bristles—he took some torn pieces of paper up from a corner of his office, and, putting them together, showed me a list of the contents—I have not got it—I left it there, not thinking it of any particular consequence—I know that the proportions in the case were peculiar—I never opened it to see, but I had given the orders myself for it's preparation—the ordinary cases contain a certain number of each size—a written order is given to our house in Paris.</p>

               <p>they run through to Great Dover Street, and he has both houses—no one was present when I first saw him, that was the same occasion that I had the conversation with the foreman—when I returned from the stable, I stated that he had a name, and a business, and a wife and children—I did not say "five children"—I also said, "I entreat you, if you know anything of these thieves, give me the information that I may get them"—he was throughout the whole conversation very much agitated—the long bristles are the most valuable—the value depends on the proportion of size in a quantity, and on the colour and strength—the price varies at different times—our firm buy bristles—we are not commission agents—we did not expect to make a large profit—Mr. Joseph, the senior partner, arranges the price—I have taken measures to look after Tom Harden—I cannot get at him at any time I like, I should be glad to put my finger on him—I have not said that I could do so; I have said that he was under the surveillance of the police, and that they could put their hands on him whenever they chose; I was told so, and I stated so—I heard it on the same evening that I went to Pritchett's, and it was there that I stated it—I have only made a memorandum of what took place on one occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I am a manufacturer of bristles, and reside in Paris. Messrs. Joseph and Turner are customers of our's, in London—in Sept. last we manufactured a case of bristles to their order—Messrs. Delavalle and Forey, in Paris, are agents for the house in London; Mr. Forey gave me the order—the bristles were prepared by numbers; the case was 100 kilogrammes—they were tied up in blue papers, like these, and were marked on the root—I identify these as part of them (<hi rend="italic">Opening a fresh packet</hi>)—I believe well that these are my bristles, but I cannot seriously affirm it—I recollect the composition of the case from memory, but it is also written in my books—there were fifteen kilogrammes of No. 2, sixteen of No. 3, twenty-seven of No. 4, twenty-seven of No. 5, ten of No. 6, and five of No. 7; there were none of No. 8—that was the only order we have made containing No. 7—the order was sent in my vehicle to the house of Delavalle and Foret.</p>

               <p>made the entry in the book—he is in Paris—all workmen can work them from the root—it depends on the parties for whom they are wanted whether they are worked from the root or the flag—if they are ordered on the root I deliver them on the root—we do not keep many in stock—we deliver as we make them according to order.</p>

On 13th Oct., I went to the back of Albert Street, about half past 1 o'clock, in the morning, and found the two prisoners concealed in a washhouse, in Arlington Street, which abuts on Albert Street—I knew there was some one there, and I got some constables and placed them at the places where I thought any one could escape, and three or four went with me to search at the back; we went to No. 19, to search for them, and found the two prisoners concealed in the washhouse, lying down beside the copper—they were not lying down when we went to the door—they did so when we forced the door—we traced their foot marks there—I took them into custody—they resisted—when I took them to the station house, these two coats were on a rail, and on searching both pri<lb/>soners, I made them pull their coats off, and threw them on the rail by the side of the other two that were left there, and I gave Allen one of the other coats to put on—he said, "It is not mine"—Smith said, "It is mine"—I said "He owned that coat, you see," and then he noticed it, and said, "No, it is not my coat," and pulled it off again—he heard what I said—there was a necktie taken from Allen, which was on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the coat that Smith put on.</p>

On Saturday, 5th Sept., about half past 12 o'clock, I went into my employer's engine shed; there were four engines there, two of them in pieces, undergoing repair—the things were all right then, and in their proper place—I saw these pieces of brass there on the Saturday—I went to the shed on Monday at half past 1 o'clock, and found several parts of the engines lying on the floor, all deranged—they had been moved, and the brass taken out from them—even the duplicate parts of an engine will not fit with the engine itself—this is a piece belonging to one of the engines where the brass was taken off—it is marked with a cross, and so is the brass; so that any individual who is a mechanical man would know how to fit this engine so as to be ready for it to work—if this had been lost, it would have cost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fit up, perhaps more—I do not know the prisoner; I might have seen him there, but I do not remember having done so—I recognise this brass as being the property of Sir Samuel Morton Peto.</p>

On Mon<lb/>day morning, 7th Sept., about 9 o'clock, Baker came to my house, and asked me if I would lend him a horse and cart, to fetch an acquaintance of his wife's from London Bridge station—he brought them back about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I said I thought he had been longer than he ought to have been—he said that the person did not come by the train that he expected, but he said the horse had had no harm, as he had given him some corn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Bow. On 21st Sept., a few minutes past 10 o'clock, the boy Pearcey was brought to my surgery—he was not then dead—he died in about eight or ten minutes afterwards—the cause of death was a wound in the <hi rend="italic">aort A.</hi> which is a large vessel emerging from the heart—the wound was caused by a sharp pointed cutting instrument with one edge only—a small bladed knife might do it—it was from about an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half in depth—it entered between the second and third ribs—I do not think it would have required any force to pull the knife out again—in my opinion, the boy could not have walked or run six yards after the blow was inflicted—I do not think he could have spoken afterwards.</p>

On 21st Oct., when Hodgkins was brought there, he was in a perfect state of insensibility, he died in two or three hours—I was present at a part of <hi rend="italic">the post mortem</hi>, examination—I believe the cause of death to have been a blow—the remote cause was effusion of blood into the cavity of the skull, thereby compressing the brain; the immediate cause I believe to have been a blow whilst in a state of intoxication, the vessels thereby being in a fall or congested state.</p>

I was in Rosemary Lane on 29th Sept. about 3 o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoners—I saw Burke first, then Clarke came up, and two more men—Burke was holding on to the prosecutor, and taking his jacket off his back—Clarke was in front of the prosecutor, and he took his black silk handker<lb/>chief off his neck, and put it up the left side of his guernsey, and he was over<lb/>hauling his pockets—I saw Burke taking his jacket—this is it—it is what I call a pea jacket—it is the same—I never lost sight of it—I followed Burke to the pawnbroker's—I saw her go in, and saw her out again—Clarke was standing outside, waiting for her—he went as far as the pawn<lb/>broker's door—he did not go in—I was about five yards from them at the outside—I would not go too close, in case I might be observed by them—I never left them above five yards, till I saw them in custody; the other two men went to the pawnbroker's, and waited outside, like Clarke—they were not doing anything—they were looking on—I gave information, and they were taken just outside the public house, in Cable Street—I am posi<lb/>tive the prisoners are the persons—I never lost sight of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a frame manufacturer, of No. 9, King Street, Covent Garden, and am employed occasionally to sell pictures on commission. On 24th July the prisoner called on me, and said that he had a picture by Linnell, and if I showed it to Mr. Fitzpatrick he would buy it, as he knew him by sight, but not well enough to speak to him—I asked him whether it was a genuine picture by that master—he said, "It is, and Mr. Fitzpatrick has seen it"—I said, "Is it the one he saw at Mr. Smart's?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him that if it was not genuine I would have nothing to do with it, but, if it was what he represented, he could send it round, and I would show it—he asked me when I should see Mr. Fitz<lb/>patrick—I said, "In half an hour"—I had an appointment with him in the City—he deals very largely with me for frames—his pictures always come to</p>

               <p>my place—he said, "I will send it round in a case; it is not far off; but do not mention my name to Mr. Fitzpatrick"—he said that he was very much pressed for money, and would part with it at a sacrifice, and he should not like any one to know the price he sold it at—I went into the City direct, and afterwards found this picture left at my place (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it has "John Linnell" on it—it is exactly in the same state as when it was brought to me, and is in the same frame—it was inclosed in a rough case—Mr. Fitzpatrick came home with me—he opened the case, and asked me that I thought of the picture—I said I thought it was a great deal of money for so small a picture—Closs had told me to get him 135 guineas for it, and I asked 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Fitzpatrick that a party had brought the picture to me, and that it was the one he had seen at Mr. Smart's—he said, "Yes, it is," and asked me if I thought there was any doubt about it being genuine, and he took it up, and rubbed the name—I told him that I was not a sufficient judge to give an opinion on it, never having had one in my possession, and I thought he had better go to Mr. Linnell before he bought it—I told him that the person was pressed for money, and that it was con<lb/>siderably less than Mr. Smart had sold it to him for; and Mr. Fitzpatrick agreed to buy it if it was genuine—I told him that I believed it was genuine, from what I was told—he said that it was too far to go to Mr. Linnell's, as he should lose the train—I then told him to go and ask Mr. Smart, as the picture was painted for him—he said, "I will give 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and will go to Mr. Smart"—he went away, returned again, and said, "It is all right; Mr. Smart says it is the picture"—during his absence, I went and saw Closs, and told him that I could not get him what he wanted—he said, "If you bring me 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and when I came back, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, "Well, I will give you 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he went away with the picture, and gave me a cheque for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two bills of exchange, making altogether 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he told me distinctly to ask Mr. Closs about it being genuine, and if I could get a warranty I was to do so—I handed the cheque and two bills to Closs, and asked him if he would give me a receipt or war<lb/>ranty—he said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had been to Mr. Smart's, aha he would sooner have given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than he should have done so, and that Mr. Smart had said that it was genuine, and what more did he want—I said, "As you ay it is so, that is sufficient.</p>

               <p>satisfied that it was the picture, but if I could get a warranty I was to do so, and I was not to part with the bills unless Closs would say positively that it was the genuine picture by Linnell—I had not mentioned Closs's name but Mr. Fitzpatrick knew who it was, because he said, "It is a tall gentle-man with a moustache;" and I said, "I will not say that it is not"—Closs said, "If he is not satisfied he can have his money back, for I lose 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it."</p>

On, I think, 22nd July, I was at Mr. Smart's shop, in Titchborne Street, and saw a picture by Linnell; he asked 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I would not buy it—I have since ascertained that it was the genuine picture—on the 24th I went to Mr. Adams, and he told me he had got the picture in his shop for sale that was at Mr. Smart's; or, "I have got the picture by Linnell"—this is the picture that he then showed me—he told me that a gentleman had left it with him who wanted money for a bill, and who did not want his name mentioned at all—I said, "Did the gentleman say that it was the picture I saw at Mr. Smart's?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him the price of it—he first said 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I desired him to go to the gentleman and inquire the lowest price he would take for it, if it was the picture I had seen at Mr. Smart's—he came back, and we agreed on 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked if the gentleman would give a warranty with it—he said, that the gentleman would not have his name mentioned in the matter at all—I said, that I should take the picture to Smart's, and if he assured me that it was the picture painted for him by Mr. Linnell, I should be satisfied without a warranty—I went the same day to Mr. Smart's, but he was not at home, it being 7 o'clock; he had gone to Ham<lb/>mersmith, where he lives—I went next morning and produced the picture, to him; he looked at it, and I held it in the light at the door for him to see and asked him how it was that the gentleman did not come forward, and how he got it—he said that he got it on a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if it was a good bill; he said that he thought it was—I held the picture to him, and he said that there was no doubt of it being a genuine picture—it was the copy—I went back and told Mr. Adams that I was perfectly satisfied, having known Mr. Smart a long time—I bought the picture, but told Mr.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, V</hi> 303). I was on duty on 23rd Aug., near Battersea Bridge. About a quarter past 12 o'clock I heard A noise—I went on the bridge—a young man spoke to me—I cannot recognise him—he complained of an assault, but I did not interfere as I saw no assault committed—I saw Peter O'Brien clapping his hands together, and calling for any b—rascal to fight him—I desired him to go home quietly, and not be making any disturbance there—he said, "Is it for you that I am to go home? I will go home when I think proper"—he still continued to call for any rascal to fight him—I said it was better for him to go home quietly and not get himself into trouble, or I would be obliged to take him to the station—I did not see Simon at that time—Peter went towards home, and Simon joined him, and I followed in the same direction a few yards—I saw them quietly off the bridge—as I was following them, the young man who had spoken to me asked what was the reason I did not take him in charge, and I was explaining it to him—he asked my number, and said he would report me at the station—while I was talking to him Peter O'Brien turned back and came to me—he said he would not go home without fighting some b—rascal, and on that he struck me—I had not interfered with him in any way, except in saying what I have stated—he struck me on the head, and on the shoulder several blows—one of the women returned with him, and she got behind me, and put her arm round my body—Simon O'Brien came up and struck me several times on the left side of the head and the shoulder—one of those blows knocked me down—I fell against the kerb stone of the bridge—when I was down Peter O'Brien got on the top of me,</p>

               <p>and put his hands in my stock—my hat had fallen off—when Peter knelt on me Simon kicked me in the lower part of my stomach at the side while I was lying on the ground—I then became insensible—when I recovered my senses I found a person of the name of Henry near me—soon afterwards two constables of the A division came up—at that time Peter O'Brien had hold with his two hands in my stock—he was shaking my stock, and choking me—I desired him to let go—one of the constables tried to unfasten his hands from my neck, and could not—he then knocked Peter O'Brien down, and by that means his hands got loose—I had got up from the ground, and the two constables assisted me to the station—when the constables had knocked Peter down I found myself up—I was confined to my bed seven or eight weeks—I lost a great quantity of blood by the bowels—that stopped on Sunday week last—I did not know either of the prisoners personally—I might have seen them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a flannel and blanket merchant, of No. 72, Aldermanbury. The prisoner was introduced to me by a person named Knight, whom I knew something of—I asked him for a reference, and sold him a parcel of goods on credit, amounting to 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called on me on the 20th of the same month, May, and told me that he expected to haves contract with the French Government for blankets—he had given his name as Fould and Co., No. 3, Cannon Street, and told me that he was related to Monsieur Fould, the Prime Minister of France—he said on the second occasion that he expected to have an order from the French Govern<lb/>ment for blankets for the camp at Chalons, and he should have an order for me—I sold him a parcel of goods amounting to 113<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called on me again about the first week in June, and said, "I want you to get me some samples of blankets, to see if I can obtain that contract; they are going to be put before the French Government, and I want samples from you as well as from other houses"—I asked him what quantity he should want, and he wrote it on a paper, and gave it to me—I have looked for it, and cannot find it; I believe it has been torn up—I left my books and papers at the office of Mr. Child, the inquiry agent—it was an order for 200 or 300 blankets; fifty pairs of nine-quarters, fifty pairs of ten-quarters mediums, fifty pairs of nine-quarters supers, and fifty pairs of ten-quarters supers—a few days afterwards he called again, and told me that the goods had been placed before the Government, and said, "I have got the contract, and it is for you; you must supply the goods"—I said, "Very well"—the paper was in French, and I did not understand it—it was headed, "<hi rend="italic">Gouvernement de Francais</hi>"—he said, "Here is the contract for the French Government"—it was partly printed, and partly written—there was a printed form on one side, and when you turned over the leaf there was the order on the other—it looked like a very large order—I could understand the numbers, but not the writing—there was a column of figures—he said that he wanted 5, 000 pairs a month, or upwards, and a fortnight after every delivery I should receive the money for them—I procured the goods, and then went over and saw him at 3, Cannon Street—it is two or three offices, up three flights of stairs—I told him that a portion of the goods had come up, and said, "Where are they to be sent to"—he said, "Send them into Arnold's, the packers, in Barge Yard: shall I send a cart over, or will you send them?"—I said, "Just as you like"—he said, "Very well, let them lie at your place until I send a cart for them"—a cart arrived, and they were given into the charge of the carman in my presence—that order was not entirely completed—there were 200 pairs in the first lot—I delivered 200 pairs more on 18th June, and on 23rd June 100 pairs large size—he had told me on the 18th or the 23rd that he wanted larger sizes of the same qualities as I had sent in, and gave me an order for 100 pairs, which I got for him—he said something about a better class for the officers—I should not have parted with those goods if I had not believed his statement, that he had an order from the French Government—I last saw him between the 6th and 24th of Aug.—I found him there two or three</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stratford, and am foreman in Mr. Burford's manu<lb/>factory. I have been there ever since I was nine yean of age—when I came home on the day in question, I asked who broke the case of birds; my wife said a pig came in the place and ran underneath the table, and upset the case—I was very angry, and said I would keep the pig until I found the owner, and would make him pay for it—I asked my lodger to write a letter for me to take to the station house, on the Thursday; he said he would take it; he delayed it—I asked him for it on Friday; he gave it to me, and I took it to the station as soon as I had done work, about 9 o'clock—I went to where my brother-in-law works, and asked him if he would take the pig until I could find an owner, as I had got no place to keep it—he did so—when I went to the station they said they knew nothing about any pig.</p>

On 5th Oct., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I was at work in the garden—from information I received, I went round to the front of the house—the front door was open—it was not open when I left it—I missed this scarf shawl from the passage (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw some footmarks on a stone against the front door—they were not very large; like the toes—I had last seen the scarf hanging up in the hall about half an hour before—I saw two lads walking, dressed in black coats and caps—I only saw their backs—I went after them, and they ran away directly they saw me—they were a long way before me, and I lost sight of them—the prisoners are about the height of the boys I saw—I found a police officer, and told him—we went to Lewisham Bridge; near Hanover Street we met two boys—they were dressed like those I had seen in the field—they both turned round, and ran away—the officer ran after them, and we took them—I am sure the prisoners are the same persons—James said he would not go—he got hold of the policeman's leg, and threw him down—the policeman had hold of the other one—James got his coat torn down the back—they both got away—I did not see them again until they were in custody—the next morning I went into the field, and found this scarf shawl about 150 yards to the left, away from the direction in which the boys ran—it was under a hedge in a ditch—it was not in a place where people often walk—I believe there was no footpath there—it would take two or three minutes to go from the street door to where I found the scarf—when I looked out in that direction I saw two persons; I was not able to see them until they got some distance up the field, so as to be in a straight line—I could not see the shawl from the house, because of the ditch.</p>

                  </hi>., Q. C., <hi rend="italic">in support of the plea, contended that the wounding with intent to murder, charged in the first Count of the former indictment, and of which the prisoner was acquitted, was in effect the same accusation as the present. It was not disputed that it arose out of the same transaction and from the same wounding. It was clearly laid dawn in Chitty's Treatise on the Criminal Law, p.</hi> 455, <hi rend="italic">that it was not in all cases necessary that the two charges should be precisely the same in degree; it was sufficient that an acquittal of one would show that the defendant could not be guilty of the other. The present case fell within that principle; the wounding was the Same, the penalty was the same, death in either case. The mere fact of the death of the party wounded did not affect the question; for, although not the ordinary course, there was no reason why, if the death had occurred at the time, the prisoner should not have been tried for the very offence of wounding with intent to murder, of which he had been acquitted; nor would it have been any answer to such a proceeding to say that, because the man was dead, therefore the prisoner could not be tried on such a charge. It was analogous to the case of a party acquitted of a common assault, which he might plead in bar to any future indictment for a felonious assault, there being but one assault, and the felonious intention and the transaction being identical with the assault of which there had been a previous acquittal. As an authority for this proposition, see the Crown v. Robinson</hi>, 5 <hi rend="italic">Deas and Anderson's Reports</hi>, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">also</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">Law Chronicle, Regina v. Walker, 2 Moody and Robinson</hi>, 446. <hi rend="italic">upon these and other authorities</hi> (<hi rend="italic">to be referred to</hi>), <hi rend="italic">he contended that this case came within that principle of the law which declared that no man's life should be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MAHON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">apprehended that the Court would consider the case upon the record only, abstractedly of the facts. The plea stated that the prisoner was, upon a former occasion, indicted for cutting and wounding, with intent to murder, and that he was acquitted of that offence; the plea did not allude to any second Count, nor did the Crown reply that Count; he was therefore clearly acquitted of the wounding which caused the death, and the Court could take no notice of the grounds, of that acquittal; the acquittal was of the whole offence, of everything essential to be proved against him; for if it had been possible, on the facts, to convict of an unlawful wounding, the Statute enabled the Jury so to do. As to the general rule, that a party cannot be tried twice for the same offence, the learned Counsel referred to Blackstone</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Hale's Pleas, ch.</hi> 35 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 36; 4<hi rend="italic">th Cooke, p.</hi> 40, (<hi rend="italic">Darley's case</hi>), <hi rend="italic">Hudson and Lee; Yaux's case, Holcroft's case Sparrow's case</hi>; 5 <hi rend="italic">Cooke, p.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As to case of pardon, he referred to Hale's Pleas</hi>, 426; <hi rend="italic">Plowden</hi>, 401, (<hi rend="italic">Cole's case</hi>); <hi rend="italic">Cooper v the Hundred of Basingstoke</hi>; 7 <hi rend="italic">Modern Reports; also</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Salkeld</hi>, 614; <hi rend="italic">Holt's Reports</hi>, 638; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd Raymond</hi>, 826, <hi rend="italic">Hales and Pettit; Plowden</hi>, 262; <hi rend="italic">Cole's case, Nicol's case; Foster's Reports</hi>, 64; <hi rend="italic">and Rex v. Jenning, Russell and Ryan</hi>, 388. <hi rend="italic">From these cases he urged that, if the Crown, instead of prematurely proceeding to trial before the death, had granted a general pardon of all felonies and offences, it was quite clear that the prisoner could not have been afterwards tried for the murder, and the case was exactly the same upon pardon, punish<lb/>ment, or acquittal. The case of Rex v. Vandercourt and Abbott</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">East</hi>, 519, <hi rend="italic">and Leech's Crown Law</hi>, 316, <hi rend="italic">was very much in point; to an indictment for burglary, with intent to steal, was pleaded a former acquittal of burglary and stealing; but as, upon the first indictment, there was no proof of stealing it was held to be no bar to the second. This established the principle that unless the first indictment were such as the prisoner might have been convicted upon by proof of the facts contained in the second, an acquittal on the first indictment could be no bar to the second; and this principle was a very striking test to apply to the present case. He therefore submitted, as well upon the general principle as upon the authorities referred to, that, first, upon the ground of the pleadings, the prisoner had substantially been acquitted of this offence; and, secondly, if the pleadings were to be amended, and the Crown permitted to reply the conviction on the second Count, that, then the prisoner would be punished twice for the same offence.</hi>

                  </hi>. "<hi rend="italic">I believe we are all of opinion that this is not a good plea. The prisoner is, on the present occasion, indicted for murder, and murder may be committed without any intent to kill. If a man intends to maim, and causes death, and it can be made out most distinctly that he did not mean to kill, yet if he does those acts and use those means for the purpose of accomplishing that limited object, and they are calculated to produce death and death ensues, by the law of England that is murder, although the man did not mean to kill. On the former occasion the prisoner was charged with wounding, with intent to kill. The Jury found that he did not intend to kill, and there the intention was of the essence of the crime; that is not so on the present occasion; it is not necessary here to prove any intention to kill; it is only necessary to prove an intention to inflict an injury that might be dangerous to life, and that it resulted in death; that is quite sufficient to sustain the present charge. Try this by the very test which Mr. M'Mahon has presented to us; he says that it is no bar to the second indictment that a</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260182"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">party has been acquitted on the first, unless the facts proved on the second indictment might have produced a conviction on the first; why, a party may be convicted upon an indictment for murder, by evidence that would have no tendency to prove that there was any intent to kill; nay, by evidence that might clearly show he meant to stop short of death, and even took some means to prevent death; but if that illegal act of his produces death, that is murder. Two authorities have been cited with reference to an acquittal or a conviction in a Police Court; one of them was a case before Mr. Justice Coltman, which turned entirely upon a particular Statute</hi> (9 <hi rend="italic">Geo.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 91, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 28); <hi rend="italic">and as to the case in 5 Law Chronicle, it is evident that proceeded upon some Act applicable to Scotland; or, if it did not, I entirely dissent from the doctrine there laid down. The only suggestion that raised, for a moment, a doubt in my mind was from Mr. M'Mahon, to the effect that as acquittal of an assault with intent to kill, was an acquittal both of the assault and of the intent; but I think that is not so; the acquittal of the whole offence is not an acquittal of every part of it, it is only an acquittal of the whole; therefore the result of such an acquittal would only be, that the acts were not done with intent to kill; and although it was urged that, under a recent Act of Parliament, it was competent to the Jury to convict of unlawfully wounding, I am not sure, if the whole record had been before us, that that would have presented any sort of answer; but the record is not before us; all we have is, that the Jury acquitted the party of the wounding with intent to kill; that is the only thing we have to deal with. It appears to me, therefore, with reference to all the authorities that have been laid before us, that the two offences are not the same, that the plea cannot be supported, and that the prisoner must answer over. I am authorised to state that Mr. Justice Crompton and Mr. Baron Watson, before whom the case came at the last Session, have looked into the matter, and concur in the view now taken.</hi>"</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion. After alluding to the peculiar form of the plea, which omitted to aver the identity of the crime now charged, with that of which the prisoner had been acquitted, and which omission, in his opinion, was fatal to the plea, he referred to that portion of the argument founded upon the maxim in Hale and other authors, that no man could be tried twice for one and the same crime; that maxim presented a true criterion by which to test this question; was the crime here one and the same? now the offence for which the prisoner had been tried was one of intent, and was therefore complete the moment the stab was given; whereas, the offence for which he was now indicted, could only be consummated by the death of the party. To the mind of any lawyer, this must be deemed conclusive as against the plea, which, on the grounds already referred to, was not to be supported.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">gave judgment to the same effect. In order to support this plea, it must be shown that the former acquittal was an acquittal of all that state of facts which might constitute the party a murderer. Now, on comparing the two indictments, it was clear that the Jury had not so acquitted him; all that was then disposed of was, that he did not wound with intent to kill; it could not be assumed that they negatived the wounding; therefore, if the wounding, coupled with circumstances not showing an intention to kill, might constitude murder, the prisoner ought now to be tried for that offence; and that this might be the case, was clearly shown by the fact, that persons inflicting wounds whilst engaged in the commission of burglary or robbery, without any intention to kill, would be guilty of murder where death ensued. The learned Judge, after noticing the various points of the argument, concluded by observing that as, in</hi>

On Sunday night, 20th Sept., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I heard Mrs. Welch screaming, and saying, "You will kill me"—I jumped out of bed, and went to the door in my night dress—I saw Welch just within his own door, making, as I thought, towards the landing—I returned into my own apartment, locked the door, and went to bed—I heard no more—I did not see Mrs. Welch—I heard no screams after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Vauxhall Walk. On Sunday morning, 20th Sept., I was called by the prisoner about 9 o'clock—I went with him to his lodgings, and found his wife lying in bed in a state of partial insensibility—I aroused her a little—she complained of pain in her</p>

               <p>head—I examined it, and discovered a contusion over the left eye, and one on the eye to some considerable extent, over the orbit, near the eyebrow—it was a black eye—there was also a superficial bruise on the left ear—there was no abrasion of the skin, or wound of any sort—she was not perfectly insensible—she could answer, but very incoherently—I consider the wounds I saw to be the result of violence; but in what way produced, of course, I could not say—I should say one blow would be sufficient to produce what I saw—a blow with the open hand, given to a person in a state of intoxication, and a fall of considerable force against a hard body, would be sufficient to account for it—I attended her continually, and had hopes of her ultimate recovery, but she subsequently relapsed, and died delirious; I may almost say maniacal—I opened the head after death—on removing the skull. I found a quantity of extravasated blood which had escaped from a ruptured vessel beneath the left lobe of the brain—that blood had coagulated and caused the pressure, paralysis, and death—in my judgment, that was caused by violence—the clot of blood under the brain was just above the orifice of the eye—I think such a blow and fall as she is described to have received. would be sufficient to produce death—I found the liver considerably harder than natural, and its structure was diseased—I should say that the deceased was evidently a woman of intemperate habits.</p>

On 6th Oct. she came to No. 1, Durham Place—she wished to hire a perambulator for a lodger of Miss Smith, No. 6, Webber Row, Westminster Road—she did not say who Miss Smith's lodger was—I let her have a perambulator—she also said she wished to have another one after tea—she came after tea, and I let her have another—she said she would bring them home together—she did not bring them—I did not see her until the Friday after, at the corner of Kennington Road—I caught hold of her, and asked her where my perambulators were—she said she had not seen them, and she knew nothing of them—I am quite sure she is the person—the value of the perambulators was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I was on duty on board the Pollux steamer—I saw a number of casks of linseed oil—I examined four of them—I found them sound—I do not know whether the others were sound or not—I saw the whole of them—I did not observe any unsoundness, except in one cask, which was leaking at the head very much—it was leaking round the chine at the edge—there was no leakage from spile holes like these—I called attention to that particular cask—I saw some of the casks put into the barge, perhaps four or five—I did not see any of those leak, only the one—I mentioned to the mate to put it in a</p>

I recollect the prisoner being called before a committee appointed to consider what remuneration he should have for his collecting the tolls—the committee was appointed soon after 24th June, and they adjourned from time to time—I think the discovery of these defal<lb/>cations was made at our first meeting in July—we went through the accounts and made inquiries—the result was communicated to the prisoner at the first meeting, which I believe was in July; he was called in, and the subject was mentioned of defalcations, or a discrepancy in his book—his reply was, "All the money that I have received I have paid in"—I was not at that time fully aware of these matters that are inquired about now; not of my own knowledge—we proceeded to make inquiries—the prisoner was in attend<lb/>ance at the meeting of the committee—I believe he was outside the door—he attended the meetings of the committee and sub-committees—he was eventually given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Church Street, Highgate. On 1st Sept. I kept the King's Head, Meeting House Lane, Peckham—on that evening I went up into my bed room, at a little after 6 o'clock, and saw a box safe with 100 sovereigns in it, also a canvas bag with 100 or 102 sovereigns, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, with eight sovereigns rolled up in them, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes loose—I locked the door, but left the key in it—I had occasion to go to the drawer about half past 9 o'clock for some papers, and found the door wide open, the drawer broken open with a chisel, and the money gone, and the box except the lid—the blind of the front window was right up; there were no marks on it—there is a yard at the back of the house to the skittle ground, and a passage four or five feet wide—there is no difficulty in getting up from there to the window—a boy six years old could get up—there are two water butts, then the slates, then some wood work and a trough, and the back room window is about so high from the slates: that window was thrown open—there were footmarks across the bed, as if a person had come across it, and a chisel on it—a very small piece of candle was thrown on the front room bed—there is a yard at the back of the house, and a gate leading from there to the passage, at the end of which there is a very large lamp, and another at the front door—the door leading from the passage to the yard is always left open for people to go to the skittle ground—on that night I saw Brooks there—I had seen him there for a month previous, and in the skittle ground—I have frequently seen Richardson at my house, but cannot say whether I saw her</p>

Holloway" was on one of them—it was discovered that they had been paid in to somebody—there are not persons playing at I skittles every night—my potman attends to the skittle ground, but I know I there was no playing that night, for I had the key of the skittle ground in the bar—I always keep it locked till it is wanted—I gave evidence before the Magistrate next day—Brooks was not found then—policeman named Cox was there, but I do not know that he was in custody for that, only for a few words that he had said--l gave the evidence I have given to-day, but not against Cox—I do not think it was on 3rd Sept.—Cox was charged with saying that if he had had time that day he should be able to find out the man and the money—he was put at the bar alone while I was giving my evidence, but not for the robbery, only for saying that; but it was a romance that he made use of, it had no meaning in it—I was ordered to go to the station by Sergeant Bond, who told me Cox was in custody for making use of that observation—Coat has been in the habit of coming to my house two or three months—I did hot see him there on the night of the robbery; he may have been—he may have looked into the parlour at about 9 o'clock and said, "You look all comfortable; I will not disturb you"—I heard a person there say that, and they said that it was Cox, but I cannot say that it was—I do not know his voice—I saw him next morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and he said, in reference to the robbery, "What a bad job it is"—that was on the 2nd, and on the 3rd he was in custody, but I did not give him into custody—I swear that I saw Brooks at my house on the night of the robbery—I have never been asked the question before, but was always as certain of it as I am now—you will find that what I said on the 8th was just the same as I say now—I cannot say what Brown was doing, because I did not attend to the bar, but I saw him as I came from the parlour into my kitchen—my wife and my two boys of thirteen and fourteen were serving; they are not here—if he is convicted, I expect to get any money found in his possession.</p>
