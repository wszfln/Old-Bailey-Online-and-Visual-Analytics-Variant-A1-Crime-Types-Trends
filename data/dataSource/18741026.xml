                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks at the Marlborough Street Police Court—I was there on the 19th and 26th February—Parrock and' Cook were brought there charged with stealing a portmanteau, the property of Sir George Jenkinson—the defendant, Sergeant Brannan, was the first 'witness called in support of the charge—I took down the evidence that he then gave—no professional men were engaged on either side on the first occasion—Parrock cross-examined him—after other witnesses were called there was an adjournment until the 26th February—on that occasion Brannan was examined afresh—he gave his evidence again—I took it down—to the best of my belief Mr. Knox asked him if he would like to give his evidence again, entirely from the beginning, and he did so; he began again entirely—I thought his manner was very strange on the first occasion; I thought he seemed confused—his evidence was read over to him—I am not certain whether it was read over to him on that occasion; I think it was on some other occasion, and he signed it—I have the original depositions here—the charge sheet was put before the Magistrate—ultimately Tarrock and Cook were discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of the defendant on 19th February was read, in which he stated that at</hi> 12.30 <hi rend="italic">that morning he was in Talbot Road, Notting Hill, and saw Parrock and Cook standing by a green cart drawn by a grey horse; that he went up and they left; that he examined the cart and found the portmanteau; that the prisoners returned with a man not in custody, and kept going backwards and forwards near the cart, that he pursued them and lost sight of them, but afterwards took them into custody. In a further deposition on 26th February he stated that lie concealed himself in a doorway and saw Parrock come towards the cart with a man not in custody, place his foot on the step or wheel, and put his right hand into the, trap, and he and the other man then went round the corner in the direction of the Portobello Road; that Parrock returned with Cook and went of before they saw him, and he then came out and pursued them but lost sight of them; and that he then examined the cart and found the jemmy and knife; that on taking Cook into custody he told her it was for being con<lb/>cerned with a man in stealing a portmanteau, and that she first denied being with the man and then admitted it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The charge sheet was before Mr. Knox on the 19th—the magistrate never hears a charge without having the charge sheet before him; it is rather before me as the Clerk, and it is handed up to the Magistrate if he wishes to see it—it does not always contain a list of the property found—I can't say whether the knife and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was in it on 19th February—I did not know on the first occasion that Brannan had been thirty days on the sick list, and had only gone on duty the night before, until he stated it—I am not certain whether it was on the first or second occasion—it is, I think, correct that on the first occasion the Magis<lb/>trate addressed him with considerable severity—I have been there about seven years—I have seen persons confused before Mr. Knox, I don't know whether it has been when Mr. Kuox has addressed them—on the first occasion nothing was said, I think, about the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife—I have heard to-day, for the first time, that it was there in Court in the helmet of a police-constable—Mr. Knox allowed Parrock to go on his own recognizance on the first occasion, and Cook also—he remanded them for a week—I believe, on the second occasion, Brannan said that he was confused on the former occasion, and he asked to be allowed to give his evidence over again, and the Magistrate allowed that to be done—on that second occasion, besides Brannan, Varnham and Young were examined—on the first occasion there was Brannan, Varnham, Young, and Hart, police-constables, Edward Lee, the footman to Sir George Jenkinson, William Bryant, of 96, Stan hope Street, cab driver, and Henry West, the owner of the horse and cart—on the second day Brannan and Henry George, 360 X, were examined—there was then a remand till the 28th, when Inspector Hole and Henry Drewitt, 37 X, the sergeant who took the charge, were examined—Varn ham was recalled, Young recalled, Hannah recalled, and John Newman, the manager of the Green Yard, who found <hi rend="italic">the jemmy wad</hi> knife; that com<lb/>pleted the evidence—the prisoners then made their statements, and after that Ship and Goldsworthy and Richmond were called for the defence—I think on the second occasion Mr. Knox asked Brannan why he had not produced the knife <hi rend="italic">and jemmy</hi> on the first occasion; he asked about it generally, how it was that it was not produced—he discharged the prisoners on the 28th—I fancy Mr. Knox said that he was glad he had never kept the man in custody for a moment, that he had allowed him to go out on his own recognizance, and that the non-production of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260005"/>
               <p>was conclusive to his mind—he said to Parrock that if he wished to take out a summons or to proceed against Brannan for perjury he would give him the necessary process—when the perjury summons was applied for by Parrock Mr. Knox sat and heard the case—there are two Magistrates at Marlborough Street, Mr. Knox and Mr. Newton—any of the other Stipendiary Magistrates can sit there—on the occasion of the summons against Brannan Mr. Edward Lewis, I think, was the solicitor acting for Parrock—he called the witnesses—Mr. Warner Sleigh appeared for Brannan—the two constables, Ship and Goldsworthy, had been examined for the defence of Parrock on the 28th—I don't recollect whether Mr. Knox suggested that they should be called again on behalf of Parrock—I don't remember his making use of the expression that with regard to Parrock and Brannan he must hangone or the other—I think he said something to the effect that if he discovered the charge of perjury against Brannan, he should be imputing something to Parrock; and if he committed Brannan for trial he should be lending himself to the charge of Parrock—I think Ship and Goldsworthy attended and Mr. Lewis refused to call them—I think Mr. Sleigh protested, and said that they ought to be put into the box for the prosecution—f think Parrock stated that he could not find the woman Charlwood; she was known at the time as <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter—I believe Parrock said he had made every endeavour to find her and could not do so—I believe Inspector Eccles said he thought he could find the woman to-morrow—I do not remember whether she was there at the next examination—I remember Mr. Lewis refusing to call her—I remember Mr. Knox saying that she and Cook were not a bit alike—I now remember the two women standing there—I think Rose Parker or one of the witnesses said that looking at the women from behind she could not tell one from the other—I don't know of my own knowledge that Mr. Knox went to the place where the cart had been standing—I believe he did, I was not there—T believe that Charlwood was in Court, and that Mr. Lewis declined to call her—I think on the previous occasion there was a suggestion that Brannan was keeping her out of the way—I believe she never was called at the Police Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The examination of the witness on the first occasion took some time—Mr. Knox addressed Brannan with some severity—Parrock cross-examined him and asked him some questions which had some relation to police duties, and Brannan said "I decline to answer"—Mr. Knox desired him to answer and I think he then said "That has to do with police duty and I decline to answer"—Mr. Knox then said "Are you aware that I can commit you for contempt of Court if you do not answer the question 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>" or something to that effect—"I desire you to answer the question," and he then did so—Brannan was more confused in the examina<lb/>tion in chief; in the cross-examination he answered tolerably distinctly—on the second occasion he gave his evidence from the commencement; and he was then examined by both the defendants—he did not mention the knife and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the first occasion.</p>

               <p>Ship and Goldsworthy—they were in plain clothes—I heard one of them say to the other "Come on Jack, we will go this way," and they went in the direction of the Earl of Percy public-house—I knew them both as constables—I did not speak to them at all—I went after that into the Lancaster Road, and ultimately to the Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, and the woman left me there—I. don't know at all who she was; she was a woman I had picked up—from the Clarendon Road I went down Blenheim Crescent to the Blenheim Arms—I should say I had been in the woman's company about an hour—before I got to the Blenheim Arms I met George Richmond, who is an old friend of mine—we both come from Yarmouth—I can't say exactly whether I met him by appointment or by accident, I think it was by accident—I went with him to the Blenheim Arms; that was about 10.30, I believe; we remained there until 12 o'clock—before we left, Richmond asked the barmaid for a stamp—he got the stamp—I don't know to whom the letter was addressed—I saw the landlord there, and the barmaid and the potman—when we left the house was being closed—I spoke to the potman and bade him "Good night"—Richmond and I then went up Kensington Park Road a little way until we came to Elgin Road, and we went to Cuff's Post Office there—Richmond was not able to post his letter there, and we then went along the Elgin Road and up the Col<lb/>ville Road to the pillar box, which is just opposite the church, where Richmond posted his letter—after doing that we went westwards down the Talbot Road—I saw two constables there, Young and Hannah—they were standing against a cart—I did not notice the cart, but there was a grey horse in it—I should say it was 40 or 50 yards from the Portobello Road, and on the south side of the road—they would be between the comer of Colville Square and Portobello Road—they were in uniform—I knew them, and as I passed I spoke to them—I believe Hannah spoke to me first, and said "How are you getting on how are you off for-work—I said" Don't talk about work; it is time to go to bed"—we were standing against the "cart all four of us then, either Hannah or Young said "Good night," and went in the easterly direction; that is the way we had come—we went towards the Portobello Road, about 6 or 8 yards, and then I stopped because of the abruptness of Hannah; me and him were very good friends when we were in the Police, and he seemed very abrupt that night—when I stopped I said so to Richmond, and then we went on—I did not walk back a step—we went down the Portobello Road and parted company of the corner of Lancaster Road and Portobello Road—Portobello Road is a very long road and runs right through the Talbot Road—it was about 12.15 or 12.20 when we passed the cart, and about 12.30 or 12.40 when I parted company with Richmond—after I left him I went down Lancaster Road as far as Lad broke Grove Road and saw the same two constables who I had seen in Salter's Fields, Ship and Goldsworthy, and also a constable named George—there were four constables; they were taking some horses to. The Green Yard—we had some conversation, some joking—after they had gone I went a little way up Ladbroke Grove Road and down the Cornwall Road, where I spoke to a person I have since recognised as Caroline Charlwood—I did not know her at the time—I went with her up Bolton Road to the coffee stall kept by William Edney at the corner of Norfolk Terrace and Ledbury Road—I had passed the defendant, Sergeant Brannan, right against Cuff's, the Post Office in Portobello Road—Sergeant Varnham was. with him, and Hannah was standing against the shutters within 20 yards of them—I spoke</p>

It was on Ash Wednesday night that I first spoke to Parrock—I met him close to Cuff's Post Office about 22.50 or 12.55—I had been to the Metropolitan Music Hall—I walked from there to the Edgware Road Station and got out at Notting Hill—I stood talking to a young friend of mine there and got to Cuff's Post Office about 12.50 or 12.55—I was only with Parrock three quarters of an hour—I was after wards summoned as a witness to the Police Court—I was stopped with a paper in Portabella Road—I was at the Police Court when Brannan was committed for trial; that was on the 9th of April—I had not seen Mr. Barnard the Solicitor, or Brannan, or any one connected with the case at that time—I was only at Marlborough Street Police Court on one occasion, and on that occasion Mr. Lewis declined to all me as a witness against Brannan—I had come along Blenheim Crescent into the Portobello Road when Parrock came up and said "Where are you going to?"—I said "I am hurrying home, don't you think it is high time?"and then we went across by Patch's the baker's, and it was there I saw the three constables standing at the corner—Parrock came closer to me and said "I would not have them see me for a gold watch or a pension"—I said "Why not?"and he said "Nothing much"—I went with him up the Bolton Road to the corner of the Ledbury Road, and there I said I would have a cup of coffee, and he ordered two cups and paid for them, and before I could drink it my brother-in-law came up, and not wishing that he should see me out so late at night, I turned my back and walked away, and Parrock told the coffee stall man to put the cup on one side till-1 came back, and we walked to the arch and watched for my brother-in-law to go away, and we then returned and finished the coffee; we then left and went to the corner of West bourne Grove, where there is a letter pillar box, and it was there that we had the conversation about his being a policeman on duty, and he pointed to a place there, where he said the policemen were in the habit, of</p>

               <p>going down for a couple of hours to sleep in the cab or cabs, and he asked me to wait for him while he went to speak to a policeman whom he said had gone down the mews—I saw a policeman go by, but he walked straight up, he did not go down the mews—Parrock did not speak to any policeman although he said he was going to—I said that I would not wait—he asked me to go to a room with him, and I said no, I would go home—he said he was late the evening before and could not get to the station for his money, so that he must go there then, and could not stop—he said he would send me some money to the post office; that was when he was soliciting me to go to a room—I said "If you have a wife you had better go home to her"—he said he was a single man—it was the 27th April when Brannan took me by the railway to Mr. Barnard's office—I was not quite sober when I got there—Brannan was not there—I told Mr. Barnard I was not going to false swear for any one, and he said "The best thing you can do is to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth"—I made a statement to him, and put my name to it—he read it over to me before I signed it, and I said it was quite right—Mr. Barnard, I believe, told me I should have to attend the Sessions—I had a letter afterwards and went to Mr. Wontner's office—Parrock and Richmond took me there; that was after I had been brought here as a witness by Mr. Barnard, the solicitor, to whom I made that statement—when I went to Mr. Wontner's there was nobody in the room but Mr. Wontner's clerk when I made my statement—they called me and I went in the room by myself—Parrock and, Richmond went in before I went in—I have had half-a-crown each time I have been to Mr. Wontner's office—I have not had any other allowance since I have been a witness for the prosecution—I think I have had five or six half-crowns—it was not the first time that I was at Mr. Wontner's that I said anything about gin or being under the influence of liquor—I told Mr. Barnard, and I had told Richmond before I got to Mr. Wontner's—I said I was not right, I was not square—I don't believe I said I did not recollect what passed at Mr. Barnard's—the gin was given to me at Mr. Brannan's house—I went there at 11 o'clock or a little after and we came out at 3 o'clock; I was there four hours—we were not drinking all the time, we did stop a little while I believe—Mr. Brannan and his wife were there, and the servant girl who had got Mrs. Brannan's baby—I had some tea; I drank half my tea, and my cup was filled up with gin by Mr. Brannan—I had no more gin after I left Brannan's, they wanted me to have some, and I had a bottle of lemonade, that was going to the station—I was not so sober at 3 o'clock as I was at Mr. Barnard's at 4 or 5 o'clock—after I had been to Mr. Wonter's I saw Parrock and Richmond at Notting Hill; they got out at the same same station—I was in their company—I have not been in their company since—I have never seen Parrock until to day, only the sessions' days—I did not tell Mr. Wontner that what I was asked to swear falsely was that I had seen Parrock put the portmanteau into the cart—I said that I was asked to take that Parrock got up on the wheel and touched the portmanteau—I am quite sure it was not "Look at the portmanteau"—I have known R Richmond about three or four years—I was nursemaid to his children while his wife was ill in bed—that was about three' years ago—I am 18 now—I did not hear Richmond swear at Police Court that he had never known <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter—Edney told me I was known as <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter, and I said I did not know of such a name; I never heard it before—he stopped</p>

               <p>me in the Portobello Road, and said he had been offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to find me—I did not ask Mr. Barnard whether the evidence I was expected to give would do any damage to Richmond, or say that if it would I would not give evidence, as I had lived in his service—I said I had been in his service—I did not express a hope that what I had to say would not injure Richmond in any way—I did not see Parrock running while I was with him at all—I did not see the two officers Goldsworthy or Ship at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see any constables taking horses to the Green Yard—Parrock and Richmond went down to Mr. Wontner's and they said I should be wanted as well, and a piece of paper was given to me by Inspector Hole to go—I met Mr. Richmond and he went down with me—I went into the room and my statement was taken down—the statement produced here which I signed at Mr. Barnard's office was read over. to me—I understood that Parrock was a constable in plain clothes, and when he put his coat collar up I supposed it to be so that they should not take much notice of his face.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. This prosecution was not instituted originally by the Treasury, but after the case was committed for trial, Parrock not having the means to carry it on—I am not aware that Mr. Knox also applied to have the assistance of the Treasury—I had nothing whatever to do with the proceedings at the Police Court, nor had the Trea sury—I only know from the depositions that the committal took place early in April—at the first Session after the committal no bill was preferred, an application was made, on my instructions, to allow a Session to pass that I might prepare the indictment, as I only received instructions on the Tuesday</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 215). On the night of Ash Wednesday, 18th February, I went on duty at 10 o'clock—my beat was from the Elgin Road to the Cornwall Road and Talbot Road—about 12.20 I was in the Talbot Road and saw a cart standing there near the corner of Colville Square, between the corner of the square and Portobello Road—I did not see any one with it or near it—I walked up to it, just glanced inside and crossed over—I did not notice anything particular—I was joined by acting Sergeant Hannah—I spoke to him about the cart and called his attention to it—we crossed over the way to the cart, and Parrock and Richmond came along—we had then just got to the cart—they came from the direction of Westbourne Park, from the eastward, near the pillar post—Parrock said to Hannah "How are you <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>?" I did not catch Hannah's reply—I asked Parrock how he was off for work—he said "Work, what about work this time of night, bed is the best place"—we then bade them good night, and walked towards Colville Square—Parrock and Richmond appeared to be going in the direction of Notting Hill, that is towards Portobello Road—I had seen them coming along the Talbot Road 50 or 60 yards before they came up to the cart where I was standing—Hannah and I were both in uniform—I knew Parrock well; I did not know Richmond—there was no woman with them or following them—after they had passed on we examined the cart, and found in it a portmanteau covered with a rug—I found nothing else—Hannah then directed me to conceal myself in an area on the opposite side of the road—the cart was on the Colville Square 'side of the way—Hannah went away—I concealed myself in the area as directed, I should say about 13 to 16 yards from the cart—I could see the cart perfectly from there—I continued to watch the cart—after I had been there from ten to fifteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, I saw Sergeant Brannan come up, he was in uniform—he went towards the cart, and seeing the police were there I whistled and he came across to me—I said to him "You see the cart"—he said "Yes, yes, there are three men and a woman wanted for it, go up Portobello Road and detain Parrock and a female, I will bring the cart along"—I then came out of the area and went in pursuit of them; I went right up Portobello Road and looked about, I was not able to find them—I had left Brannan at the area, near the cart—after searching about for some time I came back into the Porto<lb/>bello Road and saw Sergeant Brannan and Sergeant Varnham—I had been away I should think three-quarters of an hour, or it might have been an hour—I and Brannan got into the cart, it was then in the Portobello Road, and we drove to Parrock's house—as near as I can remember it must have been about 12.35 when Brannan first came up—Parrock did not touch the cart at all, nor did he walk backwards and forwards in front of the cart; he simply did what I have described—there is no place of conceal<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260019"/>
               <p>in the Talbot Road except the areas, unless you go down a turning, but then you could not gee the cart—I should say the doorways there would not afford places of concealment—I did not see anything whatever of Cook or Charlwood—when we arrived at Parrock's house, which I think was a little after 2 o'clock, we found that he had not come home—Brannan and I went inside, and he searched the lower part of the house—Parrock came home about 3.30—I spoke to him, Brannan was not present, he was inside—I took hold of Parrock and told him that Sergeant Brannan wanted to see him, with that the sergeant came out of the gateway and, took hold of him and said "What have you been doing with that horse and cart," and I think "a portmanteau," but that I won't be quite positive of—Parrock said "What cart, I know nothing about it"—I then took <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the station—I was not present when Cook was taken into custody, I was outside the house minding the cart; she was taken from her own house—we took Parrock to the station first and then we went to Cook's—Brannan, Varnham; and Hannah, I think, went and apprehended her, I was outside minding the cart—I did not hear anything that passed between Cook and Brannan—she was afterwards brought to the station-pearlier in the morning, about 6 o'clock I saw Brannan in the passage at the police-station—Hannah and Varnham were there—I had found out at that time that the portmanteau belonged to Sir George Jenkinson—Brannan said to me "Look here Young, this is your case, let me have the handling of it, this portmanteau belongs to a big man, a Member of Parliament, if you don't let me have the management of it an inspector will poke his nose into it and do you out of it"—I said "You appear to know all about it"—he said "Yes, yes, leave it to me," or some words to that effect, I can't exactly remember the last words; that was all that passed then—afterwards at the Police Court, before Parrock and Cook were taken before Mr. Knox I again had some conversation with Brannan in the yard attached to the Police Court; I went up to him and said "Sergeant Brannan had I not better get in the witness-box first, you can then bring in what you know about the woman Cook"—he said "Oh, be b——d, you leave it to me, I will mix it up for the <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>," both Hannah and Varnham were there—Brannan was the first witness called, then Varnham, and then me—on the day that Partook and Cook were discharged, 28th February, I was outside an omnibus with Brannan, we were going from the Court to Notting Hill—Brannan said to me "This is a bad job, will you stick to me, and will you lean to counsel if questions should be put to you, that is supposing I get one"—I said "I can't alter my deposition"—he said "I know that, do the best you can for me"—I made no further reply then—on one of the occasions when Brannan was before the Magistrate charged with perjury I had some con<lb/>versation with him at the back of the Court; it was Hannah who was talking to him, I did not hear the whole conversation, it was something about the small fry should be got into it and that Brannan should get out of it, that was the rumor, and Hannah asked him if it was true—Brannan denied it, he said "God forbid"—I think I first heard that the <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> and knife had been found in the cart on the second hearing—I had not searched the cart sufficiently to see whether there was <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi> and knife there, they might have been under the straw.</p>

               <p>evidence; I believe Varnham had the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the first occasion; I saw it"—I said just now that I thought it was on the second occasion I saw it; I have been ill for a long time—I have been reported for willful misconduct on my beat, for neglect of duty, and being absent from my beat; also for being found asleep in an unfinished building when on duty, and on the same occasion for being Under the influence of liquor—I have been reported six times for what they term misconduct—I was fined 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for not being on my beat for an hour and twenty minutes—I was fined for being found in a fish shop, and afterwards going to a public-house and drinking when on duty—I was reported for drinking a cup of coffee in the middle of the night, not for being absent from duty in company with a man; that was not at Edney's coffee stall—I erased a name from a police book; I think it should be explained how that did occur; a constable signed in the wrong place on receiving his armlet, and I scratched it out; the inspector asked me next day if I knew anything about it, I said I did it thinking there was no harm in it, and I was reported for that—on 29th January I was drinking outside a public-house when on duty—I have been seven years in the police next January; I still remain a constable—I have never been reduced from one rank to another—on the first examination of Parrock and Cook, Brannan was the first witness, and then Varnham—I did not go in before Varnham because I was not called—Varnham is a sergeant; it is not usual for a sergeant to be called first if his name is on the charge sheet; it all depends who is called by the magistrate—I believe I stated pretty nearly what I have to-day—I have not said to-day that Parrock never passed the cart twice, what I said was that they made a move to walk away, and when we returned we saw them standing just about the same spot; I had only been gone about a quarter of a minute; they passed the cart once, they must have done, and then retraced perhaps a couple of steps—I say that they did pass twice; I swear that—after we left them we walked towards Colville Square; we returned in about a quarter of a minute, and saw they had moved further towards the cart; I can't tell how many paces we had taken; we turned and walked back again and found Parrock and Rich<lb/>mond just about the same place, they had moved a little nearer if anything—I saw them pass the cart twice, they passed it once, and retraced their steps two paces and then went away again; they did not absolutely pass it, but I call it passing if they came up against it; I should say they were up to the wheel—up to that time I had not seen Brannan—it is true that when we got up to them they walked away and disappeared—I think I said that Brannan moved the cart into the Portobello Road and left a constable in charge of it—I was told to watch the cart; I did so until Brannan came, and he directed me to follow Parrock and a female, which I did; the cart was then in the same spot; Brannan said he would bring it along—I said at the Police Court that he had moved it into Portobello Road and left a constable in charge of it; that was something I heard, and it was strength<lb/>ened by what Brannan said to me when riding towards Parrock's house, that he wished he had not moved the cart, so I naturally concluded that it was so—I may have said on the first examination that Brannan said to Parrock that he should take him for stealing a portmanteau, and I think a horse and cart; I think what I did say was for stealing a horse and cart, and I think a portmanteau, but I may have reversed it—in my cross-exami<lb/>nation by Parrock on 19th February I said "i saw you pass the cart twice, you passed it before Brannan came up;"That is true; I might have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260021"/>
               <p>said "I met you against the cart about 12.30 or 12.35;" it was nearer 12.30 than 12.35 I think; at that time I did not believe that Parrock was concerned in receiving the property, or helping the man who had driven the cart up; I did not believe a word of it, I never believed from the first that there was a feather's weight of evidence against them in my opinion—I gave the evidence to the solicitor as to what Brannan said "Look here Young, this is your case, let me have the handling of it;"That conversation took place in the passage of the Police Station, Notting Hill, about 6 o'clock in the morning—Hannah and Varnham were present and heard it—I did not report that conversation to the superintendent or inspector—I did not say a word about it when I was examined against Parrock and Cook, or at the several examinations against Brannan—I was called twice I think—I think I mentioned it to Mr. Wontner about three Sessions ago; I believe it was in August; I believe it was read over to me, and I put my mark to it—I don't think it was taken down in short hand—Varnham was not present at the time I made the statement; not inside—Hannah was inside and Inspector Hole—I believe it was read over to me—I don't think I made any alteration in it—it was at the same time that I mentioned the conversation about getting first into the witness-box—I was not anxious at that time to get Parrock and Cook committed for trial, because my impression from the first was that Brannan had been the cause—the first conversation was in the passage, a little after 6 o'clock, and the second one at the yard of the Police Court, just before the case came on, about 11 o'clock—I said nothing about it till I went to Mr. Wontner—the conversation outside the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was on the dismissal of the charge against Parrock and Cook—Hannah was present then, he was present at all the three conversations, and at Mr. Wontner's when I gave the details—after the charge of perjury was made we met Mr. Knox at the spot—Mr. Knox did not advise me to resign, if he did it was not in my hearing—I do not suffer in my sight, I am not short-sighted—they do not say so at the hospital, frat I know of, or that my sight is unequal; the sight of my eye is not defective, the. left may be a trifle defective, but nothing to speak of—I was not 39 yards off the cart when I was in the area; I should say at the utmost it was 17 or 18—there was a lamp alight very nearly oppo<lb/>site, some few yards away—I was not so far from the cart as the Blenheim Arms, I was nearly opposite the cart—a person might see it 80 yards off, but I should question it very much—Mr. Knox said at the Police Court that I had no more right to be in the force than Parrock had, and that I ought to resign—what you asked me just now was whether Mr. Knox did not tell me to resign, and I say no, he did not advise me to resign—I can't say the exact words Mr. Knox used, I think he said "One was reported and the other discharged, and I can't see why the other was not discharged," or words to that effect—there was no light between me and the cart, the light was to the right, close to the kerb, on the opposite side of the way to the cart—part of the pavement at the side of the cart might be in shadow, I did not notice shadows, I looked after the cart—I was down the area—the houses there have portico's—I don't think anybody could call themselves concealed there except in the area, because anybody coming by could see them—I did not see the horse driven up—I believe Hannah tied the reins to the wheel—I did not see the man get out of the cart and go into the public-house; I did not see anything about the cart's arrival—my duty was in Talbot-road—I did not see the charge-sheet—I don't remember</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the service of the Great Western Railway Company—I was formerly in the Metropolitan Police Force—resigned; my time expired on the 30th June—I left of my own accord—I had been in the Force four years and a month—on the night of the 18th February I was acting sergeant—I left the Notting Hill Station to visit the men about 9.45, after I had posted them—I went to the Talbot Road, and got there about 12.15 on the morning of the 19th—I was in uniform—I saw Young,. No. 215, standing near the Colville Hotel, near the Portobello Road, and he called my attention to a horse and cart there—we waited a minute or two and crossed from the Colville Hotel to the horse and cart—Parrock and Richmond came down from the direction of Westbourne Park—I noticed them a few yards before they got up to us—they stood a second, Parrock said "<hi rend="italic">Halloa</hi> 2? show are you going on?"or "Good night"—I forget the expression but something to that effect—I answered him in an offhand way—we left them and walked in the same direction, they had come, towards Westbourne Park; they made a stand at the corner of the square; I looked round and I saw Parrock going towards the cart—I am not positive whether Richmond turned or not—I suppose that Parrock was up as far as the horse; we stood there and they walked away towards Portobello Road—I saw no more of them then—we went back and thoroughly examined the cart, and found the portmanteau—Parrock did not touch the cart at all while he was there—he did not put his foot on the wheel or step or touch it in any way, or walk backwards and forwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260023"/>
               <p>there was no woman with Parrock and Richmond—I saw no woman whatever about there—I knew Parrock; I had done duty with him—I knew he had been discharged from the Force—I had lodged in the same house with him. I saw the portmanteau in the cart partially covered with a rug—I did not get into the cart—I said to Young "I don't exactly understand this, I believe there is something wrong, you go in that area opposite," pointing to one of the private areas there—we secured the wheel first "of all by means of the reins—Young went down one of the areas—I think it was the first; that would be, I should say, 32 yards from the cart, on the opposite side of the road—I should say it was about 12.25 when I left him there—I went away and remained in Portobello Road between Cornwall Road and Elgin Road, near the post-office—I saw Parrock there with a woman; they passed me—I was standing on the kerb next door to the post-office—I took the woman to be the woman Cook who was charged—they went in the direction of Archer Street—I saw Brannan about seven or ten minutes after Parrock and the woman had passed—I had left there and gone down the Portobello Road again, and when I came back I saw Brannan near the post-office—I first reported "All right sergeant," and then I asked him whether he had received any information—he said "Why?" I then reported the circumstance of the cart and posting Young—he said "All right, I know all about it, you go after Parrock and the woman and stop them"—I told him I had' seen Parrock and another man pass the cart—I detailed the whole of it—all I said about the woman was that I had seen Parrock and the woman pass—I might have said I believed it to be Cook, or that it was Cook—after I had reported the whole of it to him he told, me to go after Parrock and the woman—I told Brannan that Parrook had merely turned towards the cart, that is all I said—I went after Parrock and the woman, but I was not able to find them, and I returned to Portobello Road in about, fifteen or twenty minutes—it was about 12.50 as near as I can guess when I first saw Braanan—when I came back I saw Brannan near the cart in Porto bellow Road, and I told him I could not find them—he said "Perhaps they are in the Mews in Buckingham Terrace," and I went back again—I saw Sergeant Varnham and asked him if he had seen them, he said he had in Portobello Road—I told him Sergeant Brannan wanted them, and we went together—we returned and I met Young in Archer Street, and we walked own together—I was not present when Parrock was taken in custody; I was when Cook was taken—she said, "I know nothing whatever about it, you must have made a mistake in the party"—she said that once or twice—Brannan was there—I first heard of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife about 9.30 in the morning—I saw the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the reserve room table and said "Halloa, what is that," and then I heard it had been found in the cart—I was present at the police-station about 6 o'clock in the morning when Brannan had some conversation with Young—we were in the passage—I think there was Young, Varnham and myself—Brannan came and said "Look here Young, this is a good job, belonging to a big man or a great man, an M.P., you had better let me have the handling of this, otherwise we shall have the Inspector shoving his nose into it," Young said. "Very well you can have it as you appear to know so much about it"—I won't be positive of the expression, but it was something to that effect—in the yard at the Police Court, I heard Young say to Brannan, "I think I had better get in the box first sergeant, had not I?"Brannan said "No I will get in the box"—that was before there was any conversation, and shortly Braanan</p>

               <p>came back and said "I am going in to the box first of all"—we had a little talk over it, and we all thought it was Young's place to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> in the box first of all, and Brannan fired up and said, "Let it alone to me, I will mix it up for myself"—he went and got in the box first—after the charge was dismissed, I went away on an omnibus with Young and Brannan—Brannan sat in the middle I think—I heard a conversation he had with Young on that occa<lb/>sion—I think Young told him first of all that Parrock had taken out a summons against him for perjury—Brannan said "I don't care much if they have, but if they do, and questions are put by counsel will you lean to it," or "Will you lean to me"—I told him it was no use to talk like that we had given our evidence which was correct—he said "I don't mean that, but if questions are put to you, will you lean to counsel"—I told him we we would not—I thought that the woman I saw with Parrock was Cook—I could not say that I ever noticed Charlwood before—I should not like to swear that Cook is the woman now, although I firmly believed at the time she was.</p>

I knew the woman Cook before, but not to say well—I said at the Police Court "I swear positively that Cook was a woman I had seen about as a prostitute. I believe her name was Cook. I was perfectly familiar with her appearance"—I gave evidence to that effect—before she was discharged I was perfectly certain that she was the woman—I was examined against Sergeant Brannan at the Police Court—I believe it was three times in all—I did not mention on either of those three occasions a single word in examination in chief or cross-examination about the conversation which I have stated to-day—I don't-remember when I mentioned that conversation to Mr. Wontner—I have not the date with me—it was the second day I went to Mr. Wontner's office, 3, Cloak Lane—I think it was later than April; it was 8th May—Young was with me—he heard the statement I made to Mr. Wontner, and I heard him make his statement—Young made his first, and then I made mine—they were written down at the time—I had been the day before to Mr. Wontner's, but I had not made any statement—Young spoke to me first about making that statement to Mr. Wontner a week or a fortnight before, and I said I should, state the facts and the truth—after Parrock spoke to me, he turned away, and went some yards; he then turned round and walked towards the cart—I had gone on to the corner of Colville Square—we turned and walked towards it, and then they went—when we turned he was about as far as the horse's head—I was next door to Cuff's post office, standing on the pavement, when I saw Brannan—I am not positive that I mentioned Cook's name to him—I may have said Parrock and the woman—I may have sworn at the Police Court that I mentioned Cook's name—I went to Bosworth Road with Sergeant Varnham—I did not tell Varnham to go to the station and tell the Inspector I had found Cook's whereabouts; nothing of the sort—I did not send Varnham to the station; Varnham left me and said he would go to the station—it was about 12.50 that I saw Brannan near Cuff's post office—I saw Parrock and the woman walking arm-in-arm in the Portobello Road—that was seven or ten minutes before I met Brannan—I said at the Police Court, before Mr. Knox, the same as I say here, that I may have mentioned Cook's name—I was present at the arrest of Cook—I went into the house—it is not a fact that all the constables were in the room while she was dressing—it is not a fact that Sergeant Brannan told us to keep out of the room—we did stay outside—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260025"/>
               <p>Brannan was in the room—he said something to the effect that he was a married man and would not look while she was dressing, and he turned his back to the bed and searched the drawers until the woman had dressed herself—the door was partly open and I could see Brannan at the drawers—I did not see the woman herself until she came to the door and said "You had better look in that side drawer, here are the keys if you want them"—I did not see any indelicacy or rudeness, and there was nothing more done than was necessary to prevent her escape—I should say from his manner that Brannan wished to save her from any unpleasantness—I did not make any report of the conversation, which I have sworn to-day, I heard to the inspector or superintendent—I wont say I did not mention it to any superior because Varnham knew about it—he was my superior—I may have mentioned it to Young a week or nine days before I went to Mr. Wontner's—I say to-day it was 12.15 when I saw Young first—I said at the Police Court on the first examination it was 12.5 but on the second or third examination I said it must be later than that—it must have been after Young had given his evidence that I altered it—Young may have said it was 12.20, but I was not there when he was examined and he did not tell me—I think it was the latter end of April that Young and I talked about that conversation, he recounted it to me—I can't say how long that was after Brannan's committal; it must have been before the committal—I know. a Police-constable of the name of Frost—it is very likely that I made a statement to Frost about my resigning; we lived together—I swear I did not tell Frost I should send in my resignation on account of Brannan's job, and that—I was afraid I should be dismissed from the Force because of my different statements—nothing of the sort—he is 20 <hi rend="italic">X Reserve</hi>—I might have told" him I had sent in my resignation—I 'thought of doing it a long while before I did—I don't think I told him I would put in my resignation because of Brannan's case—I could not swear I did not—I don't remember saying anything about Brannan's case—I won't undertake to swear I did not tell him so—I did not speak to Frost about my statements differing on the different examinations—I was receiving 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I was in the Police—my wages now are 21s—may I state my reason for accepting that; my intention was to go home and work at my trade, and this-trial being postponed I got this situation at the Great Western Railway.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The conversation I had with Young about the conversa<lb/>tion with Brannan before we went to Mr. Wontner's office was this: Young said "You remember the morning he was charged don't you, well I shall out with that when I go up there"—I don't think there was anything further—Mr. Lewis examined me when I gave evidence at the Police Court on this charge of perjury—when Cook's room was searched she brought the keys and paid "Here are the keys if you want to look"—that was after she was dressed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had had too much ale and stout. I gave the woman a shilling and she said that it was bad. I sat down on a door-step and some unfortunate woman asked me to treat her and I did so; she told me that a man had been following her for the last half-hour, and I asked Hockam what he was following her for. He did not say anything about bad money or about my being in his house, I merely struck him because he told a falsehood. As to swallowing anything, my mouth was bleeding because the witness struck me, and I might have wiped my mouth with my hand. I was in the yard a quarter of an hour, and could have made away with any<lb/>thing while I was alone; is it likely that I should have let them see me put my hand to my mouth if I wanted to make away with anything, should not I have made away with the part of a bad shilling which was in my pocket. Of course I struggled when I was seized by the throat. The 3rd of March is eight months ago, I was then at work at Mr. Gelding's, coach builders, at Reading. Consider how easily a man' may come into the possession of a bad shilling. I may have wiped blood from my mouth, but it was impossible for a man to see anything go down my throat with a stick in my mouth.</p>

I am an unfortunate girl, and live at Limehouse—on 4th October I saw Fernandez at a public-house at Limehouse—he paid for three glasses with "coppers and then he paid for five glasses and changed a half-sovereign, and I saw him tie his handkerchief up with the gold, I saw the glitter of the gold, but the quantity I do not know—all the three prisoners were then in the house—after the wine was drunk Hill and Regan took the prosecutor out of the house—I followed, and the man, was calling out after me "Julia"—two men who are not in custody came up, and the man was knocked down in the road and Morgan had the handkerchief in her hand—she offered it to me and said "It is a fine muffler"—the man first crawled a little on his knees and he said for God's sake would <hi rend="italic">they give</hi> him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would forgive them the rest, and one of them threw him back<lb/>wards and kicked him—Hill came up and said "What is the matter?"—I said "If you don't know nobody else ought to"—she said "I defy you, you are all in the shed by the side of me"—Regan came up and said "You are a foolish girl"—I said "You take my foolish advice and go home to bed," and then he came back and said that he had only a few pieces of silver in his pocket and it was no use getting in trouble for that—the policeman said "If you want satisfaction go up before the Magistrate to-morrow"—I said "Come along with me and if you require a policeman I will show you where you will get one"—when he found I intended to go he turned back—I went with the sailor to the station and they took the charge, and two policemen were called off the beat—they went up to No. 3 in in the court, where Hill lives—she was not in doors and the policeman watched the house—I was not present when she was taken—I afterwards said "Here is the woman who had the muffler," and the policeman took her—she said</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner put in the following written defence</hi>: "On Saturday evening, September 26th, I left home at 6.30 p.m. and went into Mount Pleasant Fields, which I usually did of an evening for a walk, where I met Taylor about 7.15 p.m., not by appointment, to give her money as she states. She asked me what I was doing there, I told her I had been watching a man, which I had, she then asked me where I was going, I told her I was going across the fields, where she followed me. I did not ask her to go with me. She then began to ask me for some money towards the support of her child, which she says I am the father of, whenever I met her she always asked me for money. Knowing that I am not the father of her child, I did not give her any. The first time I had anything to do with Taylor was about the end of December, 1873. She then said if I did not give her some money, she would swear the child to me, whereupon I got in a passion and struck her on the head with my fist, when she fell into the water—I did not throw her into it, as she states, we were at the edge of the water at the time I struck her. I then took hold of her hand, and assisted her out, we then went out into the field, I struck her again, I then went back and fetched her hat, and gave it to her, and told her I was sorry for what I had done, I had done it in a passion, I then wet my pocket-handkerchief in some water and washed' her face, I then told her I would take her home, I went more than half-way home with her, when she asked me not to go any farther with her, for fear some one might see us together, I again told her I was sorry for what I had done, I then left her and she ran towards home. I had no intention whatever to do Tayloy an injury, which was done in a passion, for which I am very sorry. I beg to state that I never had the life preserver in my possession, neither did I use it. The first I saw of it was when Inspector Gray shewed it to me at the Police Station on Sunday, September 27th, and asked me if it belonged to me, I told him it did not, and had never seen it before. The witness Corfield, has never seen me with it in my possession. I hope gentlemen you will deal as lenient with the case as possible, and I will endeavour to leave the country at once.</p>

I live in the same house as the prisoner in the first floor front room—I recollect Bishop and Mary Ann Ford coming home on 19th September about 11.30—was waiting at the door for my son—no one else was with them—they were coming home together very comfortably, and I thought she was very much the worse for liquor—that is what I call com<lb/>fortable—I did not notice that she was bleeding—I saw them go up stairs—I did not notice whether the prisoner was sober or not—he kindly entreated her to go up stairs—he said "Come up stairs, come up stairs," and he was going up before her—she went up of herself—I saw nothing of Mrs. Lynch that night—I went up stairs in about half an hour, and heard nothing till I had been in bed some time—I live on the floor below in front—as near as I can guess, about 1 o'clock I heard the prisoner say to the deceased very loud "What have you done with my money?"—he also said "I have treated you kindly all day, and you have robbed me of my weeks' hard earnings"—I could not tell whether that was outside or inside the room—I afterwards heard the prisoner come down to Mrs. Park's room, which is the next room to mine at the back, and I heard her say to him "Don't make a noise, because my children would go into fits"—he said "Mind <hi rend="italic">your</hi> era business."</p>

               <p>"Your wife is in here, if you will be kind enough to take her away I shall be very glad"—he came in, got hold of her, and pulled her out on to the land<lb/>ing—she was just inside the door, she might have been partly in and partly out, and then I closed the door again and went to finish my supper—she either fell down in my room or sat down purposely, I don't know which, on the floor in my room—while I was at supper I saw some silver and copper money on the floor, and I called out "Mr. Bishop, here is something be<lb/>longing to you, I believe, it don't belong to me"—he came to the door and I handed him the money—I can not rightly say whether I picked it up or whether he picked it up but he says that I did, and then he said "Where is my sovereign?" I said "I don't know anything about it, here is the lot and here is the place, you can look for yourself"—I don't think he did look, I had but half-an-hour to my supper—I had to go off again—he went out of the room—T finished my supper as nearly as possible at 12.25—I had to be back at 12.30—when I got outside I saw the deceased lying across the landing with her head to the foot of the stairs—I did not turn my head, to look whether she was dressed—I called Bishop and said "I hope you will not make any disturbance after I have gone, to disturb my wife and children as my wife is very ill"—he said "I will not," and I was going down stairs when Mrs. Parsons said "For God's sake, Mr. Bishop, have not you got something that you could cover over her"—(when she came into my room she had her clothes on and a bonnet but no jacket or shawl)—he made some remark to Mrs. Parsons but what it was I do-not know and I did not turn my head round—I took no further notice of the deceased—soon after Mrs. Parsons left my <hi rend="italic">room to go upstairs Mrs. Lynch came in</hi>, and I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> her there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector C</hi>). On 20th November, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner was brought to Vine Street Station charged with causing the death of Mary Ann Ford—I went to 13, Princess Road, and found the body of the deceased in the bed, on its back, with nothing on but the portion of a chemise—it was cold and covered with bruises all over, and there was a bruise on the head—the doctor came afterwards—I found a smear of blood about the size of my hand on the floor of the landing outside the room, in the further corner opposite the door and near the stairs which led to the second floor; I also found a small mat inside the prisoner's room, two yards from the bed in the right hand corner as I entered—there were evident signs of struggling in the room, such as scratches on the floor as if made by a boot—in a small room which led out of the bed-room I also found a smear of blood—the only female wearing apparel which I could find was very much torn, there was hardly a piece left whole—I returned to the station and read the charge to the prisoner—he said "Yea, I did it but I am very sorry for it, I never thought it would come to this; I never meant to kill her, she should have kept her hand out of my pocket"—the prisoner was wearing very heavy boots, they had been recently cleaned, I thought oiled—I found smears of blood on the thighs of his trousers and also lower down, near the bottom—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took them from him and obtained others for him—he made other remarks to the effect that he was very sorry.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 33, Dean Street—on 20th September, about 8.30 I was called to 13, Princess Road, and found the body of a female lying on the bed—she had been dead three or four hours, and possibly longer—the body was rigid and quite cold—I found a wound an inch long on the right side of the top of the head, and there were marks of blows on the head, it appeared to me an indefinite number—hardly any blood had flowed from the wound—there was a bruise on the left side of the forehead, a bruise on the centre of the forehead, and a smaller bruise on the top of the right side of the forehead, a severe bruise on the left shoulder, several marks on the left upper and fore arm, and the hand was blackened to the ends of the fingers from effused blood—there were nine or ten bruises and abrasions on the back, as if the blow which made the bruise had been rough enough to rub the skin off—an abrasion breaks the scarf skin or cuticle—there was a severe bruise on the left hip, and over the right knee-cap were three or four scratches, and others just above the hip on the left side—there were marks of injuries, more or less developed, over the whole of the body—I received the Coroner's order, and on the Monday made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on the removal of the scalp there was considerable effusion of blood into the tissues over the skull, over the whole front, side and back, and left half of the skull, which was unusually thick,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260057"/>
               <p>and it was not fractured—the membranes covering the brain were very much congested, the middle membrane or <hi rend="italic">arachnoids</hi> was milky, which proved that she had been of intemperate habits—the effusion of blood on the left half of the skull, was connected with the external bruise over that part—the brain generally was much congested, and the lateral ventricle contained about two ounces of fluid blood, which had gravitated to the base of the skull, I traced it up to the left lateral ventricle—on opening the chest the left pleural cavity contained about a pint of blood—it is called a cavity but it is filled by the lung—there, were old adhesions, showing that she had had pre-existing disease—I found the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh. ribs broken, and the eighth and eleventh were broken in two places—a splinter from the fractured sixth rib had penetrated the lungs, corresponding to which was an external bruise—that was the cause of the effusion of blood into the cavity—there was also an external injury immediately over the double fracture of the eighth and eleventh ribs, one of which had taken place close up to the spine—there was a circumscribed bruise on the front surface of the stomach', which was full of a dark substance composed of fluids and solids—the heart was degenerated from fatty infiltration, and the liver was much enlarged—the other organs were natural—the immediate cause of death was the effusion of blood into the brain, which arose from the blow on the head—I take it that the last blow was given a very short space of time before death, in consequence of there being no hemorrhage—bleeding ceases at death—I do not think that could have been caused by a kick, I think it took place when she was thrown on to the staircase; it is con<lb/>sistent with it—the blow which caused death must have been almost imme<lb/>diate I do not think it could have been given several hours before—the other bruises were caused by direct violence, and I think they must have been done before death; if a man has got a dead body before him he cannot produce bruises such as I saw, it must be done before death—the other injuries were done a very short time before death, because the injury to the lung would have let out a large quantity of blood, which would have filled the whole pleural cavity if life had not failed—the blood I saw on the lung was not sufficient to cause death; a person might survive for days, and even might recover, because a person can live with one lung.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have no doubt that the immediate cause of death was the injury to the head—that injury might have been caused by anything—if the blow was struck between 7 and 8 o'clock it would not have been possible for her to have lived several hours—I am perfectly certain that she could not have walked and talked after the infusion of blood into the brain—that follows as a matter of course—the infusion does not follow immedi<lb/>ately upon the injury—it is possible that a considerable interval may have elapsed between the blow and the effusion taking place—almost all things are possible in medicine—I do not think the injury to the top of the head was the result of a kick—to my mind the cause I give preference to was the throwing on the stairs—there must have been a projecting point to cause a clean incised wound—if a man was violently pursuing a woman and she fell on the stairs, she would be more likely to have a severe wound than if she fell from her own weight only—the external evidence of the bruises, the discolouration, had almost disappeared at the time I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I do not know that the bruises I saw on Sunday morning were the result of recent blows—in a bruise you may identify the time it has existed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260058"/>
               <p>by the change of colour at the circumference—nearly all the braises exhibited the same appearance—I said before the Magistrate "Nearly all the bruises were consistent with her falling about," and I say that now, with the exception of the fractured ribs—putting aside the fractured ribs, the appearances on her body were consistent with her falling about—the ribs were not all broken at one time, there were at least four or five different impacts—it is a most unusual thing to break the eighth and eleventh ribs in two places; it requires perfectly direct violence, and over the eighth and eleventh ribs there were external appearances—I did not identify the other fractures and abrasions in the same way as I did the case of the eighth and eleventh ribs, because they attracted my attention in a professional point of view—from the appearance of the liver, and the milky appearance of the brain, I am of opinion that she was given to drinking, and people are nearly always subject to outbursts of violent temper when they have that milky condition of the membranes of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The wound at the top of the head could have existed only a very few seconds without effusion of blood; it certainly could not have existed several hours—before the effusion of blood she might have become senseless from the concussion; the blow would cause insensibility, and then the effusion would take place—I believe the insensibility commenced directly after the blow—she would not bo able to walk and talk after the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Henry and Co., sack manufacturers, at 47, Mark Lane, and they have a warehouse in Black Horse Yard—the sacks produced are my employers' property—Stone has been our foreman about seventeen or eighteen years—about 11.30 a.m., on 1st October I received some information about the sacks and went with Detective Child to 1, Water Street, White friars—the door was opened by a woman—a Par<lb/>cels Delivery van came up about that time and delivered a bundle of thirty sacks—the woman paid the carriage—I went into the passage with Child—he had a communication with the woman and then he went upstairs—I remained in the passage with the goods—Riley was brought down and Child said "Where did you get the sacks from?"—he said "I bought them of Stone for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—I said "That is only half their value, you know, they are worth 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he made some reply, but I did not understand what he said, he mumbled something—I had known him before—he had been to our ware-house as a customer four or five years ago—there was a balance due from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the proceedings in the bankruptcy of Gustavus Marks, he describes himself as a commission merchant, of London Wall—there is a petition of Mr. John Parker, a public officer, on behalf of the National Bank, dated 4th February, 1873—the prisoner was adjudged bank<lb/>rupt on 26th March, 1873—a statement of his affairs was filed on 17th April, 1873.

I gave him credit for those on the same terms, to be paid with the second half—I sent the cheque to Paris in due course, and on 26th November I received it back marked "Orders not to pay"—I saw the prisoner the same day and asked him how this happened—he said, he had some difficulty with the bank, and that matters would be settled in a few days; he said there was an attachment on his banking account—we presented it a second time in a few days, and the answer was "Not suffi<lb/>cient"—it has never been paid or the 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. either—he owes me altogether 1,010<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not know at that time that he was getting advances from Davis, Layland, or persons of that kind—had I known it I should not have parted with my property.</p>

               <p>account sales from Valparaiso with regard to the soap—it would be the mail just previous to 6th August, 1873—there was a loss of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the soap; that was the difference between the selling and the advance—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is due to Mr. Davis—there was in the same way a loss on the merinoes of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is taking into account the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we received on the In<lb/>surance for the damaged goods; the advance was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than the return from Australia—I include in that estimate the eighty-one pieces, the whole of the parcel by that ship—it would be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., exclusive of our commission—that was not charged before—the 10 per cent. is the exchange between the two countries and 5 per cent. interest on the money; that is our com<lb/>mission on the transaction—the 10 percent, was not to cover all, we charge 5 per cent more when they come back—0 per cent is deducted before the advance, besides charges, then 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 5 on the other side, making 22 1/2 per cent; then he has all the charges at the other side—the account sales of the merino-reached us in August, 1873—there was a loss on the shawls of about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this entry of an advance of 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in January is an incorrect entry of mine, there was really no advance in January—there was a loss on each of the three transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We do have sales where there is a considerable profit to the persons selling through us, or else the business would soon be stopped—there would be no difficulty in giving an instance of that (Mr: <hi rend="smallCaps">DAVIS</hi>. My Lord, I submit this is, not bearing on the case, it is not proper, and I object to it, I don't wish the business of any clients to be disclosed in open Court.) This is the ledger; I have not got the account sales book here—I decidedly pledge my oath that there are many transactions in which money has been returned over and above the advances to the persons shipping—I could not give you an estimate of how many in the course of a year, a very great number, deducting the 22 per cent, and all the charges—at times the profits in the Colonial markets are very large, and at times the other way—all the particulars in reference to Mr. Marks, his being the person taking the advance, the ship by which the goods have gone and the person to whom they are consigned would appear in our books, and could be found at any time by any person making inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I don't know that I am at liberty to name any person. to whom a balance has been handed; I could mention them if I must do so—I will give you the name of Bethamy, of Baltavia Works, Langton, Staf<lb/>fordshire to whom I have just recently paid a cheque of profit, I forget the amount, but I think somewhere about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the advance might have been on 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something like that, I really could not: tell you the amount—that is not a solitary transaction, I could remember several, but I am not quite at liberty to mention names—it is not more usual to have a loss than a gain, I can scarcely say from memory which is the more usual, but I should think there would be quite as many gains as losses—we do not lose at all—there are not more losses than gains to the con<lb/>signor; I mean what I say, with the 22 per cent and all expenses, and although colonial affairs fluctuate very much—we try to ascertain the state of the markets before we send out; we send out anything suitable for the market—we take nothing that does not suit the market as far as we can judge.</p>

               <p>of 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the total cash I paid him was 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9s; there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for insurance, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for dock charges, and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. exchange, at 10 per cent—I am not quite certain, but I think I saw his invoice, if I did I must have known that the invoice price to him was 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is a press copy of the contract, in the main it is the same as Mr. Davis's, I think there is some little alteration. (<hi rend="italic">It wot read and was identical with the former</hi>). My usual commission is 5 per cent. and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">del credere</hi> on the gross proceeds of the sale—I sent the goods out to Charles Moore and Co., they are auctioneers and merchants as well—I had an account sale from them on 30th October, 1873; I am sorry to say it shows a loss of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it does not produce the amount I advanced, I beg to explain that out of the 10 per cent, upon which so much stress is laid is to be taken frequently the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and sometimes 3 per cent premium on the return draft, and if the goods should he held for twelve months without being sold no interest is charged; the 10 per cent. covers all that; and so it is in the exchange from Valparaiso, frequently it comes to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dollar, and we take the risk, of that—we also take the risk of the goods being sold on credit after the return sales; we get 2 1/2 more for that—I say that I am actually money out of pocket on the transaction, 2 or 3 per cant on bills and no interest on the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was the only transaction I had—goods are often sent to me represented to he of a particular quality which when sent to the colonies turn out not to be of that quality—these were represented to be Kent hops by Marks, and I feel certain they were so described in the invoice, but I could not say positively; I don't know what county hops they were, I only know that they must have been inferior to have sold at so low a price, hops as a rule in the colonies almost always fetch a good price—it is very common for persons shipping to the colonial market to obtain advances on their shipments, hundreds of persons do it.</p>

Neill appears in the pass-book; I think it ought to appear in the cash account as well—none of the payments appear in the cash account—the deficiency account is merely made up from the cash account—the deficiency account rendered to June, 1874, does not give any further information to the creditors; it is a pure fabrication I take it from beginning to end; it is only made up from the bankrupt's examination and other things—there is not a single account of his trading—I have seen the books—there is no account in the ledger; there are some leaves torn out—it appears to be a second-hand book—there is nothing in any of the books that in any way relates to his trading.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of John McCaul and Co., 137, Hounds ditch—the prisoner and prosecutor were in our employ—on Monday morning, 13th July, one of the foremen made a complaint to me of the prisoner, in consequence of which I told the prisoner that it had been reported that he was the worse for drink on the Saturday evening and had delayed the work—he said "I don't have my meals like other people, I take a little beer instead"—he then became excited and asked who could say anything against him—a good deal passed, he was with me about ten minutes; one phrase he used was "I have been in all the prisons about London and no one can say anything against me"—I did not understand what he meant—afterwards Skinner complained to me that the prisoner was the worse for drink on Saturday evening, and had delayed the work and used insulting language to him, which he would not have done if he had not been the worse for drink—it was early in the morning when I spoke to the prisoner, he smelt of drink then, I could not say that he was drunk, he was exceedingly excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 49, Philip Street, Commercial Road East—I was one of the house surgeons at the London Hospital in July when the prosecutor was brought there—he had a small wound externally, about three-quarters of an inch in length, within the margin of the ribs on the right side—I believe it had penetrated a thin layer of lung and passed into the liver; it was an extremely dangerous wound; it penetrated both the chest and the abdomen—I should not think it had gone the whole length of the blade of this knife—I thought it was probably about 2 inches in depth, but that I cannot state for certain—I did not probe wound—we believed it had penetrated the liver—he remained under my care something under a fortnight—there were no symptoms after<lb/>wards indicating that the liver was injured—it was only on the first day or two that I thought it was so, the symptoms afterwards were from the lungs—we concluded afterwards that if it had penetrated the liver it was not to any great or important extent—the danger consisted in immediate hæmorrhage, or subsequent inflammation of the chest or abdomen—I and certain the lung was penetrated—he has suffered from that since, Mr. Herman will speak to that—he was in great danger the same evening he came in, and I thought it necessary to take his declaration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is certain that the wound had penetrated the chest, I could not say absolutely that it bad penetrated the abdomen, we thought it had, it was neither proved or disproved afterwards, because that part of the wound might have healed without any further symptoms—this is a sharp pointed knife—it is very improbable that the wound could have been caused by the man suddenly turning round with the knife in his hand upon a person behind him—the length of the skin wound hardly exceeded the breadth of the knife—if the man had turned round as suggested, the skin wound would have been of considerably greater length, from the movement of the man turning; it would probably graze along the skin—it would require some force to push it in the depth it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I succeeded Mr. Williamson as house surgeon at the London Hospital—I have attended the prosecutor up to the present time, he is under my care in the hospital now—when I took up his case he had symptoms of inflammation of the pleura, he was in great danger for a long time, but he has now recovered—on 1st September he was in a bad state, and I gave my opinion that his deposition should be taken; and Mr. Lushington, the Magistrate, came—it was necessary afterwards to probe the wound to let out the matter—it was about three inches deep; it had pierced the membrane covering the lungs—there were no symptoms to indi<lb/>cate that it had penetrated the liver.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the position upon a, plan.</hi>) She was going towards Battle Bridge, and was about 3 yards from the Obelisk—I had just put my foot on the kerb as she stepped off—I saw a Hansom cab coming on its proper side of the road at about six miles an hour, and it knocked the woman down—I ran to her assistance and got behind the cab and said "Cabman, you have got a woman under your</p>

I live at 28, Norton Folgate, and am a licensed victualler—I knew the prisoner as an occasional customer—I have my business cards at the back of the bar, and sometimes they are lying about, so that a customer can take one—my washing was sent to Mrs. Keagle, of Union Street—she lives next door to a rag shop—on 3rd October I sent my barman to Mrs. Keagle for the washing—he came back without it, and brought this card—it is one of my business cards—the writing on it is not mine, nor was it written by my direction—the value of the linen was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after 3rd October, and before the prisoner was taken, he was at my house on three or four occasions—I had seen a little boy named Nevin, who gave me a very accurate description of the man to whom he gave the things, and I asked the boy to my house, that he might see the men, but on two occasions the prisoner had left the house before the boy could come—on Friday, 9th October, the prisoner was in the house, and I got the boy there—I asked him which was the man, and he pointed the prisoner out to me, and said "That is the man"—I had fixed on the prisoner from the descrip<lb/>tion the boy gave me—I told the prisoner, about half an hour previous to that, that I believed he had been robbing me—I charged him with having fetched the clothes from the laundress, and I said I would not let him go till the boy came—he said "Do as you like"—he was perfectly indifferent—I gave him in custody afterwards.

"Is not that the man?"—I don't think I did—he was standing in one of the boxes—there were about a dozen people there—I don't think any of them are here—the prisoner told me he did not know anything about it—I think the boy said he received the card from the man between 5 and 6 o'clock—I have not noticed that the boy has made two different statements with regard to the time—I did not go with the constable to the station; I followed shortly afterwards—I never remember the boy telling me or saying it was between 3 and 4 o'clock—I had never seen the boy before to my knowledge—the laundress found him—my barman is here—on the Satur-day the goods were got from the laundress the prisoner was in my bar—I</p>

Baring Brothers for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 12th May and numbered 2,973—he first asked me if there was any one spoke English and I said I did—he first asked for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the letter of credit, and I gave it to him through a cashier—the letter of credit was in the name of Matthews—there was a previous payment on it on the 19th May of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Brugmann</p>

               <p>and Son, of Brussels—these four bills were prepared by a clerk in the office before the money was paid—I asked the prisoner to sign them, which he did in my presence—after he had signed them I sent him to the cashier and he paid him the money over—the payment of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was endorsed on the letter of credit and it was given back to him—this is one of the four bills. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "Stutgard, June 19, 1874, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling at three days' sight, pay this first of exchange to the order of the Royal Bank of Wurtemburg, the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling value received, and pass advice of as per letter of credit of 12th May, No. 2,973, Messrs. Baring Brothers and Co., 'R. F. Matthews'"—the bills are endorsed by myself or some gentleman who has the right to sign them—two of the bills were forwarded to one of our correspondents and two were kept back—they would have been circulated, but we were advised by the police that a forgery had been committed—I came to this country three weeks ago, and on the following Monday, two days after I arrived, I went to the prison here—I was shown into some place were there were about a dozen people walking—I looked at them and after a time I said to the gentleman who was there "I know now that man"—I recognised the prisoner—he was changed in his appearance—he was shaved and his face was not so red as it was in Stutgard—he had a little moustache when he came to the Bank—that was shaved off—I have no doubt about his being the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The interview of 19th June took place in the principal office of the Bank—there were two other managers there besides myself and three or four clerks—one gentleman passed through while the man was there—he was a person living at Stutgard—some clerk filled up the bills—they are regular printed forms in French—another clerk paid him the money—I gave the pen to the man to sign the bills and I saw him write the name of "Matthews" four times—I am accustomed to see signatures—I watched him closely during, the time he was writing and he wrote easily—he received back the letter of credit as soon as he had signed the bills—I can't tell you who endorsed them, sometimes that is done by the principal and sometimes by the clerks—there were three or four of us engaged in the matter—when I went to Newgate I saw the criminals in the yard walking one behind the other—I think there were about a dozen; I did not count them—I think they went round more than four of five times—the Governor said to me "Have you done?"—they had been round more than four times before he spoke to me—they walked round several times more and I said "Now I have done, this is the man"—the man who had written in my presence had a beard and a moustache—the signature was written with a steel pen if I remember, but I really don't know exactly; we very seldom use quill pens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I saw the prisoner write yesterday in the presence of the Governor of Newgate, and from having seen him write, and from my experience, I am convinced that these papers are in his writing—I went yesterday to Mr. Mullen's office and saw these five bills of exchange, and my attention was drawn to the signatures "R. F. Matthews"—all the five bills are undoubtly written by the same hand—there is no apparent disguise in the signature—it certainly would not be possible in these papers of instructions to Mr. Chapman, for a person to continue writing a disguised hand in that quantity of writing—I am quite sure it is a natural handwriting throughout—the signatures "R. F. Matthews" are certainly not written by the prisoner in my belief—I have looked at these signatures with the greatest caution, anticipating that the prisoner might invent for himself a signature for the purpose of committing a fraud—I knew that he was charged with the forgery, and I looked very zealously indeed to see whether it was possible for him to create a signature different from his natural handwriting—I have seen him write to-day with a steel pen, the signature "R. F. Matthews," and as a matter of caution I requested him to write it several times—I think when he wrote in the presence of the governor he wrote with a quill pen—I will state why I believe the man never wrote "R. F. Matthews" on the bill—in the first place the formation of the letters are unlike the formation of the letters in the bills; the capital letters I am speaking of—I will take the letter "R" in all the bills—the first down stroke of the "R" is considerably above the top of it—the prisoner makes the "R" after the same model, but he never does that—he makes the "R" in two ways, but when he makes it like the "R" in the bills the down stroke is not beyond the body of the letter in any instance—the "R" in "Respectable" is an instance of what I am saying; perhaps there the down stroke is a little above the level of the bow, but as a rule it is below—in the signatures he has made in the dock to-day he has made a different kind of "R," but he makes that "R" in these papers; but when he makes the "R" after the same model as that in the bills there is the difference which I have pointed out—the next is</p>

               <p>the letter "F"—the general character of that letter is totally at variance with the prisoner's "F"—there are two instances in his papers in the words "Friday," and "Foolscap"—I will take the one which is most like the "F" in the bills; in the word "Turner" The "T" and "F" are made in the same way—the "T" in Turner is not looped at the top—all the" F's" in these bills are well looped at the top, all in one way—there is no capital "F" in the prisoner's writing which resembles that in the signatures—he crosses the letter "F" merely with a straight dash and there is a peculiar cross to the "F" in the bills—now the letter "M"—the prisoner habitually makes an enlargement of a small "M" for his capital "M"so that the ordinary capital "M "is a stranger in his writing, and it is a letter that he might select for the purpose of forgery, but it does not at all correspond, it has not the emphasis—if you look at the letters "M" in the bills there is a pressure on the pen in the last down stroke—there is a letter "M" made after the same model as the forgery in sheet B line 16 in the word "Mansion," but it is different from the "M" in the bills—one is the "M "of a superior writer; there is emphasis in one case and none in the other—if you look at all the "M's"There is the same characteristic, a different feeling and touch to my mind altogether—in all the signatures to the bills you will find the letter "h" is considerably taller than the letter "t," besides which it is looped—the loop might be for the purpose of disguise, because it would be easy if a man makes a straight letter "h"To make a loop, so I don't pay much attention to the loop, but I go to the fact that it is much taller—the prisoner habitually makes the letter "t" quite as tall if not taller than the letter "h"—further than that he has got a peculiar way of crossing the "t" such an instance in the bills would have been fatal to me, but the "t" in "Matthews" is not crossed at all, and he could hardly have failed to have put a cross in one instance out of five—now in four out of the five bills in the letter "w"The shoulder of the "w" is written with" such emphasis that it makes it really a letter "m," it looks like a third down stroke—there is no "w" like that in the prisoner's writing—I have not found one that" will bear the slightest comparison with these—the final letter "s" in Matthews is very distinct, in all the bills except one, it comes below the line—in one signature it is a small "s"—you can't find such a letter in the prisoner's writing—it is the characteristic of the writer of the signature to make the "s" below the line—independently of all these matters of detail the general character of the signatures is far superior to the prisoner's handwriting, and it is my opinion that he could not write it with any degree of practice, and it is to be considered that they were written before some other person, not in his own house in secret—I think in the presence of twenty witnesses, I should Bay he did not write it—the signatures I have seen him write are not like his ordinary handwriting.</p>

Respectable "is different from the one in "Royal"—he varies his "R's"—the "R" in "Royal "is the same kind of "R as that on the bills—the only difference is the down stroke is taller, that is the distinguishing point, it is the same character of letter, but a different touch—there is the same kind of "R" in the words "Robbery" and "Remainder" and "Reward"—he makes the letter "M" in two different ways—he generally makes an enlargement of the small "m" for the capital, but when he departs from that he makes it like the "M" in "Matthews"—a skilled forger might disguise his hand in different ways, but in certain ways he could not disguise it—he could not write in a better style than he was capable of doing—a man might practice a signature for the purposes of disguise in order that it should not be like his writing and go abroad and write it time after time; he might be able to, but I don't believe it—hundreds of writers could not do it to save their lives—I doubt that a man could acquire that skill—I first saw the signatures to the bills yesterday at 12.30—I had studied the prisoner's writing before that, and I have studied it to-day in Court with the greatest attention and care, and with a complete determination not to give evidence unless I felt very sure—I find that one part of the prisoner's writing is a great deal better than another, as it would be; that is the advantage of it—the style varies.</p>

I live at 9, Webb Street, and am a cabman—on 4th September I drove the prisoner from Blackfriars Bridge to the Station Tavern, Walworth Road—he got out of my cab in the Manor Road, Wal-worth—he gave me this card and said "There is my card, call there any time after 11 o'clock to-morrow morning and I will pay you"—I went to 81, Mark Lane, on the following morning, the Saturday—he was not there and the place was shut up—I saw Mr. Wheatley there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Charles Street, and lodge in the house where Smith lived—I recollect Murray coming to the house on Saturday, the 19th September, close on 2 o'clock—he looked very hot—he did not have anything with him at that time—he went over to the beer shop to Smith's brother—I saw Smith when he cattle home shortly after—I did not hear him say anything to Murray—they went into <hi rend="italic">the</hi> front room—they were there half an hour, I should say—I saw Murray leave the house—Smith showed me the goods he had bought—they were similar to the boots produced, but there were different sorts—he said he had bought them, and asked me whether I was a "Bounder"—I said "No"—I told him to be careful what he was doing—he then called me upstairs into my bedroom—he brought me ten pairs of boots up there, and said would I mind him putting them in my room, because he was doing the prisoner Day for them—I said I did not care about them being in my room—he said they would not hurt being in my room, as he wanted to have these out of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> bargain he made with the others "un be knowing" To Day—they were carrying on business together, I believe—they remained in my room until Friday morning—between 5 and 6 o'clock on Saturday a cart drove up to the door—Day was in the cart, and Smith also got in and drove away—they had a basket with the boots in—I daresay it might have been 10 o'clock, or after, when they returned—after that Smith came into the beer shop where I was, and asked whether there was anybody there wanted him—I told him I thought they were all gone—between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning I told him I wished he would take the boots out of my place, for I did not wish them in my place, and wanted him to take them out there and then—he said let them be until the morning, then he would take them away—he said he should take them away out of the house</p>

               <p>"un be knowing"To Day, and before Day came in the morning—I partly guessed where they came from—I said to Smith "They have not come fur from here, they have come from Mr. Johnson's"—he said "You are right"—I saw Day on the following Monday—he came in the beershop where I was and said that Smith had done him—I asked him which way he meant—he said he had taken everything out of the house and sold them "unbe<lb/>knowing," and even stopped the boy with thirty pairs of already cut uppers, and taken them away from him, and if he got twelve months' himself he would put them all away—I recollect Roper coming to the house with Garnham on the Monday—I saw the hamper there, when it was burning, when they came into the house—I believe it was the same hamper in which the boots were brought.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Day for some years—I have known that he is a boot riveter, and has been working in that trade for some time—the ten pairs of boots were taken away by Smith—I believe he took away everything—he and Day were partners—Day complained to me of being robbed—I lived in the house, and never went out until 8 o'clock at night on Saturday, the 19th September—it might be half an hour I daresay before Smith came in after Murray came in—I do not think Day was in the house at that time—Day did not live in the house; he came in very shortly after Smith—I did not see Day talk to Murray—when Murray brought the boots Smith's brother saw him first—I have lived in the house some time, and know that Smith has only lately gone into partnership with Day—I have lived there thirteen weeks with Smith—I would not stay in a house during that time which I believed belonged to a man who was not honest—it was not quite convenient for me to get out—it was convenient to work in, in our line—the two went into partnership on the Saturday before the robbery took place—when I saw the boots first they were in the kitchen—I do not know whether Murray put them down there Smith called me in—I did not say that Murray came up in the cart—the cart was sent for, I believe; at the time it came to the door Smith was in the kitchen—I saw the boots several times; they were never kept so that I could see them at any time—a week before that Day and Smith were not partners at all—they had been carrying on business with one another for weeks before, but I was not aware they had been partners—I was there while the hamper was burning.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 19th September, Mr. Garnham came to the police-station and gave information about the goods being stolen—I went out and made enquiries at different shops—on the Tuesday, I went to Smith about 7.45—I went into the house and went into Smith's kitchen, and found some hampers there in the fire grate, I saw the hamper on the fire, I went upstairs into Mrs. Nicholl's room and likewise saw some burning there, I went into the garden and there was apparently the lid of a hamper just consumed—on the Tuesday I went to Mrs. Little's and discovered the twenty-four pairs of boots—on Wednesday, about 12.45, a.m., I was in the Hackney Road with Cross—I saw Murray and Impsey arm in arm with a drunken man—I took them into custody—after they were charged a boy came to identify them—I charged them with stealing fifty-six pairs of boots from a barrow in Bishopsgate Street, on the 19th September—Impsey said he knew nothing about them, Murray the same—he said he had not seen Impsey from 5.15 that night—I took them in some water, when Murray said "Well old man, you seem to know about as much about this affair as I do"—I said "Yes, I think I do"—Impsey came up to Murray and said "If you don't tell him I will"—he then said "We should have had nothing to do with this if they had not made an arrangement with us on the Friday, the day previous to the robbery, that if we brought in the stuff from Johnson's they would</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On 15th September I took the prisoner on a warrant granted on the 14th—I went to his house in Oxford Road, Barnsbury, got into the garden over the back wall, and caught sight of him in the back kitchen; he made a start to run away, but I rushed in and caught hold of him—I said that I had a warrant for his arrest for obtaining goods of Messrs. Candy, of Watling Street—he said "It is a debt, they can't make a fraud of it"—I said "I will read the warrant to you"—ne said "Never mind, I know what it is, I know all about it"—I got hold of him, opened the front door, called for assistance, and Harding, whom I had placed there, came—I said. to the prisoner "Have you any duplicates in the house?"—he said "No"—I found these nine duplicates in a pair of trousers in the dresser drawer and in another drawer these twenty-three duplicates relating to hosiery and other things—I went with the prisoner upstairs and found the second floor front room locked—I asked him for the key—he said he had not got it—I said "Is there anything there?"—he said "No" I took him to a closet on the same floor, which was locked, and said "Is there anything there?"he said "No"—I said "Where is the key?"—he said that he had not got it—I ordered the front room door to be forced open and the cupboard, and then Harding pro<lb/>duced seventy-eight duplicates from the front room and sixty-six from the cupboard on which the advances amount to about 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—sixty-seven of the duplicates were of 1873 and were then a year old, and forty of them were out of date—eighty-seven of them are of 1874—the aggregate of contracts and duplicates out of date is upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—contract notes are given by pawnbrokers for three months or one month, as the case may be—I also found a large quantity of papers and bill heads relating to various transactions, invoices of goods from different firms, a cheque-book of the London and County Bank, Islington Branch, and one of the National Provincial, a pass-book of the Birkbeck Bank and several counterfoils of their cheques—the pass-book is made up to November, 1873—twenty-three cheques out of the twenty-five have been taken out of the cheque-book of the London and County Bank—here is only one blank cheque here now, but you will find the others among the papers—Messrs. Candy and Mr. Sayers are the names on the last two counterfoils—I have never seen any duplicates relating to Candy's or to the Wood Street Company's goods, but I went round with the witnesses and traced the goods—I found on the prisoner these two receipted invoices of Messrs. Candy's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found a letter of 24th July, signed Richard Morris (<hi rend="italic">Marked E</hi>)—there was not a chair or a table in the. house, they were using two drawers as a table and chair, and in the bedroom I found a mattress and a few things to cover it, and wearing apparel belonging to the prisoner and his wife was lying about—I found receipted invoices of Young and Rochester, of April 4th and 7th, and Wood Street Warehouse invoices of 1st and 7th September—the prisoner's wife asked Harding to allow her to go to the water-closet—he followed at a respectful distance, and after she left, this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the floor—it is dated</p>

Warehouse Company—I was present at the delivery of the goods mentioned in these invoices, of 31st August and 2nd September; upon the prisoner showing me the receipts I: allowed him to take the goods away—on the last occasion there were three large parcels, and the porter helped him with a truck—I remarked to him that he was doing a very good trade in that class of goods, and he said yes, he had sold those he had had, and he thought he had also sold those—he was going to Ludgate Hill. Robert Nassau. I am a porter to the Wood Street Warehouse Company</p>

I was to go out into the country for them to buy goods, to keep them supplied in Covent Garden Market and to sell for them as well—I entered upon my duties on the 7th September at the office, 74, Little Britain—I stayed there a month within two or three days—I was there every day—I kept up a communication with my step-father during that time—one basket of grapes came there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260132"/>
               <p>and that was all—I never saw any business carried on there—there was a desk and two chairs and an inkstand in the office and there were a few samples of hair for stuffing sofas and chairs, a piece of leather, some tobacco, a lot of engravings of fenders, and tools, and machinery, and there was some glue—after. I had been there about eight days Kenzett took me out with him and we had a glass of ale, and he said he should like me to go and sell that kind of machinery, of which they had the patterns—he showed me a book of patterns—I said if I thought I could get a living by it I should be very glad to do so after they had put me in the way a little—I did not go out—there were no books kept except one they used to copy the letters in sometimes—Bennett did the writing in that and sometimes Kenzett—there is none of my writing in it—I never wrote anything while I was there—I never kept any books—these letters are in Bennett's handwriting—I have often seen him write—I had nothing at all to do during the month I was there—I spoke to Bennett one day about it and he said "Well, I will change your duties next week"—he told me that the reason I had no books to keep was that the former clerk had left them and taken away 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore the books were not fit for me to keep—I was satisfied with that explanation—I had authority from my step-father to receive the money for the fruit consigned and I asked Bennett to send a cheque for the first lot of goods—he said he would send at once—I repeated my request the next day and he said he was in a very great hurry, he was going down to Covent Garden Market and he would send the cheque on from there—I had asked him if the first lot of fruit had arrived and he said "Yes," and he told me that it was rather damp and that the large and small fruit was mixed together—I asked if I should come and help to sort it, but I did not see it at all—he did not tell me where or how he sold it—the last time I saw Bennett at the office was on the Saturday that I asked him for the cheque, and he said he would send it on when he got to the Market—that was three weeks after I had been there—up to that time I had been to the office every day—Kenzett was frequently there for the first two weeks and then he told me he was going down into the country to bury his sister, and I never saw him again until he was appre<lb/>hended—I was not paid any wages for the time I was there—I did not ask—they had letters come there addressed to the firm and occasionally some one called—they seemed to be business men—I don't recollect anybody named Eaton calling—I never went to the banker's for them—I have seen a cheque book but I never saw a cheque drawn—when I asked Bennett for the cheque he took one out of the box, put. it in his pocket, and said he would send it.</p>

When I went into the employment I said I did not know anything and they said they would teach me—I saw a book in which they kept copies of their letters; it was locked in the desk—I did not know they had got a place at Lower Marsh, Lambeth, where the fruit was stored—I did not apply to them for any wages—I was to be paid at the end of the week, and I was there a month all but four days, I think—a Mr. Perry, a tailor, called there occasionally—I left on the Tuesday, I can't tell you what day of the month it was—when I asked Bennett for the cheque he said "Do they want a cheque on account, or do they want to be paid for the first lot of goods"—I said "They want to be paid for the first lot of goods"—he said "I will send it on, but if I do I expect they will allow 5 per cent."</p>

In the advertisement I put in the paper I gave my father's address in Devonshire, not my own, and it was after I had heard from my father that I went to Little Britain—I went there several times before I was finally engaged—I have not said before that the first time I went I saw Kenzett; the first time I saw Kenzett he told me his partner was a salesman in Covent Garden Market—that is what I said—Kenzett presented himself to me as being in the drapery line—I know how that they had a place in Lower Marsh—I did not know they had one then—I will swear that I saw Kenzett write a letter and take a copy off in the letter book—I saw that done two or three timed—I was out of employment about a month before I went there—I have been a gentleman's servant—Kenzett recommended me to take a coffee-house—he told me most gentle<lb/>men's servants did that—something was said about going into a merchant's office, and I said I had no knowledge of it—Kenzett told me if I would call again he would speak to Mr. Bennett, and he would probably find some one who would take me, and the next time I saw them both together, and the arrangement was made that I was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—Kenzett told me he had nothing to do with the fruit himself, the dry goods were generally his line—he said he was a salesman of drapery.</p>

Soloman, Cowen &amp; Co., Bankers—there is no such bank as that in existence—they are printed forms—I went to 74, Little Britain and examined the office; there I found a table, a stool, a desk, a cash box, a quantity of samples, such as leather, glue, pins, &amp;c.—I brought them all away in a bag—there was nothing in the cash box but some old brass-headed nails.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon of Lower Richmond Road, Putney—on Saturday night, 10th October, about 10.30 I went to Tidy's house in Gay Street, and saw a boy there about two years old, dead—I found a number of bruises and burns on the body, face and arms, a large bruise over the stomach, a very large bruise over the left lip and round the front of the stomach and all down the left leg and about the private—there were also several boles in the skin, which looked like burns with the point of a poker or something of that sort—there was one small wound about the middle of the back—it was an abrasion through both skins, just over the spine where it was very thin—it appeared to be done by a blunt instrument—the burns were not very large or very deep, but sufficient to destroy the skin—there were about a dozen burns on the whole body and half a dozen bruises, but one or two of them were so large that they reached from the uncle to the hip—I don't think they could have been the effect of one injury—there was a burn on the wrist which looked as if a hot poker had been drawn across it, not with the point—the body was very thin and it cooled down very rapidly after death, which is a sign that it had not been well nourished—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, examination on Thursday the 15th, and found two bruises on the head, one about two inches behind the ear, and the other on the crown of the head, and corresponding</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260144"/>
               <p>with place behind the ear I found a large clot of blood about the size of a walnut, inside the brain—the skull was not fractured—it would be hard to fracture a child's skull, because it is elastic, but it does not follow that harm would not be done inside—death arose from concussion of the brain producing that clot of blood—it was the blow behind the ear which caused that—I don't think the blow on the top of the head would have caused it—the stomach was inflamed on its front surface corresponding with the bruise on the skin and part of the large intestines close to it, that inflamation would not cause death by itself, but I think all the wounds together might have caused death sooner or later without the one behind the ear—the intestines were empty, but healthy—he could not have had much food for several days, but such an absence of nutrition would not have caused death—he did not die of mere starvation—the injur behind the ear must have been done with something blunt, because there was no wound on the skin—I think it must have been something harder than a fist—the child might have fallen on that part, but if so he must have fallen against something projecting, such as a boar, bed, or fire-place—it could not have been done against the ground—he must have fallen heavily—I don't think he fell from a height.</p>

The mark on the back was only about the size of a threepenny piece—a mustard plaster on the back would leave a mark, and if the child had scratched it would make a sore, but whether it would leave the mark of the mustard plaster all round would depend upon how long the plaster was on.</p>

The abrasions were certainly not produced by a mustard plaster—the bruises were very extensive—I don't think they could have been produced by a fall, because there were so many together and some of them were too severe to have been produced by falls or by anything except external violence—the one on the head might have been produced by some projecting substance.</p>
