                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Dr. Hunter, of Upper Seymour-street, as hall-porter—I know the prisoners—on Thursday, 2d November, Jones came there about ten minutes to 1—he was then alone—Merrick came about half an hour afterwards—when Jones came, he asked me if he could see Dr. Hunter—I told him he was engaged; if he would wait, he could see him in his turn—I showed him into the waiting-room, and he was there when Merrick arrived—Dr. Hunter was still engaged, and unable to see them—Jones said he could not wait any longer, and I showed him into Dr. Melville's consulting-room—he had a consulting-room in the same house—Merrick was following him—I said to him, "Can't you wait?" he said, "I am Mr. Jones' brother"—I said, "You had better go in there too, and I will go up and see Dr. Hunter, and tell him"—Jones got very excited—I told Dr. Melville that Mr. Jones was getting very excited; he had better go and speak to him—he went in and told him that he must wait, that Dr. Hunter was engaged—I was standing at the banister, and he rushed out of the room and said, "You are all d—d scamps, "and knocked me down, and ran upstairs—Merrick followed—they both rushed up two stairs at a time, as fast as ever they could go—directly they rushed up stairs, I went out for a policeman—I did not see one, but Dr. Hunter's coachman was at the door, and I asked him to get one—I then ran up stairs to try and give assistance to protect Dr. Hunter from further violence—I went and stood between Jones and Dr. Hunter—Jones took me round the waist and threw me away—I did not see Merrick do anything—he was in custody of a police-constable—the policeman got there almost as soon as I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, of the year 1837—in the month of October I knew Mrs. Merrick, a patient—I have a consulting-room in the same hones as Dr. Hunter, and assist him—Mrs. Merrick lived at 52, Upper Baker-street—I visited her in company with Dr. Wills, on the 21st October, and on 23d, 24tb, and 27th—I visited her alone on the 27th—the last time I went there, I saw Jones—I understood him to say he was the brother of Mrs. Merrick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of directions you had received from Dr. Hunter, did you tell Jones that you wished Mr. Merrick to call on Dr. Hunter and see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say it was in consequence of directions I had received, but I did request him to do so—I at first addressed him as Mr. Merrick—he said, "I am not Mr. Merrick, I am Mrs. Merrick's brother"—I then said, "Will you be kind enough to ask Mr. Merrick to come down and see us to morrow; the attendance now I think no longer necessary, and we should like to see Mr. Merrick on the subject—on the following Tuesday morning, I received a communication from Dr. Hunter about these people—on Thursday, 2d November, about 2 o'clock, the last witness came to me, and said, "Mr. Jones is in a very excited state, he seems very angry"—I said, "You had hotter show him into my room"—that was the front room on the ground floor—I came down from up stairs to see Jones—I found two other persons in the hall besides Jones—I recognise Merrick as one of them—Jones said he wanted to see Dr. Hunter—I replied, "You can't see him at present, because he is engaged with a patient; you will have to wait"—he was at that time sitting on the chair, and he rose up and said, "I will see Dr. Hunter," and he rushed quickly out of the room—I followed him—he went up stairs—as he went up stairs I heard his voice, but I could not catch exactly what he said—at that time Merrick was in the hall—the servant was in a state of great excitement, and I said to him, "William, you bad better go and get a policeman"—there was some other person in the hall, and I addressed him and asked him to walk into the reception-room—I then went up stairs, because at that time I heard a confusion and noise upstairs—I went directly into Dr. Hunter's room; at least, I attempted to enter it, but I could not get in—as soon as I got to the top of the landing, I saw Dr. Hunter with his head against the wall; Jones on his right hand side, with Dr. Hunter's ear in his mouth; Mrs. Hunter standing between the two; Merrick in front of Dr. Hunter, with his hand extended to his throat; Dr. Hunter's daughter on the other side, and Dr. Munns just at the side of Jones, endeavouring to disengage him—I did not at any time see anything in the hands of either of the parties—I endeavoured and succeeded, I think, moving Merrick—I got him by the arms behind, and drew him back-wards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180005"/>
               <p>—believe Dr. Munns was instrumental in removing Jones—he again rushed to endeavour to assault Hunter—Merrick at that time was standing quietly enough on the landing, where there were several others, and the policeman was there by that time—I noticed the state of Dr. Hunter's ear; there was a lacerated wound which was bleeding very profusely—I heard Jones, before he was removed, say why he had come there—I was remon-strating with Merrick and said, "You know you" have laid yourself open to a criminal indictment for this proceeding"—Jones, I think, overheard me, and he said, "You don't suppose I came here not knowing the consequence; I came here to give him a licking"—I think he called the doctor an infernal scoundrel—they were subsequently removed by a police-constable—I have known Dr. Hunter very nearly eleven years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was he then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In New York—he left New York, I think it must have been, at the latter end of 1858, or the beginning of 1859—I was in New York at that time—I was intimate with him—we did not live together then—I was in the habit of seeing him daily—I do not know that he had practised there without being qualified—I never knew that he practised before he obtained his diploma—I never heard of any complaints made against him in consequence of that; I swear that—he did not leave New York suddenly; I swear that—I do not know that, just before the time he left New York, a charge had been made against him—I swear most distinctly I never heard that a charge was brought against him; nothing of the kind—I did not see Merrick strike any blow on this occasion—I saw him with his band on Dr. Hunter's throat—I swear that he had hold of him—I did not see him seize him—when I came to the top of the stairs, he was leaning over Mrs. Hunter, who was between them, with his hand on Dr. Hunter's throat—I was not present at the commencement—to the best of my recollection, what Jones said was, "You don't think that I came here not knowing the consequence of what I was going to do; I came here determined to give him a licking"—if he did not use the word "determined." it was certainly a word expressive of the same meaning—he said that he had grossly insulted his sister; he assigned that as the cause—he was very excited—I have been fourteen months with Dr. Hunter in London—I did not say I was an assistant; there is a partnership I presume existing between him and myself—during the time I have been there, I think I have known most of the patients attending—I do not remember a Mrs. Eversfield being a patient of Dr. Hunter's—I knew a Mr. Rawlings in New York—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at a gentleman in Court</hi>) I do not know that gentleman; that is not the gentleman I knew—I think I remember the fact of a Mrs. Brisley being a patient—I never saw her—I do not know that she suddenly discontinued her visits.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 3, Queen's-gate-terrace, but I have a professional residence in Upper Seymour-street—I am a registered licentiate in medicine and surgery, and a Doctor of Medicine—among many patients there was a person of the name of Mrs. Merrick—I first saw her, I think, on 25th September—she came to my house to consult me—she made seven or eight visits—Dr. Melville is associated with me in practice as a partner—subsequently to these visits of Mrs. Merrick's, she took a severe cold, and had an attack of pleural pneumonia, and was obliged to keep her house—two of the gentlemen associated with me visited her—on Monday, 30th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180006"/>
               <p>October, Mr. Merrick called upon me—he stated that Dr. Melville bad left word for him to come down and see me in regard to the payment of fees—I explained to him that he was indebted to the medical men for their visits, that the mouth had expired by four days, and it was impossible for us to go on, unless the regular fees were paid—he disputed the right of the medical men to be paid for their visits—I called his attention to the fee-card, which distinctly states that all out-visits are extra—he then said, "You won't continue attendance, unless I pay this?"—I said, "Certainly not, unless you arrange for them, and pay the monthly fee, inasmuch as the expense we have already been put to is considerably more than the amount received in fees"—he again asked me whether I would not allow the fees to remain unpaid, and continue my attendance—I told him I would mention the matter to Dr. Melville, but, so far as I had any connexion with it, we would not continue the attendance—he left very much dissatisfied—Mrs. Merrick had been supplied with an inhaling machine and medicines, and so forth, which had been rendered necessary by this attack of illness—on Thursday, 2d November, I was in my consulting-room from an early hour, perhaps half-past 10—I think it might have been after 2 o'clock when I heard a loud excited talk in the adjoining room, in which my wife and daughter, and Dr. Munns were sitting, and, thinking that the servants had had some dispute, I went to the door to ascertain what it was—immediately upon opening the door I received a heavy blow over the top of the head with this cane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the pieces—the blow was struck by Jones, with the cane held in this manner, the moment my head appeared at the door—before I was conscious of what was taking place, I must have received two blows, as there were two heavy ridges over the head afterwards; but of course, in the excitement of the moment, it was not possible to say—Merrick, being a smaller man, was in front of Jones—Jones struck over his head—both of them rushed into the room—I succeeded in defending my face—Merrick got round on my left-hand side—Jones was on the right—Merrick got under my guard—I held up my arms to guard my face, and I turned towards him, and struck him down against the table—as I did so, Jones worked in upon me, his cane having broken in his hand, and fastened his teeth in my right ear; he bit the ear almost quite through—it bled very profusely, so as to saturate my coat and shirt, and even the floor—Merrick recovered himself, and seized me by the throat—almost at the same instant as Jones fastened his teeth in my ear, Mrs. Hunter and my daughter rushed from the adjoining room, and seized hold of my arms with a view of pro<lb/>tecting me—with their assistance, and that of one of the medical gentlemen and the policeman, I was released from them—they were then given into custody, and taken to the police court—they were committed on that very day for trial at the Middlesex Sessions on the ensuing Monday—on the Saturday night before that Monday, at half-past 10 o'clock, I was taken into custody, on a warrant, on a charge of rape, and locked up—upon an appli<lb/>cation being made to postpone this trial of assault at the Sessions, I in<lb/>structed my Counsel to oppose it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not a charge openly and publicly made against you just before the time you left there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No charge was ever made against me, on my oath—no charge of having committed a rape; nor since I was born—I was not challenged to come forward and refute the charge; it is untrue from beginning to end—I think it very likely I saw that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Rawlins</hi>) about fourteen years ago—I hardly know his face again—he never dined with me at my house—I say distinctly and unhesitatingly that I was never charged with a rape, nor anything of the kind; I swear that—among my patients, I think, was a Mrs. Brisley—she never made any complaint against me, never—I do not know of her ever making any complaint whatever; not a word to me—she discontinued her visits at the end of her month, I suppose—I don't think she came more than two or three times altogether—she never alleged any reason for discontinuing her visits; I swear that dis<lb/>tinctly—I will swear she did not charge me with having committed any indecency towards her—I had &amp; patient of the name of Mrs. Everafield; she never accused me of any indecent conduct towards her, not a word.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the day of this assault, you say that Jones bit your ear; will you swear that was so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I will—there was a spatuls in his hands at one time, but how it came there I do not know—I don't think there was any instrument that would cause the wound on my ear—I swear it was caused by a bite from Jones—I was then turning towards Merrick—I had struck Merrick down, and, as I was turning, Jones rushed in and fastened his teeth in my ear—Merrick had put his hand on me before I struck him; be had struck me several blows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Jones tell you, when he first came in, that you had grossly vio<lb/>lated his sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not say anything of the kind; on his entering afterwards, he said I bad insulted his sister on her second visit—he was as a man would be who had been taken in an assault.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I put it to you again, as he did, not in the shape of a legal charge, bat any personal complaint made to you by any woman during your whole practice, or during your whole life, of ever having acted indecently towards her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not one single instance of personal complaint even to myself—I never heard of complaints made against me, until this charge of rape was brought—I stood my trial in that dock, and was acquitted.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Poole, a watch-maker, in Fen-church-street—on 27th October, between 4 and 5 in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, produced a brooch, and asked me what we should charge for putting a catch on it—I looked at it, and turned round towards the window, to see what it required, and on turning again to speak to the prisoner, I saw him take his hand out of a case—I could not see what he took—I had no time to tell him what the brooch would cost, for he directly ran out through the doorway—Mr. Bridge followed him—the case was afterwards examined, and one watch was missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pilot, and reside at Folkestone—I have no knowledge of the prisoner previous to seeing him at the Court—on the night of 25th November, I went to the theatre—I did not see him that night—I first saw him in the morning—I left the (theatre about 12 or half-past—I am not certain when I missed my watch—this key and ring are mine.</p>

               <p>of October—it was a portion of the goods that he had received before he entered into the new arrangement—he said that if I would redeem that bracelet, he thought he had a good chance of selling it—I did redeem it, and I also handed him a pair of turquoise and diamond ear-rings to sell with it—they represented part of the new stock—he brought the ear-rings, but not the bracelet, and said that he had shown the ear-rings to Mr. Johnson, of Threadneedle-street, that he admired them very much, and would have purchased them as ear-rings, but one of the young men put one of them into his scarf, and it looked so pretty as a pin, that if I would have them converted into pins, he would give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bracelet—I said, "Very well, I will accept the offer"—I had the ear-rings converted into pins, and they were given to the prisoner to take to Mr. Johnson's, about 4th November—I cannot call to mind whether the prisoner returned that evening; but in Oxford-street I asked him once or twice whether he had delivered the ear-rings to Mr. Johnson, and he said "Yes"—here is an entry in the day-book of 4th November, 1865, in the prisoner's writings, "Mr. Johnson, Threadneedle-street, 2 brilliant and turquose pins, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one brilliant enamelled horse-shoe bracelet, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—in the ledger I find Mr. Johnson's name also carried forward, in the prisoner's writing, as a debtor to the amount of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Johnson had not previously been any customer of mine—about the 16th November, I saw Mr. Johnson, and, in consequence of what he told me, I saw the prisoner—I had before that consulted my solicitor, and I saw the prisoner in his presence, and in the presence of Mr. Buchanan, the prisoner's solicitor, or his clerk—I asked him, if he had sold that bracelet and pins to Mr. Johnson, of Threadneedle-street; after a little hesitation, he said, "No, Sir, I have not; but I have sold them to somebody else; I have received the money for them, and have appropriated it to my own use, and now you may do what you like—it was not said defiantly, but almost despairingly—I then asked him about the sale of a bracelet to Mr. Moses, in Oxford-street—I found an entry in the prisoner's handwriting on 15th September, 1865, of a carbuncle and brilliant bracelet, value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sold to Mr. Moses, of Oxford-street, and he is also brought forward in the same way, as a debtor, in the ledger—I asked the prisoner if he had sold the bracelet to Mr. Moses—he said "No, Sir"—I then gave him into custody—I found an entry on 16th September, of a turquoise suite and case for twelve guineas, sold to Mr. Bennett, of Blackheath—that was also carried forward in the ledger—I did not ask the prisoner as to that—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the ear-rings—I have not been able to hear of the other property—this letter is in the prisoner's writing—I received it after I had instituted proceedings before the Lord Mayor, (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir, I once more ask you to have mercy, not for me, but for my poor little children; if you will only withdraw, I will do all in my power to refund, and assist you—do, for heaven's sake, release; I have suffered much, and without benefiting you one farthing; do not refuse my prayer, or my only comfort on earth will not survive the blow."</p>

After being questioned further as to his not finding the order till three o'clock, he said, "I have made a mistake as to time, it must have been about twelve o'clock when I found the order"—he then said that it was at the corner of Duke-street and Oxford-street that he picked it up, and that when he gave the order to the man at the public house it was not signed—he was searched—I did not find any portemonnaie or any stamps—he said he had been out that night and got drunk—he was out till four o'clock the next morning—he could not give any account of the portemonnaie.</p>

I do not know the man's name; I only knew him by sight.

I am assistant to Mr. Hollis and have been so for twenty-one years—I was in the shop the whole of the time between one and two o'clock on the day in question—the prisoner was at his post the whole of that time, shut in the post-office by himself—no one was with him—he was there alone from twenty minutes to two until two, or a few minutes past—nobody went in there at all—he dispatched the letters—the stamps are sup<lb/>plied to the prisoner in the morning—he has to account for so much money or so much in stamps every evening.</p>

I have been in the habit of corresponding with a gentleman at Liverpool, in whose service I was for three years, and I used a great many postage stamps; I took the stamps, but, of course, I paid for them. On my return that afternoon I commenced my duties again, and in case any postage stamps are presented at the window it is my duty to buy them; whether it is my duty or not I have done it, and have paid the money out of the till; that is the only way in which I can account for these coming into my possession; if I had taken the stamps out of the drawer and appropriated them there must have been so much money over. I can account for every penny that I had in my pos<lb/>session; I had received 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on account of the gentleman at Liverpool, out of which I had expended 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. leaving 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; only 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it was my own money, it was what I had to account for to the honorary secretary of a society, held at 22, Berners-street.</p>

I am the wife of Michael Lee, and live at 36, Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields—it is a common lodging-house, kept by Mr. Mitchell—I have assisted him there for a good many years—I know the prisoner—he came to the lodging-house on Saturday, 25th November, at very nearly 11 o'clock at night—the little girl was with him—he asked me for a double bed, that is a bed for two persons—I said, "You shall not have a double bed—you shall have a bed to yourself, and the little girl can sleep with Mrs. Daley"—I said, "Where is this child's mother?"—he said, "Her mother is my sister, and she is very ill in the workhouse"—I said, "You have nothing to do with this child, I am sure,' and the people there said they were sure the child was too respectable for him to have anything to do with, and they pitched into him, and pulled him about—he got out and got away, and left the child there—after he had gone she became stupefied—we thought it right to send her to the Loudon Hospital—some of the lodgers tried to find her parents—had known the prisoner before, and am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I am a detective of the Metropolitan police, but employed by the War-office at Woolwich—on 2d November, from information I received, I went to the Alexandra Theatre at Islington, and saw Duncan join Garrett, who was standing at the entrance—I said to Duncan, "You have been stealing cheques or money from your employers"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I told him I was a police-officer, and should take him in custody—Garrett was close by and could hear the conversation—I said to Duncan, What have you done with the money you got for the cheques you passed at the bank?—he said, "I have bought things with it; I also bought two watches, one I gave to Garrett, and one I have now, "nodding towards Garrett, who said, "Yes, he did give me a watch and guard"—Duncan said, "I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several things I bought with the money are at home"—he also said that he gave Garrett two gold rings-Garrett was not in military costume—Duncan also said, "I gave money to two other men at Woolwich at different times"—I said to Garrett, "The case looks very suspicious against you, receiving watches and money from this boy"—he made no reply—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody for receiving from</p>

               <p>the boy"—I remember speaking to Garrett about his discharge, I said "You are about purchasing your discharge, or have done so within the last few days—he said, "Yes, my father has bought my discharge with his own money," and that the amount of it was 3ol.—I had a conversation with Garrett's father, and afterwards, when Duncan and Garrett were both together, I said to Garrett, "Your father tells me you gave him the money to buy the discharge"—he said nothing—I then said to Duncan, "I understand from Garrett's father that you must have given Garrett the money to buy his discharge"—he said, "Yes, I did; I gave him 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold to buy his discharge"—I took them to the station and charged them—I searched Duncan's premises, and found a great number of things which he said were bought with the money of the forgery—on 6th November I saw Buckley at Woolwich barracks—I told him I was a police-officer, and took him for receiving sums of money from a boy named Duncan—he said, "I have not received any money from the boy Duncan"—he said that he knew the boy Duncan out at Gibraltar, but had not seen him lately—on the way to the station, I said, "You are about getting your discharge, I believe, from the service?"—he said, "Yes, my father is going to buy my discharge."</p>

O." in the corner of it—I read it, and showed it to the boy at night, and he tore it up—I believe it was from Buckley—I only just read it—I cannot tell exactly the contents of it, but I gathered from it that he had been to Greenwich with Buckley—there was nothing about money—I intercepted another letter from Garrett, and the boy burned that—it said that he was to bring him a watch, that be (Garrett) was on full pay, and would pay it at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I said to my boy, "I do not wish you to have anything to do with Garrett; how have you got money to pur<lb/>chase a watch?"—he said, "Garrett was in London, and I brought him the watch, "that is, took it down to him—I cautioned him—I made a communi<lb/>cation to Mr. Conte—my husband wrote a letter to Garrett at Woolwich, and I told him what to put in it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Garrett returned the letter to me, and told me to send it to the proper owner—I think the children made away with the letter; I cannot find it—this is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "Bombardier Garrett—I received your letter this morning, telling my boy to bring you a watch. You must remember we are only poor people, and the boy has no money to buy watches, or yet to spend in going after you, and you writing after him may only prompt him to rob his master. I wish you to have nothing more to do with him; if you do, I will certainly bring you before your commanding officer, and I know Colonel Maberly will see me justified in doing so; you are a young soldier, with good prospects in front of you, and I don't wish to injure you if it can be avoided. W. Duncan."—"Woolwich, 11/10/65. Mrs. Duncan,—I re<lb/>ceived this morning (Wednesday), a letter from you, accusing me of writing begging letters to your son, requesting him to purchase me a watch. Now, I see how the mistake has been; I shall take it in that light; you must look again at the letters you received from Woolwich, and you will then see that I have only written you one, which, as I got the address from a friend of mine, I accordingly addressed it there, as what I wrote to your son, whom I know no more about than your husband does of me, although the manner in which you inquired after Bombardier Garrett on Sunday, was as much as to say that I was the means of your son remaining from home; certainly, when he said he should like to stop, and he told me he had paid for a telegram to you, I made him as comfortable as our accommodation would permit. I have enclosed your threatening letter, hoping you will change the name, and forward it to the proper quarter. I wrote a letter for my friend one day, as he was on duty, that he had not time to do it; but I signed his name at the bottom of it, therefore, hoping you will correct the error, and inform me of the result, you will greatly oblige H. Garrett, bombardier.")—I went to Woolwich after the receipt of Garrett's letter, and I think the Sunday morning before—I found my boy in Garrett's room—he came out, but said nothing—I brought him up to London—I did not stop to speak to Garrett.</p>

               <p>because it was sent back, and I read it over and over, and Garrett's writing is so saucy, I thought it was very impudent—I can write a little, and can read plain writing—when I spoke to my son I thought there was something wrong—he did not say that he had a good master, and that he sometimes got half-a-sovereign at a time from gentlemen—he said that he got a shil<lb/>ling sometimes, and sometimes sixpence, when he went out to the wine-merchants—I was not satisfied—I had been to Mr. Conte before I received the letter—I began to suspect as soon as I saw him with any money—I then went to Mr. Conte, and he told me it was all right, there was nothing wrong.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180035"/>
               <p>Butler then said, "Go on Saturday morning at a quarter-past 8,"and I went and took them, and that gentleman (Mr. Beaumar) saw me take them—I waited about till half-post 9, and then took them to Butler's house—I opened the parcel, and was looking at the stockings, when Butler's sister asked me to give her a pair, and I gave her a pair—about 11, Butler came home, and said, "They suspect you"—I said, "I dare say they do, the gentleman saw me take them out; I wish I had never taken them"—he undid the samples, and said, "We shall get about 61. for these"—we took them out, about ten minutes to 1, and waited down the court till Peterson came out—Peterson said. "Go and take the things, and meet me in White-cross-street, while I go to <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins' and see—he came back, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins can't buy them"—Butler then said to Peterson, "You go and ask at the other place in Golden-lane"—there is another who buys stolen property, I don't know his name—Peterson went in and asked, and the man said he would buy them——me and Butler waited at the baths, in Golden-lane, and a little girl came to me, and asked me if I belonged to the things—I said, "Yes," and she told me to bring them to the shop—I took the things into the parlour where Peterson was, with the man and his wife and the little child—the man asked me where I had got them, and I told him how I had got them—Peterson said, "I want 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this lot"—he said, "I can't give it; "and so they made a bargain—Peterson said, "I want 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for the kid gloves, "and the man said he could only give 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the shawls, and the man gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked half a sovereign for a lot of hosiery, and the man gave him a crown—he asked half a crown each for the shirts, and the man gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some stockings; altogether it came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Peterson gave me a sovereign, and Butler a sovereign, and kept the rest himself—altogether I have had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10s. of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, from first to last—I have seen Peterson and Butler together frequently—on that Saturday night I went to the Britannia Theatre with Butler—I did not see Peterson that night—the man we sold Mr. Garbett's samples to, is called <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Ryan—there is another man named <hi rend="italic">Cockie</hi> Robins.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180036"/>
               <p>—my mother told me on Monday to plead guilty and be a good boy—I took the samples, I dare say, about five weeks after I took the jacket—Betts took all the other things except the Cardigan jacket and Mr. Garbett's samples—I took the Cardigan jacket about five weeks before the 25th—the time that Betts told me that it was a good chance to steal, was after the time when he took the jacket up, and threw it down again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Byford's Defence.</hi> Haye'S-Court is 100 or 140 yards from the prosecutor's place; there are eight doors from his place to the corner of Greek-street, and when you stand at the corner of Greek-street, Haye's-court is 130 yards off; do you think it possible that Jewell could discern me out of five or six others? He said at the Court that he could swear to the lot of us; he says that I had a different hat and coat, and you are aware how clothing alters a man; by my having this clothing on now, I may resemble the man he saw, but I can assure you he is mistaken; he never saw me in his life before, nor I him, to my knowledge; I will not say that he did not see this man, but he did not see me. I have passed Cole, and nodded to him, and he has nodded to me, without my having the slightest idea of being captured. I never saw the other prisoner before, and never was in Byford's house in my life. I told Cole I knew the robbery had been done, but I had nothing to do with it, and that I was always taken for things I knew nothing about. I have been bad, but am now trying to lead an honest life. I was at work at Mr. Woodville's, an engraver, in Wardour-street, and was living at a re<lb/>spectable lodging in King-street; but Cole came to the landlady, and told her that she had got a convicted thief in the house; and when I went home she said that she could not keep me there any longer; I begged her to tell me why, and she told me what Cole had said. Cole has a great bitterness against me, and has often said that he would <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> me. I left work two months ago, and have never been in a place since; it is a long time since I was convicted. Cole knows that I am innocent of this.</p>

On 29th October I received infor<lb/>mation, went into the field, and saw that a sheep had been slaughtered in a furrow—it appeared to have had its throat cut, and a person appeared to have strode across it for a long time, as there were two very deep impressions of boots which had been repaired at the bottom, and a portion of the tip was gone—I went to Hounslow, and apprehended the prisoner on another charge—I looked at his boots, and when he was at the Twickenham-station, I told him I should require them, for I believed there would be another charge against him—I went to the field, and saw that they exactly cor<lb/>responded with the impressions—I measured the mark with a stick, and it was the same length and width—I covered up the footmarks, and told the shepherd to put up hurdles to prevent the sheep going over the ground—I went back to the station, entered the charge, and told the prisoner he was further charged with being concerned with other men not in custody in slaughtering a fat sheep at Whitton, and stealing a portion of it—he said nothing—when he was convicted of the first charge I apprehended him—I told him the charge, and he asked me if anybody was in custody for it—I said, "Not that I am aware of now, but there may be before you get to Twickenham—he said, "You would have done better, if you had gone and looked over the Park instead of looking after me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the General Steam Navi<lb/>gation Company, which is incorporated by Act of Parliament—the prisoner was a clerk at the head office, 78, Lombard-street—his duties were to issue tickets to passengers, to receive the money for them, and to enter them in a book, and pay over the amount to the cashier at the end of each day—there are counterfoils to the tickets—a Paris ticket, fore-cabin and third class, is 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the usual practice is to write the name of the passengers on the coun<lb/>terfoil, and place the date on the ticket—a passenger gives up the ticket, and they are returned, that is after a certain time—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the deposit book—I find no entry here, on 10th October, of a ticket, price 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or of tickets 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th October or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th.</p>

Q.</hi> But you have the counterfoils for all these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but none of those tickets are entered in this book—they are properly entered on the counterfoil, but there is no amount specified on the tickets—we know them by their colour—there is sufficient on this counterfoil for me to verify the ticket—we could have checked the prisoner by a comparison of the ticket with the counterfoil—what we complain is that it is not entered in the day-book, nor the money paid in—if the prisoner was away, another person would take money—the prisoner has been in the service nearly five years—he has been promoted—his duties have been very heavy for five or six mouths during the summer—I understand that he has had to pay telegrams, but that would be between him and the cashier—Mr. Roots has mentioned that to me—I have not seen him here—I have not seen him since last Thursday—he was then at the police-court and asked me there—I spoke to the prisoner about it on the same day as I heard of it—he remained in the office ten or twelve days after that—I told him to make up his accounts, but he did not, and I had them made up—we made up the de<lb/>ficiency by going through the books—that was not with the prisoner's assistance—he merely came backwards and forwards every day to tell me of the attempts that were made to make up his deficiencies—I advised him to try to get the money to pay up his deficiencies—I had no power to pro<lb/>mise him—I did it out of a kindly feeling to him—I did not understand that, if he made it up the money, nothing would be done to him—Mr. Roots did not see him during those days to my knowledge—Mr. Roots marked the counterfoils of the prisoner's tickets himself—this marked "0" is one of those that are owing—I cannot say who put it there—it was discovered from there not being entered in this book—Mr. Roots is an active man in the Directorship—the prisoner told me the amount was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he was astonished when I told him it was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not a paper made up by him in which he shows an account of money due—he showed one to me, and I showed him that certain additions must be made to it—I cannot say what that amounted to—it was a large amount—it contained the Paris tickets—the prisoner told me he had lent money to some of the clerks in the establishment, and produced some I. O. U.'s—up to the last moment I believed he would be able to raise the money—he made many efforts to raise it, and reported to me daily whether he was successful or otherwise—that went on for eight or nine days—I told the secretary from time to time what was taking place—I saw a paper something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know whether this is it—by the last moment I mean two or three days</p>

From information I received, I went on Monday, 11th December, about half-past 9 in the morning, to the prisoner's house on Uxbridge-common—I went into the bed-room, and saw two small mutton-bones, which were cooked, on the table-Henry White was in bed-1 asked him how he could account for the meat that these bones belonged to—he said that he did not know-David was out then—I went and took him afterwards—It is David's house, and the son lives with him—I then went upstairs, searched the bed-room, and found two fore-quarters of mutton and a piece of the neck, in a drawer, and a piece of lights and liver on the table—I sent for another constable to assist me, and left him in charge of Henry White—I took David about half an hour afterwards, up the George-road, a little way off—I took him to his house, and asked him how he came in possession of that meat—he said, "1 know nothing about it"—I found a pocket-knife in David's coat-pocket—It had some fresh blood on it, and some wool—I noticed blood on Henry White's trousers—I found fresh blood at the bottom of the legs, as if something bloody had been pushed against it—on the morning of the 12th, I took both prisoners' boots into the field, where the sheep had been kept—there were foot-prints in the field—I compared the boots with the tracks of two persons, to and fro—there were several nails out, and the place where the nails were out, exactly corresponded with the tracks in the field—on the same morning, I found a hurdle close to the place where the sheep had been stolen; I produce a piece of wool from it—there was an impression on the wool, that had been made by the trousers that Henry was wearing, as if he had sat on it—the prisoner's house is about 300 or 400 yards from where the sheep was stolen—I produce a skin—there is a head and neck that fits in it.</p>

On 3d December I went to Ponders-end with a donkey-cart—I was in South-street at 5 o'clock, and my cart was standing with one wheel in the gutter, on the left-hand side of the road—that would be my right side if I was travelling—while I was at the door of a house I heard another cart coming along—I heard a crash, and found a horse and cart</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. John Bennett, a watch and clock maker, of 65, Cheapside—the prisoner was in his service as assis<lb/>tant and salesman in the shop—he had to deliver articles to purchasers and receive money—on 9th November he was discharged—he had been home with some jewellery on the Saturday, and from some circumstances that came to our knowledge we wrote to a lady and asked her if she had paid him, and he then immediately came down and paid the money to the cashier, while I was talking to the lady—the articles had been sold on the Saturday, and this occurred on the Thursday—he received the money at the lady's house—his duty was to have paid the money in—he was asked by the assis<lb/>tant, "Did the lady pay you?"and he said, "No"—he had to go again to see her—the money was not paid until the lady came—he was asked about it before she came, but not in my presence—I think it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was on Saturday, 14th November, and it was paid on Wednesday, 18th—in con<lb/>sequence of a letter which had been received from Mrs. Janvrin, I commu<lb/>nicated with Dean, and desired him to write a letter to me to explain—I saw him after that letter—I took an officer, who said, "You are charged with embezzling the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received by you for Mr. Benuett from Captain Taylor's servant"—I do not remember whether he said anything relating to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on 11th December I was staying at the Sailors' Home in Whitechapel—on the night of 11th December, about half-past nine, I was in Cannon-street, going home—I was sober—I met the prisoners and was about to pass them, when Manning touched me on the shoulder, and said, "How are you getting on?—I said, "Nicely "—Donovan was then on the other side of me—I went to go on and Manning said, "I see, you don't know a person now"—I did not stop, and he then came up to me, and said, "D—n it, you don't know a person, you don't recollect me the other day, fetching you to the Sailors' Home?"—I turned round and said, "I know nothing about you, my good man; you did not fetch me there"—he then struck me behind the ear as hard as he could—I recollect seeing him about Wells-street, where the Sailors' Home is, before that—Donovan then <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me on the side by the coat, tore my coat open, got his hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out my money—I had hold of his hand and felt the money in his hand—Manning then struck me again with his fist, and I was pretty near stunned—I called "Police"—after Man<lb/>ning struck me the second time, he put his hand in my right waistcoat pocket, in which I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, which he took out—I then got away from them and crossed the street; I saw them turn a corner and followed them—I then saw two women, Hands was one of them—I went a little further, saw a policeman, and made a complaint to him—he gave not the least attention to me—I left him to go away and the three prisoners then made a chase after me, and the woman came up to me at different times and got me by the coat and tried to get it off—I turned round and saw her face at different times—I went into a public-house and made a complaint to the landlord, and about five minutes afterwards police-constable Barnes called me out—I gave him some information and went with him to another public-house; I believe it was the Crown—I went in—he remained outside—I went into a room, and saw about fifteen or sixteen men and women assembled</p>

He told a policeman that he had been rob<lb/>bed; the policeman said, "Who robbed you?"and he said, "I don't know"—we stood there listening to him, and the man turned round, and said, "Those two men robbed me,"and the policeman would not take us—the prosecutor said then that he had lost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then walked up towards the Sailor's Home—this woman ran before us up to him, and then she came back to us, and said, "I have given him a good hitting and shoving for accusing us"—we then went to the Crown for some more beer, and the sailor and another policeman came in, and gave us in charge.</p>

I am a seafaring man, and was lately lodging at the Sailors' Home, in Wells-street—on 27th November, about 11 o'clock, I had been drinking with Margaret Hines in a public-house in Wells-street—I was going a bit of the way home when I met the prisoner—Hines pointed to him and said, "There, Robert, there is the man who has got your coat"—he had my coat on at that time—I said, "Give it up,"and he struck me on the face with his fist, and then drew out something from his left side, and stabbed me on the left side of the head and the ear—I was out—he struck me once with his fist and then with the knife, hard—I have a mark on my head still—I had a doctor for about five days—the prisoner ran away after it happened.</p>

About half-past 11 o'clock on Tuesday, 28th November, I was on duty in Holborn—I saw the four prisoners together outside the Bell public-house, in Newton-street—I am sure they are the men—they appeared to have seen me, and they went into the Bell about half-past 11—when I got to the station the next morning I heard there had been a robbery—I heard a description at the station—I went in search of the prisoners on the 30th—I went into Newton-street and saw McCormack and Southwell in the bar of the Bell—Brannan was with me—I went into the parlour, and saw Lemore and George in there, and three others that I wanted for another case—I took them out altogether—they wanted to know the charge, and I told them for assaulting and robbing a gentleman a couple of nights ago out in the street—Southwell said, "All rjght, give us fair play"—with assistance I took them to the station—I believe Southwell is his right name—we put them with about thirty in the yard, and the prosecutor was sent for, and he came and picked them out.</p>

I am a baker, of 36, Bridge-street, Greenwich—on Saturday night, 11th November, the prisoner came to me to pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave her change—as I was going down stairs, I met the witness Carter coming up—when I was half-way down, she said, "The woman is robbing of you"—I ran upstairs into the shop, ran behind the counter, and she said, "That woman has robbed you"—the prisoner said, "I have only been round the counter to take a biscuit or two"—I looked round the flour-shelves, and missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was there when I</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>.) I came to this country on 1st June in the present year—I was accompanied by Bayer—I went to the Terminus hotel, London-bridge—I stopped there seven or eight days—Bayer left one or two days before I saw Berrens—I think the second day after my arrival I saw Braun in front of the hotel at the railway-station—Bayer was with me—when we were together the talk was about the forged bank-notes, and an appointment was made for the next day to meet, and we did meet at a cafe the next day, not far from the hotel—there were present Berrens, Lon<lb/>dinski, I, and Bayer—Berrens introduced himself there as the owner of the manufactory of the notes—I asked him to show me the place of manufactory—he said he could not do so, and he asked me to give him some money for the purpose of procuring some new paper; some better ones—then we separ<lb/>ated—I said I should consider about it—the conversation was in German—Berrens is a Russian—he does not speak German fluently—next I saw Blum or Braun, in Spencer's hotel—that was perhaps six or eight days after the interview with Berrens; Londinski, Berrens, Bayer, and I were present—after Berrens would not show me the place of manufacture Braun was introduced to me, and represented to me as one who would establish for me such a manu<lb/>facture—Berrens recommended him to me, saying that he was an excellent engraver, that he had already made some plates of forged notes at Riga—and that also in London he had taken part, in making some plates, and that lat<lb/>terly he had imitated sixpenny-pieces here—Berrens and Braun told me that they had made these things in partnership with a man named Jaffer—I in<lb/>vited him to call on me to show me a sample, and he promised he would call and furnish me with such a sample—he came, not the next day but I think the second or third day afterwards—at that interview only indifferent things were spoken about—about the forged bank notes it was said, that a house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180075"/>
               <p>should be taken if the samples should turn out well, and then the manufactory should be established—we all spoke about it—I cannot recollect that anything more was said about the house at that time—the next person I saw was Holchester—I saw him at my lodging, No. 1, Brunswick-terrace—that was perhaps six or ten days after the interview with Braun—he came with Londinski—Holchester told me that he had 20,000 five-rouble notes ready, and offered them to me for sale—he told me he generally sold them at 20 or 25 per cent, but if I took all he produced he should give them to me at 10 per cent—I told him that I had not the intention of buying his papers, as the paper was so very bad, but if he would receive me as co-partner, and introduce me into his manufactory, I was ready to give him some money—he would not consent to that—no more was said about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At any time after that did Braun show you a plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had made the eagle of a Russian 25-rouble note—it was shown to me at Bayer's lodging; 75, Camberwell-road—after that Bayer, Braun, and I went to Pinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to Pinner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were about to hire a house, as the eagle had been recognised as being considered a good one—Braun sug<lb/>gested Pinner—he brought me a newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, or some other in which places of abode were advertised, and so we immediately went there—we went in a private carriage, a fly I think—it was hired from a place close to my lodging, the second or third house from it—we went to Pinner, and found that the house had been taken that very day—after that a house was taken at 11, Russell-street, Camberwell—Londinski found that house out, and agreed as to the price—I took the house—the second day I went there—Londinski had come to me about it before I took it, and after it was taken—Bayer went into the occupation of it—the first of the prisoners I saw at that house was Barrens—that was on the same day as Bayer went into it—I saw the prisoners there every day—I can't recollect whom I saw—Davis and Silberman I only saw at a later period—I saw Holchester at that house a few days after it was taken; very little time after—we were every day speaking about my wanting to have the factory, and he persisted on it that he would sell me papers—I did not agree to take the papers—I always refused to—at that time, I was in communication with Inspector Thompson—I afterwards went to Paris.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to Paris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Towards the end of June, Holchester told me that he would perhaps enter with me into this business, as soon as I should be recommended to him by somebody—I asked him from whom he wished to have the recommendation, and he said from De Lipeou in Paris—I went to Paris to De Lipeou for three days for the purpose of being recommended by him, and about two days after my return to London, Holchester and Londinski told, me that De Lipeou had written to them, and that he was ready or willing to take me as a co-partner into this factory, and asked for this 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling—at that time only I ascertained his name; I did not know it before—we then separated again, and these negotiations were repeated daily—once at my place; once at a public house near Holchester's lodging—in the month of July, Holchester showed me some forged notes—I can't say on what day—it was at my lodging—there were 500 forged five-rouble notes—200 of them Bayer bought—I gave the money for them—I saw Holchester on many occasions between that time and the time when he was taken into custody—every time we met he spoke about his factory—he wanted 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I would not give him—I first saw Davis, about the</p>

               <p>middle of July, at the London-bridge railway—Berrens and Bayer were present—Davis warned me and Berrens not to throw away uselessly the money at Brussels—I had not been to Brussels at that time—I went after<lb/>wards with Berrens—I wanted to discover there the factory of Crawcaur—nothing further of importance passed at that interview, only indifferent subjects—it was after I returned that I saw Silberman—I saw him at Davis's—he told me he had served in the insurrection, and showed me a certificate—nothing more passed of importance then; only indifferent subjects were spoken about—we then separated, and I saw him once more at Davis's; and there I asked Davis and Berrens what sort of a man he was; how he came into it—and they told me that he was a very clever man for the uttering of forged bank-notes—they also told me, at the same time, that he had brought some watches from Holland, for forged notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Holchester at any time when he mentioned to you a person of the name of Spretchnecover, or was the name mentioned by any of the prisoners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We spoke every day of the name of Spretchnecover, after she had been arrested in Paris—Holchester told me that he had not sold to Spretchnecover, and he had not sold direct to Bluckler—he always told me that he took from 20 to 25 per cent. for small quantities of the forged rouble notes—about the end of July an arrangement was made between me and Inspector Thompson—I can't recollect if it was on the 29th—I can't recollect what happened on that day—I remember a day upon which several of the prisoners came to Russell-street—when they assembled together there, it was always talked about of the factory and of the future arrangements—on 29th August, Holchester brought to Bayer 500 forged five-rouble notes, at 11, Russell-street—I saw Holchester arrive there—he had with him a parcel with 500 bank notes—it was wrapped up in a thin, fine paper—I can't say the colour of the paper; I can't recollect—Bayer was also there, and later Davis, Silberman, and Berrens came—we separated because Holchester was in a hurry to go away—nothing was done—I can't exactly recollect what was said—we spoke every day of the factory, of notes, of our business—Bayer received the packet of notes that Holchester brought—he took it down to the kitchen, to be kept—I then went away—they went away with the understanding that the next day, the 30th, I should go to Ramsgate with Bayer—Holchester was to accompany us—that was the day they were taken into custody—we did not go to Ramsgate—I had no intention of going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you and Holchester, and the others, to be in the house at the time they were arrested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had then to assemble there—I com<lb/>municated that to Inspector Thompson—I gave a signal to Thompson to come and arrest them—the signal was unbuttoning my coat—I did that at the first-floor window—that was not the room in which the prisoners were; they were on the ground floor—just before I went up stairs, I asked Bayer to show me the bank notes which Holchester brought yesterday—Bayer then fetched them—we looked at them, Holchester, I, and Bayer—Bayer fetched the notes from the kitchen—they were wrapped up in that paper; but I cannot recollect what sort of paper—I saw a carpet bag at that time in the place—I saw Holchester had a bag—Bayer had a bag—while Holchester, I, and Bayer were looking at the notes, Berrens, Davis, and Silberman came in, and at that moment I went up stairs, to give the signal—I cannot recollect what was going on at the time they came in—the notes were there—I can't say if they were just at that time on the table, or if somebody had taken them and put them somewhere else—I had them on the table—I cannot</p>

               <p>recollect whether anything was being said when Silberman, Davis, and Berrens came in—I did not remain up stairs while the prisoners were being arrested—I went down stairs into the kitchen—I first went into the room where they were, and looked out, and, when I saw Mr. Thompson coming, I went down stairs—I was not in the same room that the prisoners were after Thompson came in.</p>

               <p>lived in St. John's Wood—you always refused to give me your address—we had a conversation, the end of which was that you agreed to engrave plates for me of twenty-five rouble notes—you asked me for a new genuine twenty-five rouble note—I wanted to see a proof of your work, but did not say that I should like to see the eagle best—I understood very little of such works at that time—you told me that you had done this before, and it was only wasting time to see a proof, as you had done them in Riga and here—it was agreed that you should make the sample at Bayer's—I wanted to see the proof done in Bayer's and my presence, and you agreed that the sample should be made under our eye—I gave the money to Londinski to buy a genuine twenty-five rouble note—it was bought by Barrens—I do not recollect whether it was brought to Bayer's lodgings—it is possible that I went there to look at it—I do not know whether the good note was put in paper and handed over to you—I know you received it—it is possible that we then went away, and spent the night at the London Pavilion—I do not know whether you wrote to Bayer saying you would come on the next Saturday—I do not recollect Bayer showing me that letter—I cannot recollect whether you went to Bayer's on the next Monday and took some tools—that was Bayer's business—I saw a piece of steel there, which you brought to do this proof on—I do not know it—you showed it to me at my house, or at Bayer's house—I cannot recollect whether you and Bayer came next morning to No. 1, Brunswick-terrace—it is possible—I know the sample was made at Bayer's house, but I do not know if they went there from my house or not—I went over, talking to the landlord till it was done—they told me that it took two hours to draw the eagle and outline it—I I do not know if it was two, I was not present—I went up stairs and saw the proof—I would not be satisfied, or dissatisfied, as I did not understand that sort of thing—I asked Bayer if it was good—you told me that in three or four months you would have finished the whole engraving—you and Bayer came down stairs and found me talking to the landlord—I then went up and saw a proof—if we went up together, I do not know—I sent Londinski to look for a house, and it is very possible that I was in a very bad temper about his not having a house—you did not propose the news<lb/>paper, but you brought one to me—I think it was the Telegraph—I cannot read English, therefore I cannot have picked out the house at Pinner—you found it in the paper and read it, and told me there was a house there—I do not recollect your writing it on a card and showing it to the landlady—it is possible—this was at my lodging, 1, Brunswick-terrace—the landlady, I think, sent the servant to the railway-station—I do not know whether she found that there was no line to Pinner, but we took a private carriage, and you and I and Bayer went there in it—when we came to the house, you left Bayer and I in the carriage, and you came back and said, "You cannot get that house"—I think that it was already let—I do not know that you told me they would not let it to foreigners—we then went to the tavern and had dinner—Londinski came back the same night from Pinner—I do not know whether he found a house the next day or the day after—I do not recollect whether he had written down in his pocket-book the name of the landlord and of the agent, "11, Russell-street, "and "Johnson"—I can<lb/>not recollect that you took that paper out of the pocket-book, it is possible, or if you asked me to go and see the landlord—it is possible that I sent Lon<lb/>dinski for a cab, and that you and I and Londinski went there and saw George Johnson, but I do not know—I cannot recollect whether I saw a</p>

You will see by these few lines how much I have penetrated in this man; and apologizing that I could not do anything for you, I hope you will excuse my not personally coming to you, I being too much engaged in my business, and having been always exposed to unpleasantness when I have stopped away.

               <p>went away, apparently in a great hurry—at about a quarter to 11, Bayer returned—shortly before 11, Liban and Braun came to the house together, and I saw Liban, Holchester, and Braun seated at the window smoking, and in conversation—shortly afterwards I heard them speaking very violently, as if there was an altercation going on, and at 12 o'clock Holchester came out, slammed the door, and went away in a great hurry—he had the same coat and parcel on his left arm as he had when he went in—shortly after<lb/>wards, Davis and Berrens came to the house, and about 1 o'clock Berrens, Davis, Silberman, and Bayer went away together—I did not follow them, but I directed Mulvaney to do so—on the night of Monday, the 28th, I was in Holborn, opposite the Dancing-rooms, at midnight, and saw Davis, Berrens, and Liban, come out together—on the following day, Tuesday, the 29th, I was again in Russell-street, in the evening—I had an opportunity of looking in at the window—I was in a room immediately facing the house, and could see anything that went on—I saw the whole of the prisoners come there that evening, with the exception of Braun—they remained there until about half-past 9, and then went away in different directions—I did not see anything take place that day—previous to Wednesday, the 30th, Liban made some communication to me as to what was to take place on the 30th, in consequence of which, on the 30th, I, accompanied by other officers, went to Russell-street about 6 in the evening—I first saw Bayer and Holchester come to the house about half-past 5 in a hansom cab, and, a few minutes afterwards, came up a four-wheeled cab, out of which Berrens, Davis, and Silberman got, and went into the house—previous to this, about noon, I had seen Holchester go to the house and go away with Bayer—within about ten minutes afterwards I received an intimation which had been pre<lb/>arranged with Liban, and entered the house, accompanied by other officers—I first went into the parlour, which consists of two rooms, with folding doors, thrown into one—I there found Holchester, Bayer, Berrens, and Silberman seated round a table, drinking wine—I said, addressing the prisoners generally, "I am an inspector of police, and I have received information that there is in this place a large quantity of forged Russian notes"—several of the prisoners said, "We know nothing about it"—I could not individualise those who spoke—I said, "Very well, I shall search the house"—Holchester got up and said, "Look here, Mr. Inspector, I demand to see your warrant"—I said, "I have not got one, but I shall search the house, nevertheless"—I then directed the police who were with me, each to take charge of a prisoner—I then told Mulvaney to look round the room and see if there were any notes about; I did the same—Mulvaney went direct to the fireplace in the back portion of the room; there were several pieces of paper lying loose in the grate—Mulvaney examined them, there was no fire there—I then told Mulvany to come with me, he was still engaged in searching the fireplace, he left off doing so and went up with me, and we proceeded to search the upper part of the house—I there found some engraver's tools, which I pro<lb/>duce, in a drawer in a small table in the back room—I then went downstairs in to the kitchen and searched the ground floor, and then I entered the room with Mulvaney in which the prisoners were—I told Mulvaney to search the room thoroughly, and I commenced doing the same—I saw him go to the fireplace, and whilst I was examining a bed he exclaimed, "Here is some<lb/>thing, sir,"and he brought out the papers I now produce—he took them from the fireplace in the parlour where the prisoners were; I am told they are Russian notes, but I do not know Russian and cannot say—they were precisely in the same state as they are now when he handed them to me—</p>

               <p>when he produced them I said, "Very well,"and continued searching the room—no conversation passed that I noticed—I have omitted to state that when I re-entered the room with Mulvaney, I said, "I wish to see the occupier of the house"—Bayer stood forward, he did not appear to understand me, and I repeated the same to him in French, and he answered, "I occupy the house"—I said, "Very well, come with me a moment,"and I asked him to come out of the room—he came out of the room; Mulvaney also left the room—what Bayer said was not within hearing of the other prisoners—after some communication had taken place between Bayer and myself I went back into the room and closely searched it, and under a small table I found a carpet-bag; it was a small table near the window in the back portion of the room—this is the bag—it is a small six-roomed house—the bag was not under the table at which the prisoners were sitting—I felt the bag and found that it contained something like a book loose—I placed it on the table around which the prisoners were seated, and asked each one if he had the key of it; they each said "No" I took out my keys but none of them would fit the lock—I then cut open the side of the bag with a pen-knife, took out a small packet from the bag, opened it in the presence of the pri<lb/>soners, and found it to contain the notes I now produce—I placed the parcel of notes on the table and showed it to the prisoners—I said, "You see here is a bundle of what I think are forged Russian notes"—Holchester jumped up and appeared greatly excited, he said, "I do not speak Russian, and never saw a Russian note in my life"—I then ordered each of the prisoners to be searched—I saw Mulvaney take a key from the pocket of Bayer which fitted the lock of the bag—the prisoners were then given in custody to the station, I went with them—I afterwards went to the house of Holchester and searched it—I found there a duplicate relating to a ring pawned by a man named Berrens of Houudsditch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">alluded to the recent Act (28 Vic. c. 18), in the following terms</hi>;—</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="italic">There is one question which, although, perhaps, it will not bear much on this particular case, is realty of great general importance. I allude to the effect of the new Act of Parliament which has been recently passed at the instance of Mr. George Denman, as to the summing up of the evidence by Counsel in criminal cases, because it really seems to me from my brother Ballantine's address, and from what I am given to understand has been the course of proceeding at this Court, that the object of that Act has been quite misunderstood, and if it is continued to be acted upon as it has been, it will be absolutely necessary that it should be repealed, or the course of criminal justice in this country will be seriously injured. Hitherto it has been the supposition that the Prosecuting Counsel was to consider himself in a hind of quasi-judicial position. Of course he has to conduct the case for the prosecution, and to bring forward these parts of the evidence bearing upon the prisoner's guilt, but he does that with a feeling of responsibility that he is not to be a mere Counsel to try to get a verdict, but an assistant to help the Judge, by fairly bringing forward that which is the case of the prosecution, and nothing more. At Nisi Prius, where the causes are between party and party, the position of counsel is different. There he is employed by a particular party to get a particular verdict, and, of course, he must use all fair means, and none other, to get that verdict. In Courts of Criminal Justice, Counsel is in a very different situation; the tendency of which should be to try to avoid technical objections and Nisi Prius tricks, so that the case may be tried upon its merits. The Act was passed, not as my brother Ballantine has said, making it the duty of the Prosecuting Counsel to sum up in all cases, but giving him the right and the power to do so in exceptional cases where it is necessary in order to set right something that has occurred in the course of the case different to what was expected. If that is followed out as was intended by the Legislature, fairly and candidly—namely, the Counsel to state the case before he calls his evidence—then, when the evidence is over, to say simply, 'I say nothing,' or 'I have already told you what would be the effect of the evidence, and there it is, you see the evidence is right; 'or in exceptional cases to say,' Something is proved different to what I expected,' and merely to give such an explanation of it as is required, and to confine himself simply to those excep<lb/>tional cases, then the administration of Criminal Justice will go on as it has hitherto done in this country, and as I hope it always will, fairly and properly, the Prosecuting Counsel being really apart of the Court, a minister of justice, filling a quasi-judicial position; but if Counsel are to think it a matter of duty in every case to sum up the evidence and to introduce into criminal cases the course pursued at Nisi Prius; if we once get criminal prosecutions con<lb/>ducted, not by a gentleman feeling himself to be a minister of justice, but by a person who is to open his case slightly, then call the evidence and then trust to an eloquent speech at the end, so as to have the last word with the jury, and thus make himself a partisan, it will be utterly impossible to conduct Criminal</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180094"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Justice as it has hitherto been conducted; it will become the positive duty and necessity of the Judge, instead of trusting the Counsel for the Prosecution, to assist him in considering what are the real points of the case, and in helping the Jury with regard to them, to have his attention distracted by watching and seeing that no unnecessary Nisi Prius advantage is taken by him in order to catch a verdict upon something not substantially on the merits of the case itself. I do not say that anything of the sort has been done in the present case. I quite agree with my brother Ballantine that it is in the discretion of Counsel whether he shall sum up his case or not, but I think that discretion should only be exercised in particular cases. If it is to be done in all cases I think the Act will become, instead of a boon, a great curse, and must be repealed. If it is carried out as it has hitherto been carried out on the Circuits, that is to say, if the summing up of Counsel is a privilege only to be exercised in exceptional cases where it is really wanted, and if the Counsel, exercising their discretion, will use the privilege sparingly, then, no doubt, it will do, as it was intended to do, a great deal of good.</hi>"</p>

I am a boiler-maker in the employ of Horton, Son and Kendrick, and live at 172, Long-lane, Bermondsey—the prisoner is a fellow workman of mine—on Friday, 17th December, I was at work at Rother<lb/>hithe dock—there were fifty-six of us—the prisoner Webb was one—he left home with me in the morning, and was at work with me till we left at 6 o'clock in the evening—five others left with me—the prisoner was one of them—we went to the Ship public-house, Rotherhithe, and had some beer—we stayed there till twenty minutes past 7 exactly, the six of us—Webb was one—he went into a urinal and Topfield followed him—Webb was taken about twenty yards from the urinal—I was half-a-dozen yards from him, almost alongside of him—I could not hear what was said by the man who took him—we went to the station, but they would not allow us in—we told them we wanted to go in to hear the charge that was to be laid against our fellow shipmate, but the sergeant on duty prevented us—Doyle is the man who took Webb—he shoved four of us at one time off the steps of the station—we asked him what he was taking Webb for, but he only replied, "Come with me, and you will know all about it"—when we went he would not let us go in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Francis Martin, of Tudor-lodge, Wim<lb/>bledon-common—on 9th October, I saw the place secured, and went to bed at half past ten—I was the last up—when I came down next morning, I found my pantry in confusion—I missed two tea-pots, a coffee-pot, and a large quantity of plate that had been safe the night before in a cupboard in the pantry—some of the plated articles were on a cloth, but not part of those which I missed—the plated articles were placed on a cloth; they were not taken—I missed that cloth—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the window of the pantry was wide open, and all over treacle; and there was a quantity of treacle under the window, and some broken paper also inside—the glass of the window was broken—it opens like a door inwards towards the French case<lb/>ment window—there were four iron bars outside the window, not very large; they were painted a kind of brown colour—one was pulled right out, and three others bent very much—I should think it would allow one man to get through—I should think I could get through—the glass appeared to me as if it had been cut by a diamond, and removed by the treacle and brown paper—it was cut below the fastening—there was a very large piece of glass taken out—anybody could put their hands through, and open it quite well—I found this painter's putty-knife on the floor of the pantry close to the sink—I also found this file on the sink, and outside the window a piece of strong rope—I also found a piece of white cloth spread on the ground in front of the pantry window, and a green baize cloth was placed on the top of it—there was also a cloth in front of the hall window—I found a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> in the boot-house—on the knife-board I also found some bits of candle and some matches—I also missed two white cloths from the pantry besides the other one—I had known the prisoner before—he used to visit the housekeeper at Mr. Martin's—he was there on the 9th—he left about nine o'clock, just before we had prayers—I noticed a kind of slouched cap on a small table in the servants' hall that evening—the prisoner wore a kind of slouch-looking cap, rather dark, a kind of loose coat, and a fancy shirt, a Jersey—I did not notice whether he had any kind of blouse on.</p>

               <p>swear that—it has been painted—I will swear that the cupboard door has been painted lately—there were six or seven painters, I think, employed—at the time I lost the towel, I did not tell the constable of it—I missed it before Micklejohn called my attention to it—I did not give information about it—I told Micklejohn I had lost it—on the Thursday morning he told me that there were two foot-marks in front of the pantry window—you have been visiting at the house some considerable time—in August last, I went to the Isle of Wight—my bed-room door is always locked; I never leave it unlocked—we had no footman then—we have one now—he has not the key of my room, nor have I—I have not the key here—my bed-room was locked when I went to the Isle of Wight—I took the key with me—the housemaid could not get into the room, that I know of—on Thursday, 12th October, the officer, King, showed me a brooch with a likeness in it—he said he had never seen the likeness in the brooch before, or the person it represented—I saw foot-marks at Tudor lodge before I saw Micklejohn with the boot—Tuesday, the 17th, was the first time I saw marks—I did not see them until the police called my attention to them—they were in front of the pantry window, about seven yards away—there is no mould there—it is a kind of gravel; ashes and gravel together—it is a path, not a bed—there were no foot-marks found on that path—on the Thursday night, two days after the robbery, you came to Tudor lodge, with your mother—about half-past 9, when you were going to leave, I heard a policeman say, that by Mr. Martin's orders, you could not leave—I did not hear you ask him the reason why you were detained—I did not hear him say that he did not know—I did not see you give the police the keys of your residence—I believe you did—I have got a brother a painter—I did not tell the police so—I always leave the plate down stairs—Mr. Martin's orders were, that I should take the silver up every night to my bed-room; but I thought it quite secure to place it in the plate-cupboard, and lock it up, except when they have been out of town, when I have taken it up into my bed-room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> I believe you saw the towel on Monday, October 2d? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw it on the morning the inspector was there; he found it in the drawer—it was on the Tuesday morning you wished me to send your things to the wash, I think—I really cannot say when it was I saw the towel—it must have been either the Monday or Tuesday when I saw it—I did not see you come in on the Tuesday—the blouse was dirty when I sent it to the wash—I did not notice that there was any alteration in it—there were some other things with it—it might have been in your room a day or two before—I had never seen you wear it in my house; I suppose you wore it at your work—Micklejohn came to my place on Saturday, the 14th, I think—he did not say that if I came up to Wandsworth he would pay me; he said I had occasion to come—I had a summons to go—he said he would intercede for me to be paid my rent—I believe when you took my apartments you told me you were working for Messrs. Banting of St. James's-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the gardener at the entrance-lodge to Tudor-lodge, Wimbledon—I live there with my father—on the evening of 9th October, I let the prisoner out at the front gates, between 9 and 10—I had not been in the habit of letting him out that way—it was an unusual thing—I cannot say that I had ever seen him go out at the front gates before, I do not remember—I had seen him come in that way on Sundays—he was dressed in dark clothes, and wore a loose coat, and a slouched cap, like this one—the last omnibus to London goes past the house at a quarter past 7.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Martin's gardener—I saw Micklejohn measure some footmarks on some loose ground, about five yards from the pantry window, with a pair of compasses—he produced a boot and gently pressed it into the hole, and then measured it across with the compasses—he just put it into the footmark—I did not see him make any mark—he did; not press it—he put it gently down to the footmark—I did not see him do anything else with the boot—I was not there when he began the operations—one footmark was preserved—I did not see another by the side of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what did he measure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He measured the boot with the compasses, and measured the footmark with the compasses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was it on the Saturday that your attention was first called to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had never looked at it before—the flower-pots are in my charge—Micklejohn did not borrow one of me that day—I never lent one—there are hundreds of flower-pots about there—it was not a secret that you were there—you might be there as you liked—you always had done so—there would be nothing extraordinary in one of your footmarks being there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
