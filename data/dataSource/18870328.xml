I am a draper, of 6, Columbia Road, Hackney Road, the last witness has apartments there—on the night of 12th February I had been to Bow, and came home about a quarter to 10, and went through my shop into the parlour—I heard that the side door was open—I shut it, and got a candle and proceeded upstairs, and on the first landing I saw the prisoner and another man; they were about to ascend to the second floor—I said "Halloa, what are you doing here?" and the prisoner turned to his friend and said "Come along, we have come to the wrong house"—I came down stairs, and they followed me close behind, and while I was in the act of fastening the side door to detain them they made their escape through the shop, pushing a glass case down in their escape—I am sure the prisoner was one of the men—I had a candle in my hand, and held it up to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shop was lighted up and had been open all the evening; my wife was serving—there is a shop-parlour at the back, with a curtain partially drawn across a glass door—there is a window at the back of the shop-parlour, and you can see through the shop to the back of the house, that is always kept latched—the prisoner was differently dressed then—the other man had on a brown overcoat, but I could not say whether he had a muffler on—he had a light moustache.</p>

I started the Guide when I was in Regent Square, 18 months ago; after I got into trouble about the pictures"—when searching his bedroom he produced a packet of Guides from his trunk; he said "These are specimen numbers of each copy of the Guide since its commencement"—I went through them—the earliest had no date, the next were Christmas Vacation 1885 ones; then came February, March, April, none for May and June, but others from July to October inclusive; nothing subsequent to October.</p>

On 1st March, about 4.30 p.m., I went with Hearn and Macey to Barkley Street, Somers Town—I saw Lynch take hold of the knocker of No. 14; he looked round, then left the door, crossed the street and walked away in an opposite direction to me—I followed and told him I should apprehend him for burglary in Park Street on Saturday night—he said "All right, I will walk with you; I do not know anything about the burglary. Have you got the others?"—I said "Not all of them"—he said "I wish to Christ you had"—at the station he said "I wish to Christ you had the proper people here, I do not know this man, I never saw him in my life before"—he said "You smile, governor, I daresay you know all about this job, first come first served. The man says that it is his coat, does he?"—I said "The man who charged you identifies the coat you were carrying, and you heard him say so"—he said "He does, does he? I shall prove it is my coat and where I had it made."</p>

               <p>said, "Yes"—I said, "Perhaps they may not be to sample"—I put down 50 dozen, and the sizes, and I said if they were not those sizes they were no good to me—they were to be delivered by 4 o'clock on the Wednesday—I find the place where the leaves are torn out in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the next day, Wednesday, I remained at home till about 4.45 p.m.—Leeder was with me—Bentley did not come, nor did the gloves—I went out about 4.50—when I came back a communication was made to me by somebody in the shop, or the next morning, and on that morning, about 10 o'clock, Bentley came—he said, "I have brought the gloves:—I said, "Have you brought an invoice?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I cannot take them without an invoice. I do not like to take anything without an invoice; you had better go back and get a proper in<lb/>voice and then you can have your money"—he went away—I saw him no more till he was in custody.</p>

In consequence of information I received I went on 29th January, about 3 p.m., to 14A, Napier Street, Hoxton, with Sergeants White and Thick—I saw Bentley in the passage—I went with him into the back parlour—I said "I am an inspector of police, and this is Sergeant Thick. We have called to make inquiry respecting a quantity of gloves which I am told you offered to a hosier in the Hackney Road for sale"—he replied, "I know nothing about any gloves"—I took these two pairs of gloves from my pocket and said, "These are the gloves I refer to; I am told you left them with a Mr. Leeder, of Peter Street, Hackney Road, and he afterwards introduced you to a Mr. Heddon, and that Mr. Heddon ordered 50 dozen of you, and that you brought them the next day but he would not take them in because you had no invoice"—he said "No, not me, it was a mistake, I know nothing about any gloves"—I said "Am I to understand that you totally deny offering any gloves for sale?" he said "I know nothing about any gloves and never offered any for sale, and you have made a mistake"—I said "You must consider yourself in custody for being concerned in stealing a large quantity of gloves, value over 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 28th December last"—he said "Very well; I know nothing about it"—I searched the room and in a clock which was on the mantelpiece I found the lady's gold watch produced—I saw this case afterwards in one of the drawers, and he said "That belongs to the watch," and I put it with it—I said "How do you account for this watch, Mr. Bentley, which was inside the clock?"—"It was going," he said, "a man left it here, he will come for it; if he does not I will tell you who it is"—amongst other things I found about 40 pawnbrokers' duplicates, one relating to the pledge of a gold watch for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Cranfield of 450, Edgware Road, and on another duplicate the address of Cranfield of 22, Hertford Road, Downkam Road, Kingsland; that relates to a watch pledged with Mr. Bryant in the name of James Topp; I also found this book showing that Bentley paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week rent, he only occu<lb/>pied one room; I also found this book which Mr. Heddon identified, two pages are missing, there are some entries in it: "Watch and seal, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; lever watch, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; silver albert, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; gold watch, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; two watch-keys; one clock, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; paid for hats, 2 doz.; Harry; H.

               <p>like to see the <hi rend="italic">"loser"</hi>—that was before he went to the cells—he meant the owner of the van from which the property was lost—I was present at the interview, the offect of which was that if he, Bentley, could be out on bail he might be able to do him some good—I had left Sergeant White on the premises—on the evening of 29th January I went with Heddon, a witness in the case, to the King Lud—leaving Heddon in the bar, I had a conversation with Mr. Wilkinson, the manager of the King Lud—Cranfield was serving behind the bar—after leaving the King Lud I went back to Napier Street—White was still there; he handed me this telegram—the next day, at a quarter to I, I went to the King Lud and saw Cranfield—White accompanied me—I said to Cranfield, "I am an inspector of police, and this is Sergeant White; I have come to make inquiry about a quantity of gloves which were stolen in December last; what is your name?"—he said, "Henry Cranfield"—I said, "Where do you reside?"—he said, "22, Hertford Road, Downham Road, Kingsland"—I said, "I apprehended a man named Bentley, of 14A, Napier Street, yesterday afternoon, for being concerned in stealing and receiving the gloves I have spoken about; I also came here last night and saw the manager, Mr. Wilkinson, and after I left I find this telegram was sent to Bentley at his house, and purports to come from you; it was handed in at Ludgate Hill shortly after I left"—I took out the telegram and read it—he said, "It is quite right, I sent it; I thought perhaps something was wrong." (<hi rend="italic">The telegram was to Bentley</hi>: "Clear your house. <hi rend="smallCaps">H. CRANFIELD</hi>. "10.40 p.m., 29th January.) The manager then said "What did you do with the box that was handed over the bar last night; what was in it?"—Cranfield. said "Only my watch and a few little things I did not care for anyone to see"—I said "I also find pawntickets in Bentley's possession relating to a valuable gold watch pledged for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in your name"—he said "Oh! you will find that is all right; it was pledged at Attenborough's some time ago; it is redeemed"—I said "I am told that you introduced Bentley to a Mr. Leeder, and that you told him it was your father, and that you were present when he gave Leeder the sample of the gloves, and that Leeder and Heddon called on you the next day and you gave them Bentley's address at 14A, Napier Street"—he said "About four months ago I got acquainted with a man who came occasionally into the bar, and about a month ago he asked me if I knew anyone who would buy gloves—I told him I would see, and I spoke to McGoverain, and asked him if he knew anyone, and he recommended Mr. Leeder, who happened to call; I do not know the name and address of the man who called here, but I afterwards went with Bentley, whom I knew when I was at the Sutton Arms, Caledonian Road, when I was there as barman"—he said they called the man who asked him if he knew anyone who could buy gloves, sometimes <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and that he looked like a City man, and he went on to describe him, saying "He has a brown beard and moustache, wears a high hat, and looks as though he had been a soldier"—he said he had heard him say he was going to Gresham Street; also "The man was in here last night, and told me someone was in trouble, and that caused me to send a telegram"—I said "You will have to consider yourself in custody, for I consider your explanation is very unsatisfactory, and the fact of your passing a box over the bar last night after I was here is a very suspicious circumstance, and is a matter for the Magistrate to deal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280044"/>
               <p>with"—he said he had taken the box to a man named Montague, and if I would allow him he would show me where he lived, as he could not remember the number of the house—I accompanied him to Wall Street, Stepney—he knocked at the door, No. 14, I think, and McGoverain, who resides on the first floor, answered, and we went up into his room—McGoverain denied all knowledge of the box—then Cranfield said "I did not leave it here; if I tell you where the things came from that are in that box, will that do?"—I told him my only object was that he should not have an opportunity of saying that I did not allow him to explain, and he said "I shall say nothing"—I took him to the station—he said "I gave the parcel to a man in the street; I do not know where he lives," referring to the one that was handed over the bar—many of the pawntickets relate to articles of jewellery, and some of them I find are his wife's.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Baches Street, Shoreditch, and am landlady of that house—it is composed of the kitchen, ground floor, and first, second, and third floors—I have lived there between 17 and 18 years—I am the tenant, and let it out to others—in February last my three daughters, Mrs. Gauntlett, Lydia, and Amy, lived with me—I and Amy lived in the basement, and slept together in the first-floor back room, and Alice and Lydia occupied the parlour floor; the back room was their bedroom, and the front room their parlour—those rooms communicated by folding doors, and there is a door from each room into the passage which leads to the front door—the first-floor front room was occupied by two old ladies, Mrs. Fenn and Mrs. Dodd; the second-floor front by Mr. and Mrs. Attrell, the back by Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair, and the third floor by Mr. and Mrs. Day—all those lodgers had regular hours of going out—Attrell went out about a quarter to 7, and my daughter Alice about 10 minutes to 7, Lydia about 8, Mrs. Day about a quarter past 8, and Mrs. Sinclair about 9—I am the mother of the deceased girl—she was about 31 years of age, and had been keeping company with the prisoner between 10 and 12 years—he is about the same age, I think—I scarcely know in what employment he was; he was a sponge-clipper the last thing he worked at, but he was only there some few months—I do not know what he was before that; he never knew what he was doing—he never asked me to assist him in any way—my daughter was employed at Mr. Andrews's, at Walthamstow, covering surgical instruments—she had been there 14 or 15 years, and had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—out of that she paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for her board and lodgings—she took her dinner with her, and if I had not got it I gave her the money—that left her 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for herself—the prisoner had been in the habit of constantly coming to the house, but he has not come quite so much since last August—I believe he knew the lodgers in the house—he did not tell me the reason he did not come so often after August—I did, not know of any difference in the relationship of my daughter Lydia and the prisoner—I know he used to meet her as usual, and come to the door and such like, but I did not see much of it—that would be once or twice a week, or perhaps more—he would come into the house, and would be familiar with the lodgers' habits, and know the hours when they came in and went out—the last time I saw him was on a Sunday towards the end of January—I and my daughter and a Mr. Gilbey and the prisoner were in the parlour together—Gilbey did not wait about a quarter of an hour—I do not think the prisoner and my daughter were on good terms then; they did not talk much—I think she was quite alone in the room when the prisoner came in—I had been to chapel, and I came home and found the three together—she had stopped at home to mind Alice's baby—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280047"/>
               <p>and the prisoner then went out a little while, and he came back to the door with her—that was the last time I saw him—on Friday night, the 4th, just about 11 o'clock, I was in the house, and heard the prisoner talking at the street door with Lydia, but I did not hear anything that was said—they were not married because he would never keep a place to get enough money, and she would not marry him till he got a home—I heard him say good-bye on the Friday night, and then my daughter came in, and came down to the kitchen and had her supper—she was in her usual spirits, but she looked pale and ill, as if she was worried—she had her supper, and then went to bed—in the morning, at a quarter-past 7, she used to knock on the floor with a little curtain-pole which she kept—before that, at a quarter to 7, Alice used to come up and bring me a cap of tea, the last thing before she went out to her work, And I used to remain in bed until I heard the knocking from below—on Saturday morning, 5th February, Alice came up as usual at a quarter to 7, and gave me a cup of tea, and then went away, and I remained in bed with my daughter Amy—about five or ten minutes past 7 I heard a very great noise three times, but I cannot describe what it was; it appeared to be like something very heavy falling down, but I could not tell where it came from—the noises came very quick one after the other—I spoke to Amy, but I did not get up for a minute or two—I then heard some one walk across the passage and bang the street door, and I got up then—I had heard Mrs. Gauntlett go out that morning and close the door after her—I had not heard the door go at all between the time of my hearing those footsteps and the banging of the door—I got up and put my things on hastily; Amy remained in bed—I then went downstairs to the back parlour bedroom: the door was palled close to, but not catched—when I got inside I found my daughter lying on the floor just inside the door, with her head towards a chest of drawers and her feet towards the bed, which is on the right-hand side of the room as you enter—she was fully dressed with the exception of her dress-body and her boots, and her hair was partly plaited—I saw some blood on the floor under her head, and some upon her face, and some under her right hand, which was thrown out under a chair—Mrs. Gauntlett's baby was on the bed crying dreadfully; it is eight months old—a little spirit lamp was burning on the drawers on a little tray; it was not very dark and not very light—the washhand-stand was just beyond the drawers, that appeared to have been used; there was dirty water in it—in front of the window there was a dressing-table with the looking-glass on it; that is where my daughter would be standing if the baby was not crying, and if it was she would go to the bed—this is quite a small room—at that time I only noticed one wound over the left temple—seeing that, I called for assistance, and my daughter Amy and Mrs. Attrell and the other lodgers came, and Dr. Davis was sent for, and he arrived in a short time—up to his arrival Lydia had remained almost in the same position—I showed him the wound—he made some examination of it, and gave me certain advice—he told me she was dead—after that, about 8 o'clock, Mrs. Coleman was sent for, and she came and laid the body out, and she then pointed out to me an injury on the right hand and two injuries upon the right side of the throat, and the right eye was very black as though bruised—she was lying flat on her back when I saw her—this was about 9 o'clock—the doctor was to come back later in the</p>

               <p>day upon my sending for him, and about 3 or half-past I sent for him—Attrell came home about 3—he told me something, in consequence of which I sent for the doctor and the police—about 6 or 7 o'clock the doctor came again, and made a more complete examination of the body—the prisoner had left nothing at all at my house belonging to him on the Friday night—there was nothing the matter with me on the Saturday—I was quite well, and I had been so on the Friday night—I did not see the prisoner on the Saturday and tell him to go and get my daughter's wages; I should not have done that if I had seen him—all my tenants have latchkeys—after we discovered this the blinds of the house were pulled down at once, and remained down all day, and they were down at 1.30—I did not see the prisoner on the Saturday, and I did not see the latchkey which the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sometimes the prisoner stayed away from the house two or three days at a time—in November, I think it was, he was ill, and my daughter used to go and visit him at his father's house—they had been away together in the country or at the seaside, in August—he some<lb/>times used to stay away on the Sunday—I cannot say whether he had been out with her every night for a fortnight before 5th February, hut I think very likely he did, because he used to meet her coming from work—she had been to his father's house on the previous Sunday—she went to Green Lanes Chapel, but not with him—on the Friday night she should have come in from her work at 8 or a quarter-past, but she did not come in till nearly 11, and she apologised, and said she had been with him at his father's house—I had a son living at Bow—the prisoner was a good bit there during the five days he was ill, and after his death on 7th January—the prisoner was there on and off during his illness, and sat up with him one night, and he helped my daughter to remove the furniture there—Lydia went there with him sometimes—my son died leaving a widow and children, and I was greatly upset by that, he being my only son—I was not laid up; my daughters did not think I was likely to have an illness, and I did not speak of being ill—I was in my business all the time—I can't say whether more people would he in the house at 7 a.m. than at any other time; they would not all be gone out then; the Days would be in the house, and Mrs. Attrell—there is a good lock to the door; it has not been out of order this year or two; you could not open it by pressing against it—it is not left open in the daytime or in the evening—there is a door at the back leading into the yard, and there are workshops at the back—both the husbands and wives have a key; I gave them all one, I believe—I never heard of any other persons having keys that would open the door—I did not know that Currell had one—he had a key when he lived in Chart Street close by which would open our door—his mother lived there 12 months ago last June, and their key would open our door—the prisoner has lived there all his life—I have seen him open the door with that key, not for other persons to go in, but if he or Lydia wanted to come in in the evening when they were out he would let them in—I did not know that he opened the door lately with a key—as far as I remember there was in other person outside the house who had a key—Walter has not got a key that I know of; he is my daughter Amy's young man—Lydia had a key, but she seldom took it with her—I don't know that everybody knew she had a key—I don't remember that she has ever used it—Amy has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280049"/>
               <p>not got a key—I never lent my key to anybody—if Amy went out she had to knock at the door; there is a knocker and a bell—I don't know that the prisoner had got furniture at my house for their home when he got married—his father sent a few old things, but it was never mentioned that they were for him—all there was was a very small bed and bedstead and a washhand-stand, a fender, and a little timepiece—the prisoner has done jobs about the house with his tools for me on one or two occasions, not often; he has not done anything during the last 12 months—I remember his buying some blinds, he told me he had bought them at a sale for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was before Mrs. Gauntlett came to live with me, which was 13 months ago—he put three of them up in my house, in the kitchen, and one in my bedroom, there was then one left—that stood in Alice Gauutlett's room on the ground floor, and was taken away some two or three months ago—it was going to be put up in her room, but she would not have it because it would make it too dark—they were the ordinary canvas blinds on rollers, with a pulley and cord—she told me Currell had taken the blind away—there was a small paper parcel, with a pair of pincers and a hammer and other things in it, on the shelf in the Kitchen for some time, and it was taken away two or three months ago—I will not swear the blind was not taken away on the Wednesday before the Friday, Mrs. Gauntlett knows more about the blind than I do—there was a watch and some jewellery in this room, and Lydia had a little money, but nothing was taken from the room of any kind—the watch was on the chest of drawers—I know my daughter had no other admirer but Currell, she was too particular—she was very modest and reserved, she did not associate with any one—the relations between her and the prisoner were thoroughly respectable—I heard the old ladies go out that morning at 6.30, and heard the street-door bang—I used to get up when I heard my daughter knock, and go down and get her food ready by the time she came down—she used to get out of bed at 7 o'clock and get partly dressed before she knocked to me; I daresay she would take half an hour to dress, because she was rather particular—all the lodgers were in the house on this morning when I came down, except the two old ladies—I know Annie Manton—Lydia had been away from her work before this on Saturdays; on Saturday, 15th January, when her brother was buried, she was away, and also when she was ill—she had arranged on the Saturday to make some clothes for her sister's baby—Annie Manton brought Lydia's wages on those two occasions when she was away, and I saw her hand it to her in the parlour on Sunday evening—I heard that Annie Manton had given Currell the money on the same day, at 12 o'clock at night, she came round and told me—I have seen her and Beatrice Stevens a good many times since, and I have spoken to other people about this matter—I have known a man named Williamson by sight for three or four years—he occupied a shop in Pitfield Street, and we purchased things there; he is not there now, one of his daughters is in the shop—I first spoke to Williamson about this matter last Sunday—I know a Nan named Lambert, I never saw him till last Sunday, I have heard of him—I do not know a man named Thomas—when I came downstairs and the doctor was sent for I thought she had fallen and fractured her skull, but in the morning we thought there had been some foul play, and after we had seen Attrell about 3 or half past, and from some statemen the made, that made us feel certain—Attrell would not be home at 1 o'clock,</p>

               <p>sometimes he does not come home till 6 or 6 in the evening—the police were communicated with sometime after Attrell came home—they searched the parlours but not the lodgers' apartments, nor I think the kitchen—they came about 6 o'clock—I was a great deal annoyed about this matter by people coming to see me, amongst them people from the press—it only took me a few minutes to put on my clothes after I heard the noise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner was present in the parlour on the Sunday after my son's funeral, when Annie Manton brought Lydia's wages—she handed her the money, which was always in an envelope, and in a joke said, "Co., it," meaning "share it," and Lydia put it in her pocket—I didn't see her open it and count the money—Alice was present—the fender and washstand were brought to my place after the prisoner's father left Great Chart Street; it was a little painted washstand; they were broken, I should not like to give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the full value—it was a child's bedstead.</p>

I am single, and live with my mother at 8, Baches Street, Shoreditch—we lived in the kitchen and slept in the first floor back, we have lived there a great many years—my sister Lydia lived there with us, and I have seen her and the prisoner in the house, but from August he did not come till October, and from October to February he sometimes did not come for a week, and then perhaps he would come two or three nights in a week—he knew my mother's lodgers, their habits in coming in and out—I was at home on the night of the 23rd January, when Mr. Gilbey was there; my sister was at home also; the prisoner came in and remained some little time—I was not at home when either he or Mr. Gilbey came, I came in and found them both there, and then the prisoner and my sister went out—I saw him again the next Sunday, he only came to the passage, and my sister was out, she had gone to his mother and father's—he said, "I will go on to her"—I next saw him on Tuesday, 1st February, at our house—he was again there on Wednesday, the 2nd, and remained for a little while, that was the last time I saw him—to my knowledge he left no tools there—on Friday night he did not come in—I slept with my mother as usual on Friday night, and next morning Alice brought us some tea before she went to work—she went at her usual time, Attrell having left before her—I remained on in bed with my mother and heard the door bang after Alice went out, and went to sleep again, and was awoke by a very loud noise, which occurred three times—I got up in bed and asked my mother what it was—she said, "I cant make out"—I said, "I think it is the door banging"—she got up and dressed herself, and I went to sleep again—my mother went downstairs, and her calling awakened me—I got up and went downstairs into my sister's bedroom, and saw my sister lying on the floor—there was blood upon the floor and upon her face—at that time the only wound I saw was one on her left temple—I took her up and supported her head and sent for a doctor—he came, and after that Mrs. Coleman was sent for, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 8, Baches Street—I live with my wife in the second floor front room; no one else lives with us—we have lived, there about a year and eight months—when I first went to live there Mrs. Green gave me a latch-key, but that was lost in some unaccountable way about the first or second week we were there—my mistress bought two other keys at a stall in Hoxton, and they opened the door—there was also a third key, a metal key, which I got from my brother-in-law—I think that was made of brass and copper—I had the metal key; I always carried it—my wife carried one of the others, and my little nephew, William Henry King, had the third—he does not live with us; he is a doctor's boy—he formerly lived with us, and after he left he kept the key—he is just turned 15—I know the prisoner quite well, but only as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, or Thomas—I knew that he was coming to the house and keeping company with Lydia Green—I saw her last on the Friday evening, standing outside Mrs. Green's front door at about half-past 10, and he was with her—they were talking quietly together—I passed in, leaving them there, and wished them good night, and went upstairs to my room to my wife and went to bed—on the Saturday morning I got up about half-past 6, and went out at the front door as near as possible at half-past 7—it was fastened when I came down, and of course I fastened it when I went out—Mrs. Fenn and Miss Dodd go</p>

               <p>out before me—it is only a catch-lock; I found it on the latch—I pulled the latch back and went out—the door does not swing back; you pull it to, and it fastens—I remember pulling it after me because it goes rather hard—I left the house as nearly as possible at a quarter to 7—I saw no one in the house before I left—I noticed a light in the front parlour when I got out into the street—I turned to the left as I went out at the door; that was towards Brunswick Place—I went towards Charles Square, and when I was at the corner of Charles Street and Pitfield Street I saw the prisoner there (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the plan</hi>)—it takes about two minutes to walk from No. 8 to the spot if you walk quick, and a little farther on is the Crosby Head public-house—the prisoner was merely standing there, at the corner of the pavement, doing nothing—he was not against the wall—he spoke first; he saluted me in the usual way, "Good morning, Mr. Attrell," and I said "Good morning, <hi rend="italic">Tom,"</hi> or "Thomas," or "Good morning to you"—I did not know that his name was Currell—he said "Which way are you going?"—I said I was going to Clifton Street, and we walked from where he stood to the corner of the Crosby Head, towards the City; that was the way to my workshop, where I was going—he asked me if I was coming in there, and of course I walked in with him—he asked me what I would have to drink—I said "Half a pint of mild ale," and he called for two, one for himself and one for me, which he paid for, and then he called for a pennyworth of gin, and put it in my ale, and made a mixture of it, and said a drop of gin would give me courage if I was going up on a high roof—he then said "Is there any one up and about at hour?"—I asked if he meant Mrs. Green or any of the family—he said "Yes"—I told him the two old ladies who lived in the first floor under me had gone out—he said "Is Alice gone out?" meaning Mrs. Gauntlett—I said "I don't know; there was a light in the parlour when I came out, I noticed that"—he said nothing to that—he said that he had left a few things in Mrs. Green's kitchen, which he wanted to get out, and he did not want to be knocking at the door to be disturbing the family; would I kindly lend him my keys to get the things out, and he said after he had used the key he would return it to Mrs. Green, and she would return it to my wife, so that I could have it after dinner—nothing more was said about the things in the kitchen, only that they were a few things which I understood he wanted for his business—he said they were two or three little things he left there on Friday evening, and he wanted to get them out; he did not say what for—nothing more was said about Alice—I lent him the key, drank up the drink, wished him good morning, and left him—I had never drunk with him before—I was in his company three minutes, or it may be four minutes altogether, and no more—I parted with him at the Crosby Head in the big bar, the largest bar of the house—he went out at the Pitfield Street side, and I at the Old Street side, and I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at Worship Street—it was as near as possible 6 minutes to 7 when I parted with him—I went to my work, and came home about half-past 3, and heard what had happened to Lydia—I went to the station and told the police that I thought there had been foul play, and told them about my key—I have never seen it since—I had never lent it to him before—I think it was made of copper and brass mixed; it looked more of a copper colour—it got very bright in my pocket, and it was more like copper than brass; a sort of dirty brown—I never saw any key of</p>

               <p>this lock of that metal—I cannot exactly tell how the prisoner was dressed; it was rather dark at a quarter to 7, but I know it was dark clothes; I do not know whether it was a brown or black coat, and a hat with a band round it—I had not time to stop to take much notice; I had to get away to my shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My wife bought the two keys at the same time, and they both fitted the door, and afterwards my brother, who is a blacksmith, gave me a key, as I wanted a third—I never saw a bolt on the door—there used to be a big lock attached to it, but I think it is out of order—whenever I have come in it has been by turning my own key—I have come in at 12 and 12.30, never any later, and it was very extraordinary to be out as late as that—I always let myself in—I said before the Magistrate that I had seen Currell there ever since I had been in the house, and I had seen Lydia—they were talking happily together on the Friday night—I never heard any angry words between them in my life—I passed close to them on the left as I went in at the door, and I wished them both good night—Currell had never spoken to me about where I worked—he had no means of knowing in what direction my work was that I am aware of—I dare say I have known the neighbourhood of Baches Street 12 years; the same houses have been there all that time, the streets have not been altered—Baches Street is the nearest way that I should go to my work; I might have gone along Brunswick Street into Pitfield Street, there would not be half a dozen yards difference—I work at different places; we are sent to all parts of London; one morning I go one way, and another another, but I have to go to the shop to get the time-sheet at Clifton Street—that leads to Earl Street, Finsbury—I go there every morning when I am at work for Mr. King—all his men have to be there at 6 o'clock in the summer and 7 o'clock in the winter, by the time-sheet—I work regularly for Mr. King when he has got work, when he has not I cannot do it, he does not make work for me, people do not do that, I wish they did—work was bad last winter, and has been for the last two years—I cannot say whether Currell was within a few yards of the Crosby Head when I met him that morning; he was actually in Pitfield Street, he had not turned the corner into Charles Street—I left the house about a quarter to 7—it might have taken me two minutes to walk to where I met him—I might have stood and talked to him two minutes, and then we walked to the public-house, and I dare say I was in there about four minutes and no more—I did not look at the clock in the public-house—he could not have left me at nearly 10 minutes to 7—the first account I gave of this was at the Inquest—I do not remember saying, "I should think it must have been seven or eight minutes to 7 when I left him," but it may have been—I do not carry a watch because I have not got one—I cannot say whether from where I left him he could walk to Baches Street, go into the house, go into the kitchen, come out again, and get back to the spot in 10 minutes—I could walk there in two minutes, and no doubt in three, I mean three minutes from the Crosby Head—if I was at the door in Baches Street I should have to go down-stairs to get to the kitchen—sometimes you could not get the key out of the lock; I know it is a job to get the key into the lock sometimes; I do not know whether there was something wrong with the lock—I dare say I could get from the door to the kitchen in two minutes—sometimes I have a difficulty in opening the door—I never saw Mrs. Green after</p>

               <p>I got back on Saturday—Amy was the first person I spoke to when I went to the house on Saturday afternoon, and I did not have any conversation with her—I spoke to my wife when I got upstairs—my work is over about 12 o'clock on Saturday—I could walk from Mr. King's shop to Baches Street in a quarter of an hour if I went straight home—I was there about 1 o'clock—sometimes we do not get our money till 1 o'clock—if I got my money at 1 o'clock I could be home at a quarter-past, if I did not stop anywhere—I might have been home from 12.15 to 1.15—I should not go along Brunswick Place, I should come up Pear Street into Pitfield Street, and turn into a street that leads into Brook Place, or else turn up Charles Street, the way I went in the morning—if I turned up Charles Street I should come into Brunswick Place—when I saw the prisoner that morning his manner was calm, he was all right, I saw nothing wrong about him—the conversation I had with him did not strike me as being at all extraordinary—I did not think it a remark<lb/>able thing that he should borrow my key, nor in the smallest degree suspicious—I might have talked this matter over with a few people, I cannot say how many; I never made a constant affair of it—I am quite sure of the words the prisoner used—he did not say, "Is there anybody up round the corner?" not to me—he said, "Is there anybody up and about at home?"—I said, "Do you mean the Green family?" and he said "Yes"—he said, "Is Alice gone?"—I said I did not know—he said, "If Alice is gone I shall have to knock at the street door," or "I do not want to knock at the door"—I do not remember his, saying that he had not got his key with him—I never knew that he had a key of his own; I have seen him go in and out with a key, but I never knew that he had one of his own—I have seen him let himself in with a key with a jug in his hand; I do not know whether there was beer in it, or what it was—it was not upon his saying that he did not want to disturb the people that I mentioned my key, I did not mention it till he asked me for it; I did not take it out and lend him it to him at once, not for half a minute; I hesitated perhaps half a minute—I did not say anything that I am aware of, or question him about what he wanted it for, because he said he wanted to get the things out of the kitchen, that there were two or three little things he wanted which he had left in Mrs. Green's kitchen—I understood that he wanted them for some kind of work, things in his trade, but he did not say what things they were, and I did not ask him—I have never known him by any other name than Tom or Thomas—I have told you fairly everything I remember as being said—I think I know Williamson, a butcher—I think I saw him yesterday—he used to live in Pitfield Street—I did not see him at the police-court—I know a man named Lambert; I have spoken to him, but I never had much to say to him—I spoke to him about this matter when we went to the Treasury; that was the first time I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have seen the prisoner once or twice open the door of No. 8 with a latchkey when he has been carrying a jug; that was on a Sunday evening, after tea, between 7 and 8 o'clock—I never knew he had a key except in that way, and how he got it I don't know—in the winter it was usual for the two old ladies to leave before me—I never saw a bolt on the door, and I cannot swear that there is one.</p>

We always leave the back door open and fasten it back with a little catch when we are coming back again—it was kept open in the daytime from early morning—it was not closed by me—I do not play in the yard—I have never seen the little gate in the wall open—the only water-closet is in the yard—I am sure I unbolted the back door after I heard the noise on the Saturday morning—I unbolted the kitchen door when I went down for the water, which is in the back kitchen, and then I unbolted the yard door—there was no smell of powder or of a lucifer being lit.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 63, Bevington Street, Hoxton, which is almost in a line with Fanshaw Street—I am a butcher and cattle dealer, and have lived there eight or nine months—I have known the prisoner about four years as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I have seen him at, I think the George and Vulture is the sign of the public-house—I never knew his sur<lb/>name—on Feb. 5th I left my house about 7.5 a.m. and went into the Haber<lb/>dashers' Arms and had twopenny worth of rum and milk and half an ounce of tobacco—I left at 7.15 and went down Buttesland Street and round the corner into Great Chart Street and straight through Baches Street into Brunswick Place—it was about 7.18 when I went through Baches Street, where I met the prisoner in the middle of the road and wished him good morning—he was 20 or 30 yards from No. 8, which I knew well and all the family—he was between No. 8 and Great Chart Street—just as I turned the corner by the Globe public-house, and before I saw him, I heard a door slam, I cannot say it was No. 8, but it came from that direction—he was buttoning up his coat and he walked very sharply across the road towards Great Chart Street—he did not reply when I spoke to him, and I went on and did not look back to see whether he turned up or down—I went down Baches Street and came out in the City Road, and went to the Meat Market, Smithfield—afterwards, on the same day, I heard of Lydia's death, I knew her by seeing her with her mother—I went to Worship Street Police-court twice but did not see the pri<lb/>soner's face, I was not there three minutes—he was remanded for a week</p>

               <p>and I went again when he was committed—I saw him come in and recog<lb/>nised him as the man I knew as Tom—I went there because some people in a public-house said "You know him well, you have been in his com<lb/>pany," and I went to see if I could recognise him; I did so, and after the Court was up I spoke to Inspector Peel—I gave my name but refused my address—I said "You don't want me, I don't want to be brought into a case of this description, my evidence will not be worth anything"—on Friday, March 4th, I was sent for to Hoxton Station; I went there and saw, I think it was Inspector Fearn, and made a statement to him, which he took down—that was after committal—I went to the Soli<lb/>citor to the Treasury's office and a gentleman took my statement.</p>

               <p>middle of February—I went every morning to Prior's place during the time I was in his employment—I had to get there from 8.30 to 9—I went from Snow Hill to Walworth by the one minute to 8 train, I think it was—it would take me all 20 minutes to get from Hoxton to Snow Hill—I used to go past the Meat Market nearly every morning—I used to go to it, for business sometimes; sometimes I had to buy meat for other people—on 5th February I did not buy any meat for anybody; I did no particular business in the Meat Market that morning—I did not buy any that morning—I don't think I did any business—my nearest way is through the Meat Market, and I meant by saying I was on my way to the Meat Market that my nearest way was through the Meat Market—I was on my way to Snow Hill—I have known Currell for three or four years, and I have known him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I knew the Green family perfectly well—I have seen Currell with Lydia Green of an evening—I did not see them so often together that I supposed they were man and wife; I did not know whether they were or were not—I have made two statements at different times, one to the Treasury and one to the police; they are exactly the same—I could not swear it is true that "I have many times seen the deceased, whom I knew with him, and thought they were man and wife from seeing them together so often;" very likely I might have said that; I have seen them together in the evening—I knew I was giving a statement with regard to a man charged with murder; they asked me the questions, and I answered them, I should speak the truth—I gave my statement truthfully—I should say I remember what I said—I said "I have many times seen the deceased, whom I knew, with him, and thought they were man and wife from seeing them together so often"—I don't remember what time I left my house on the Thursday, nor on the Wednesday morning; it was generally about the same time—I cannot fix the exact time I left on any particular morning—I did not always go at once as soon as I got out of the house to a public-house—I very often went to the Haberdashers' Arms—I am managing Martin's shop now at Queen's Crescent, Kentish Town—I leave home now as a rule about 7 or a quarter past—on this morning I looked at the' clock when I got out of bed; it was five minutes past 7—I don't know if it took me five minutes to dress—I have sworn I left my home at 10 minutes past 7—I saw it was five minutes past 7 when I got out of the bed, and I was out of the house at 10 minutes past 7—I would not swear it was five minutes past—I don't know if the clock was right—I saw the clock in the Haberdashers' Arms; that was a quarter past 7 when I left—I did not look what time it was when I went in—I next looked at Dawson's clock in the City Road; that was 20 minutes past exactly; then I looked at the clock at the Meat Market; that was 25 minutes to 8, I think—I would not pledge my oath as to the time by the Meat Market clock; I will swear it was 25 minutes past 7 by Dawson's clock—I did not think it was important to fix the time I looked at it—I do not notice it every morning—I saw the clock on this particular morning because as soon as I got home I heard of the murder, and I said "It is a strange thing, I went through the street; I met a man, but it would not be him"—I remembered the time that very night, and passing through the street—I did not remember seeing the man, whom I looked upon as practically the husband of the murdered woman—I remember the time because it was 7.15 when I came out of the house, and 20 past</p>

               <p>by Dawson's—I remember looking at both those clocks, and passing through the street, and seeing the man in the street whom I thought was the woman's husband, and that his name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—the murder was talked about a good deal—I did not read the papers—I am not a very good scholar—I can read the papers; I cannot understand them—it was a matter of great interest in the neighbourhood; there was a deal of talk about it—I did not know who was suspected of the murder when I heard of it—I heard on the Sunday, I think, that a man named Currell. a sweetheart of Lydia Green, was suspected to be guilty—I remembered I had seen the sweetheart; he had been at my place—as soon as I heard he was a sweetheart of Lydia Green's I remembered that I had seen him in the street, but I did not know but what he was the husband—I did not know but what they were married—I did not know whether they were married or not—I did not think they were two different men, a husband and a sweetheart—I knew the man I saw in the street was the man who was either her husband or her sweetheart, and that his name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I did not know he was the sweetheart who was suspected—I knew the man's name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and I knew the suspected man's name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> after I saw it in print on the Monday night—I thought he was the suspected man—I cannot say I knew he was the sweetheart—I heard them on the Sunday or Monday talking about the woman's sweetheart being suspected, and that his name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I did not remember I had seen the sweetheart and the man whose name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> in the street that morning—I bade him good morning—I took no notice of him—on the Monday I knew, from what I had heard and from what I had seen in the papers, that the man suspected was a sweetheart of the woman, and that his name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I could not tell whether the man I had seen in the street was her sweetheart or not—I had seen her with him—I swear I did not know whether the man was her sweetheart or not—I did not know at all who was suspected—I had no idea whether there were two men named <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> suspected of this; I did not know who they were—I did not hear of the Inquest; I heard nothing of that—I heard of the time the murder was supposed to have taken place—I did not hear what evidence was given at the Inquest till I saw it in the paper—I heard a verdict of wilful murder was given against the woman's sweetheart—it never occurred to me that the man I saw was the man against whom the verdict was found—I attached no importance to what had happened so far as I was concerned—I never went to see Mrs. Green about it; I had never been to see her—I met Currell in the Essex Road a week after the Inquest—I knew he was the man <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> who was the woman's sweetheart or husband, but I never thought anything about the murder then—I thought nothing of him then as the man who was wanted—I did not know who the man was who was wanted according to the likeness—I saw the likeness—I did not know that the man wanted was the sweetheart of Lydia Green; I did not know whether he was the sweetheart or husband—I did not know that I knew the man at all who was wanted—I could not say whether he was either sweetheart or husband—I saw she was a single girl by the papers—after the Inquest I did not know who was the man suspected in the papers—I never knew the suspected man's name was <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, nor that he was the sweetheart of the girl—I read some of the evidence; I did not read much about it, although I knew the family well—I did not talk about it, and took no interest in it—to</p>

               <p>the end of February I had not the slightest idea that the man I supposed to be the husband was suspected—I heard of the prisoner being arrested, and of his writing a letter—I heard the circumstances under which he gave himself up, I attached no importance to it—when I spoke to the police I did not attach the slightest importance to my evidence—when I went to the police-court on 28th February I was not employed anywhere—I got off a cart in which I had a load of meat, and went in to see the man—I did not hear Attrell give his evidence there, I heard the doctor—the first time I went I did not stop, I was there a few minutes, I suppose, not 10—I would not swear I was there 10 minutes—I went in because the people told me I knew him—I went to hear the trial—I did not go in while Attrell was giving his evidence—I never said, "On Wednesday, 23rd February, I went unknown to the police-court"—I gave a statement of the evidence I was prepared to give to that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Sims, of the Solicitor's Department, Treasury</hi>) at Whitehall afterwards—I did not tell him I went unknown to the police—I did go unknown—perhaps I told him that, I don't know—I went in to see the man in custody for the murder, I went in to hear the trial; when he came up you could have knocked me down with a feather—it is quite right that, "on 23rd February I went unknown to the police-court to see the man who was in custody for the murder, I had no idea that I should find he was the man I had seen on the 15th"—I had not the slightest idea—I did not know what the name of the man who was charged was; I did not know he was the sweetheart—when I went to the police-court I did not know whether the man charged was sweetheart or husband—seeing him with her I thought perhaps Currell was the sweetheart, after reading the papers—I did not know certainly that <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Currell was the sweetheart of Lydia Green when I went to the police-court, I heard it—I tried to see the man—I did not see him the first time I went to the police-court—I saw his back—I could not tell for how long—I did not hear Attrell give his evidence, nor did I see him in the witness-box—I only saw the doctor in the witness-box to the best of my recollection; I am not positive about it, I was in there a few minutes and came out again—I was riding home with a load eve meat—I should not think the gentleman who took my statement invented this, "I stood at the back of the Court. I could not see the prisoner's face; I was only there about 10 minutes. I heard Attrell, whom I know, giving evidence as to giving the prisoner in the dock the key of 8, Baches Street"—I saw him as he was coming out of the Court, but I did not hear him give his evidence the first time I went; I heard him the second time—I heard him speak once or twice in the box the second time—when I went to the police-court, on 23rd February, and stayed there about 10 minutes, I believe Attrell was in the witness-box, now I come to recollect it, I am not quite positive about it—I did not hear the time mentioned when he said he had given the key, I heard the fact that he gave the key—I saw some of in the paper—I don't think I heard him say he had given this man the key—I could not swear whether I did—I knew Attrell—very likely I might have given that statement to the Solicitor to the Treasury—I was crashed behind the crowd at the Court—I heard Attrell say one or two things—I could not say about whether I heard him speak about the key—I did not hear Attrell say the time when he gave the key to the prisoner—I heard him say something, I was behind the crowd, I could not catch the words—I was there 10 minutes—I</p>

I live at 10, New Street, Drysdale Street, Hoxton, and work at Mr. Andrews's, a surgical instrument maker, at Waltham-stow—up to February 4th Lydia Green worked there with me—I last saw her alive on the evening of that day at five minutes to 7 in Mr. Andrews's workroom—from time to time I went to visit her at 8, Baches Street—I last went there on Sunday, 16th January, the Sunday after the brother's funeral, which was on Saturday, the 15th—I saw Lydia Green and the prisoner together in the same room—he was lying on the couch—the deceased had not been at her work on the Saturday, and I had received her wages from Mr. Andrews, and I brought them to her on this Sunday—I gave her the money, and somebody in jest said "Co it"—I can remember nothing else that was said—I stayed about half an hour—the prisoner was there all the time—I left them—I had taken her her wages in that way three or four times before, it may have been—I have known the prisoner by sight ever since I knew Miss Green, about 6 years—I was in the habit of coming home with her from work until lately—she sprained her foot some time before, and that prevented her doing the walk between the two stations—she did not walk home on the Friday, she caught an earlier train—Beatrice Stevens was her companion and mine—we all three have come home together, but more often I and Miss Green—when we came home together in that way we came from St. James's Street to Hackney Downs by train, and then walked from Hackney Downs to Dalston, and rode from Dalston to Shoreditch, and walked from Shore<lb/>ditch home, to either her home or mine—while on our walk between Hackney Downs and Dalston we have met the prisoner several times—on 6th February the deceased did not come to her work, and Mr. Andrews gave me her wages in an envelope to give to her—I came home on that day with Beatrice Stevens—we came by train from St. James's Street to Hackney Downs, and then, as we were walking to Dalston, a little after 3 o'clock, I met the prisoner—he was at the corner of a street in the Dalston Lane reading a bill on a board—I said "Tom"—he turned and asked me how I was—I made no reply, but said "Have you seen Miss Green?"—he said "Yes"—said" Is not she well?"—he said "Oh, yes, her mother is queer," or "ill"—I asked him if she was not able to get up—he answered something, I forget what it was—I do not think I spoke next—he said "I promised to take Lydia to the Hall to-night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280070"/>
               <p>but I don't suppose she will go now as her mother is ill"—he meant the Agricultural Hall—I said I was sorry her mother was ill—he said "I told <hi rend="italic">Lyd</hi> I was coming this way, and she asked me to meet you for her money"—I gave him the money as it had been given to me in the closed envelope—I believe he put it in his pocket—Beatrice Stevens was standing just a little way from me, not far, and he said "Is that <hi rend="italic">Beatie?"</hi>—I said "Yes, come along,<hi rend="italic">Beatie"</hi>—she came up then—she was not very close to me while this conversation was going on, only just behind me; I do not think she was close enough to hear what was said, she might have heard some of it—we all three walked down Dalston Lane together towards Dalston Junction—there is a public-house near the railway-station; before we got to it the prisoner asked me if I would have a drink at another public-house, and as we walked along he asked me if I would have a flower—the second time he asked <hi rend="italic">Beatie</hi> and me to have a drink at the public-house by the station we went in, and he called for a glass of ale each and paid—I did not see where he took the money from, nor how much he paid—I did not see the envelope again after I gave it to him, nor did I see him touch it in any way—I said "Miss Green wasn't at Bow last night"—he said "No, she was at my place till late"—nothing more occurred in the public-house except that he joked with both of us—he seemed in good spirits; I thought he had had a glass too much to drink—I think he had a glass of beer in the public-house, I cannot remember—he asked us to have some more drink; we declined, and he did not have any more—we left the public-house after having been there about 10 minutes—we went out into the Lane again, and went to Dalston Junction Station—he went with us; he took the tickets for me and Beatrice Stevens, and paid for them; they were 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. tickets; we did not repay him; he gave us the tickets—he said "Look out for <hi rend="italic">Lyd</hi> Monday morning"—I said "From Bishopsgate?" and he said "Yes, the same as usual"—he said good-bye to us—we went down to the train, and went on—he did not go down the staircase with us—I last saw him there at that time in the station—it was just after 3 o'clock when we met him, and I should say it was about a quarter past 3, or a little more, when he left us, from a quarter to 20 minutes past 3—I heard nothing of the deceased that night, but next morning, Sunday, I first heard of her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go to Mrs. Green's house that night, but on Sunday morning—I did not then talk it over with Mrs. Green and the family very much, they were so upset—I have frequently been there since this matter; certainly we have talked about it, not very much—I and the girls at where I work have talked about it—I have not talked about it to other people, they have spoken to me about it—nobody has found fault with me for giving the money to Currell nor asked why I gave it—I had been in this public-house before with Currell and Miss Green—when I brought the wages home to her once when he was there, I said something to her, I forget what I said—that was just before I was coming away, I stayed there about five minutes after I gave her the money—I gave her the envelope, I don't know what she did with it—some one said <hi rend="italic">"Co</hi> it," and something more was said about it, I forget what it was—I can't remember who spoke—I think Currell was at the son's funeral, I don't know—this was on Sunday evening and the funeral had been on Saturday—I was asked at the Inquest about handing her the</p>

               <p>wages—for some time I had frequently seen Currell and Lydia Green together, I had often known him meet her in Dalston Lane—that was the place he used to meet her, but lately she had been to Bishopsgate—she had begun to go the other way—he told me she had met him in Dalston Lane on the day before—some parts of Dalston Lane are lonely, there are plenty of shops there—there are houses all the way along it—I thought the trouble they had had might have affected Lydia or her mother—I thought that before the Saturday—I did not expect the mother to be ill more so than the others—I thought the trouble might have affected the mother's health or Miss Green's or the son's—when Lydia did not come in the morning I thought she was ill—when we saw Currell that day, the first thing said to me was not "Where is Lyd?"—I used more often than not to speak of her as Miss Green—sometimes I used to call her Lyd or Lyddie—he did not say "Where is Lyddie"—I did not say "She has not been at work to-day, I suppose she is ill," nor words like it—I said "Have you seen Miss Green?"—when I asked him if she was well, he said "Yes, she is all right"—he did not say "She was at our place till late last night" till I spoke to him about her being at Bow—it was not at the time he said she was all right that he said he had been with her late last night, it was in the public-house that he said he had been with her the night before—he did not say "She is all right, I suppose her mother is ill," but that her mother was ill and so she had stayed at home on that account—I said I had expected some of them to be ill for some time, not Lydia or the mother more than the others—I said "I am sorry her mother is ill, I have been expecting it for some time," I had expected one or the other to be ill—he said soon after he asked me for the money," I promised to take her to the Hall to-night, but now her mother is ill I don't suppose she will go"—in the public-house he said she had been with him till late last night—I had intended to take the wages round, thinking she was ill—I am quite sure I did not say that I had got the wages and that I was going to take them round—I was going nowhere particularly that night but going home, I seldom go out on Saturday night—we passed some flower-woman just by the station—he paid for a glass of ale and a penny ticket—when I had been in the public-house before with him and Lydia he has paid then—Lydia and I were great Mends—during the time I knew her I never knew her meet any other man.</p>

I work at Mr. Andrews's, surgical instrument maker, Walthamstow—Annie Manton and the deceased worked with me—I saw her on Friday, 4th February, and went to work with her on that day—we went from Shoreditch to Dalston Junction, then walked down Dalston Lane to Hackney Downs, and she took a return ticket which would take her to Walthamstow and bring her back in the evening—she returned alone that evening, I did not come with her—that was the last time I saw her—I was present on the Saturday when Mr. Andrews gave an envelope to Annie Manton—I returned with her on that afternoon—we came from James Street to Hackney Downs, then as we were walking along we met the prisoner—Annie Manton asked him the reason Miss Green had not been at work on the Saturday morning, he said her mother had been very ill on the Saturday morning and that was the reason she had not been on the Saturday, and that he had see her on the Saturday morning, and he said he was coming that way and she asked him whether he would meet</p>

Cresswell and Co., Sponge Importers, 32, Red Lion Square, Holborn, W.C."—I kept it—we talked about business matters and other things generally, as to what I was doing in the way of work; nothing more in relation to Lydia Green, or about the address—nothing more was said about my writing to him there—I thought he looked a little heavy-eyed, as if he had had a little something to drink—he left about 8 o'clock—he said nothing about going to Flask Street to lodge, or as to where he was going—I did not know he was going there—he said nothing about leaving his boxes with me, or any<lb/>thing about his boxes.</p>

My husband is a carpenter, of 22, Flask Street, Hampstead—on Saturday, 5th February, we had a notice in the window, "Lodgings for single men," and about 7.30 p.m. the prisoner came and asked for lodgings—he said that he preferred a room to himself, but as my children had gone to bed in the room which I let, he engaged a bed in a double-bedded room at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he gave me the name of Cole, and said that he should be very pleased to refer to his aunt, Mrs. Hearn, of 32, New End, who had sent him to me—I did not know Mrs. Hearn, but my husband did; she is a dressmaker, two or three minutes' walk off—he said that he preferred a room to himself, because he heard that he was in the habit of groaning at night, and he thought if he had a room to himself he could groan as he liked without disturbing anyone—I told him he could have a room to himself later on—he brought no luggage—he said that his boxes would follow—he shared the room of a lodger of mine named Mortimer—he removed there that night, and sent my little boy for the special <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi>, which was fetched and given to him—he said he thought we should have war with Germany before the month was over—he went out on the Sunday between 10 and 11 and brought in a Sunday newspaper—he was only out a few minutes to get the paper and to get shaved—he went out on the Monday, and said he was going to Oetzmann's in Hampstead Road to make final arrangements—he had told me on the Saturday night that he had an engagement there, and was going to start on Wednesday morning on a stamped agreement—I asked him where he had been at work before, but he did not make any answer—he said that he always went on those terms, three years agreements—he was out till the evening, and when he returned after 7 o'clock there was a letter for him which had come by post; it was addressed "Mr. T. Cole"—he read it aloud, and then put it on the end of our mantelpiece—the purport of it was that he was to have his tools on Wednesday morning at 8.30 to commence work—he said that he had been at Oetzmann's that day, and he was rather surprised at the letter coming, as he thought all arrangements had been made—when he came in on Monday he asked whether his boxes had arrived—I said "No"—he said "I dare say they will be here the first thing on Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, and that they were coming by Carter, Paterson, and Co."—he went out on the Tuesday about 12 o'clock, and at 7 o'clock, when I went out to a musical entertainment, he had not returned, but he was there when I got back—he had agreed to go there with us, but my husband said in his presence "The young man has been at work; he took his tools to Oetzmann's, and stopped and did a little job"—he had a ticket for the entertainment, and also one for his aunt—he seemed very unwell that night, and next morning, Wednesday, it was between 11 and 12 o'clock when he got up.—he was very sick, and drank large quantities of water as if he was burnt up with fever—he told me he had had roast pork for his dinner, and he expected that was the thing that disagreed with him—he said that he did not feel equal to work, and he must send them a letter to tell them he was not well—he wrote a letter, but I did not see him address it—he took it to the post himself soon after 12; he was not out many minutes; he brought back a <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> with him, and after reading it by the fire he went upstairs to his room between 2 and 3 o'clock, and I saw no more of him that day—I saw him next about 10 o'clock next morning, Thursday—he said he felt better, and thought he would go to Oetzmann's and see it he was equal to work, but at all events he must show up there that morning—as he went out between 11 and 12 he said that he should be out for an hour, and would then get my husband to help him round with his boxes from Mrs. Hearn's—he never returned—I sat up till 10, and my husband later—next day, Friday, I went up into the room which he had occupied jointly with Mortimer, and missed a coat of Mortimer's from a recess behind the door—my husband went to Mrs. Hearn's—on Friday afternoon this letter came (<hi rend="italic">Addressed "Mr. Cole</hi>, 22, <hi rend="italic">Flask Wharf, Hampstead, N.W.," on an envelope stamped "James Shoolbred and Co., Tottenham Court Road"):</hi> "Friday, February 11th, 1887.

I am a carpenter, of 22, Flask Wharf, Hampstead—on Saturday night, February 5th, I was at home about 7.30 when the prisoner came—my wife answered the door to him—I was in the back yard, and came in and saw her and the prisoner—he said that his name was Thomas Cole, and told us to go and get a reference for him at Mrs. Hearn's—he pressed it very much, but I did not go because I knew the woman—I described to him what sort of woman she, was, because I thought I knew her, and he said "That is the woman"—I said that I need not go, and I did not trouble myself further about it—on the Saturday night he stayed in the kitchen with us till about 11 o'clock—he sent for drink; I pressed him not to do so, and said "You don't come here to spend your money; we don't wish for it," but he went and got some; a quart of beer, I think, and someone in the house went and got some more; the little girl, I think—I know there were two quarts—a quart the first time, and a quart the second time, I think, and some whisky—the prisoner paid for it; I do not know how much or what it came to—he seemed rather excited after he had had a little beer and the spirits—he drank some of the whisky, and gave some of it to us—he went up to bed about 11 o'clock as near as I can guess—he remained in the house on Sunday night, Monday, and Tuesday, and on Tuesday</p>

               <p>night, about 8.30 or 8.45, he came in when my wife and children were out, and I said "You did not get back to go to the entertainment at the Wesleyan Chapel," Dr. Stephenson's boys were going to sing—he said "I have been to Oetzmann's, and have done three hours' work, which they wanted me to start on a little job, and I went and done that"—he remained there on Wednesday, and till Thursday morning, when just before he left he came to me in the back room, and said "I shall be back, Mr. Smith, in about an hour's time, and if you will give me a hand with my two boxes, which are at Mrs. Hearn's, I shall be obliged"—I said "It is near dinner-time, and I will be here"—that was the last I saw of him—he did not return—his boxes were not at Mrs. Hearn's, and they never came—we left a lamp burning all night for him, and next morning I went up to his room and found he had not been home—Mortimer had gone out early—I told my wife, who went upstairs about breakfast time, and told me about Mortimer's coat—I then went to Mrs. Hearn's to know about the boxes, and when Mortimer came home, which he does at 10 o'clock or at midday, as he is a milkman, I went with him to the police-station; that was between 10 and 10.30—later on the same day this letter arrived in this envelope—I do not know whether it was before or after dinner, but I took it to the station and handed it unopened to Inspector Collins.</p>

Moody and Sankey when they were there, and then I asked him if he had been at the New North Road; he said that he had, and had heard Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Spurgeon—he said that he knew Walthamstow as well as he did his home, but I don't know where his home was—two quarts of beer were drunk on the Saturday night—I do not recollect any being sent for on the Sunday—there were four of us in the kitchen on the Saturday night, Cole, my wife, and I and a lodger—Mortimer was there—I do not know whether Cole sent for the first pot or one of the others—the boy was sent for a pot of ale, and the prisoner told him while ho was out to bring back a paper—I think we all had some of the ale—the two lodgers had some as far as I know—it was sent for for us to have a drink with him, and I think I had some—some whisky was sent for later on; I don't know what he paid for it—I had some of it—the second pot of ale was saved till Sunday morning—before we went to bed we told him not to have any more—he said "Let us have some more of that beer," and I said "You had better put it on one side, we have had plenty, next Sunday morning I will not have so much if anybody gives me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>on the Saturday night that he had just finished a three years' engage<lb/>ment, and he had got a three years' stamped agreement from Oetzmann's—he did not say why he had left—he said that he should very much like to get into Shoolbred's—he said that he took his tools to Oetzmann's, not that he was going to serve behind the counter—he got shaved on the Sunday morning—I did not notice whether he had a beard on Saturday night, but he had a little whiskers—when he got shaved there was no alteration in his appearance except that he looked cleaner—he did not alter his clothes in any way that I saw—he had a band on the arm of his undercoat—I did not notice one on his hat—he went out every day, but I did not see him go—he was out for hours the same as anyone else—I had seen his writing in a missionary book as a subscriber.</p>

On Saturday 5th February, about 5 p.m. information was brought to Hoxton Police-station of the death of Lydia Green, and I sent Reed and other constables to 8, Baches Street—they returned to the station about 7.30 and gave me information and Inspector Peel went to Dr. Davis and then to 8 Baches Street and into the back room where the deceased was lying—I examined the walls and flooring, and under the bed and the carpet, and turned out some boxes, and examined the fireplace and window curtains, and behind, under, and in the drawers, but found no bullet or mark—I did not search for a bullet, but for any weapon with which the wounds might have been inflicted, and found none—I searched again on the Sunday and again on the Monday after the post-mortem, but discovered nothing—afterwards inquiries were made for the prisoner at 22, Fanshaw Street, and on the 7th I went there myself about 7 p.m. and saw Cracknell, who pointed out this box to me—it was locked, but Sergeant Sage, who accompanied me, had a key which opened it—it contained a quantity of wearing apparel, day and night shirts, one of which Cracknell, claimed, and this box con<lb/>taining 38 cartridges—there is a label on it: "50 powder 5 1/2 grains. 50 bullets, 63 grains. Cartridges for revolver. Eley Brothers, manu<lb/>facturers, London"—I afterwards handed four of the cartridges to Mr. Oliver, the surgeon, and kept the rest—I also found this letter in the box. (<hi rend="italic">This was without date, addressed to the prisoner as "My dearest Tom." It contained many expressions of affection, and was signed "Your true love, Liddie."</hi>) I also found a number of pawnbrokers' duplicates ranging from 5th February, 1886, to 2nd February, 1887. (<hi rend="italic">Many of these were in the name of Cole, one of Crackneell, and one of Bucknell, at three different pawn<lb/>brokers'.</hi>) I afterwards received an unopend letter from Inspector Canning address to Mr. Cole at Mr. Smith's—it contained a pawn-ticket.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280088"/>
               <p>made the post-mortem examination on that day—my partner, Mr. Oliver, was present and assisted—the body had been washed and pre<lb/>pared—there were two wounds on the neck at the angle of the right-hand side of the jaw, near the corner, not quite an inch apart, about half an inch perhaps—they were punctured wounds, and we traced the course of the bullet—on the inside of one wound we found a small sticking of lead, which has been produced, and farther on a bullet lying close to the back of the tongue, near the uvula, not penetrating the mucous membrane of the mouth—in the head I found a wound about half an inch externally on the occipital ridge; that fractured the skull—there were marks of gunpowder—in cutting into the scalp we found two pieces of lead, and following up the course of the bullet about two inches into the brain itself we found a larger piece with a portion of bone that it had carried on it—Mr. Oliver took charge of those pieces of lead—there was only one entrance—one shot must have caused the injury to the brain and the skull—striking the bone, of course, would divide the bullet—a pistol bullet must have entered the palmar surface of the thumb between the thumb and the first finger, shattering the metacarpal joint entirely, and making its exit with a different shaped wound in the dorsal surface—we did not find any bullet there—she must have had her hand up—the cause of death was injury to the brain; the other wounds must have occurred beforehand—the injury to the brain and the shock would cause instan<lb/>taneous death—the wounds to the neck would not have caused death immediately—the shot in the brain must have been fired last because that caused immediate death—it is possible, but not probable, for the deceased to have fallen dead at the first shot in the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My opinion is that there were four shots; there must have been three—I think there were two in the neck, one in the head, and one in the hand—I have not made experiments with bullets—there are five pieces of lead, one almost, if not quite, an entire bullet; that was in the throat behind, in the neck; one piece of lead was in the brain, two under the scalp—the girl was not pregnant.</p>

I am an ironmonger—I live at 26, Kingsland Road—I have known the prisoner all his life—I met him in East Road three or four weeks before Christmas—we went and had a drink at the Prince of Wales public-house—nothing particular passed; I had some business, and he invited me back, and I called back—he came out of the public-house with me in the East Road—he told me he wanted to buy a revolver—he said "They have got some in the window there; will you go with me?"—that was at Alton's, the pawnbroker's, five or six doors from the Prince of Wales—we went to the corner—the revolvers were hanging in the window—Currell wished me to purchase one for him; I told him I knew nothing about them, and told him to buy one himself—he made no remark—afterwards he told me that he had an overcoat that he would give me (I was rather ragged at the time) if I liked to call</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not with Lambert when I met Currell in the East Road—I never went to the public-house with him and Lambert in the East Road—I was not in the public-house when he spoke about the revolver to Lambert—I am an ironmonger, or take a fish-barrow, or do anything for an honest living—I did a day's work the day before yesterday as potman—I went to that situation four weeks ago—before that I had gained my living as an odd man. (<hi rend="italic">Reading from the Depositions</hi>: "I have been out of employment for two years.") That is quite right, regular em<lb/>ployment—I have lost my berth through this case; another man has to be engaged in my place—Currell asked me to buy the revolver knowing I was an ironmonger and understood the spring—I have said "London ironmongers do not know anything about the springs of a revolver, but country ones do"—I am a London ironmonger—26, Kingsland Road is a lodging-house—I pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night, or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I gave an address Alexander Chambers; that is a lodging-house of the same kind—I got thrown out there because I gave evidence—I was never charged to my knowledge—I will tell you what that means: I was charged with attempted suicide and sent to the House of Detention for seven days—I was suffering from delirium tremens; that is the only charge I have ever had preferred against me—that was seven years ago—I have been a teetotaler five years, but I am drinking again now—I did not speak to Lambert about giving evidence. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I gave a statement of my evidence. I told Lambert about it before I gave that statement.") That is not true—I was not present when Lambert made an appointment to meet the prisoner at the Prince of Wales public-house—I am not sure whether I met Lambert when he was going to keep an appointment with the prisoner—I cannot fix the day of the week or month—Currell was living in Stoke Newington; that is the reason I had to call for the coat in the neighbourhood—I made my statement to the Treasury the Monday before my evidence was given at Worship Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, William Street, St. Peter's Street, Islington, and am a barman—I and the prisoner were fellow servants together about nine months ago—on Saturday morning, about 1 o'clock, I and the prisoner and three or four other men were coming out of the Islington Darning Hall and Club, a few doors from Collins's Music Hall—the prisoner, three men and two women, surrounded me, and the prisoner deliberately snatched my watch and chain from my pocket and van away—the watch was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the chain 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—another man held me by my throat and took the pin from my scarf, and the others rifled my pockets and took 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—they all ran away—I fell in the struggle—the prisoner did not touch me, no one hit me—I am sure the prisoner stole my watch and chain—I knew him—I was quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALKER</hi>. My suspicions were aroused by these advertisements—I had the idea they were not genuine—we did not advertise in the paper for evidence to support the charge—we put in a notice that we should be glad to hear from anyone who had purchased pianos purporting to be made by Allen and Taylor or Bishop and Sons, through our columns—that was after we had got the warrant for the arrest—we wanted to find out whether other people had been defrauded through our columns—we have had answers—we have sufficient, without pursuing them—it is part of the system of our paper that a deposit should be paid on application, that is a guarantee of honesty on both sides—I deposited the money myself, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave Sumner a receipt for the money and notified it to him—the person who is going to buy the article has to deposit the money with us—we give a receipt to him and send out an advice note to the person who has the goods—it is not true that Sumner deposited 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I put it in myself—it does not matter whether A or B deposits it, so long as it is deposited in a certain name—I did not receive 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Sumner, the receipt does not represent the transaction if you like to say so—part of our system is that intending purchasers should have the opportunity of seeing goods before purchasing—there is a system by which articles are sent on approval, so that persons can see and satisfy themselves as to the quality of the goods—we have two classes of advertisements, private and trade—Mrs. Jones's is a private advertise<lb/>ment and the other a trade one representing that some one in the trade is going to sell; it is among the private advertisements under the heading "Trade"—if a tradesman wishes to advertise goods he can do so at the bottom of the private advertisements, that is a matter of arrangement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte tuner and quadrille pianist of 221, Stanhope Street, Regent's Park—I have been connected with the piano trade 17 years—I was apprenticed to Messrs. Hopkinson, of Regent Street, for seven years, and was with them 12 months afterwards I was with Messrs. Erard's close upon two years, as tuner; at Kirk<lb/>land's at Soho Square about the same time as tuner and sometimes as assistant salesman—I have had to give estimates for exchange and repairs—I left Kirkland's in August, 1880—I have since had my own business—I have examined a piano at 170, Strand, at the request of Mr. Gill, No. 2108, by Allen and Taylor; the materials are not the best, the bottom door is warped and shrunk, showing that the wood is not seasoned—its trade value is 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., otherwise 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it could not I think cost 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would be an unfair price—I should say it is new—I also examined piano 2115, by Allen and Taylor—that was slightly better, it was in better order altogether—it was the same type of instrument—I should put the same value upon it both trade and otherwise.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Rotherham Road, Camden Town—I have been some 36 years in the piano trade—I am the inventor of a patent action very widely used in the trade—I was seven and a half years manager to Messrs. Brinsmead—I was called in as an expert by the President at the Liverpool Exhibition—I write articles on pianos—I am thoroughly familiar with the piano business—very large discounts are given on pianos—the foreigners have set the example—I have seen Beta where 50 per cent, is allowed, and in Challen's lists it is very common—there is also an additional discount under certain circumstances—there is a discount on the trade tally—all instruments will not bear 50 per cent. discount on the trade tally—it is surprising what little profit is made by the manufacturer—I have examined the pianos referred to—this is called a French check action to give it reputation, but it is invented by an Englishman—it is a good action, and used by good makers—Broadwood's use it, and I have seen the same kind of action in Challen's, Collard's, Kirkman's, Erard's, and in lower class makers—I do not find fault with the action—the keys are ivory—celluloid keys are cheaper—the sounding board is a good one, I found no bridges split, but all intact—a practical man would look to the sounding bridges—the worst part of the work is the outside, the cabinet work; but a professor would not care if you painted it, he wants the music—the musical part is good, but it is not an</p>

               <p>Street, Clerkenwell—I have known the prisoner and his wife between 18 months and two years—I have visited them on two or three occasions—early in the morning on 8th March, after 12, I and my wife were at their lodging—the prisoner went out of the sitting-room into the bedroom; his wife followed him—I heard the prisoner's son exclaim "Look out, mother: father has got a knife"—she said "I don't care about your knives"—I went into the bedroom; I did not see the prisoner—I was met at the door by the wife, and I said "What's this about the knife?" the prisoner had gone out of the bedroom on to the landing—I did not follow him—I looked at the woman's hand; it was covered with blood—the prisoner came back soon afterwards—I asked him where was the knife he had cut his wife with—he said he had not got a knife—I told him to turn out his pockets; he did so, and almost the first thing he brought out was a penknife—I snatched it out of his hand, and knocked it on to the floor, and picked it up, and said "I shall keep this knife; you tried to stab your wife with it and cut her hand"—he said he did not care about my keeping it, and I kept it several days—the prisoner's conduct has been very strange—on the 7th, the previous night, I and my wife went to a concert with the prisoner and his wife, and I noticed that he looked very strange there—his conduct has been very strange indeed, and his language fearful—on that night my wife slept with his wife to protect her.</p>

I am single—I live with Mrs. Crawley, my aunt, and her husband, but I go home and sleep with my mother—my room is opposite Mrs. Johnson's—the first time I slept at my aunt's was Tuesday, March 15th; I had been to the theatre, and my aunt sat up for me, and at 1 o'clock Mrs. Johnson knocked at the door several times—I heard the clock go "one" just before—my aunt told me not to open the door in case Mrs. Johnson was the worse for drink, but she kept on knocking and I opened it and saw her; she asked me to come in and see what her husband had given her to drink—I followed her to her room and she showed me some paraffin oil in a little jug on the table, and I could see beer at the bottom—I asked her if she had drunk any, she said no, she had had a mouthful and spat it out—I saw the prisoner lying on the bed as I passed through to the sitting room, he did not speak—I did not see his eyes—I went back to my aunt's directly, but I went back to the room, and the prisoner was still lying on the bed; he did not move or speak—Mrs. Johnson was sitting in a chair in front of the fire, undressed, but with something round her shoulders—she made a statement in my aunt's presence that the prisoner had given her something to drink; my aunt said "Have you drank any?" she said exactly the same as she had said to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had to pass by the bedroom to get into the sitting-room—the door between the two rooms was open—if the prisoner was awake he could hear what was said—he made no remark—I may We said to Mrs. Johnson "Lucky you did not drink it"—she said "Oh yes, I drank a nice mouthful, and spat some of it out."</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a commercial clerk—my niece was sleeping with me in my room on Tuesday, March 15th—she had been to the theatre—I heard St. John's Church shrike 1, and a knock came to the door—I asked her not to open it, as Mrs. Johnson, whose rooms are close to ours, might be the worse for drink—there was more knocking, and my niece went away and came back shortly, and then I went to Mrs. Johnson's room—her bedroom and living-room adjoin each other,</p>

               <p>and I saw the prisoner in bed with his back towards me—he did not move or make any sign of being awake—his wife asked me to look in a jug, and said "See what my husband has given me to drink"—I looked in the jug, and there was paraffin and beer—I asked her if she bad drunk any—she said "No; I had a mouthful and I spat it out"—the jug was not half full—there was more paraffin than beer in it—I spoke to her about coming to my door so often and annoying me when she was in drink—she said "It is not the first time he has threatened my life"—I said "Why do you call me? Why don't you summon him, and get a separation?"—she said "I will lock him up"—she was not excited—I asked her if she was all right—she said "Yes," and I left her—I was only there from 1 o'clock to a quarter past—she never roused the prisoner—there has not been a week since Christmas when she has not aroused me when she has been the worse for drink—on a Monday, I cannot tell the date, I was disturbed by some one coming to my door, and next morning I asked Mrs. Johnson why her husband knocked there—she said that he was in one of his mad fits again—I said "I do not wish him to knock at my door"—she said that she would tell him of it, and in the evening she sent for me for Mr. Johnson to apologise—she said that they had been to a music-hall together, and had some drink—no mention was made of a penknife.</p>

I am a general practitioner—on 23rd February I attended Mrs. Johnson, who had had a miscarriage on the previous Sunday night—it was not natural—I found indications of drunken habits, and there was no doubt of her being an inebriate—on the night of March 14th she came to my surgery and asked to be allowed to at down—she was not sober—paraffin is unpleasant; the palate detects it immediately, and it is not diminished if put with beer—it is not possible for a person to gulp it down without knowing it; they would detect it at once—I know a case where it was taken in mistake for gin—while I was attending the prosecutrix the prisoner seemed particularly</p>

                  </hi>. I was porter in the employment of the defendant—I had been with him about seven years—during that time he has traded as Williams, at 93, Gresham Street, as a picture dealer—he occupied the ground floor as a shop, together with the basement—there is an entrance to the shop in Gresham Street, and one in Basinghall Street—there is also another entrance, by the side of his entrance in Basinghall Street, to the premises above, which are let out in offices—there is no communication from his shop to the premises above, only by going outside; the two doors are side by side, one leads to the shop, and the other leads upstairs—Henry Stringer, with his family, was the housekeeper, and lived upstairs—there is a staircase from the shop to the basement; there is a trapdoor in the floor of the shop—there is no access from the basement to the other part of the house, the shop and basement are quite private—Mr. Wainwright was the manager, I and McLeod were porters—on Saturday, 19th March, I believe, fresh premises had been taken in Queen Victoria Street—on that morning McLeod spoke to me, and I afterwards purchased a gallon of paraffin oil, and gave it to him—there was a paraffin lamp in the basement, it had been there, I think, about a day or two, it might have been there on the Friday, I won't be certain—before the Saturday it had been used in the shop—on the Saturday it was downstairs in the basement, sus<lb/>pended from the ceiling; we thought it was purchased for the other shop—it was purchased about a week or a fortnight before, I could not tell exactly—before it was in the basement it had been used in the shop, over Mr. Wainwright'a table where he did his writing—it was removed to the basement on the Friday or Saturday; one gallon of oil had been used upstairs, and McLeod used up what was in the can—he was directed to take it downstairs—there were three gas burners in the basement, two T's from the ceiling and one by the moulding—the T's were over the bench where we used to work, about four feet from the trap door—we used to fit up the pictures, clean them up, and see that they were sent out all right when sold—we did not make frames, the frames were ordered—we never had more than three burners downstairs, we never wanted any extra light, the three were quite sufficient—on the Saturday morning I had been in the basement on and off—about half-past 3, or a little before, there was a knock on the floor as a signal to me to go up—I went up and saw the prisoner in the shop—he told me to go and get a van—I went out but failed to get one—I returned and told the prisoner he could have one the first thing on Monday morning—he said that would not do, he wanted one then, and he went out and got one himself—Mr. Wain<lb/>wright was then out, I believe—when the van came the prisoner told me and McLeod to load it; we did load it with pictures—we were told what pictures to put in—we also put in a cabinet—McLeod and Mr. Wainwright then went with the van to Queen Victoria Street—I stayed behind with the prisoner—I went down into the basement—I had been there some little time when he knocked again; that was about a quarter past 4 I should think; I had no clock, therefore I could not tell exactly, it might have been more—when I came upstairs the prisoner told me to take four unframed pictures over to Queen Victoria Street—he pointed out those I was to take, and also two vases—I told him I did not think I could carry the lot—he said, "Oh, yes, you could"—before I went I saw Stringer, and made a communication to him—I then went over to Queen Victoria Street—I called out to McLeod to come and take the vases—I gave him</p>

Those two pictures had not been down there ever since they had come to the premises, they were up in the shop; they had been downstairs for some time—I have been in the prisoner's employment about seven years—he carried on a considerable business as a picture-dealer—I believe "Williams and Co." was the name of the firm before he took the business; it has always been carried on under the same name since I have been there—the premises are generally closed at 4 o'clock on Saturday—it is either my business or McLeod's to put up the shutters, and then we get away—I had been sent round to Johnson's for a van—I said that the governor wanted a van on the Saturday afternoon, but that I did not want one—I came back and told the prisoner that I could not get one, he could have one the first thing on Monday morning—that was not true—upon that he said "That is non<lb/>sense," and went round to Johnson's himself and got one—when he came back he had a conversation with me—he did not tell me I had told him a lie, not to my knowledge; I don't believe he did—I have a doubt about it—he did not then say to me "You can go"—after we had had a few words I said "Do you think 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week keeps me?"—he did not tell me I should have to go; Mr. Wainwright was there and he heard—I did not say "I can paint, I can earn without wages, "I said I could paint—I</p>

               <p>did not say I had learnt something there—he did not tell me I could find another place—he told me I was very foolish to have stopped so long—he did not tell me I had better find another place—he brought the van and we loaded it, and McLeod and Mr. Wainwright went away with it—I went downstairs again, as I naturally should—I was there about 10 minutes, when I was sent for up by Mr. Wilson—he did not tell me to put up the shutters—I did not put them up—I do not know whether I put them up or not—I could not say whether they were put up or not, I really cannot recollect whether I was told to up them up or not, I might—it was about 10 minutes after the van had gone that I was told to go to Queen Victoria Street with the pictures and vases—I do not know what time it was when I spoke to Stringer, I had not clock there; it might have been half-past 4, or it might have been 4 o'clock—I said the van went about 4 o'clock, I don't know—after the van went I was up in the shop, and then I went downstairs—I could not tell exactly how many minutes I was in the shop; I had no watch or clock there; except the in the basement the whole time—I know where the money was kept by Mr. Wainwright when it was in the shop, it was either in his desk or on a table; it was commonly kept in his desk, which was open—I did not know that afternoon that a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was missing, I knew it after<lb/>wards—I knew nothing of it till Mr. Wainwright told me after the fire—I don't know the time, it was after we got in and after the fire was got out—there was nobody there before the fire except Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wainwright, McLeod, and I; there might have been somebody come in the shop, I could not tell, I mean a customer—I don't know whether a customer would see where the money was kept, some might—I made a communication to Stringer, and then went over to Queen victoria Street—I only said to Mr. Wilson that I did not think I could carry the vases as well as the pictures—the vases were about a foot or 18 inches high, and the four pictures were 36 inches by 24 I think—after seeing Stringer I went back into the basement before I went over to Queen Victoria Street, I went back for my coat or my hat, one of the two, or both—it was then that I blew out the light—I did that because I had my sus<lb/>picions, and then I started over to Queen Victoria Street.</p>

I was a porter in the defendant's employment—on Saturday, 19th March, I remember some fresh paraffin oil was wanted, and I was directed by Mr. Wilson to get it—at from half-past 11 to 12 the oil was brought—I had orders to get it on the Friday—he said "Get some more oil."—I told Jefferies to get it, and he got it on Saturday</p>

               <p>about 12 o'clock—the lamp was put into the basement on the Friday, and was burning on the Friday for five or six hours I dare say, it may have been longer—the prisoner saw it burning—I fixed it by his directions; he told me where to fix it, and I raised an objection about putting it at a certain place where he wanted it, because I thought it was not safe—I did not fix it at that place, but used my own discretion, and put it in a safer place—he did not object to my putting it where I thought it better—before fresh oil was sent for I emptied what was in the can into the lamp, before I put it up on the Friday; there was some left in it—it had been burning for five hours before I put any in the receptacle—I cannot say if any was left in at the end of the five hours—the bottom of the lamp was brass—the oil fetched in on Saturday morning was just the same as when it was brought in—the light when the lamp was burning in the basement was as usual; we had two gas-burners going—the lamp showed a different light; it was put up for trial to see the effect of it—the lamp was bought for the Victoria Street new premises, and we tested it to see the effect of the light from this particular lamp—on the Saturday morning I saw the prisoner in the basement, a little before 12 o'clock it may have been, I cannot say the exact time—I came downstairs and saw the prisoner burning a piece of paper; I did not see it lighted—he was burning the paper, I should say, about eight inches off the can of oil, which was on the sill of the window that lights the basement, the window by which people can look in from the area—in consequence of seeing that I spoke to Mr. Wainwright, and afterwards we examined the paper and found it was an advertisement of the Water-bury Watch Company—we could not examine it, it was burnt to a cinder—it smelt of paraffin, and the sill too—you could see by the magnifying glass which Mr. Wainwright got, that it was the advertisement of the Waterbury Watch Co.—I put the can of oil away under the cistern—I had put it on the window-sill when it was brought in; it had not been touched so far as I know; the can was just as it was when I left it so far as I know—it was a patent can with no cork—it was not the prisoner's habit to be much in the basement.</p>

We smelt the paper when I told Mr. Wainwright—it was on the sill we smelt it mostly—the paper could not smell, it was burnt to a cinder—the ledge of the window-sill itself smelt of paraffin, the stain; there was a kind of a stain there—the can had not been there—the can was standing where it had been on the sill—there was a stain on the window-sill where the burnt paper had been left—I did not say I saw the paper in the prisoner's hand—I saw him burning a piece of paper on the sill; he was standing by the side of it watching it—where the paper was burnt there was a little discoloration—I smelt some paraffin there on the sill—the paper was burnt to a cinder, and then the prisoner went away—I did not try if the can smelt of paraffin.</p>

               <p>getting back as soon as possible, something of that sort—he wanted the keys to get in, we understood the door was locked—nothing was said at all beyond the fact "I should like to have the keys"—then he went away back with them, and I and Mr. Wainwright followed to Gresham Street when we had finished unloading the van—that was not in consequence of anything he said—when I came back with Wainwright I saw Jefferies trying to get in with the key, and he had found the other key in the door—he found that before we got back—he started to go back five or seven minutes before us; it might have been longer, I had not got my watch on; it was as much as five, and perhaps seven—when I and Wainwright got back we shook the door is Basinghall Street, which was the only door we could get in at, and we stamped on the railings, and got a stick and knocked at the window, we did not break it—I looked down and saw the gaslight was out; I had noticed it was burning when we first arrived, and it had been turned off in the meantime while we were knocking at the door and trying to get in—you cannot see down the area without getting right down to look in on a level with the pavement—coming across the road from Queen Victoria Street I saw the reflection—you could see it from the opposite side of the road—after I noticed the gas was out I looked again and saw a fire burning; I could not see any smoke from outside; I did not see smoke before I got down into the basement, only a flame—any one in the shop could hear the shaking of the door, and any one in the basement could hear the tapping on the window—after I saw the fire burning I told Mr. Wainwright at once—he got a pair of steps to reach the fanlight to get in, and he smashed the fanlight in Gresham Street, and I went up and was in the act of getting through the fanlight when Mr. Wilson came and opened the door in Basinghall Street—I did not see where he came from—it was from seven minutes to ten minutes from the time of our arriving at the shop in Gresham Street till the prisoner came out; I cannot be accurate to a minute or two—I then went down in the basement, alone first, because the staircase is rather dark and everybody cannot get down unless they know it—the prisoner was at this time in the shop with Stringer—I came up immediately because the smoke was so dense—coming upstairs I asked Stringer what I should do (that was not before the prisoner)—Stringer opened the trap in the floor from the top in the shop, and I opened the window in the basement; that allowed the smoke to get out—I went down and saw the fire burning; Stringer followed me down immediately afterwards—I only saw two tires at the time; when I went down there was only one I could see, the place was all in darkness—there was one fire burning, which I believe you call No. 1; it was near the table, one end of which was right underneath one end of the trap-door—that was the only one I saw burning at the time I went down—Stringer used the water, I did not—I could not say whether any water had been thrown before I went down the second time—after I went down Stringer, who followed me down, used the water, which I got from the hand-basin in the basement, where there is a tap; I gave it to Stringer, and he extinguished that fire—when I went down I fell over a chair standing in the passage way at the bottom of the staircase—we make a passage way there with pictures on each side—the chair was underneath the mouldings, which were fitted upon a rack on the ceiling, and had been kept there for years—we keep the mouldings and send them to the</p>

I have been manager at Gresham Street between 10 and 11 years—I gave evidence at the police-court after being subpoenaed to go there, I refused to give any statement to the City solicitor, who was conducting the prosecution—in 1883 the prisoner was very ill and his business banking account at the Union Bank of London was then changed into my name, but it was not mixed up with my private affairs at all—I can't charge my memory with seeing that exact letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) soon after it arrived most likely, I think I did, about that date I drew a cheque for the landlord for payment of the rent—I could not say when it was drawn, but it was about the 22nd February, my pass book would show—there was no notice to leave these premises in Gresham Street, the lease had expired on the 25th March—I recollect an action pending by Robinson and Fisher—a writ was served I think about a month before the 19th—the prisoner had been doing a fairly good business for the last six months before the fire—I know there were two policies—there was an indorsement on one of them as to the removal of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock to Blackpool for an exhibition there, that was returned <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> of course certain purchases which were sold there, I may say the stock was returned—I made out a synopsis in a small book of the stock book, that was kept on the table or in the safe previous to the fire—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I looked for the book upon the premises and was not able to find it, and now it is handed to me by the usher—I recollect the two large pictures of "The Crucifixion," and "The Unbelief of St. Thomas"—they were bought in 1883 or 1884, I think 1884, my ledger will tell me, if I might have it; I see by that that there were five pictures, two of which are the ones to which I now refer, purchased on the 26th January, 1884, for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each frame—the other three pictures were sold, two of them at different times, to Mr. Brooks, a picture dealer, and the third to a private gentleman, also of the name of Brooks—one of them was sold for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one was sold</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280123"/>
               <p>to Mr. Brooks, on the 20th October, with two others, for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was quite a nominal price, much less than the value—one was a De Beuff of the finest style; but it was more a matter of friendship than want of money then—I have an entry in the day book that the two pictures, "The Crucifixion" and "The Unbelief of St. Thomas" were sent to Mr. Brooks on approval, on October 20th, and returned on January 18th, 1887—the price is stated as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the two—the policies were usually kept in the safe, in a drawer, the key of which I never kept; I always gave it to Mr. Wilson—I believe they were kept there for nine years; when I went to the drawer they were there—I looked into the drawer last week and missed them from there—I noticed this receipt for the insurance on my file about six or seven days before the fire—I saw the cinders of the paper on the Saturday morning about 12 or perhaps 1 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner then, I believe he was out—at the same time I saw a can of paraffin on the cill, and asked McLeod to put it away, but I did not see whether he did so—I afterwards saw it again just under the cistern; it is difficult for me to say whereabouts—I put it on a shelf at the back—I did not put it anywhere until after I saw it under the cistern—it was open to view when I saw it, if you went to look, not without; it was behind a frame—I recollect a van being driven away in the afternoon with some pictures—I did not count how many there were—I have not made a statement of their value—I thought they were worth about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they might be worth less; it is impossible to say, because I don't know every picture that was put in—they were not sold; they did not all belong to the prisoner, 11 or 12 did I should say—I don't know to whom the others belonged, they were bought by some one whose name I have not got—they had been purchased and not sent home; they bad not paid for them—I recollect Jefferies coming; to Queen Victoria Street with four pictures—they belonged to a friend of Mr. Wilson's—it was about 12 minutes after I had reached Queen Victoria Street that Jefferies arrived with the four pictures—I then sent him back—I did not see him return, I happened to he over the way purchasing something, but when I walked across the street he was helping Colin with the last large picture out of the van, and he then said he wanted my keys—I can't say the moment he returned—he asked me for the keys and left me—after that, I and McLeod, having finished at Queen Victoria Street, followed him—it was half-past 4 by Webster's clock when we started, as we turned from locking the door—when I got to the corner of Old Jewry I saw Jefferies at the corner of Gresham Street, apparently looking out; he beckoned me, I went to him; he said, "I cannot open the door"—I saw him trying to open the door with a key, and then trying to push the lock back with a knife, which of course could not be done—I tried to open it myself but could not, then I rattled at the door, it was locked—Colin went round to Gresham Street, and did as we usually do, scraped his feet on the grating to let any one downstairs know there was some one there, and stamped—that was our usual signal, as there was no bell—I may have looked down the grating, but I won't swear I did—the next thing I did was to fetch a stick and knock through the grating on the basement window, because the prisoner suffers from deafness, so that if he were washing his hands he would know some one was there—the prisoner is very ill, I have endeavoured before the Magistrate to let him know how ill the prisoner has been; that accounts for my keeping the banking account—after knocking with</p>

               <p>the stick I began to get anxious, and thought I would get a ladder and enter in by the skylight—McLeod first got up the ladder, but he was not quite tall enough to unfasten the skylight, and he came down, and I went up and broke the skylight and cut the cord within—I had been there seven or eight minutes when that was done—as I was breaking the skylight I saw people going round the corner and leaving me, and so I thought it would be better to go in by the door than by the skylight, and I went round—I saw Stringer just vanishing round the end to go downstairs in the shop—the prisoner was standing just opposite the lobby doors, the doors in Gresham Street, where there used to be a lobby inside the premises, on a mat—I did not go down in the basement till afterwards, when the firemen were there—while I was there, after I had come to the premises, I saw a fire on the ground, that was all I could say—the gas was out, 1 simply saw fire.</p>

Mr. Wilson thought so highly of them that he had spent 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each in having valuable frames made for them—I don't know that these two pictures were insured for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each as far back as 1884, just when they were purchased by Mr. Wilson—I do not know when they were insured—Mr. Brooks is a picture dealer—I did not make the ar<lb/>rangement with him, I only speak from an entry that appears in the books—it is not unusual for one picture dealer to send pictures to another dealer, who may have certain facilities for selling certain pictures, and dividing the profit—if such an arrangement were made 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be the price from which the joint profit would start—I kept the cash at Gres-ham Street, and managed the cash account, any cash that was on the premises was kept in the little drawer in the stationery on my table—we had very little cash, mostly cheques—in the day time it would be unlocked—on that day I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, I cashed a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of it, and I gave Mr. Wilson 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for some boots, or something of that kind, which he had—that left a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the little draws—that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. disappeared that afternoon—I last saw it at 10 minutes to 4, and missed it first about 10 minutes past 5, I suppose, certainly after 5 o'clock—I know Mr. Wilson was searched—I asked him whether he had taken the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said no—when searched 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him—I had also given him just before the fire 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of something else; some money which I had borrowed—during the time I have been there, taking an average of eight to 10 years, Mr. Wilson has been making, in this business a net profit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—his personal expenses were more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, I could not tell you how much without looking at the books; many of his expenses were paid irregularly, rent and those things, it was not like so much a week; roughly, it might have been 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it was not 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the prisoner had been in the habit of allowing his rent at his rooms at Hill Gardens to accumulate, and then paying when it reached a certain sum; he always paid 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a rule—there was nothing exceptional in that state of things—he had been there for seven years, I think, or it might be longer—I don't know that he had been 15 years in his previous lodgings—there is a door at the top of the staircase and one at the bottom—the one at the bottom was always thrown back, never shut—before I broke the fanlight the door had been shaken and somebody had scraped his feet—undoubtedly there were things of considerable value in the shop—the shop was closed at four, for business purposes on Saturday—when I went to Queen Victoria Street the shutters were not put up, and when I came back they were up—there was nobody who could do that except Jefferies—only the Basinghall Street door was used by the public—I saw Jefferies the first time he came over, and I was in the Queen Victoria Street shop the second time, and did not see him, but as I was walking across the road I found him there helping McLeod with one of the pictures—I heard the conversation between Jefferies and Mr. Wilson about the van having been ordered—Mr. Wilson told him in substance that he had told him a lie about it, and he acknowledged it—I heard Jefferies say "Well, you don't think your 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week keeps me?"—Mr. Wilson replied "If you think you can do better, don't you think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188703280126"/>
               <p>you had better?"—Jefferies said he had been learing to paint during the time he had been there; that he had taught himself to paint—I was aware that he had taught himself to paint, and I thought it very credit<lb/>able of him—I knew that he had painted pictures and sold them; I had bought some of him—I knew that Mr. Wilson was going to set up a new business in Queen Victoria Street, the rent of which was to be 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—possession was given to him about a week or a fortnight before the fire—I can't say when the key came; I know a card was sent—I am unable to say whether actual possession was given the day before or not—there is also a basement at Queen Victoria Street—I believe it was for that purpose that this lamp was obtained; it was a Defries safety lamp, which would be quite safe if knocked over—Mr. Wilson tried the lamp both in the shop and in the basement; it burnt three days, I think, upstairs, and then it was put downstairs—I could not say exactly the day it was upstairs; it was Thursday or Friday—Mr. Wilson is a great smoker; he smoked everywhere; he was always smoking—he suffers in his right hand—there is a place downstairs for washing our hands.</p>

I resided with my wife and niece on the fourth floor of 93, Gresham Street, at the corner of Basing-hall Street and Gresham Street—the ground floor and basement were occupied by the prisoner as a Fine Art Repository—on Saturday afternoon, the 19th, about 4.30, I received certain information from Jefferies, in consequence of which I kept watch over the shop from my own staircase, I was off duty at that time—I did not hear or see anything, or smell anything just then—I did about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I think I made a slight mistake in the time in the first instance; it was between 20 minutes and half an hour, it was not so late as a quarter to 5—I heard a loud knocking at the prisoner's shop door; I came on the landing and smelt smoke coming up the staircase—I went downstairs into the street, and came to the street door of the shop in Basing hall Street—it was locked—I went round to the street door in Gresham Street, and saw Mr.</p>

               <p>Wainwright going up a pair of steps, and breaking the fanlight over the shop door in Gresham Street—I Knelt down on the ground, looked through the area grating, and saw a large jet of gas burning, and a fire burning on the basement floor—I went round to the shop door in Basing<lb/>hall Street, and remained there nearly 2 minutes, when the prisoner un<lb/>locked the door and was coming out—I said to him," What is all this smoke?"—I went into the shop, he said, "Where are you going to?"—I said, "Downstairs into the basement!"—just then McLeod came into the shop after me, he went to the staircase of the basement, and came back and said, "It's no use, we shall have to wait till the engines come"—the prisoner was in the shop at the time, not above three or four yards away from us—I opened the trap-door in the meddle of the floor, that allowed a quantity of smoke to come from there—McLeod went down into the basement, and I followed him; the basement was full of smoke—when we first got in McLeod said, "Shall I open one of the windows?"—turning to the left I saw a fire burning on the basement floor, close to two boxes, one of which is now in Court—they were close to two large pictures—I called for some water—McLeod gave me some in an old saucepan—I extinguished the fire—I then turned round and saw another fire burning, thrust between some empty boxes close up under the gas meter—I got some water and exttinguished that one—Mcleod lit the gas and—I found there had been a quantity of moulding burnt that was close up to the flooring of the ground floor—I said to the prisoner, "This look a funny job"—he had not come down close behind us: I don't know whether he came down before the fireman or with the fireman—he was in the basement when I spoke to him—he said, "Do you think I set fire to the place?"—that was all the conversation that took place—I produce a piece of the moulding and the box—the mouldings were six or seven feet from the ground—I noticed some charred paper on the floor under<lb/>neath the moulding—there were 30 or 40 pieces of moulding like this they were not all burnt through, some burnt nearly through, and some scotched, that was all out; it had evidently been recently burnt, as far as I could tell—the gas was out when I got down into the basement, turned off at the burner—I put out the two fires—no water was thrown on them till I threw it on myself—at this time my wife, my niece, and Mr. Heal were on the premises—that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer in charge of the Fire Brigade Station, Watling Street, and have been so employed for 27 years—on 19th March I was called to the fire in Greshain Street about 4.47 p.m. by that man (<hi rend="italic">Jefferies</hi>)—we do not give anything to the first person who comes—we sent the hose-cart on and followed with the engine, the pre<lb/>mises were open—the fire was extinguished, but there was still a. great deal of smoke—I examined the basement and found there had been three separate and distinct fires; one consisted of two packing cases, a wrapper and a quantity of waste paper, the packing cases were near to some pictures; No. 2 was some picture mouldings 8 or 9 feet long, and No. 3 was 8 or 9 feet under the gas meter, and consisted of some trimmings in a bag, and a quantity of newspapers slightly scorched—the fires in my opinion were the work of an incendiary and nut accidental—I saw the prisoner in the basement and asked him if he could account for the three separate and distinct fires, he simply said that he had tried to put the fire out, he did not answer the question, I put it again and he muttered something which I did not understand, but finished by saying that he had attempted to put the fire out—I had no difficulty in making him hear, he did not appear to be deaf—the inspector then pointed out to him the appearance of the premises—the fire had been burning I should think not more than five or six minutes at the outside, if it had been burning 20 minutes I don't think there would have been muck left</p>

This wood produced is oak—if there was a good flame it would not take long to burn like this if it was perfectly dry and a person held a lighted newspaper under it; it would not take more than five or six minutes, but of course one newspaper would not do it, he would have to replenish it with newspaper after newspaper—there was a considerable quantity of ashes below, apparently tinder from paper, and unless the fire was a strong one it might take more than five or six minutes to burn, it might take a quarter of an hour—the moldings were in a dozen pieces or more in a rack—they would take longer to burn if it was in a single piece so that the flames could go round it—some of the moulding is so charred that it was burnt through and the ends were hanging down—the supports were 18 inches from the ceiling, which was not at all charred; it was very dirty, and would not show the smoke—I should think the fire underneath for five or six minutes would make it a little cleaner, but it would show; I did not see anything on the ceiling, therefore the fire could not have been a large one—the fire was eight or nine feet from the moulding—this wood would not flare so much as pine—the effect of the fire turned out to be to burn the mouldings, but it had no effect on the house or the pictures.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> It is impossible to say how the mouldings were burnt, but I should say by a flame applied underneath—I do not know whether a person would have to stand on a chair—it would take very short time to car the mouldings like that—there is a sink in the basement—it is impossible for a person coming from that sink and going upstairs to pass through without seeing these fires; he must have passed under the one which was burning overhead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the North British Mercan<lb/>tile Fire Office—on 26th September, 1881, a policy was effected there in the name of C. Wilson, trading as Wilson and Co., Gresham, Street, for 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is still running by renewal—it appears on the back that the limit on ant one article is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—on 14th March, 1884, another policy for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was taken out on three pictures, "The Crucifixion," "The Marriage of the Virgin," and "The Unbelief of St. Thomas," and on 12th March, 1885, a fresh policy for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., expiring on 14th February, 1886, on the pictures, a "Marriage of the Virgin;" 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at Burlington House, and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the two pictures "The Crucifixion" and "Ten Unbelief of St. Thomas"—There was an insurance running from 24th December, 1886, for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in equal proportions on the two last at Mr. Brook's. 34, Fitzroy street; that was endorsed on 10th March to 93, Gresham Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These policies were effected through Mr. Collins, one of the best known insurance agents—he no doubt had an opportunity of examining the pictures before they were covered at the office—I have traced the prisoner's insurances as far back as Midsummer, 1874—the earlier policies described the premises as 27, Gresham Street but I understand it is the same house—he has never made any claim that I am aware of—we are not the prosecutors, I am simply a witness for the prosecution.</p>

If a man destroys, loses, or burns his policy, and a reasonable statement is made to the office for its non-production, the claim is paid—Mr. Collins would have a record of policies effected through him as I have of mine—I was first asked to give evidence on the Monday or Tuesday after the fire—I was asked several questions before the Magis<lb/>tate about the earlier policies for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the answer to which involved the actual knowledge of the facts put to me—I had not referred to the Company's books, and was not in a position to give answers to the questions Counsel put to me—the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4,000,<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. policies had been immediately affected by the fire, as under them a claim might arise—I could not say myself whether the policies were new or old ones</p>

I am proprietor of the Reynolds Gallery, 5, Great Newport Street—I have had experience all my life of the works of the old masters, and I believe I am an expert as to the genuineness of works attributed to the old masters—on 21st March I went to 93, Gresham Street, and saw two pictures, a "Crucifixion" attributed to Van Eyck, and "The Unbelief of St. Thomas," attributed to Van Leyden, which were certainly not rightly attributed to those artists—if they were genuine 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each would be adequate for insuring them—they are extremely difficult pictures to value—to me they would be of no value whatever, it is entirely matter of opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A perfectly certain Van Eyck would be of very large value—I have seen a Van Eyck as large as this in the Academy at Ghent 10 years ago—I never had a Van Eyck through my hands to sell as a dealer.</p>

I keep a fishmonger's shop at 277, High Street, Stratford—on 3rd March the prisoner came in about 9 o'clock for two-Pennyworth of fish and a pennyworth of potatoes—he was served by Davis, who afterwards handed me the coin and said "Here, Mr. Barber, here is a had two-shilling piece"—I looked at it, and could see it was Bent—I went round the counter to the prisoner, and said "Where did You get this from?"—he said "From the Corporation; I have been Working for the tramways"—I said "That is not the Corporation"—he Said he had it as a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>; meaning, I suppose, he had had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as part of The wages due to him—I said "Have you any more money about you"—he Said "here is a two shilling piece"—I said "That seems to be all right "The Corporation"—I called for my hat and coat, and said 'If they will Change it it will be all right"—I went out of my shop with him, and When we got outside he said "Don't lock me up, governor"—I said "I have not got outside he said anything about locking up; come down, and we will go and see anyhow"—he said "It is no good going down"—I said "Why?"—he said "Because they never gave it me"—I said "Oh, where did you get it from?"—he said "I had it last week"—I that time a constable came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I gave the florin to the constable; this is it—I believe the prisoner was perfectly sober, although he attempted to look silly—I asked him what he had done with the other shilling when he talked about the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. sub.—he said he had had some beer with it.</p>

I think he knocked twice—I watched at the window till he came away from the door, and when he got to the gate he looked at me and took a large handkerchief out of his pocket and tied it round his neck—I watched him as far as I could see—he went to the right, down Khedive Road—I still stood at the window for about 10 minutes and saw him come back again—I believe he saw me at the window—he passed on, I then left the room—I am sure sure he is the man, he wore a brown suit, a mixture, I should say that this it it—I picked him out on the Friday from a room full of men, at the station—this was a very wet day.</p>

I said "I am a police officer and am going to arrest you on suspicion of breaking and entering the dwelling-house No. 5, Hayter Villas, Ham Road"—he said "I don't know what you mean," and at the same time he stepped back into the roadway from the path, and tried to get his right hand into a back pocket of his trousers—I called to Hallmark to look out, and immediately seized his right hand, and on searching him I found this 5-barrelled revolver, which was loaded in three chambers, and two chambers contained empty cartridges—we took him to Ham station, he was placed with a number of men, and Allwright, Taylor, and Harris picked him out without hesitation—somebody mentioned the revolver, and he referred to a catalogue and said "You can see by this catalogue that I bought it at a sale at Forest Gate"—I found on him the catalogue, a metal watch, a metal brooch, two common rings, and a scarf pin.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Ansell, who is at present in Australia; I live at 103, Roan Street, Greenwich—the prisoner is my brother-in-law, he and his wife occupied a room on the top floor of that house—prior to 4th March my sister had been ill and confined to her bed a month—I was staying with her, nursing her—on Friday night, 4th March, Dr. Gordon came, about 9, to see her—the prisoner was downstairs, I fetched him up, Dr. Gordon told him that his wife was very dangerously ill, and ordered him to letch the medicine in a quarter or half an hour at latest, and some ice to be put into some cold water for her to drink—the prisoner went out at 20 minutes to 10, he returned at 12.20—I was in the room when he returned, with Mr. and Mrs. Carter, his wife was in bed—the prisoner seemed cross—My sister said to him,</p>

               <p>"Frank, you have no love for me or you would have returned with my medicine before, knowing that the doctor said I was to have it in a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes at latest"—He used bad language—Mrs. Carter, who is my other sister, said to him, "Have you the medicine?"—he said, "All right, wait a minute"—she said, "If you have it, give it to me"—he gave it to her, she gave it to me, and I poured it out and gave it to her—I then said, "Frank, you ought to be devilish well ashamed of yourself"—he said, "The b—room is mine. you go out of it, if you don't go I will throw you down the b—stairs," and he rushed at me, and tore my dress and apron—Mrs. Carter jumped up and said, "Frank, be quiet"—he then sat down, but jumped up again, and said he would have me out of the b—room—he took off his coat and threw it across the chair—my sister said. "Oh Frank, you wretch, you want to kill me; Melina, don't leave me"—I went to the fireplace and took the poker, and said, "Frank, if you touch me again I will hit you with this," and I placed the poker between my legs, holding the knob in my hand—he jumped up again, snatched the poker out of my hand, and" threw it into the fireplace—he was quiet then, and sat down for about a second, and then he jumped up and said he would set light to the b—bed and the b—lot of us, and then he struck at the lamp violently with his right hand clenched, and missed it; he had a box of matches in his left hand—the lamp was on the corner of the table alight, it held close upon a quart of paraffin—he then struck at the lamp again and knocked it over; it went from that table on to a side table and on to a chair, and then on to the floor, and there was a great smash and a great flame—the door was burnt, and two chairs and two large pictures that were hanging up by the door, and my sister's boots; the carpet was not burnt, it was kamptulicon—the box of matches were found all burnt on the floor, and his wife's night-dress was saturated at the bottom slightly; I have it here—I rushed to my sister and pulled her out of bed, and stood her by the window, and told Mrs. Carter to call mother, father, or somebody—the prisoner was still in the room—he did not tender any assistance whatever—his wife said, "Oh Frank, help me, for God's sake help me"—he made no answer, but rushed out of the room, and struck me in the chest as he passed—I was then outside the room, knocking at Mrs. Seymour's door, then I fell, and crawled down stairs and knocked at the parlour door, and I don't remember anything more.</p>

I had taken out a summons against my husband on 19th February, for ill using me on the previous Saturday, and on the night of 22nd February I was on the bed dressed, when he came to the bedside and said he would take my life; he said he knew he should get a month for what he had done, and he might as well be committed for manslaughter as not—I begged of him to be quiet and he fell into a drunken sleep until morning—he said nothing till he went out and got drunk—he came back about 20 minutes after, walked up and down the room for a few minutes, and then came to my bedside and said "I must take your life," or something to that effect—he had nothing in his hand then—he made for my chest, my shawl gave way; I got up off the bed and caught hold of him, and then he reached, took something off the bed, there was a scuffle, I felt a blow on the top of my head, and then I saw the light of the door and remember no more—when I came to I was at a neighbour's house—I was taken to the hospital, out of which I came last Monday—I am still an out-patient.</p>
