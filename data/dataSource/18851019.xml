                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Sergeant</hi>). In July last I was at New Brentford with a constable named Richardson, making inquiries in another matter, and on 13th July, about 5 p.m., I went alone on board the barge Lucy, which was close to the Grand Junction Canal—no one was on board, but the younger prisoner came on board and asked me what my business was there—I said "Are you the master?"—he said "No; I am the mate of the barge"—I said "I want to look at this barge"—he asked me into the cabin—we went down, and I told him I was a police officer—I pointed to a bed berth, and said "What is that underneath there?"—he said "Flour, I think"—I said "Where did you get it from?"—he said "That is an over, and we are making use of it"—we went into the hold, where I saw a pile covered with sacks—I pulled the sacks off and said "What is this?"—he made no reply—I found six marked sacks, with the marks downwards covered with other empty sacks—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—I said "Where is your father?"—he said "Ashore; I do not know where"—I said "Go and fetch him"—he did so, while I remained on the barge—the father came and asked what my business was—I drew his attention to the flour under the bed berth, and asked him to account for having it—he said "About a month ago I loaded 500 bags of flour at K Jetty, Victoria Docks, and took them to Mercer's Mill, Uxbridge; I did not deliver them myself When I went to take the barge away I found the flour on board"—I asked if he had told any one—he said "Yes; I told my master"—I said "When?"—he said "Some time ago"—I asked if he had acquainted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190004"/>
               <p>the people at the mill or the Dock Company that he had an excess—he said "No; I never tell anybody when I have anything over; only a short time ago my master had to pay for two quarters of wheat"—I left an officer in charge, and went and made inquiries, and about 6 o'clock I met him in High Street, Brentford, and told him the account he gave did not seem at all satisfactory, and he would have to go with me to the station—he was taken there and detained—they were taken before a Magistrate next day, and on the way back to the station the elder prisoner said "It is no use my telling you a lie; I did not get them from the quay; I got them from the steamship"—I took the sacks from the barge, and afterwards went back to the barge and found a seventh sack in the hold, covered over and put into a plain sack which concealed the marks on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What he said was "My master had to pay last week for two quarters of wheat which were short"—his master at that time was Mr. Sanders, who is here—I showed the younger prisoner a paper, on the supposition that I was going to buy the barge, and I think he believed it—I did not lead the father to believe I was an intending pur<lb/>chaser—the barge is covered with gratings and tarpaulins; the gratings are used as hatches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Clive and Son, merchants, of Great Tower Street—the steamship Longhurst was reported as arriving on June 8th—she was discharged in the Victoria Docks—we were to receive by her a large quantity of flour with the brand "Long John"—Gillespie and Scott were agents for the owners, and I got from them a release for the goods—I gave an order for Stevens and Mercer, of Uxbridge, to receive 500 of the bags on June 6th or 8th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the brand "Long John" about three years, during which there have been large consignments of it to London.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Gillespie and Scott, of Philpot Lane, agents for Elliott and Co., owners of the Longhurst, by which we had a freight of flour consigned to the order of Clive and Son—to enable them to get the goods I should give a release on the ship for the payment of the freight—I collect the freight—the release would be the authority for the mate to deliver that part of the cargo—after the cargo was got out there was, according to the dock return, a shortage of 32 bags of flour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The manifest shows 4,490 bags of "Long John," and the dock returns show that there was 32 short—I do not know that 40 bags of "Long John" came in another vessel afterwards—mistakes are sometimes made in the manifests and in the receipts of the lightermen, and in the dock landing accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Some bags come short with different marks—sometimes a lighterman gives a receipt for a less quantity than he receives—I should not call that a mistake, but it might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAUNDERS</hi>. I am a lighterman—I received instructions from Messrs. Mercer to take 500 bags of flour from the ship to their mill—I got this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the mill personally from Mr. Mercer on 19th June—the elder prisoner was the master of my barge Lucy, and the younger the mate—neither of them said anything to me on this matter till the elder prisoner was arrested—I then said to him "Have you got any sacks on board?"—he said "No; but I have got some flour which I had over out of that last lot."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has been eight years in my employment—he has been out on bail, and has been working for me ever since—he has been in Brentford all his life—he was a long while in Mr. Dale's employment—the men sometimes find that they are short in taking a load from a vessel, and I then compel them to make up the deficiency out of their wages—the consignee would let me know, and he would stop it from my account—the men occasionally receive more than their quantity, and do not tell their masters, and so recoup themselves for the stoppage on the "shorts"—he made three voyages for the delivery of these bags at Uxbridge—he worked back again to Brentford, and went up and down the river, calling at various places with seven sacks on board—he after<lb/>wards had a voyage with coal from Brentford to London—the barge Wag left Millwall Dock in July with 10 sacks of "Long John" flour short—I had notice from the consignee, and told my men they would have to make up the deficiency—when the lighter leaves the ship the man has to sign for what he has received, and he is bound by his signa<lb/>ture—if he signs for 20 sacks and there are only 19 it is very seldom rectified—if he signs for 20 and finds he has 23 he does not give them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not authorise that; it is a custom among the men, which we prevent whenever we can, by giving notice to the owners—I did not go and examine the barge when the prisoners were arrested—I supposed it to be empty—I have charged the prisoners with shortings—I do not know when, but perhaps three or four times in eight years.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bags are counted by tiers, and we cannot very well make a mistake in counting—the usual average is 10 bags in a tier, and we get on top of them to count them, and see that they are all level, and if there are 8 tiers 8 times 10 make 80 bags.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipping clerk—Mr. Shepherd employed me to assist in discharging the cargo of the Longhurst, and among other barges we discharged into the Lucy—the bags are passed down a shoot, and as the marks come they are carried to whoever is entitled to them—the Kirbys were in the Lucy, and the younger prisoner packed princi<lb/>pally—they were to receive 500 bags of "Long John" flour—the elder prisoner said that 9 bags were required for the top tier, and he had only 8, he was one bag short; that is, as the barge was packed he wanted a whole tier, he wanted 9 and we had only 8 to give him—he waited to get the other bag to complete the 500—I called out to Mr. Shepherd "He has got the 500," and he wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the pass-book which would be signed by Mr. Shepherd, by the Custom House officer, by the lighterman, and by the Dock Company, to allow him to pass out of the Docks.</p>

I am manager of the transport department of the Auxiliary Stores—Guignebert was a checker—this sheet is his writing—when a hamper is sent with the bill to the transport department Guigne<lb/>bert should satisfy himself that it is properly stamped, and he would enter it on the carman's delivery sheet and hand him the parcel—the bill is placed in the hamper and sent with the goods—the carman sees that the parcels are all entered on the sheet, and it was Guignebert's duty to see that all the articles were put into the van—here is on this sheet a parcel for Luckie, 41, Spencer Park, but none for Savin, of 7, Fensbury Terrace, Wandsworth.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 57, Weymouth Street, Portland Place, and am a physician and apothecary—I have the diploma of physician of the College of Edinburgh and a certificate of midwifery from there—in 1879 I was the prisoner's assistant under an agreement, which came to an end ultimately—in February, 1884, I obtained a diploma from the Society of Apothecaries—I am now medical officer to the Prince Albert and Duchess of Kent lodges of Odd Fellows; the first is held in Albany Street, and the second in George Street, Manchester Square—I was appointed to the Prince Albert on 29th June, 1884, and to the Duchess of Kent in January, 1885—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">These letters, written in May and June, 1885, by the prisoner to the Noble Grand of the lodges, imputed that Mr. Beecher was not a qualified surgeon, and had no right to practise surgery; that he had failed to pass his examination at the Royal College of Surgeons, Elinburgh, and had been elected by chicanery and bribery.</hi>) All the letters refer to me—I am qualified to practise surgery, although I do not hold the diploma.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Noble Grands are officers of the board of manage<lb/>ment of the lodges—the letters were posted to the Noble Grands, and were read at open lodges—I am only an honorary member, and am familiar with the rules observed at the lodge meetings—they are tiled, with a warder to prevent any one coming in except members—I am 51—I obtained my apothecary's certificate in February, 1884, and my certifi<lb/>cate from the Royal College of Edinburgh was on 5th February, 1885—I am legally qualified to practise surgery by both those examinations, but not to recover fees as a surgeon—I was examined in surgery at Edinburgh—when I was appointed to these lodges I was a member of the Society of Apothecaries, from which I had the qualification to prac<lb/>tise surgery, and to give a certificate if some one died—I swear it gave me more right to practise surgery than a person with no such qualifica<lb/>tion—there are two examinations, preliminary and final, for the Society of Apothecaries' examination—I passed the preliminary six months before June, 1884—I was not examined in pure surgery at my final examina<lb/>tion—I was examined in anatomy—I never passed an examination in surgery, but I had gone through the hospital practice and anatomy, and that will entitle any person to practise surgery, and any other medical person in the witness-box would give the same answer—the law entitles apothecaries to practise surgery, but not to recover fees which are not paid at the time—this certificate would give me the right to perform the most difficut surgical operations if I was fool enough to do so—I should run no more risk than an M.R.C.S.—in London every person would call in a pure surgeon—I was with Mr. Hunter, surgeon, of Pimlico, 18 years ago—after remaining there three or four years, I went as a clerk to Messrs Savory and Moore—I was there some years, and then went to Messrs. Legison's, lozenge manufacturers, and travelled for orders for their drugs—then I was with the prisoner for five or six years—I kept his books during that time—he is a properly qualified M.R.C.S.—he held the office of surgeon to these lodges a great many years—I did not know he was a member of them till I was told so—in that capacity he would</p>

               <p>be entitled to all their privileges—I receive a medical officer's emolu<lb/>ments to attend patients as they may apply to me—if a man applied to me to have his leg amputated I should recommend him to go to the hospital for help—if he objected I should amputate his leg if necessary, calling in some one to assist me—I should lead in the operation—I have never operated on any member of these societies; I should take the responsibility if necessary—application has been made to me for a minor surgical operation—there was one operation when I had not the instru<lb/>ments—I could have borrowed them, out I sent the patient to Mr. Sutton—I know Mr. Bale, the secretary of the Prince Albert Lodge—it is not correct that members of that lodge would get an operation performed by applying to Mr. Bloxham or Mr. Sutton, as I was associated with them—I do not know Rule 21 of the Duchess of Kent lodge, "That a qualified surgeon shall be appointed"—I expect the rules govern the couduct of the lodges—I know nothing about the rules—if a child had swallowed some corrosive fluid and were likely to be choked, I should perform trache<lb/>otomy—I have also been appointed medical officer to St. James's Lodge—I do not know that the prisoner did not belong to that lodge; he was formerly surgeon to it—I never heard that he wrote to that lodge—I receive 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per member per annum—they would be entitled to surgical and medical attendance and medicine—I should attend them—I should call one of my friends in to assist in a surgical case—in only one case I sent a patient to my friend—neither Mr. Bloxham nor Mr. Sutton have been appointed surgeons to the lodge—I have not heard that the members have complained that a surgeon has not been appointed—it is libellous to state that I was plucked for an examination; I never went up for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Prince Albert Lodge—I received these letters, A, B, and C, by post, and the chairman and I opened them together, and he or I read them aloud to the general meeting of the lodge (about 40 or 50 were present) as part of the business of the evening meeting—they were discussed especially with regard to Mr. Beecher—he was appointed on the date named in the regular way—in consequence of complaints we got rid of Mr. Mapleson, and then we had several candidates and elected Mr. Beecher by ballot of the members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letters were read to the members with closed doors—a member is stationed at the door to prevent any one but members coming in—the members would be under no obligation not to disclose what took place at the meeting—certain things are kept secret, but not such things as this—I don't think it would be improper for members to talk outside about the contents of these letters—the only instances where members have complained that they did not know Mr. Mapleson was still the officer, was where they themselves had removed—there are district, lodge, and general rules—the prisoner had held the appointment for nearly 20 years—Mr. Beecher was appointed to act where necessary as surgeon—he was asked on the night of his election if he could practise surgery, and he answered "Yes"—it was not on that that he was appointed; all the candidates were asked, so as to be on the safe side—we look on the members who pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a year as claiming the office of doctor—Mr. Beecher has proved himself fit to attend on the members by his attention and general abilities; we have never been so</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was an honorary member; he had no privileges—he could come and speak at meetings, but had no vote in the management—the letters were read solely before a meeting of the members—members are under obligation not to divulge anything that takes place, and therefore Mr. Mapleson might think it would never reach anybody outside the lodge, I suppose—we have bye-laws for the lodges which govern the immediate action of the lodge so long as they do not act contrary to the district rules—the rules have been revised since the appointment; the rule that existed then is not quite the same as at present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dental surgeon at 10, Cavendish Place—on Saturday, 5th September, I left Victoria for Worthing by the 11.40 train—after taking my seat I got out to get a paper, and on returning I found a man standing at the door—I got into the carriage and took my seat; the man entered and took a seat opposite mine, and another man got in—on arriving at Clapham Junction the prisoner put his head out at the window, and another man got in and sat next to me—the man who joined us last said to one of the men, "How is the time?"—then he put his coat over his knees and produced some cards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190026"/>
               <p>and asked if any one had seen cards like those, and began to shuffle them about and explain the game—one card had the figure of a horse's head upon it, and the other two were blanks—the prisoner joined with the others in the play—they played 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. points, and sometimes half-sovereigns—the winnings did not always go to the dealer—later on the prisoner came and sat next to me, exactly opposite the dealer—he kept asking me why I would not play—he asked my opinion as to which was the winning card, first, second, or third, and I said "I think it is <hi rend="italic">that,</hi>" and he said "So do I," and then he would stake on the card—he sometimes lost and sometimes won—he kept inducing me to play—I hit on the right card several times, and he said, "Why don't you join us?"—I said, "I have no wish to, I have seen the game before"—the prisoner still persuaded me to play, and then as an excuse I said I had no money—he said, "Oh, if it is a matter of funds I have been winning a little and I will lend you some"—I said, "You are very kind, but I do not borrow money from strangers, I have no desire to play"—he still pressed me to play, as also the dealer, and to keep them quiet I said, "Very well, as you are so lavish with your money I will take it," and he then lent me five sovereigns—the cards were dealt out, and the dealer said, "I won't take a less stake than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner said, "I have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you put another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between us"—I put the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the dealer won—the prisoner suggested, to get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, that he should lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Very well"—then the stakes jumped up to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we went another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which also went, and the prisoner lent me another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and we staked with that and won it, and then there was another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that went, and I think another—it ended by my owing the prisoner 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the dealer won the whole time, and the other men told me how much they had lost; one man said he had lost 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, and another 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—by this time we got to Preston Park—the prisoner asked me where I was going—I said "To Worthing"—he said, "Have you any friends there?"—I said, "I know it slightly, I have been down there once or twice"—he said he was going down there to see some friends he had not seen for 16 years, that he had been in Australia, and was going home to stay with them from Saturday till Tuesday, that he did not know where they lived, and he had no luggage; he said he was going to Worthing for an hour or so—our train was an express, and there was no stoppage between Clapham Junction and Preston Park—a man came to the door and said, "Tickets, please"—I gave mine, and he looked at the other four and never asked them, and the prisoner said "Season"—I thought it strange that he should have a season ticket if he were only going to Worthing for a few hours—the others got out, and the prisoner remained in—on the road to Worthing the prisoner asked me what I was going to do about his money—I said, "You will have it, come to me for it, I have not it with me, I do not carry my cheque-book about"—he asked me if I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I could let him have till Monday, as he had run out—I said I had not—he asked if I was going to stay with friends—I said "Yes," and he asked if they would lend the money—I said it was very doubtful; I said, "I will give you my address, and you give me yours, and you can call for it on Monday; are you living in London?"—he said "No"—I said, "You give me your address wherever it is"—he said, "I have not one at present, I am going down to see these people at Brighton, and don't</p>

               <p>know whether I shall see them or not; you had better give me an I O U"—I said, "I shall be very pleased to do that, and if you doubt my word I will let you have my watch and chain as a guarantee of good faith"—he refused that, and produced this envelope for the I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he went with me to my friends at Worthing—no money was lent—he was to come to me in London on Monday morning, and I communicated with the authorities at Scotland Yard—two detectives awaited him, and he was taken in custody—O'Dea asked him what he wanted—he said he wanted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—I said, "If you can send for a friend to vouch for you, and you can show it is a genuine loan, I am willing to pay it now."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave a detailed account of the card-playing before the Magistrate—when I said I had no money, I had enough to pay my fare and to play with if I wished to—the value of my watch and chain was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stopped about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at my friend's house at Worthing—I did not see any season-ticket—I am aware that there are weekly season-tickets—I think the races near Worthing were over—I saw no recognition between the prisoner and the others in the carriage—I was reading a paper—I got from the prisoner exactly 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns; I tried to get a note, but could not—I cannot say whether I could have put the money in my pocket, and not played for it.</p>

I live at 41, Richmond Road, Caledonian Road, and am a fish salesman—I have known the prisoner ever since we were boy and girl together; she is, I believe, unmarried—I became intimate with her during the last three years—on the morning of 29th September, about 10 o'clock, I went into the Swan public-house, Fish Street Hill, with the prisoner, Mrs. Niell, and her child; I called for two or three cups of coffee—the prisoner refused to allow me to pay for any for her—I asked her what I owed her visit to—she said she wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked her what she wanted it for—she said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a week's rent for her room, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a week's notice—I was not living in her room: I occasionally visited her—I told her she would have no more money out of me, as she had had 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within three months, besides the rent—I then said that I must return to my business, because I had not finished—with that Mrs. Niell halloaed out "Look out, George, she has got the bottle"—I saw the prisoner with a bottle in her hand—she said "Take that then," and threw it—I tried to knock it out of her hand with this hand, and it went up my arm—I did not succeed in knocking it out, and she threw the remains of the bottle in my face—I made a hit or two at her, but I was advised to leave her alone and run to the hospital, and I did so—I have heard her make threats several times, weeks before, in blackguard words—she said she would ruin me first; she would blind me with vitriol, and I should then go about begging with a dog, for the rest of my life—on the Monday before this occurrence I went into the Monument public-house with my brother and two friends, and saw the prisoner there—I saw a bottle in her hand in a handkerchief—she was trying to get the cork out, and my brother halloaed out "Look out, George, she has got a bottle"—I ran out, and she ran after me.</p>

I live at 16b, Broad Street Buildings, and am a widow—on 29th September, about 10 a.m., I was with Mansfield in the Swan public-house, Fish Street Hill—the prisoner went in with us—I had a cup of coffee there—I heard the conversation between the prisoner and prosecutor—the prisoner then took a bottle out of her bag—I heard her take the cork out, and before she threw it I said "She has got something in the bag"—he tried to knock it out of her hand, but knocked it more into her lap, and then she did it again, and it went over his face and over the place—on the previous Sunday the prisoner came to my lodging when Mrs. Hunt was there, and asked me to send the children out of the room, and I did so—she there said that for the injury he had done her and broken her home up and injuring her children she would have revenge, and she swore a terrible oath that she would blind him; that she had got the stuff at home, and if she had it with her she would have thrown it at him instead of the boots, which were in a parcel in her hand, which she had thrown at him before—I believe they were her own boots—she was at my lodgings about an hour.</p>

I am a milliner and fancy draper at 42, Brush-field Street—the prisoner has called at my place for about the last ten months as an agent for frilling—on 28th September he brought a length of beaver fur and said "I know Mrs. Rosenbaum wants a length for her jacket if you would like to buy it"—he showed it as a sample——nothing was said as to where it came from—I said I would see if it was required—next day, Wednesday morning, I had a conversation with Mr. Kosminski, and on Wednesday afternoon I said to the prisoner "I have a buyer, a furrier, who will buy the lot of you, but will only buy it if you will bring down the bulk for him to see—I made an appointment for him to come and see the bulk at my place—he said there were 72</p>

About 7 p.m. I saw the prisoner at Snow Hill Station—shortly before 7 on 1st October I went with him to White Cross Street from what I heard him say—when there I asked him to point out the place where he had received the fur from—it was a small jeweller's shop at 160, Whitecross Street, with the name of Taylor over it—I told him to go inside and see if Taylor or the man that sent him with the skins was there—he went in, a female behind the counter spoke to him, and he came out—I said "Where is the man?"—he said "He is not in"—I said "You know where to find him, I suppose"—he said "I know the public-house he uses"—we went round St. Luke's to different public-houses in search of Taylor, the man who had sent him with the skins—we got into the City Road—I said "You must have made some appointment with this man when you received these skins this afternoon"—he said "No I haven't"—I said "Is there no other house he that he used that you know?"—he said there was one in Nile Street—I saw two uniform men at the corner of Eagle Street, and asked them to follow me up, as I knew the neigh<lb/>bourhood—the prisoner went into a public-house, but came out again—we went back to Whitecross Street again, and I told him he had better go inside the shop and see if he was there—he went inside, and spoke to the same female for a minute or two, and then came out—I said "Is he in?"—he said "No"—I said "You must have an appointment some<lb/>where"—he said he was sure to find him—we went round the same neighbourhood again till we got to the Eagle again—I said "This won't do for me; if you don't tell me where you made the appointment with this man, you must have had an appointment with him when you took the skins this afternoon, I shall take you back to the station"—he said "If I do I shall be in the same position as if I did not tell you"—I said "If you don't tell me where you had the appointment to-day I shall take you</p>

I am a widow and a laundress, at 2, Chester Cottages, opposite the prisoner's house—on 7th October, about 1.50, I saw Mr. Golding, the deceased, come home to his dinner the worse for drink and using very bad language—before he went in he said, "You b—old cow, I want you"—his wife was upstairs—he went into the parlour and shut the door, and I heard a knife and fork going, as though he was eating his dinner, and he continued to use bad language—the prisoner came down the stairs, and the deceased rushed to the door to him and said, "You b—thieving young swine, if you don't get out of this</p>

               <p>house I will throw something at your head"—the boy said, "I won't be called a thief when I am not"—the father rushed back to the room again, and as the boy was going out at the garden gate he threw a plate with very great violence at him, and then a knife—the boy ducked down or they would both have hit him—he turned round and said to his father, "You old b—, if you throw things at me I will throw them back again," and I saw something dark leave the boy's hand, and saw the father sink into a chair looking very pale, and I went across to him and saw blood oozing from his left leg and running down his boots—I called Mrs. Golding, and went to fetch a doctor, but the man was dead before I went.</p>

We went the next day, and Mr. Dean gave us the particulars the same as in the letter, and a small diagram of the road to get at it from the station, and told us he would write to Captain Fitzhenry that we were coming on the following day to view the estate for the purpose of purchasing it for ourselves—I was then assisting Groome at a salary—he was rebuilding some old premises in Crown Court, Chancery Lane—at that time I had no available property nor had Groome—I believe he became indebted to me afterwards—we went down the next day, and Dean was to have gone with us, but did not—Captain Fitzhenry showed us the whole estate—we acted as would-be purchasers—we went, I think, the next day, and saw the defendants, and told them we thought well of the estate, and there could be a considerable ground rent made of it, and we were agreeable to purchase it at the sum named—I told Dean that I had not the means of paying even the deposit for the estate, and he said "There is no necessity for that, as I have a client who will provide all the means on mortgage"—I then turned to Groome and said "If that is so I see no objection; you have not the means to purchase, neither have I, and if that is the case, if your client will provide the means the matter can be settled"—I after<lb/>wards said "Why does not you client purchase?"—he said "Our clients will advance money on mortgage when they will not lock their money up"—then I turned round to Groome, and said "If that is the case I see no objection"—I then went off the scene, and took a position as clerk of the works at the rebuilding of the endowed schools at Isleworth, for which Mr. Bouchier, of Great George Street, was architect—I saw the defendants very little after that—this letter is in my handwriting.

And we were very pleased to get the estate on those conditions—I went down to the estate I should think twenty times—I do not know that Dean told the Captain that it was to be a cash transaction—I know the reverse of that—I know I am bound by my answer—it was proposed we should get the money to buy the estate by mortgage—I had not probably borrowed anything approaching such a sum on land in my life—I have borrowed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not specially for land, nor was this specially for land, because the house built on the estate was well worth about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the house called The Shawe, which Captain Fitzhenry resides in—I attempted to get the money, amongst other places, at Adelaide Place, Mr. Thomas's, what they call the Land Security Investment Association, or Company, and I made an attempt, we will say with Mr. King, land surveyor, who gets money on mortgage for gentlemen, and at Guildhall Yard; De Jersey and Preston's, land agents and financial brokers, and almost to every solicitor who had money to lend, and amongst others, to the solicitor and surveyor for Earl Darnley, who Mr. Cross referred me to—his name is as sweet as yours—I went to a number of places—I complained to Dean that I thought he must have known something more of the estate when he sold it to me, as I found from Mr. Dyer, in Gracechurch Street, another land agent, that the Captain had offered the estate for less than 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was supposed to offer 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and when I went down to Captain Fitzhenry on the first occasion I asked him as a condition, if I dealt with the estate, would he kindly refuse to answer any inquiry of any surveyor as to what I was paying for it, as I had to raise the money on mortgage, and if it were disclosed it would spoil the deal, and he <hi rend="italic">grappled</hi> my hand and said "My mouth shall be mum, Mr. Groome, on that question"—the Captain told me of the bill he had given to Dean and Son—I did not know that it fell due in October—I don't think the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190057"/>
               <p>we will say, without any conversation whatever, put the question whether they would lend on his property, Cadogan Mansions—he had three Earls tenants, he called them <hi rend="italic">Harls,</hi> and they said, "What is it?" and they entertained his project, and they forgot mine for the moment, when all at once he blurted out that Mr. Groome was offered 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his bargain as soon as he had obtained it, as soon as he had got the land or purchased the Ashstead estate—it is no matter whether I was going to get 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit on the bargain; how much do you get on your bargains?—we were at De Jersey and Preston's at the time, and I do not know whether it was with flurry at the disclosure or what, but his head, which was white, became pink and then red; his bald head became evidently suffused, and he did not entertain the idea after, but he told it to Mr. De Breary—he is a gentleman the same as you are; an independent gentle<lb/>man I should say, much more than you or me; a gentleman living on his means—he was to get the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. De Breary came out and said, "Go back, Mr. Groome, directly, and demand your commission note, but do not take that fellow with you; he has no discretion, and has lost the money;" they would have simply lent us the 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if there had been no interference in the matter—I tried to explain that he was really talking without his book, and did not understand himself—I must deny that I said I was going to give 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the estate, and that Mr. Rowland "let the cat out of the bag," that I was only going to give 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that it was then declined—I assure you there is more truth in my mouth than there ever was in Mr. Rowland's, and I think you must have found that out—Mr. Cross showed the valuation to Captain Fitzhenry—I have a letter from Captain Fitzhenry wondering why I did not take the money—you shall have everything I can oblige you with; I shall have it directly, I think, only these things come so awkwardly, you know—this letter is from Captain Fitzhenry, but it has nothing to do with the matter; it is addressed to Mr. Cross—take it by all means; you shall have all I have if you can make anything out of them—I should like to find the letter where Captain Fitzhenry writes wondering why I did not take the money—he wrote to me on several occasions from The Shawe—the reason why I did not accept some portion of the 26,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was simply that I fully believed, and believe now, that the estate is worth a considerable sum more than I agreed to pay for it, and considering then I had what I may call a fortune in my own hands I did not intend to fool it away—you have heard, I think, before that in consequence of some interference on the part of Mr. Henry the Captain volunteered to take from Moore and Henry 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which they could have got from Harwood, who was sent down to make the valuation and to develop the estate himself, and all he endeavoured to do was to throw me over. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you whether this conversation did not take place between the prisoner, yourself, and Rowland when you were at the 16th May interview? Did Mr. Rowland ask Mr. Dean how it was to be done, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> how the estate was to be purchased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is a tissue of lies from beginning to end, he never said anything of the sort—Mr. Dean did not go on to say, "I have clients who will find the money you want, they will find the money on mortgage, but will not purchase it themselves," nothing of the kind. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is wilful and corrupt perjury on the part of Mr. Rowland? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no, Mr. Rowland has evidently gone into some other hands and forgotten himself—about March, 1884, I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190058"/>
               <p>another contract in hand through Messrs. Dean and Son to purchase land at Burgess Hill—it was not for 12,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not quite at the same time as these negotiations were going on—after we found we could get the money Rowland informed me of this matter near Brighton, and that he should like to go down and look at it—we purchased it on the same system and on the same understanding without any idea of deposit—if Captain Fitzhenry had come to me and said "Mr. Groome, you have not found me any one," he could have taken his money back, but when he alleged fraud it was another matter—I find I have not that letter from Captain Fitzhenry with me, but should it come in course of practice I will very soon get at it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Spring Grove, Isleworth, In 1884 I was possessed of part of my father's estate at Burgess Hill, near Brighton, which I was desirous of selling—I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> and received this letter from Dean and Son. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "May 23rd, 1884. Dear Sir,—We are likely to be able to find you a purchaser for the whole of your land at Burgees Hill if you are prepared to take a fair price for it. Please let us know what is the lowest price for it, exclusive of the residence, and let us have plan showing the whole. Yours truly, Dean and Son.") I replied by letter, and in consequence of a communi<lb/>cation from Dean, I think I saw them at their office—I signed this memorandum—it is dated 21st May, 1884: "To Messrs. Dean and Son, 60, Finsbury Pavement, London. I hereby authorise you to negotiate a mortgage for me on my 30 acres freehold land, &amp;c., at Burgess Hill, exclusive of the residence, let at 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, for 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at not a higher rate of interest than from 4 1/2 to 5 per cent., and on your securing the same for me I agree to pay you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission. No charge to be made, excepting three guineas for survey and said mortgage." That is signed by me—this is the next document, which is dated 26th May, to Dean and Son: "I hereby place my freehold estate, of about 30 acres of land at Burgess Hill in your hands for disposal, &amp;c." I afterwards received a letter from them which I have not got—they named a pur<lb/>chaser when I went to see them—I went to see them again in conse<lb/>quence of a letter, and they told me that they had obtained purchasers and I asked who they were, and they said they were Messrs. Groome and Rowland—then I asked whether they were responsible people—I think the younger Dean was present—Dean said "We have known them a considerable time, and sold them an estate or estates before; they are large contractors"—across this document, dated June 17th, I wrote: "I agree to the terms. (Signed) William Doubleday"—I received it from Dean—may I add that when it was given to me I said I should require a deposit of 10 per cent. if he sold it to them, and he said 10 per cent. was too high, but 5 per cent. would be a fair thing, to which I agreed, and also said "Do not sell to these men or make an agreement with them without you make it the subject of a contract"—I wrote the above words—this document is dated June 17th, 1884: "To Messrs. Dean and Son, 60, Finsbury Pavement, London. Gentlemen,—We beg to offer you the sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per acre for the 32 acres of freehold building land, belong<lb/>ing to Mr. W. V. Doubleday, being the residue of the Burgess Hill Park Estate, Burgess Hill, Surrey. We are, gentlemen, yours very truly, Groome and Rowland." [<hi rend="smallCaps">GROOME:</hi> This is my signature at the bottom.] "To Messrs. Dean and Son. I desire you to accept Messrs.</p>

               <p>Groome and Rowland's offer of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre for my freehold building land, Burgess Hill, Surrey, comprising 32 acres, or thereabouts. June, 1884. (Signed) W. V. Doubleday." I did not hear anything of them for some time after June 18th, though I called occasionally from time to time to know how they were getting on—they intimated several times they were progressing, but I lost my confidence in them to tell you the truth—on one occasion when I called, after June 18th, Dean spoke to me about my giving a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards his commission, as he was short of money—I was indignant at it; I thought it an insult—I wrote to them on or about 20th June, and it was not returned to me through the dead letter office: "June 20th. Will you kindly send to Messrs. Rye and Eyre particular of the arrangements entered into between us, &amp;c. To Messrs. Dean and Son." In consequence of inquiries I instructed my solicitors to take steps to have the contract rescinded, and the matter was set aside—that was about July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by John Marsh Dean.</hi> I think the offer was made in writing on June 17th by Groome alone—you sent me that offer—I wrote you to accept it—I particularly mentioned the deposit to you at the time—perhaps the offer was written by Groome and Rowland—I wrote across agreeing to the terms, and then told you that I should expect a deposit of 10 per cent, which you demurred to, and then I agreed to 5 per cent.—you wrote out a memorandum at your office, and I signed it then and there—there is nothing about 5 per cent. in writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe I am telling the truth when I say it was before that I had a conversation with Dean as to the deposit, because I parti<lb/>cularly put the question to him, "Are these responsible men?"—he said "Oh yes; I have sold them an estate before; they are large contractors"—that satisfied me, and then I requested a deposit—I looked upon Dean as a sort of agent of mine, and I told him that he was not to do this without making it the subject of a contract—he knew I wanted a deposit before I signed that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> The matter fell through and you never made any claim upon me for commission—you put me to a great deal of annoyance and expense—you wanted to get a bill out of me—I did not like your treatment—I made inquiries about you—it was of course to your interest to complete the purchase and earn your commission.</p>

Hamphreys, giving us notice that they were instructed to act for the Captain both in this and the common-law action, and asking us at the same time to allow the common-law action to stand over—you have always been most ready and willing to go on; you were most anxious to get the charge disposed of—notice was given that you would hold the parties responsible for malicious prosecution in September, 1884—I have the answer here: "26, Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. 26th September, 1884. Dear Sir—Fitzhenry and Dean,—I am in receipt of your favour of yesterday. It is unnecessary to enter into discussion now on the ground of my client's proceedings. That is specially a matter for magisterial inquiry. Under the present circumstances I must decline accepting service of any process whatever on behalf of my client, but leave Messrs. Dean and Son to fill up the full measure of their conduct in the way they deem best. Yours truly, C. M. Vosper. To W. Bennett, Esq., 1 and 2, Chiswell Street."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, surveyor, and land and estate agent, and have carried on business at Finsbury Square for the last ten or twelve years, and previously for many years at No. 7—I have a very large practice. (<hi rend="italic">The following document read:</hi> "Messrs. Dean and Son, 60, Finsbury Pavement, London, 30th November, 1883. I herewith hand you five guineas to cover your cost of survey of my freehold estate at Ashstead, Surrey, comprising residence, and about forty acres of land, and I undertake in the event of your finding me a purchaser for the sum of 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I will pay you a commission of 2 1/2 per cent. on that sum, or any less sum I may hereafter agree to accept for the property; but should a purchaser be found by you at any higher sum, in that event I agree to divide the difference with you between 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and such higher sum obtained, it being understood and agreed that the higher price obtained shall not exclude payment of commission less than 2 1/2 per cent. on 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is to be payable by me in any event.") It is addressed to Dean and Son—I know nothing about it—supposing it had been addressed to me I would have considered myself entitled to the full commission, and I should take the ordinary steps to look about to find a purchaser, and to get the best I could—if I did not sell I should not earn my commission—I should introduce it to likely buyers—I do not consider it part of my duty to inquire as to the means of the parties to complete the purchase—the duty of an auctioneer or sur<lb/>veyor is to see that the contract, approved by the vendor or his solicitor, be duly signed and a deposit paid over—there are such cases as a contract being signed without a deposit being paid—they are not so frequent, and as a rule we endeavour to obtain a deposit, but I have got many cases in my office of sales where deposits have not been paid—thirty years ago there were no deposits paid on private sales in the Court of Chancery, as a rule—the practice is, of course, to receive a deposit—it is ear-marked and ready at any moment—there is a lien on it for our commission and costs—that is the only way we "stick to it."</p>

I should expect a deposit according to the amount of the purchase-money—if it is under 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10 per cent., and perhaps over that 5 per cent.—that is sales by auction, but there is no absolute rule—it is a rule that on the contract being signed in the auction room a deposit be paid of 10 per cent. or 5 per cent.—I would not take a contract without a deposit, unless my employer, the solicitor, said I was to do so—by private treaty the vendors and their solicitors do not insist on deposits—I should assuredly consider myself entitled to my commission if the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

An agent is entitled to his commission when and so soon as the purchase is completed—<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> so soon as the solicitor of the purchaser is satisfied with the title and the balance of the purchaser's money is handed over—I should not be entitled to it until then, except in a hypothetical case such as the Juryman put to me, where a contract is cancelled behind my back, and then I should expect my commission—it is unusual to prepare a contract without inserting a clause that a deposit shall be paid, but there are many cases where in sales of land and houses it has been arranged by the owner that a deposit need not be paid—as a rule, it is invariable to pay a deposit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> There are exceptions, and I have cases in my office, but they hang about longer—no solicitor would allow a contract to be entered into where the agreement was that the money should be raised on mortgage, instead of being paid down in the ordinary way, and I should not without the express authority of the vendor in writing—sup<lb/>posing the vendor and purchaser agreed, then it would be their act, and not mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Supposing a vendor came to me, being willing to sell his estate without a deposit, and being willing to enter into a contract without a date, the object being to give the purchaser an opportunity to raise the money on mortgage, then I should feel it my duty to point out to the vendor the grave risk he ran—I should say "It will be better for you to consult your solicitor," and I should see that that happened, but if the vendor said "I am satisfied," I do not know that I should go out of my way to decline business—it is irregular, Mr. Dean, it is unusual; it might be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Solicitors are invariably employed in my business, and, in fact, I should decline business if there were no solicitor—the case I put of no solicitor was only hypothetical—it is the invariable practice that there should be a solicitor on the vendor's side—some sign a contract and pay a deposit without consulting us when they are dealing with large estates realising 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as a matter of fact, the name of an intending purchaser is not necessarily disclosed—the rule is, we have an offer of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. say, and when I take it to the solicitor he says "Yes," and the draft contract is sent to the vendor's solicitor, and so on, but if it is proposed not to pay a deposit then the solicitor of the vendor comes into the responsibility, and so on—I mean that I should use some circumspection as to who I was dealing with.</p>

I am an auctioneer, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Chislehurst, and Kensington, and have carried on business nearly 21 years—if a property were placed in my hands I should offer it to persons likely to purchase, and if I received an offer it would be my duty to communicate it to the vendor, and on bringing the vendor and purchaser together I should arrange terms with the purchaser if I were instructed by the vendor as his agent—in regard to the practice I should say if a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> auctioneer introduced a vendor to a purchaser, and they entered into the sale themselves, and it were a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> transaction, the agent would certainly be entitled to his commission—supposing a vendor to raise the purchase money on mortgage, and then afterwards to interfere to prevent the purchase being carried out, I should certainly consider myself entitled to my commission if the transaction were <hi rend="italic">bond fide.</hi>

On a sale by auction the solicitor always prepares the conditions of sale and stipulates for the payment of a deposit, and then the auctioneer has no further duty than to take the deposit and sign the contract on behalf of the vendor, the purchase to be completed on a certain date—I do not prepare private contracts for sale in my office; that is the province of a solicitor, except a preliminary contract to be the subject of a contract prepared by the solicitor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do a good business—in a case similar to this, I think after the offer was made I should have submitted it to the vendor, and perhaps I might have entered into a preliminary agreement with the intending purchaser, the contract to follow by the solicitor.</p>

From what Richardson told me I went to the back of his premises and through his back window on to some garden walls adjoining Mr. Rooney's premises—I saw a skylight of very thick glass broken; a person falling from the wall above may have broken it—I sent Batchelor down and remained on the top—I made a further examination with my lamp, and I found some one had gone down the other side, from the marks on the wall at the back of Mr. Rooney's premises—I was still on the top—I went through Mr. Young's premises, and in a back yard I found Fogherty in a closet, shut in—I said to him "What are you doing here?"—he said "All right, governor, I'm only having a sleep"—I took him to the station, went back, and found Mr. Rooney's place had been broken into on the first-floor back—the glass and framework of the window were broken—I found these two rifles and cases laid on the stone coping just outside the window, and five yards from another skylight, which was not broken—a pile of two dozen rifles were in the room, of the same kind as these.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 868). On this Sunday morning, shortly before 1 o'clock, I was watching Mr. Rooney's warehouse—from information I received from Collins I went to the back of the Welbeck public-house, Vine Street, and through a first-floor window, and on a low building at the rear of 95, Minories, occupied by Mr. Bunting, a pianoforte-maker, I there saw a skylight broken—I procured a short ladder, got through the hole that had been broken in the glass, and found Arnold concealed in a small closet under the staircase at the rear of 95, Minories—I asked him what he was doing there, he said he was running away from a man who had hit him on the head, and he had fallen through the skylight—I took him to the station.</p>

I am a sailor—I life at Doddington Terrace, Lilliput Road, Canning Town—on 10th October, about 8.15, I was in Canning Town, about half-way between the Tidal Basin and Barking Station—I was wearing a watch chain and a silver hunter lever watch in my left waistcoat pocket—I felt a tug at my watch chain, and saw the prisoner's hand with the watch in it—he let it go, and it dropped into my hand—it</p>

I live at Park Street, St. Albans, with my mother and sister—I am 19 years of age—on 10th June this year I was at Harpenden Races with my sister Martha and Miss Harding—we met two men there; I had not known them before—the prisoner is one of them—he first spoke to Miss Harding—I was not with them at the moment, I was a little distance on—I saw him speak to her; he afterwards got into convention with me—Miss Harding introduced me; she said "This is Miss Dickerson"—she did not give me his name—he stayed in my company for some little time; the conversation was chiefly about the horses and other matters—the other man was there too—after that we were all together, us three and the two men; we walked about—after the races we met the two men in the evening; they did not go with us; we left them there, and we drove home with some friends to St. Albans—we met them again in the evening by appointment; they made the appointment—we walked with them—we saw them against the Town Hall and went out to them—I had some conversation with the prisoner that evening—his name was given on the racecourse; it was written on a paper by the other man, Frederick Deane; the prisoner was present—Deane put down his own name and address on a piece of paper, and put the prisoner's underneath it—I did not ask them for their address; they offered it—Deane wrote his name and address for Miss Harding, and then wrote the prisoner's under it—I don't know whether the prisoner saw him write it, he was close by—I did not see the prisoner again till I had a letter from him; it is destroyed—after that I addressed him by the same that was written down—I saw him on the following Sunday—I then addressed him as Macdonald; that was the same signed in the letter, James Macdonald—when I addressed him as Macdonald he answered me—I don't think he mentioned who or what he was—he said afterwards that he had a business—I saw him altogether about three or four times, and was in his company for some time for about a month—he came down to St. Albans, chiefly on Sunday—I also saw him in London; I went to the theatre with him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The other man was broader and darker, rather darker, not much, and he was a little taller; he had not got so much hair on his face—I do not remember his dress—I heard Macdonald's voice and the prisoner's, there was a resemblance—Macdonald ordered the fire about 8 o'clock as near as I can say—I was first asked to recollect about this man Macdonald, who had been there at Easter, last month—I think it was August; it was shortly before the last trial—I was present at the last trial, but was not called.</p>

I am a coachsmith, of 12, Richmond Street, Ken<lb/>nington Road—about mid-day on 8th September I met the prisoners at the Prince Alfred public-house—I had some conversation with them, and afterwards went to my home with them—we had some more liquor, and Norris was put to bed, as he was so drunk—we had some tea in the front room—my wife came in, and I came downstairs and went into the back<lb/>yard for a while, and Matthews gave my wife a pair of ear-rings, and Israel gave her a brooch as I entered the room, and handed a watch to me—I afterwards went with them to my mother-in-law, with the inten<lb/>tion of going to the theatre—I gave the watch to a man to be repaired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Israel.</hi> Matthews spoke to me first—I did not buy the watch—I did not give Matthews half a sovereign for it—I did not ask if you would go with me to Lambeth—you are a stranger to me—I did not say I would dispose of the articles and get more than Matthews could—when we left the public-house we went along Oxford Street and had some drink—we did not get on an omnibus at the corner of Regent's Circus—my mother-in-law pawned the chain—she did not call on some one else to pawn a watch and chain—you did not gave my wife a locket.</p>

On 22nd Sep<lb/>tember I received information from Leeson about a bale of goods—I was instructed to go to Poplar to look into the matter—I saw the canvas pro<lb/>duced round one roll of cloth; there are two rolls to a truss—I weighed the roll; it weighed 1 cwt.—the weight marked and entered was 1 c. 3 qr. 12lb.—I saw the canvas would hold another roll—after making inquiries, I communicated with Inspector Read, of the Thames Police, and we went up the river to Hermitage tier, and there saw the barge Autumn attached to the Vesta, lying in the river, and loaded with oil—we saw the prisoner; he lives in the barge—we searched it; it was about 1.30 we saw some tarpaulin in the hold—the inspector asked the prisoner "What is that down there?"—he said "Bundles of sacks"—I got down into the hold and turned the tarpaulins over; another officer opened one bundle of about 20 Great Eastern sacks—this sack was tied up with a piece of tarred string—I opened that and found the cloth—the sack was outside the cabin-door—I could not open the door, not without moving it—the prisoner said he had not left the barge since 11 the previous night—I went afterwards to Poplar and searched—I had 15 yards of similar cloth handed to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames Police Inspector</hi>). I went to Hermitage tier with Topple between 1 and 2 on the afternoon of the 22nd September—I said to the prisoner "Are you master of this barge?"—he said "Yes"—I said "What have you got in it?"—he said "Casks of oil"—I said "Where are you from?"—he said "From the Collier Dock"—I said "Have you got anything liable to duty, or that does not belong to you?"—he said "No"—I said "I am a police officer and officer of Customs, and I am going to search"—I went into the fore-cabin and searched—I found only some malt in a sack—I came back and said "Now are you sure you have got nothing in the barge that does not belong to you?"—he said "There is nothing here but what belongs to me and my master"—I then walked with the prisoner and Topple and another officer along the deck to the after cabin—the other officer walked over the casks of oil which were uncovered—I pointed to the tarpaulin, and said "What is there there?"—he said "Bundles of empty sacks"—Selby, the other constable, and Topple turned the tarpaulins back; they were partly folded up, and Selby opened the first bundle, and felt in and said "These are sacks"—I pointed to the other bundle and said "That is not empty sacks"—Topple opened the sack, and put his hand in and said "This is the cloth," and pulled it out—I said to the prisoner "Halloa! how do you account for this?"—he hesitated, and then said "I did not know it was there"—I took him to the station, and he was charged.</p>

On 7th October, about 9 p.m., I took Haley and another man—I told Haley he would be charged with stealing a watch-chain from a man named Carey in the street at Bethnal Green—he said "You have made a mistake; I do not know anything about it"—I took him to the station, and Humphreys identified him from several others as the one who threw Carey down, and Carey identified him next morning from 7 or 8 others; he also picked out another man, who he said he thought was one of the three—we had picked the men out of the street.</p>

I am a butcher—Goldberg's sister is in my service—about three weeks before Czernechowski was arrested Goldberg called at my house one night and took out a lot of papers, and said "I hope I shall do well with these papers, but unfortunately to-day I did not meet the Russian Consul, I met the clerk; they do not promise any reward until you show something, and then you may get something"—I did not answer.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 9, Bath Terrace, Trinity Square—on 8th July, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in Mans<lb/>field Street, Borough, going home—I stayed for a necessary purpose against a brick wall in Mansfield Street—I was about to go on my way when I was suddenly attacked and thrown down, and the prisoners were on top of me—I called out "Help" and "Police"—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in my pocket, and a watch—one of them said "How dare you make water over me?"—that was untrue, I had not seen them—the other tried to put his hand into my right trousers pocket, where the gold was—a constable came up, and I was immediately rescued—my hat was knocked off, and my wrist severely sprained; I was thrown down in trying to protect myself—I had had a glass, that is all—I was sober, but very much terrified and excited—there is a lamp near—I was on the ground not more than a minute.</p>

I am the wife of James Carter, of Royal Oak Passage, Huntingdon—my maiden name was Woods—the prisoner is my sister—I have been married about twelve months, and before my marriage I lived with my father near Huntingdon—before the birth of my sister's child she was in the service of Mr. Waley—she was confined in July, 1879, and the child was named Ellen Saddington Woods—the father's name was Saddington—he was a potman—my sister nursed the child at first, and then left it in the care of my mother, and then went out to service again, near Croydon, and then she went back to Mr. Whaley's—in January, 1885, she came down home, and took the child away with her, and in June, 1885, she made an application to me that I should take the child—I agreed to take it, and the child came to me in the care of a railway guard, and I took care of it up to Thursday, 13th</p>

I live at 16, Lamb's Conduit Street—I know the prisoner and the child Nelly—the prisoner was employed at a public-house in Limb's Conduit Street—I remember Thursday, 27th August, when the prisoner came in and spoke to me—Mrs. Watson was there—the prisoner did not say anything till Mrs. Button spoke, and then she said to me "Will you take the child for a day or two, or perhaps a week, or perhaps a little longer?"—she told me where the child was; she said that she was then going to fetch her out of the workhouse—I agreed to take the child, and she went away, as I thought to fetch the child on the same day, Thursday—she came back without the child, and said that she had been to the workhouse and that the child was ill in the infirmary, but that they would endeavour to bring it back to the workhouse the same night—she asked me if I would go to the workhouse in Gray's Inn Road next day and get the child, and I said that I would—she said that she would pay me, and she did pay me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before she went to the workhouse—she also paid me a shilling for my trouble, and gave me an envelope to take to the workhouse to show, when I got the child—the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to keep the child for a week—on Friday, the 28th, I got the child at the workhouse, and brought it away and took it to my house, and it stayed with me till Monday, 7th September—I wrote to her on a Saturday, I do not know whether it was the 5th September; no, I have made a mistake, it was on a Thursday I wrote to her—I found the child a trouble, and I wrote to the prisoner and got this answer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her.

I am the wife of Isaac Barber, of Beulah Terrace, Clifton Road, Croydon—on Tuesday morning, 8th September, at 7 o'clock, I was getting up, and looked out at my window and saw a child lying on the grass in a field at the back of the house—I could not see its face at first—I called a neighbour, a lodger of mine, and we went into the field, and there saw this little child lying on the grass on her side—I saw something fastened round her neck; it was a white diaper; it was tied round—the bottom part of the child had clothing on, but not the upper part—she had stockings and a petticoat and drawers, but she had no frock, shoes, or hat—I got a blanket and wrapped her in it, and carried her into the house and put her on a sofa—I sent for the police and a doctor; that was Dr. Fleming—her neck was bleeding, and it had a diaper applied to it—I saw that the child's throat had been cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at St. Olave's Chambers, southwark—on the 3rd August I was at Croydon Races, and after the races I was walking to the town—there were a good many vehicles coming along the road—I saw the deceased man on a cab, going in the opposite direction to me, that is, from Croydon towards the race course—it was about 4 o'clock—the deceased held up his hand and halloaed out to a cab to halt—I saw the prisoner draw his cab up, but the cabs were coming very quick behind his, and he ran into the deceased—he was going at the rate of about 12 or 13 miles an hour just before that; it was a sharp trot—when the deceased held up his hand, the prisoner tried to stop his horse, but the cab behind would have run into him if he had stopped—the effect of his going on was that the fore-wheel of his cab caught the fore-wheel of the deceased's cab, and the deceased was thrown off on his shoulder on the footway, and the cab fell on him immediately afterwards—I ran to his assistance, but Mr. Wick was there before me; the man was dead then—I have been used to horses for about five years, I drove for Mr. Clarke, of Kennington—in my opinion the prisoner could not have got out of the way; I do not think he could.</p>

The deceased's cab was on its right side—he was out<lb/>side the row of cabs which was going in an opposite direction, going from Croydon (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to a plan</hi>)—here is Croydon, and the prisoner's cab was on his left, that was his proper side—the deceased was also on his proper side—the prisoner was in the centre of the road; he was not on the near side, because there were two or three rows of cabs there moving in a continual stream—he did not pull up and stop; because there were a lot of cabs coming behind him very fast—just before he tried to pass through he touched his horse under the flank—he could not have stopped farther back, because he was close on to the cab when the deceased shouted—this was just before 5 o'clock; there was a good light—the deceased was coming at a walking pace, and on his right side.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BROMLEY</hi>. When I saw the deceased's cab I was about 35 yards in front of him, coming towards it on the race course side—I saw the deceased hold up his hand; at that time there were not one or two cabs before him, there was nothing before him; I am positive of that—I can hardly say what the width of the road is, I did not take that notice—the deceased's cab was coming the same way as the defendant's cab—they were all on the left-hand side of the way, going towards Croydon—there is a tramway in the centre of the road, and some were in the centre of the tramway—I did not notice a tram car coming along, at the time I saw the deceased; the whole thing was done in a very short time—it was not so much as two or three minutes from the time it commenced to the time the deceased was killed, and as soon as the collision took place the deceased was thrown off the box of his cab;</p>

               <p>the prisoner was also thrown off the box of his cab; they were both thrown off—I had not time to see what the space was between the deceased's cab and the other cabs which were standing by the tramway but it was about the width of a four-wheeler—the cab was upset by the collision, and the horses were struggling and kicking together, and threw the cab on the deceased.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined.</hi> There was nothing in front of the prisoner's cab when the collision took place; he was passing a number of cabs to the left of it—it did not seem to me that the prisoner could have done anything which he did not do; I should have tried to get through if I had been in his place.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with the prisoner as his wife for three years last April—on Saturday, 1st August, about 2 p.m., I had some words with the prisoner, who was going to sell my jacket—he was in the street, and I forbade his selling it and said, "If you sell it I will go to the police-station and demand it back again"—I kept out of his way until the evening, when I was against the Barleymow public-house—I went outside the Black Lion to speak to another woman, when the prisoner came up to me and walked away against the Black Lion door—the two houses are close to each other, one being a beershop and the other a public-house—he stood by the side of me, and did not speak to me, but plunged a penknife into my neck—I did not see where he got it from, and I have not seen it here—it felt like a knife in my neck, it was so quick—he would not have done it if he had not been in drink—he went straight into the lodging-house—I was then taken to the police-station, and afterwards to the infirmary, where I remained till the Saturday, as the hearing was on the 12th—I am quite well now; there is a small scar—we had not been drinking together that day—he got</p>

I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons—I saw the prosecutrix on the night in question, when she was suffering from a wound on the throat on the left side—it was about one and a half inches, to the best of my recollection, below the ear, and about on a level with the angle of the jaw—it was almost horizontal, extending about one inch in length, and not more than half an inch in depth—it was dangerous from its position—I believe it divided the external jugular—of course that is not so important a vessel as the internal jugular—if the knife had penetrated half an inch farther it would have wounded the main vessels, namely, the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery.</p>

There was hemorrhage, and it had been aggravated by the bystanders applying a lot of cloths, which I at once removed—I believe the wound to have been inflicted by a penknife—it was a puncture at the beginning—I believe it was dug in, and then worked its way out—I should say he turned the knife round in the wound—there was not a very considerable amount of force used, because it was not more than half an inch at the greatest depth—I believe she had imbibed a certain portion of drink; I could not say for certain—of course the loss of blood would cause excitement; she lost a considerable quantity, I am sure—she is perfectly out of danger now—I examined her body, and found two considerable bruises, one on the shoulder, and the other near the hip—I believe them to be recent, because I saw the woman a few days subse<lb/>quently, and they had developed considerably.</p>

I was 13 years old last April—up to the beginning of June last I was living with my father, Charles, and mother, Elizabeth Armstrong, at 32, Charles Street, Lisson Grove—my eldest sister Eliza<lb/>beth is 17; she was out at service—I have three little brothers, aged 11, 7, and 4—my father is a chimney-sweep—we had all been living at the same address for many years—I used to nurse and look after the youngest child, a baby—I attended at the Board school, and can read and write—I know Mrs. Broughton, who lived with her husband at No. 37 in the same street—on the 2nd June a little girl told me some one wanted a servant,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190139"/>
               <p>and I went to Mrs. Broughton's house—Mrs. Broughton and the prisoner Jarrett, whom I had not seen before, were there—Mrs. Broughton asked me whether my mother would let me go out to service—I said I would go and ask my mother—I did so; my mother came up and went with me to Mrs. Broughton's—Jarrett was still there—she asked my mother if she would let me go to service—mother asked her whereabouts she lived—I understood her to say Wimbledon—mother asked why she could not get another girl where she lived—Jarrett said she could do so, but she thought a poor girl would like to go to a home where she lived—I don't know if she said home or service—mother asked her what to do—she said to scrub and to clean oilcloth, because she could not kneel, and she would do the dusting and the other part of the work—I afterwards saw she was lame—my mother said "No," and went away—Jarrett said she had a French girl as a servant, who wanted to go home to her mother, and she thought she would let her go—I went home with my mother, leaving Mrs. Broughton and Jarrett together—I did not see them again that day—the next day was the Derby Day—I saw my mother with Mrs. Broughton about 11 on the morning of Wednesday (Derby Day), 3rd June—my mother told me something when she came back which Mrs. Broughton had said to her, and I went with her to Mrs. Broughton's—Mrs. Jarrett was there—she asked mother if I had any nice clothes to go in—mother said I had not; Jarrett said she would buy me some, because her husband was a particular man—Jarrett told me to go home, wash myself, and get myself all ready, and I was to go along with her to buy some clothes—I went home, my mother went with me—after<lb/>wards wards I came back to Mrs. Broughton's—Mrs. Jarrett was there, and put on her things, and went with me to the boot-shop at the corner of Charles Street—up to that time I had not heard what Jarrett's name was—while going to the boot-shop she said I should like going into her service very much—she then took me into several shops, and bought various articles of clothing for me—she paid for them and brought them with her—we went back to Mrs. Broughton's, where I put on my new clothes—nothing further was said by Jarrett, nothing was said about what my wages were to be—I went home for about an hour, and had dinner there—I had left Mrs. Jarrett trimming my new hat at Mrs. Broughton's—the other clothes I had got on—when I went home to dinner I saw my mother—I don't remember whether I saw my father—after<lb/>wards I went back to Mrs. Broughton's, at about 2 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—my mother did not go with me—I saw Jarrett in the room, and she said she was going to start at 3 o'clock—I stayed there till 3—I had seen my mother at the door, and kissed her before I came away—my mother said she would see me off—at 3 o'clock she was to meet me in Mrs. Broughton's room—I waited at Mrs. Broughton's about an hour, till 3 o'clock, when Mrs. Jarrett said it was time to go—I was then all dressed ready to start, with the hat on which Jarrett had trimmed—Jarrett, Mrs. Broughton, and I went out together—nothing was said about mother not having come back—when we started Mrs. Broughton and Jarrett went into a public-house—I waited outside—Jarrett and I got into an omnibus at the corner of Chapel Street—my mother told me she was going some<lb/>where—I had said nothing about that to Jarrett—I said good-bye to Mrs. Broughton—we got out of the omnibus past the Marble Arch, and went to a house I know now as 16, Albany Street—that was a private</p>

The two men had gone into that house—Jarrett and I went upstairs into a front bedroom—Mr. Jacques was one of the two men who were outside and who went in—I did not see who the other was then—I have no doubt of Jaques—I saw him again when I returned from France; I knew him then—when I got into the bedroom the men came into the room—the men had something to drink in the next room—Jarrett also had something to drink in the same room as I was; the drink was something brown—she asked me if I would go to bed—I said I did not want to go to bed yet—Jarrett gave me a picture book, and said we would stay there that night, because she lived in a place a long way off, and it would take a very long time to get there—she did not say where we were to go in the morning—Jarrett asked me again to go to bed, and I did so; I undressed and got into bed—Jarrett did not undress, she said she was waiting up for the young lady to come home—afterwards Jarrett lay down outside the bed with her clothes on by my side—she put a handkerchief up to my note; I threw it away—she put it again to my nose, and said, "Give a good sniff up"—I said I would not have it, and threw it away—Jarrett said it was scent; it had a nasty smell—I was still awake afterwards—the door opened and some one came in—I could tell by the sound, I could not see because the curtains were round the bed—there was a lamp in the room—when the door opened Jarrett was off the bed and outside the curtains—she said, "She is all right," or something like that—I heard a man's voice, but I did not hear what was said—I screamed out, "There is a man in the room"—the man went away when I screamed out, and shut the door after him—Jarrett said "What is the matter?"—I said "There is a man in the room"—Jarrett pulled up the curtains and said "There is no man in the room"—I said "Because he is gone out"—I saw there was no one in the room when the curtains were pulled up by Jarrett—Jarrett left the room and returned in two or three minutes, saying "Get up and dress, there are too many men in this house"—that was about 1 o'clock—we had been in the house an hour—I did not see a clock or any<lb/>thing—I got up and dressed—she put her hat and jacket on, went out of the room and downstairs—I saw nothing of the two men, Jacques and the other—we got into a cab which was waiting outside the house, and a man who I do not know got on the box seat—the cab drove to some house, where the man got off the box and went in—Jarrett and I waited at the door inside the cab for an hour—after that the man came out and said to Jarrett "You can sleep here to-night"—Jarrett said "All right"—we got out of the cab and went into the house—before I was last examined at Bow Street I went to this house, which is No. 27, Not<lb/>tingham Place—I know it is the same house; it is a nicely furnished private house—Jarrett and I went into a bedroom, undressed, and went to bed—she slept on a sofa; I on the bed—Jarrett said nothing to me about our stopping there that night—I went to sleep—I go up the next morning—I cannot say whether any one came into the room; no one came in while I was awake—next morning I got up to breakfast—while at breakfast Mrs. Combe, whom I then saw for the first time, and the young lady who had changed hats with Jarrett at Albany Street, came—Mrs. Combe asked me if I should like to go to a place along with her—I said "No"—Jarrett and Mrs. Combe went out of the room together, leaving me there—I was sitting crying when Jarrett and Mrs. Combe</p>

I am very happy. The 'Captain' is very good to me. Mrs. Combe is going away for a little time. She is gone about her business. She is soon coming back again. I hope you are going on all right. I have asked the Lord to bless you every night, and I hope you are soon coming to see me. I am getting on all right. I has plenty to eat an drink, and if you would write me a little letter it would be very pleasant to have one from you; and I hope I shall be able to go and see my mother soon and my little brothers and sisters. The 'Captain' is going away for two months, and I am going to be a good girl while she is gone. Well, that is all I got to say at present. Good-bye, and God bless you for my sake. As I was lying in my bed, some little thoughts came in my head; I thought of one, I thought of two, but first of all I thought of you. I received this answer to that letter: "Hope Cottage, Highcliff, Winchester. My dear Child,—I received your beautiful letter, which I had been longing to get from you, but I forget the address, and Mrs. Combe promised to write to me about you, so I was expecting to hear from you. I am not coming to see you, but you are coming to me. A lady has got to bring you straight to me. You are to come to my little cottage, but you are to see your mother and father; but you are God's child, and I hope that you are trying to be</p>

SULLIVAN."</hi> Mrs. Combe remained in Paris about a week, and then left saying she would not be long, and was going on business for two or three days—she said nothing about writing before she left—I remained in Paris about four weeks—then Mrs. Combe's son, "Lieutenant" Combe, took me away—he is a Frenchman, but spoke English; he is about 25 years of age—we started at 8 p.m.; no one else was with us, and no one saw us off—we travelled all night, and next day arrived at Loriol—he took me to the house of M. and Madame Berard—there were some children there, and an English governess, Miss Fielder—"Lieutenant" Combe stayed there that night, and left next day—I was employed as a servant there—a few days after I arrived I received a letter from "Lieutenant" Combe, who had said he would write to me; the date is 19th July—on 22nd July I wrote this letter to my mother; the English governess addressed the envelope—at the same time I wrote to Madame Combe—both letters were put in one envelope by Madame Berard, addressed to Madame Combe—I did not see this enve<lb/>lope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) addressed to my mother—in the letter to my mother there was no address given, in consequence of a letter I received from Madame Combe—I did not get any answer for some time. (<hi rend="italic">The letter from the witness to her mother was then read, stating that she was very happy and had a good place, which was a long way in France, she had good food to eat, and all she wanted. It again ended:</hi> "As I was lying in my bed, &amp;c," <hi rend="italic">as ✗b fore.</hi>) I afterwards received this letter from my mother, the day before I was going away.

"And let me know where that woman took you to when you left me to go to service," &amp;c. "And how you came to know those little rhymes you wrote in your letter.") I was then at Plaines de Bec, a little way from Loriol, where M. Berard had a country house—afterwards I went back to Loriol—I wrote another letter to my mother while at Plaines de Bec—Miss Fielder wrote part of it for me and the envelope. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read; the post-mark was 14th August</hi>). I re<lb/>turned to Loriol the day after the letter was written—while I was there two gentlemen came for me; "Captain" Baby of the Salvation "Army" was one of them—Miss Fielder told me to get ready to go—we had some dinner before we left—when I saw the two gentlemen I cried—I went with them by train as far as Arras, and then to Paris—I cried because I did not know what the men were going to do with me at first—I went back to the head quarters of the Salvation "Army," where I saw Miss Booth and Miss Green—Miss Green brought me back to England, where I arrived on Sunday, 23rd August—she was the cook—I was taken to Mr. Stead's house at Wimbledon—he asked me to go into the garden to pick some flowers, and asked whether I liked the place where I went to, and whether I was sick on the water—Mr. Jacques came into the garden and asked if I should like to go to a place, it was better than going to a drunken home—he said he would take me to a gentle<lb/>man's family near the Bayswater Road—I said "I will see what my mother says"—he asked me whether I should like to go and see my mother—I</p>

Except what the French lady did in Milton Street, nothing was done to distress or vex me—the handkerchief put to my nose annoyed me, but it had no effect on me—I pushed it away—Madame Combe was very kind to me—I was very happy in my place, and was comfortably clad and fed—I never saw Mrs. Jarrett before a lot of my schoolmates came to me on 2nd June, about 3 p.m., and told me she was looking for a girl—I did not know her name till I got to Paris, nor did my father or mother—I was not told that Jarrett had seen three other little girls at Mrs. Broughton's—my mother told me on the Tuesday that the strange lady had seen Alice West, who was too old; she was 15—she lived in the same house as my father and mother, with Mrs. Wood<lb/>ward—when I came home I understood that the strange lady had also seen a girl named Jane Farrer, who also was too old—she wanted a girl just over 13, and she was 19—I know Lizzie Stephens, but did not know she was going—I was anxious to go out to work—our family, six or seven, lived in one room—my sister was not able to spare anything for my father and mother—times are sometimes rather hard with my father—the strange lady told me when I went to see her that she wanted me to go to service with her—I went back and told my mother, who came across—Mrs. Broughton is not an intimate friend of my mother's—my mother told me that she had put the question to the lady, "Why don't you get a servant in the place where you live?"—I did not hear my mother say that—I heard the strange lady say she had had a French girl—I went out and left my mother and Mrs. Broughton and the strange lady together—I heard my mother say she would not let me go that day—I was annoyed at that, and kept talking to my mother next day, saying I wanted to go—on Wednesday morning, as far as I know, no message came from Mrs. Broughton or the strange lady, and my mother went to Mrs. Broughton's of her own accord—about 11 o'clock she came back and told me I could go—all the conversation about the place and the clothes is what my mother told me on Wednesday—I heard the lady on Wednesday ask my mother whether I had any clothes—all the rest of the conversation was told me by my mother—the lady told me herself that I should have to scrub the oilcloth—the lady asked my mother whether I had any clothes to go in—she replied "No"—the lady said she would buy me some, as her husband was a very particular man—she did buy me a complete rig out of inside and outside clothing—my mother said nothing about what wages I was to get, nor had I any idea—I had been out to service once before in Spring Street—the strange lady did not ask me anything about what work I could do, or what experience I had had, or for any reference to my previous employment, or whether I had been a servant before—my father left to go to work at 8 that morning—he came in at 1 o'clock for</p>

I will tell you what I want a girl for. You see I am a cripple and I cannot go about with a stick"—she had a stick with her—she said "I am married pretty comfortably off to a commercial traveller; I have a little six-roomed house, and I want a girl to kneel and clean about"—I believe Eliza was in the room at that time—I think she came in with us, I am almost sure—Jarrett said she had a good deal of travelling about and did not keep long in one place—I said Eliza could go on one condition, that she should write to me once a week, and that I should see her once a month—Jarrett turned to Eliza and said "Write to your mother as often as you like, as you can read and write"—Jarrett asked me how Eliza was off for clothes—I said "She is not very well off for clothes; the dress she has got on is dark, it will do for her to work about in;" I said "Her boots is strong, I buys the girls strong boots as well as the boys, to last the longest; they will do for her to work in; suppose you try her for a week, and write and let me know if she will suit, and I will buy her some clothes"—she said "Well, suppose I buy her some"—I said "If you do you will have to advance a month's wages"—she said she should like to get the little girl as nice as she could, to show her hus<lb/>band that she had a nice little girl, as he was very particular—she took the child out to the boot-shop—I did not go with her—she brought her back with the boots on to Mrs. Broughton's; I was at my own place; she took her out again and bought her a dress—she did not tell me what price the things were—I did not ask because I thought if she hired the girl, and the girl suited her, she would stop the money out of a month's wages if she purchased things—I did not know what the wages were to be, she was to try her first—Eliza had her dinner at my house—my hus<lb/>band was not at home—Eliza had the clothes on; she had put them on in Mrs. Broughton's—Jarrett trimmed the hat in Mrs. Broughton's parlour—Jarrett said nothing to me about what her name was—I first learnt her name from Mrs. Broughton after the child had gone away—except Croydon,</p>

") (<hi rend="italic">The envelope was addressed to "Mrs. Armstrong, 32, Charles Street, Bell Street, Edgware Road.</hi>") I did not know who the Chief Director was—I had not heard of Mr. Stead before that—Thicknesse had another letter, which he said came from Eliza, but he would not give it to me now—Jacques said "Give it to the mother," but he said "No, I was informed to keep that one"—Thicknesse said "You shall see her to-morrow; you shall come with me to-morrow and you shall spend half an hour with her; I am sure you will not take her away then when she</p>

Borner came to me at half-past 9 on Monday, 24th August—Mr. Thicknesse came next—he said "Is this Mr. Armstrong?"—I said "No, Sir"—Borner said "I am an inspector of police"—I said to Mr. Thicknesse "I beg your pardon, Sir, before I go where are you going to take me?"—he said "To Wimble<lb/>don"—I said "I wish this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Borner</hi>) to go with me"—Mr. Thicknesse said "Well, I don't think it is required"—I said "I wish it"—Borner asked him his name—he gave it, and we then went out—Mr. Thicknesse, Borner, me, and my eldest daughter Elizabeth—we met Mr. Jacques at the top of the street, and we then went to Cheviot Street and took a cab and went to Wimbledon to Mr. Stead's house—Jacques did not say who he was—I had only seen him at my house on the Sunday—at Wimbledon I fancy I saw Mrs. Stead first—Miss Green brought the child in, and they all left the room with the exception of me and my two daughters—Miss Green was the person that was spoken of as the cook at the Salvation "Army" at Paris—it was arranged that I and my eldest daughter should see Eliza alone—my daughter came in when they had left—she was very glad indeed to see me, and cried and kissed me—we remained together talking for some half-hour or three-quarters—I asked her where she had been—after that we had some lunch—Jacques came in; he did not say anything then till we had had lunch—he then asked me if Eliza looked well—I said I thought she did, and I thought she had grown—he then asked me if I had not better let her stay where she was, and he would get her a situation, and I said "No"—he said the situation would be near my home, near the Bayswater Road—I said "No, Sir; I would get her one myself"—he said he would call on me; I might make up my mind in two or three days to let her go—shortly after that I went upstairs with Mr. Jacques; Mr. Thicknesse was up there—Jacques asked me to go—Mr. Thicknesse read a paper—before the paper was read, Jacques said "I will double Eliza's wages; sup<lb/>pose I make it even money; I will do that; you have had a long trouble," and produced 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I signed this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the signature is the only writing of mine on it; it was already written out before I signed it.

The outrage was never mentioned; it was never read like that to me; I never could agree to that, because I never knew and don't know now; I would never sign my hand to that—I can read; it was all read out to me except the outrage and illusage—the "I am quite satisfied" was not read—at that same interview Jacques said "You need not trouble the police any more now"—he also said "Before you take your daughter away will you have her examined before me?"—I said "No"—I then came downstairs and saw Miss Green and Mrs. Stead, and then came away with Inspector Borner, Mr. Thicknesse, Mr. Jacques, and my two daughters, and went to the Treasury Solicitor's offices, and made a statement to that gentleman there, Mr. Pollard—I received two letters from my daughter while she was away, and the child wrote three—I never received one from Paris a few days after she left—I went down to Winchester with Mr. Hailes, of Lloyd's—I do not remember the date—Mrs. Broughton told me on the day the child went away that she had a sovereign—she said it was for being so kind to Jarrett.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUSSELL</hi>. When I said my child was looking well and had grown I thought so, I saw considerable signs of improve<lb/>ment in her appearance—it was at Mrs. Stead's instance that I was left with my child to have a talk with her, I and my eldest daughter, and we had a long talk together by ourselves—Mrs. Stead said Mrs. Brough<lb/>ton was a very bad woman, and I said I didn't think she was as bad as Rebecca Jarrett, and she said, "Yes, worse"—when the reference was made by Mr. Booth on 1st August to some medical certificate to satisfy me that the child had not been outraged I expressed my pleasure that that was so—I believed what Mr. Booth had told me—on 4th August I wrote him a letter, in which I said God would reward him for all the trouble he had taken and for what he had done—I thought he would restore my child back to me, and I thought he had been acting from good motives—I understood Mr. Jacques's proposition to mean a medical examination—I did not say to him, "No, I am satisfied with what my child has told me;" I never asked the child the question—I was satisfied with the child saying that she had been kindly treated while she was in France—I said before the Magistrate, "I was satisfied with what the child had told me;" I did not mean "about the outrage;" I was satisfied by her saying she had been kindly treated while in France—I can read a little—the words "I have received my daughter Eliza safe and sound" were in the paper that was read to me by Mr. Thicknesse—I did not read the paper myself—he only read part of the paper—I signed it—I was an intimate friend of Mrs. Broughton's, only as a neighbour, just to pass the time of day and like that, to bid her good morning, that was all—she had lived in our neighbourhood between two and three years—I had never been into her room before, nor did she ever come into mine—we had not been drinking together or anything of that kind—I did not know what her character or previous history had been—I had never seen Jarrett before Tuesday, 2nd June, and knew nothing of her history; I did not know her name—I knew her name by the first letter, when she put "Mrs. Sullivan"—that was her marriage name—that was a week</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190153"/>
               <p>after the child left—I had asked Mrs. Broughton what her name was—she said she knew the name as Jarrett when she was in service with her, but she did not know her marriage name—I asked Mrs. Broughton that question two or three days before I had the letter—I did not say anything to Mrs. Broughton on that—I uuderstood that Mrs. Broughton under<lb/>stood that she was married and well off, but did not know her name—I allowed my child to go because of Mrs. Broughton's statement as to her knowledge of this woman—I did not get her address before my child left; I thought Mrs. Broughton knew, because she was going to stay a week with her in the country—I asked her where she stayed on the Tuesday night, and she said she stayed with her mother in Albany Street—I have not said anything about this visit of Mrs. Broughton's to Jarrett until to-day—on the morning of 2nd June I went to Mrs. Broughton in consequence of something my child had said to me—I had also heard from a little girl that there was a strange woman there who was wanting a little girl—when I went over I asked her where she lived, and she said Croydon; if I said Wimbledon it was my mistake; I could not swear that she said Croydon, but I am almost sure she did—I never heard Winchester mentioned or Wimbledon—I said to her, "Can't you get a servant at Croydon? is there not a registry office there?"—I could not understand her coming to a street like ours to look for a girl when she might have got a servant nearer home; I thought there was something very queer and suspicious about it; to tell you the truth I did not care for the look of the woman at all, and that made me more suspicious—I said rather shortly, "You shan't have my child," and went away—it was on the Wednesday she said her mother kept a house in Albany Street—I said, "She has got good friends, then?" and she said "Yes"—Albany Street is not a great way from our house—I could not tell what kind of character Albany Street has—I made inquiry to try and find the house, but I could not; I and Mr. Hales made inquiry—in the interview with Mr. Booth no reference was made to Albany Street—nothing was said about where my child was going to sleep on the Wednesday—I understood that she was going out of town straight into the country, straight off to Croydon as I supposed; I am sure of that—I heard that <hi rend="italic">Becky,</hi> as Mrs. Broughton called her, was at Mrs. Broughton's house on the Wednesday morning—I was looking out of my first-floor window and saw Mrs. Broughton—I went over to her, and asked her whether Jarrett was a genuine woman—she said she had been in service with her at Claridge's—I did not ask what as, or when—I had no information about her beyond what Mrs. Broughton said—I did not know on the Wednesday what her name was or her address—at the time I spoke to Mrs. Broughton on the Wednesday she was inquiring about the girl Alice—she inquired whether the child's aunt was in—she lives in the same house as May—it is a cottage with two rooms, one below and one above—Mrs. Broughton said, <hi rend="italic">"Becky</hi> is come again, I should like to get her a girl to-day before she goes"—she said Jarrett kept a little four-roomed house, that her husband was a commercial traveller—she did not say she was living with a man; she said she was married, very comfortable, to a com<lb/>mercial traveller—Eliza was not in the room then; she came in after<lb/>wards—she did not say she wanted the child for a gentleman, I am quite certain of that, nothing of the kind—she asked me was the child a pure child—I asked her what she meant by that—she said,</p>

               <p>"Well, is she a forward girl?"—I said, "Oh dear no, far from it"—she did not ask whether she had been in the habit of romping about the street with boys—I never allowed it—she asked whether she was well behaved, and I said "Yes"—she said her husband was a very particular man; she did not say "the gentleman"—I said I was willing to let the child go, after she told me what she wanted; a little girl to clean about—when the child came in, about 12 o'clock, she said "You will be a good girl, and help me; you see I cannot get about very well myself"—the child said "Yes, ma'am"—it was at that time that the scrubbing and cleaning was mentioned—I then left and went to my house—I came back in about a quarter of an hour—my mouth was then bleeding—my husband had struck me because I wanted to go to a funeral; he said I should not go, I said I would go, and he struck me—that would be a little after 12 o'clock—I did not tell my husband about the child going—not then; I was very cross, and I would not tell him—I did not see him before night, I think—I think he had been home, but I did not see him—I don't think I saw him till night—I won't swear I did not—I did not tell my daughter that I did tell my husband—if she has said so it is a mistake—I did not tell my husband; he leaves everything to me—he asked where Eliza was when he came home at night—I told him she had gone to service—he said "Who with?"—I said "A friend of Mrs. Broughton's"—he said "What made you let her go with a strange woman?"—I said "Oh, it's all right, Mrs. Broughton gives a very good account of her, she has lived fellow-servant with her; it's all right"—he did not ask me her name—I said she was a lady that kept a house in the country—that was all—we had a few words over it for my letting her go, and he struck me—that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—I never had a drop that day till after my husband struck me at night; I had none in the day—I was taken into custody about 10 o'clock, I think, or a little after—it was for having a few words with a person I knew—I was not drunk and disorderly; they put it down so—I was bailed out by the landlord of the Marquis of Anglesea—my husband assisted in getting bail for me—I was fined the next morning—when I came back with my mouth bleeding I did not ask for some money for drink—I did not want none; I had some upstairs—that was the time at which I got the shilling—in addition to the shilling I did not get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid into my hand by the strange woman—not one farthing; that I will swear—I swear it before my Maker—I will call the Lord as a witness for that—I was not struck with the fact of the woman offering to supply clothes, because when the child came back, and was dressed, she said it was her Sunday suit which she was supposed to wear on Sunday—the child had clothes fit enough for work—she did not want for clothes decent enough to do her work in—she had a plain and comfortable dress, a good pair of strong boots, and some good underneath clothes—I was startled at the fact of this strange woman coming for a girl on Tuesday—nothing was said or done on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday I was not surprised at her rigging out my child, because they were not showy clothes; they were very quiet clothes, neat, but not gaudy—nothing was said about wages—I thought that was to be agreed upon when the child had been there a week to see if she would suit—she was to go on trial for a week; nothing of that kind was said—the word wages was never mentioned to me—nothing was said about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190155"/>
               <p>wages at any time—I understood that she was going on trial for a week, and if she answered then the question of wages would come up, but nothing of that kind was said—I thought it was very kind of her to take out the child to be dressed—I have never known a similar case—she fitted her clothes on her, and trimmed her hat—I was to come and see her off—I was told they were to leave at 3 o'clock—I did not know they were going so precisely as 3 o'clock—I went to the School Board about 2.50 or 2.55—the School Board is round the corner—I was going to leave the key there with my little boy, so that when my husband came home to give it to him—the School Board does not "loose" till 4 o'clock, but you can leave a message, or you can leave a key—the boy would not get out till 4.30—I did not leave the key with a neighbour, because I thought my husband would not like it—Mrs. Woodward was not at home; no one was in the house—I kept ringing the bell, and could not get in; the bell is in the playground—I was ringing there about a quarter of an hour, I think—I had never left the key there before—I have to go about my own work sometimes and leave the house locked up—I take the key with me then—I expected my husband would be home before night—he comes home at all hours—it was known in the neigh<lb/>bourhood that my child had gone—the fact that a strange woman had come and had seen several little girls with a view to getting one bad been talked about among the neighbours—I did not know that till after my child had gone—I did not know on the Wednesday that the strange woman had been seeing several other little girls in the street with a view to see whether she could not get one of them—I am sure of that—I mean on the Tuesday—I did not know it on the Wednesday; I did not know it til after my child had gone; one little girl said "She wanted me to go, but I was too old," and another said "She wanted me to go, and I was too old"—I did not know about Jane Farrer till afterwards, and I did not know about Alice West, because Mrs. Broughton was coming to inquire of her aunt—I did not know of Lizzie Stevens till after—I did not tell my child on the Tuesday or Wednesday that what was wanted was a child just over thirteen; but I was told so by Mrs. Broughton and the strange woman—it did not strike me as odd why a girl 14, 15, or 16 should not do—it was Mrs. Jarrett who said that the one that was wanted was a girl or child over 13—she said between 13 and 14; she asked me if I was sure Lizzie was no more than 13; I said no, she was 13 last April—it did not strike me as at all singular why 14, or 15, or 16 should not do—after the child left it was talked of among my neighbours about my child going away, and then I heard more fully about three or four other girls who had been seen and were too old; one little girl lives near my house, named Margaret Fann; she was the child that the sister was to let go; she was ready to go, only the sister's husband would not let her go; the sister was willing she should go, and she was quit ready to go—Inspector Borner had been to see her—Jarrett had asked leave to see the sister; she was just over 13, she would have gone back to her sister, only the sister's husband would not allow her—I also heard a niece of Mrs. Broughton's spoken about—she told me herself, "I was too old, or I could have had the place if I liked"—she was I believe 17—Jane Farrer was also spoken of, I have heard since; she was too old; and Lizzie Stevens was too old—Margaret Fann was about the same age as my little child, and she was ready to go—my neighbours</p>

               <p>that same week in which the 2nd and 3rd of June came, spoke to me rather angrily about this matter, because they could not make out why she did not write—Mrs. Stollard was one, and Mrs. Mudd was another; and others—my neighbours did not accuse me and Mrs. Broughton of selling the child that week, not till the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> came out; they did then make accusation against me—the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> came out on the Mon<lb/>day, and I was shown it on the Thursday—my neighbours had not com<lb/>plained that I had improperly parted with my child till after the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> came out; they used to talk to me about Eliza not writing at all; but not anything else till after the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> came out—my neighbours were not in effect charging me and Mrs. Broughton with having improperly parted with my child—I had not had angry discussions with them before 6th July—nothing of the sort occurred till after the Monday when the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> came out—I thought the child referred to in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> might possibly have connection my child, because the child was taken away on the Derby day, and because she was thinking she was going to service; they said the name was Lily, and I thought they might have christened her Lily instead of Eliza; and also the article stated that she had never been in the country, except in school treats—I saw that it was stated in the article that the child had been sold; but I knew that could not be me because my child was not sold—on the Thursday that I read it I went to Mrs. Broughton, and I said to her "Mrs. Broughton, I suppose you have not had a letter?" she said "No; if I had I should have brought it to you, as I did the other one"—I said "What a dreadful thing that is in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>"—she said "Yes, I am all of a tremble"—she was sitting at tea—nobody ever came to me till I went to the Magistrate—I said before the Magistrate "Two or three of my neighbours spoke to me about the disappearance of my child; Mrs. Stollard was one, Mrs. Mudd was another, and a good many persons stopped me in the street"—that was after the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> came out; not before—I mean in my own street—it was after the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> article—they said to me it looked as though I might have sold my child—that was after I said "The <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> article increased my uneasiness"—after the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> came out on the Monday they read it, and then they told me it looked very much like as if I had sold the child—I never read it myself till the Thursday—not till afterwards—if I said that that was before the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> came out it was a mistake; it was afterwards—before the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> some of my neighbours said if I had not sold my child, it looked very much like it; so it did when they read the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> look very much like it, but I did not say so before—if I said so, that was my mistake; when I saw the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> it made me more uneasy—it was a mistake on my part if I said so, it was after the <hi rend="italic">Gazette.</hi>

I did not know where you lived—I did not think you knew anything about it—I should soon have applied to you if I had thought you knew anything about my child, I assure you—there were so many mixed up in it—the paper was the first thing that brought to my knowledge the story of "Lily"—I never asked anybody to come to your office, I should have come myself if I had known—I did not look to see if the address of the office was printed at the bottom of the</p>

You expect me to bring it back and then say I am a bad woman"—I said "I did say so, and I mean it," and she said she would not give it up till the officer saw it—I thought she had deceived me then—she said it was not my child, and I said I expected it was—I do not now think Mrs. Broughton deceived me—I think she is innocent; I think that woman deceived her as she did me—I began to believe she was innocent after</p>

How you came by the child is a mystery, and must be found out.

I referred to the verses in that letter; that was what I meant—Borner and Conquest were present at the interview I had with Mr. Bramwell Booth—I went to him on another occasion, but he would not see me—I had no other conversation with him except on the 1st August—except what Mr. Bramwell Booth said about a doctor's certificate, I had not heard anything about my daughter being examined at all until she came back—until I got that letter, the "Chief Director," handed to me by Mr. Thicknesse on the 1st August, I had never heard Mr. Stead's name in my life—I did not know, except from what they told me, who the Chief Director was—Mr. Thomas keeps a home at 200, Euston Road—he is the manager of the home—I had known Mrs. Broughton in the place living with her husband in our street two or three years—I did not know anything against her either as to her moral conduct or anything about her before my child went away; and when she told me Becky was a genuine woman I believed her—Mrs. Jarrett seemed kind to the child on that Wednesday when she was there with her—Mrs. Stead said to me at the beginning of the conversation at Wimbledon that Mrs. Broughton was worse than Rebecca Jarrett—I do not remember saying anything to Mrs. Stead about children she had taken away—with the exception of that one shilling which was handed me by Mrs. Jarrett in the way described, I did not receive a farthing—I had no hope or promise of money made to me, or anything else—Mrs. Broughton received a sovereign—I heard that on the Wednesday; she told me she gave it her out of kindness for sheltering her when she was ill—I asked Mrs. Broughton no more about the sovereign—she told me Jarrett owed her a lot of money—she said she had kept her a long time after her illness, after she came out of the infirmary—she told me she had been in the infirmary for I think she said a broken leg—I asked nothing more about the sovereign—having received that account of it I felt no anxiety or suspicion about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Broughton, and have been married 10 years the 7th of next November—I am now living at 37, Charles Street, Lisson Grove—I have been living there with my husband since 21st September three years, and occupied one room—I have no children living—I was formerly employed at Claridge's Hotel, and used to go there daily to work—the prisoner Rebecca Jarrett was a monthly servant there employed as an ironer—that was the first time I knew her—I left there last January twelvemonth—Jarrett had left as near as I can guess two months before—she slept in the hotel—we were employed there together as near as I can guess from two to three months—she left because she was taken bad with a diseased hip—when she left she tried to get into the Mount Street Workhouse; she could not get in there, and I took her home—on that occasion she stayed with me as near as I can guess about a week—she shared my room and boarded and lodged with me—after that she went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and then she came back and lived with me again for about a week—she then went to the New Infirmary, Notting Hill—she sent me a card to come and see her—she used to write post cards; she wrote one letter—I cannot read or write, nor my husband either—my husband is a handy man employed at Mr. Stokes's; he has been employed there from 20 to 21 years—Mr. Stokes is the secretary of the Marylebone Association for improving the dwellings of the industrial classes—when I received these letters and post-cards I had to get them read to me by the neighbours—since this case commenced I have looked up all 'my letters and papers—I always knew her as Rebecca Jarrett—these are the letters that I gave to Mr. Von Tornow that I received from Rebecca Jarrett from different places she has been in—I did not answer these letters myself, but after receiving them I went to see her at the New Infirmary and Bartholomew's Hospital—I saw her last about nine months before the beginning of June last—she was lame and walked with a stick—she came to see me at Charles Street—she told me she was in a place—early in June this year she came to see me; I thought it was on the Monday—she knocked at the door; I was in the yard, and I went to the street door—I said, "It is you, <hi rend="italic">Becky</hi>"—I then asked her into my room—she said, "Good morning, Nancy; how are you getting on?"—I said, "Middling; how are you getting on?"—she said, "Middling-like"—I said, "Are you in place?"—she said, "No, I left that place, and I was out of work looking for a place, and I came across a commercial traveller," and she had got married to him, and was stopping with a friend of her husband's at Albany Street—she said she occupied a six roomed house at Wimbledon, and she wanted a little girl to clean around the carpet and the oilcloth, and asked if I knew of one—Jane Farrer was in the room; she was in the room before Jarrett came in, and I turned round and said, "Jane, will you go to place?"—she said, "Yes, Mrs. Broughton"—Jarrett turned round and said, "She is too big; how old are you?"—Jane paid, "Nineteen"—Jarrett said, "You are too old and too big, I want one younger than you"—Lizzie Stevens was going through the street, and I called her into my room—Jarrett asked how old she was—Lizzie said "Sixteen," and she said she was toe</p>

               <p>old, she only wanted a girl to clean round the carpet, likewise the oilcloth on the staircase, to save her from kneeling, as she was afflicted—Lizzie Stevens then left the room and went out—and then Eliza Armstrong came in about five minutes after Lizzie Stevens had gone out—I knew Eliza Armstrong, just as a neighbour's child—she knocked at the room door and said, "Mrs. Broughton, where is the person that wants a servant?"—I said, "There she is, Eliza"—she says, "I should like to go to service"—I said, "Where is your mother?"—she says, "My mother is upstairs"—I says, "Go and fetch your mother"—she went out, and I never saw any more of her until the afternoon—this was in the morning—Jarrett said nothing after she had gone out, except that she would not take her without the mother's con<lb/>sent—Jarrett remained with me until four o'clock in the afternoon—she came in I believe between ten and eleven in the morning, and was there all day until 4 o'clock—she told me she was staying with a friend of her husband's in Albany Street, and before she went away she said she was that way the next morning, and she would call and see me—I saw Mrs. Armstrong that day in the evening about 7 o'clock—I said, "Mrs. Armstrong, there is Rebecca Jarrett, that used to come down to me from St. Bartholomew's Hospital, has come to ask me to get a girl for her to clean about the house for her"—she then turned round and abused me, and said, "I won't have people coming after my child; I am not going to let my child go for any b—wh—, I am not going to let her go to a b—service," and I was to go and b—myself—she was the worse for drink—the next day she said she was very sorry for having made use of the language—the next day, Wednesday, Jarrett called upon me again between 10 and half-past—she said, "Good morn<lb/>ing, Nancy"—I said, "Good morning"—she said, "Did you get me a girl?"—I said, "No; cannot you go to a baker's shop"—she said, "Don't you know a nice little orphan girl that would be glad of a good home?"—I said, "Well, there is one up the street in the same house as Mrs. Armstrong is"—I went to Mrs. Armstrong's house, and saw her looking out of her own window, the first floor front—I said, "Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong, I am going to see if Alice West would be glad to go to service"—she is a niece of Mrs. Woodward, and lives in the same house as Mrs. Armstrong—Mrs. Armstrong said, "Wait a minute, I want to speak to you"—she came downstairs and said, "Where is this person that wants a servant?"—I said, "She is sitting agin my room door," and I says, "You had better come down and see her yourself"—Mrs. Armstrong said, "My Eliza has been teazing me all the morning about wanting to go to the service"—I told her to come down herself to make an agreement with Jarrett—she told me not to take Alice West; she was too full of vermin—I said nothing to that—Alice West is about 15—Mrs. Armstrong went to my room where Jarrett was—she had her things on—I said she was the mother of the girl who came in yesterday—Mrs. Armstrong asked Jarrett if she was the person who wanted to take the girl as a ser<lb/>vant—she said, "Yes. Are you the mother of the child?"—Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong said, "Yes"—Jarrett says, "Are you willing to let your child go?"—Jane Farrer was in the room at the time—Mrs. Armstrong said, "What do you want her to do?"—Jarrett said, "To clean the carpet, and likewise the oilcloth on the stairs and hall, as I am occupying a six-roomed house at Wimbledon"—Mrs. Armstrong turned round and says,</p>

               <p>had given me I put behind the vase on the mantel-piece—I looked at it when she had gone to buy the clothes—besides that money she had given me half a sovereign to get some whisky—she gave me the sovereign between 10 and 11—the half-sovereign was for a quartern of whisky; I went out and got the whisky, and got 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and that handed back to her—after dinner Eliza came back alone, and Jarrett asked her if she was ready to go with her to buy the clothes, and she took her out—that was a little after 1—she first bought a pair of boots—he mother came in while they were out and said to me "Mrs. Broughton, do you know what time they will be back?"—I said "I don't know"—she said "Go over to Chandler's to see" (Chandler's is a shoe-shop) "if Rebecca Jarrett is there, and ask her" (she called her "that person who is in the room") "What time she will be back"—I said "Very well I am going over"—I went over to Chandler's, and saw Jarrett and Eliza there, and said to her "Becky, Mrs. Armstrong wants to know what time you will be back"—she said "2 o'clock"—I came back and told Mrs. Armstrong—she said "I am going to a funeral, and I will depend upon you to see her off"—I said "Can't you stop to see her off?"—she said "I am going to see the funeral, and it might be too late"—I said "Very well, then"—she went away, and I did not see her again for some time—she was sober then—while Jarrett and Elliza were out I went to the mantel-piece and looked at the money behind the vase; it was a sovereign—I took it up and went out before they had returned to get something for tea at the baker's shop—Jane Farrer was with me—I showed her the money when I picked it up—at the baker's I bought some bread and changed the sovereign, and took the bread back-Rebecca Jarrett was standing at the street door; Eliza was gone home—Jarrett came in with some trimmings and a dress—I afterwards saw Eliza put those things on in my room—she had the new boots on—the hat was trimmed by Rebecca in my room—I had sent Farrer to the pawnshop for my shawl with some money out of the sovereign—the pawnshop was Chapman's—it was in pawn for half-a-crown—I got it out of pawn, and she brought it to me—the other things I got out of pawn afterwards—Jarrett and the little girl and myself left my house at five minutes to 3—Jarrett had a cup of tea before she went—before they left I saw Mrs. Armstrong receive some money—she came and knocked at the door—the little girl had not got the clothes on then—Rebecca Jarrett, me, and Jane Farrer were in the room, and Eliza—Mrs. Armstrong asked me for sixpence; she did not say what for; she asked me to give it her till Saturday—I told her I had not a sixpence in my possession—Rebecca Jarrett then put her hand in her purse, and turned round and said, "Here you are, Mrs. Armstrong, here is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mrs. Armstrong said, "I thank you, that will do better"—Mrs. Armstrong then went away—that was about half-past 2 and from that to a quarter to 3—she was all right then—her mouth was cut and bleeding—she said nothing about her mouth being cut at the time—about five minutes to 3 I and Eliza and Rebecca left the house together—I went to the corner of Chapel Street, Edgware Road, to the omnibus—I had got the shawl then—I said, "Good-bye," and saw them off by the omnibus—that was about 3 o'clock—up to that time Jarrett had not told me the name of her husband. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES VON TORNOW</hi>

I have written to you and sent you a card. I have sent Mr. Simmons when to come, but no one has come. A lady came to see me yesterday. She spoke about my box. I told her how I was placed. I have got to work, Nancy, to pay you for it, and she is going to write to you about it this week and tell you. I told her you was very kind towich me during the time I was with you; but I have not seen any one lately since I have been here, which is six weeks to-morrow. I expect to stop here a long time, so I think she is going to keep my box at her house till I get well again. But you will see what she says in your letter. Then she will tell me what you say in your letter back again, for she is coming to see me on Friday again, wich I hope you will come to some arrangement of what I owe you, so that I may come to some settling now with you. Give my love to Bash and Mrs. Simmons—" (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Broughton:</hi> Bash is my husband)" and tell her if she likes to come and see me I will send a card. I must say good-bye now.—From your grateful <hi rend="smallCaps">REBECCA JARRETT</hi>. C 2 Ward, Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, London." <hi rend="italic">The other letter was as follows:</hi> "Sheet Cottage, Petersfield, Hants. Dear Nancy, I do not know why you did not send the collars, but I suppose Sarah had not got the money. I have only 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down here, for my boot has broke again. I have had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it to be mended—a brass plate on the sole and heel to hold the screw firm by. I am much better I think in myself, and my hip do feel a little stronger. I can walk a little, thank God, and I shall be quite two or three months before I shall be able to do anything for a living; so, dear Nancy, do not forsake me now. I have not a friend in this wide world but you and Sarah. If I cannot reward you and Bash for your kindness to me, God will prosper you in all your undertakings. But as soon as I am able to earn any money you shall have it, wich by God help will not be long. I have written to Miss Morley, and thank her for sending me here. I have told her what is the matter, for Miss Bonham-Carter told me Miss Morley does not think I am so bad with my hip, for Miss Morly only sent me here for three weeks, but they have given me another week to make a month. If I could get a month down by the sea-side I should get all right. They tell me here to go straight from here to it. I think if Miss Morly knew how I have no home or anywhere to go, she might get me, for Miss Bonham-Carter told me she has got a convalescent home of her own. I know she has taken a deal of trouble with me. I should have had to go into the workhouse if it had not been for Sarah and you"—(Sarah is a young girl who is gone to Canada, who worked at the hotel with us) "But if I could get myself quite well, I would endeavour to pay it all up again."

               <p>letter is need Rebecca, Mrs. Sullivan—that was the first time I had heard the name of Sullivan—about a month afterwards I remem<lb/>ber Mrs. Armstrong talking to me about her child—I believe it was the 10th July—it was on a Friday morning—she said she was going before a Magistrate—I had got that letter then—I did not give her the letter, she never asked me for it—I gave it up when the officer came—on the Friday—the same day—Mrs. Armstrong and I did not have any words about her child, only she was going down to the police court to see if she could get her child home—we had no angry words—I got Farrer to write a letter for her—that was the same day—that was before I had given the letter up to the officer—they were to write so as to get the child, because she said as she was going to the court house, and the child was gone, that she would blame me for the child—in consequence of what she said I got Jane Farrer to write the letter for me—I told her what to write—I saw her write the letter—I posted it myself—she directed it—I put the stamp on and posted it at the post-office at the corner of Bell Street—the letter was to "Dear Beckie Jarrett"—it was addressed "Mrs. Sullivan, Wimbledon, near Hampton Court, likewise Rebecca—they said it was somewhere near HamptonCourt, Wimbledon was the place where the six-roomed house was—besides the letter I got Jane Farrer to write a telegram for me—that was the same day—I also received this postcard: "Saturday.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RUSSELL</hi>. The first time I met Rebecca Jarrett was at Claridge's Hotel about two years ago—she was in work there—she came there when I was in work—I had been there somewhat longer—I have left the hotel since last January twelvemonth—she left two months before last Christmas twelvemonth—I left Claridge's Hotel last Christmas twelvemonth—I left of my own accord—I did not know anything about what life Rebecca had been leading, that I swear—I and Rebecca became very intimate—she did not tell me that she had kept a gay house at Ward's Buildings, Manchester, nor at Bristol, nor close to where I live at Charles Street in Marylebone; I did not know where she kept houses—I know what a gay house is—she did not tell me at any time that she kept a gay house anywhere—I swear that I did not know that in High Street, Maryle<lb/>bone, she kept a gay house—High Street, Marylebone, is about 10 minutes' walk from Charles Street, where I live—I had not seen her for nine months before 2nd June—I had no communication with her between the date of those letters written from Petersfield, amongst other places, in 1883, until she came to see me in September, 1884—she said that she wrote me a letter, but I never answered it. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After 1883, the last of those letters being dated November, 1883, have you never had any letter from her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years ago. I cannot recollect whether I have had any letters from her since 1883, I might have had some; it is very awkward, as I did not read them myself—I cannot think whether between November, 1883, and the time that she came to see me on 2nd June I ever had any letter from her—I have got all the letters, and produced all that I have—she came to see me and called at my house about nine months before June, as near as I can guess</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190173"/>
               <p>—she called to see me in September, 1884—I do not recollect where she told me she was living then; I do not remember whether I asked her—I do not remember whether she told me that she was living at Chiswick—she asked me about the box—I did not ask her what she was doing; I only asked her how she was getting on; how she was getting her bread I did not ask her and did not learn—I cannot say about hearing from her between September, 1884, and June of the present year, but I had not seen her from the beginning of June—I produced all the letters which she sent me—when she came in June she did not tell me what she was doing; she did not tell me what her position was, or that she had changed her name—she told me she was married to a commercial traveller, I am sure of that—the expression that she used was that she had had a slice of luck, that she was looking for a place, and that she fell in with a commercial traveller, and that she was married to him—I did not ask <hi rend="italic">Becky</hi> where she had fallen in with the commercial traveller; she told me that she had come across him looking for a place—she said he was travelling about and never at one place; she did not tell me for whom, I did not ask; I did not ask where she bad met him; she did not tell the name, I did not ask—she told me in the room she was married, and then she said she was stopping with a friend of her husband in Albany Street for a week—I told that to Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong after being at the Court-house—I told Mrs. Armstrong what Jarrett had said to me about Albany Street next day, the morning after Jarrett took the girl away—if the little girl has sworn that her mother told her that she was going to Albany Street I cannot explain how that happened—I did not tell the child—Mrs. Armstrong asked me where Jarrett was going to, and I said she was stopping with a friend of her husband's in Albany Street—I said before the Magistrate. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Mrs. Armstrong came over on the second day to see Mrs. Jarrett did she ask her name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she did not, she asked where she was going, and I said "There is Beckey, ask her," and Mrs. Jarrett said "I am going to Albany Street"—that is correct—I am sure that she said that to Mrs. Armstrong—it is true that Mrs. Jarrett told Mrs. Armstrong that she and the child were going to Albany Street—I told Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong the day after the child left that she had gone to Albany Street, because she came and asked me—I reminded her what Mrs. Jarrett said the day before, and that she was occupying a six-roomed house at Wimbledon—I never knew the name of the sup<lb/>posed commercial traveller, the husband, until I got the letter from Winchester—the letter which Mrs. Jarrett sent to Mrs. Armstrong is addressed as to "Eliza's mother"—she did not know Mrs. Armstrong's name without she heard me mention it in the room—I did not know what her supposed new married name was, and Mrs. Armstrong did not know it, and she apparently did not know the name of the mother of the child—the name of Jarrett was not mentioned to Mrs. Armstrong—I believe, when I went up to her, that I said that Rebecca Jarrett, who had worked with me at Claridge's Hotel, wanted a girl—I will not be sure that I called her Rebecca—I did not tell Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong anything more about Rebecca on the Wednesday than I told her on the Tuesday—I am quite sure of that—I was with Mrs. Jarrett all the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190174"/>
               <p>time in the house; until 4 o'clock—on the Tuesday I never saw any con<lb/>versation at all between Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Jarrett—Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong never asked me whether Rebecca was a genuine woman or not—Mrs. Armstrong asked me how did I know Rebecca, and I said by working at Claridge's Hotel—Rebecca did not tell me that the girl she wanted must be a nice little girl just over 13—she did not inquire about the age at all; I am quite sure of that—Mary Plummer's name was not mentioned in my room; I am sure of it—she is my niece—I did not say at the police-court "Five girls were spoken of altogether about going, excluding Eliza Armstrong"—I could not have sworn that, because there were not five girls mentioned—my evidence was read over to me—I did not say in cross-examination "Five girls were spoken of altogether about going, excluding Eliza Armstrong"—there was only Jane Farrer, Elizabeth Stevens, and Eliza Armstrong, I mentioned, in my room; there was no one else—I do not know who put in Mary Plummer—Maggie Fann was standing at the street door—I said at the police-court "I said there is a young girl here, Jane Farrer"—Jarrett was staying at a friend of her husband's at Wimbledon—it was not Croydon—"She wanted a little girl to do house work. I said "There is a young girl here, Jane Farrer," who was in the room at the time, and I asked her if she would go"—"Mrs. Jarrett asked the girl's age," that was the first question she asked, "and on being told it was 18 said She is too old.' She did not want one quite so old. I said there was a younger one named Lizzie Stevens in Highwood Street. She was called in, but Jarrett said she was too big. Stevens was 17 years of age. Jarrett said she wanted only a girl between 13 and 14 years of age"—she said she did not want a girl quite so big—I cannot say whether that was what she said; I have such a bad recollec<lb/>tion—I did not tell Mrs. Armstrong that the girl which was wanted was a girl just over 13—I told her that Jarrett wanted a young girl just to save her from kneeling—I said nothing about age to the mother—if Eliza has sworn that her mother told her that what was wanted was a little girl just over 13, I cannot explain where she heard it—Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong neither saw me nor Rebecca on that first day at all until after Rebecca had gone, at 4 o'clock—Mrs. Armstrong came to me about 7; she was passing down the street—she called me a b—cow, and more than that—she called me it that day, and has called me it since—I do not know what she accused me for on that day, but she did use some very disgusting expressions to me, including the one I have mentioned—on the same day she had had a drop to drink—on the next morning when Rebecca came round I had no idea at all of looking for Eliza Armstrong—when I went to see Woodward's niece Mrs. Armstrong said "Take Eliza; my Eliza has been teasing me all the morning, and wants heart and soul to go to a place"—she asked me where Rebecca was—beyond asking me where she was and my telling her she was in my room, she did not ask me one single question about Rebecca's character—upon her saving "Take Eliza, the other girl is full of vermin," and so forth, I said to her "Go and make the agreement yourself, on condition that you get the name and address where the girl is going to"—I said that because I thought it would be satisfaction to her, and to me too—she had not said anything which induced me to say that—I said this because it would be a satisfaction if any harm should come to the child—I did not think any harm would come to it—it is a person's duty, or a mother's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190175"/>
               <p>duty, to see where a child is going when she is going with a stranger—I know that Mrs. Armstrong never did get the address, nor the name, not to my knowledge—I only got what she told me, that she was staying with a friend of her husband's at Albany Street, but that she had a four or six-roomed house at Wimbledon—the mother says Croydon—I had not the least misgivings or doubts in my mind at all about the kind of place she was going to at this time—I thought when she wanted to write to her daughter of course she need not come to ask me—I thought it would save me trouble—I had nothing bad whatever in my mind—this is what I said at the police-court: "Mrs. Armstrong said 'Wait a minute; I want to speak to you.' She then came out to me and said 'Where is the woman that wants the girl?' I said 'She is in my room.' Mrs. Armstrong said 'Do not take young Woodward, she is full of vermin.' I said 'Well, are you going to let Eliza go?' Mrs. Armstrong said 'Yes.' I then told her to come and make the agreement herself, on condition she got the name and address where the girl was going to. I said that to Mrs. Armstrong. We went together to my place, and saw Mrs. Jarrett there. I said 'Here comes Mrs. Armstrong, the mother of the girl you spoke to yesterday.' Jarrett said 'Are you willing to let the girl go?' Mrs. Armstrong said 'Yes.'" That is the order in which it occurred—if Mrs. Armstrong has sworn that on that occasion, when I brought her over to my room, and where she saw Rebecca, that Rebecca said "Is the girl pure," that is not correct—no, not such a thing was mentioned in my room, or anything of that kind—Rebecca asked me if I had seen her romping about, and I said only with boys and girls; I said only just out and about—Mrs. Armstrong was there at that time I believe—I knew this little girl, seeing her about the street—she spent the most of her time, when it was dry, in the street, nursing the baby—I have known them two or three years—it didn't strike me as odd that this strange person, strange to Mrs. Armstrong, and known only to me as a fellow-servant at Claridge's, should come in this particular street for a little girl—nothing of a bad opinion struck us about it—what made me say "Let her go on condition that you get the name and address," was I thought she was an uneducated child, and the mother would want to know about her daughter—I heard some of the conversation between Jarrett and Mrs. Armstrong—I never heard Mrs. Armstrong ask her why she could not get a little girl near her own home—I never heard any<lb/>thing of the kind mentioned, or whether there was a registry office there—Mrs. Jarrett offered me some coin in her hand—I did not know what it was—I stated at the Mansion House, in answer to Mr. Reid, that I thought it was a shilling; I did not know what it was, whether it was a shilling or not—I said at first I thought it was a shilling, and that I put it behind the mantelpiece—I appreciated her; I did not look for anything from her—she came and stayed with me about a week one time, and nearly a week another time, if she brought with her and spent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I never saw it—I never received a shilling of her—she did not spend it partly for her own support when ill, and for what was wanted in the house—she did not bring it and spend it in the house—I did not ever make any claim on her for what I had done for her, only how she promised it to me—I recollect one of the letters read this morning, in which she makes reference gratefully to Mrs. Morley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190176"/>
               <p>and Miss Carter, and a reference to a box that she left in my house—it is a fact that there were two dresses taken out of that box—she told me to take them—they were cotton dresses—I did not pawn them, and I did not wear them—they laid in my place a long time—a person named Simmons, who used to live in the house borrowed them, and I have not seen them since—it is a fact that when the girl was at one of these benevolent homes, an officer from the Charity Organisation Society came to me about Rebecca's box, and paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for keeping the box—I did not claim or wish for anything—I could not tell you whether all the letters which have been read here, the last of which is in November, 1883, were letters before the box was removed last year—I did not look to see what money it was she gave me, because I was getting my husband's dinner ready, and had no bad opinion in my mind—I do not often get money in that way—she did not, before she took away the child, give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, not a penny over the sovereign—it was between 2 and 3 o'clock when Mrs. Armstrong came in and asked me to lend her sixpence—if Mrs. Armstrong has said that what she asked for was not the loan of sixpence but a penny to buy something to quiet the child, it is not true; she asked me for sixpence—I recollect when she came up in the passage and was standing at the door with the child in her arms—Rebecca Jarrett was sitting near the door, and she handed something to her, but I could not tell you what it was, only by the way in which Rebecca repeated the words and said, "Here is a shilling for you, Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong," and then handed something I did not see—after the child had been out and had the clothes bought, she went and washed at her mother's house, and came back—her old clothes were taken off her and the frock put on—the boots and hat were left behind in my room—the child went away with nothing except the new clothes pur<lb/>chased for her—the others were left in my room—I afterwards gave them to her mother the next day, Thursday; I was present when the question of clothos was discussed, and heard the mother say, "She has got a good frock and a strong pair of shoes, and clothes good enough for her to work in"—there was no arrangement when I should meet them next time or any future time—the working clothes were left loose, not in a bundle—I did not know whether the mother was going to send for them, or whether, as Jarrett said, she was coming home in a month's time—according to my view she was going away as a servant, and she would have dirty work to do—I do not know what clothes she would have if those were left behind; only the mother repeated the words, and said that they were quite good enough to work about in—that did not strike me as anything bad at all, certainly not—I got a letter from Cliff Cottage, Winchester—I got Jane Farrer to read that letter to me—there are a good many persons about the neighbourhood of the name of Sullivan—I do not know one who is a bricklayer; I am quite sure and certain of that, or a stonemason; they might be the best of characters, or the worst of characters, but I do not know them—I did not know that a person of the name of Sullivan had gone to Winchester—until you an<lb/>nounced it I did not know any one since the time I gave it up to the chief officer; of course there might be some one of the</p>

               <p>name—it was arranged that the child was to go away about 3 o'clock—it was arranged they were to go to Albany Street, and I saw them off in the omnibus at the Edgware Road—Mrs. Armstrong did not see the child off—she gave me permission to see her off, because of the funeral, while Jarrett was gone to buy the clothes—I did not hear Mrs. Armstrong say anything about coming round to the Board School with the key—I saw her with her mouth cut, between 2 and 3 o'clock—I had seen her earlier than that—she came in with the girl to speak to Jarrett between 11 and 12 o'clock—her mouth was not cut then—I am sure of that—if she says that her husband struck her and cut her mouth between 8 and 10 in the morning, that is not correct—she did not come in to me with her mouth cut then—between 2 and 3 o'clock her mouth was cut—I had seen her before when her mouth was not cut, between 11 and 12 o'clock—there is one letter I did not write, but I got some one to write letters for me—I never sent a letter, to my knowledge, with "Good night and sweet repose" in it—I never, to my knowledge, sent a letter with that disgusting thing.

I wish I could—before the Magistrate I heard the letter—I have thought about it several times since to see if I could acknowledge it—I will not pledge my oath that I did not ask some one to write a letter like that—I should think I think more of myself than have a letter like that written—I do not think I did direct that letter to be written—I did not do it—I would own to it if I could recollect it—it is very hard for me to say—if I directed it, you know more than I do—it is very, very seldom I ever write a letter—Rebecca Jarrett generally writes my letters—I cannot write, nor can my husband—Jane Farrer wrote the Winchester letter—I think it was Sarah that wrote my letters in 1883 and 1884—she was not living with me long; not many weeks—she did not share the room in which me and my husband lived—she earned her bread in the laundry—Rebecca and I have not talked about Sarah; nothing bad—she has got her living the same way as myself at Claridge's Hotel since I knew her, until such time as she went to Canada I never received anything but what belonged to me—I did not receive in addition two orders for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; so help me God, no; I swear that on my oath—I received no cheque, post-card, or nothing from France, except a letter from Winchester—a question was put to me at Bow Street if I received anything more—I said I received nothing except the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she give me into my hand—the neighbours did not begin to talk to me of what had become of the little girl until the mother abused me—</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. After the disturbance had begun, and when my attention was drawn to it, I caused some letters to be written to Rebecca about this matter; one to Winchester and a tele<lb/>gram there—were three letters altogether—after the mother had accused me, in July I caused to be written to Rebecca two letters to Winchester and one to Wimbeldon, three altogether—Jane Farrer wrote two to Winchester; no, one to Winchester—I beg your pardon, there was one to Winchester and one to Wimbledon, and my brother wrote, in his dinner hour another to Winchester—I should know Jane Farrer's writing—it was not mentioned in the letter to Rebecca to ask her to send girl home as she stands, and not to give her any money or clothes until it was all over—I told her to send her home as soon as the could—I told her to put what she liked in, but to tell Rebecca Jarrett to send the child home as soon as she could—I do not remember saying "And do not give her any money or clothes until we see that this is all over"—I forget—I certainly did ask Jane Farrer to send that letter—I did not tell her to write that she was to send her back as she stood, and not to give her any money or clothes until this was all over—I will pledge my oath I did not—I suppose I must have said that—I told the mother to go and make the bargain herself—I was not responsible for it any way, as she was the mother of the child—I did not want to be blamed—I should not have considered myself to blame if wrong was to come of the girl, I should not have recommended her—I did not consider I was to blame in the matter, whether it went right or wrong, as the mother gave permis<lb/>sion for the child to go; not on condition that the child was to be great trouble—if anything bad had happened to the child I should have been sorry to have recommended her—I should have been sorry if any harm had come to her—I was sorry that I had recommended the child after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190179"/>
               <p>I found that the mother was abusing me, and what the neighbours said—when I wrote those letters through Jane Farrer, I knew that the mother had been to the police-court, because she came and told me—I only knew that complaints were being made about it by the way in which the police kept coming to me—I did not tell Mrs. Armstrong what I had written; I do not think I did, nor did she tell me that she had written—no wages was mentioned, only that she would buy her clothes for the first month—I did not think that anything wrong had happened to the child. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "Dear Rebecca, I write these few lines to you hoping you will soon be better, but do send Eliza home at once as I am in great trouble, and be surprised if she does not come back. Her mother been to the police-court to see if there are any tidings of her, so send her up as soon as you," and then there is a word which I cannot read, "and do not forget. Dear Rebecca, send her home as she stand, and do not give her any money or clothes until we see that this is all over.") Supposing that I did send that, then I suppose I meant it, as the mother came abusing me, and saying I sold the child for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was not guilty of the crime, and saying I was a prostitute, and I had been a prostitute all my life—Mrs. Armstrong said that—she has only known me since I have been living in Charles Street—she also said that I was a brothel-keeper—Mrs. Armstrong said all that about me. <hi rend="italic">Letter continued:</hi> "Until we see that this is all over. Her mother has sent for her girl's likeness to Kilburn to take it before the Magistrate to find her out. Her mother says that you was only going to give her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week?"—The agreement was not made in the room, but somebody told me that outside the street door—it was in the paper, but the amount of wages was not mentioned in my room—the question of wages was never mentioned in my presence at all; not the amount of wages—Mrs. Armstrong asked Rebecca Jarrett how much she would give her, and she said she would give her nothing for the first month, but she would buy her clothes—beyond that nothing was said about the amount. <hi rend="italic">The letter says:</hi> "Dear Rebecca. She is going to summon me for she say that you give me a sovern for her." Mrs. Armstrong charged me with that. "So send her up as soon as possible.

                  <hi rend="italic">Then the postscript:</hi> "Dear Rebecca. Write and tell me where I shall meet her, and what time." I was to meet her to see her straight home—the post-card was sent to me, and I heard the mother had one—Jarrett sent it—I was to meet her to bring her straight home, but I did not know what was in her post-card—she never told me, and I never told her—I had no idea what amount of wages she would be likely to get—for a girl like that I should think about half-a-crown a week—I knew that she had clothes given to her, because they were put on in my house—I do not know why they were not put on in her own house—the boots were put on at her own house—my house was not used on purpose for her to change her clothes—my house is as far from hers as the length of this Court—I do not know why the clothes were not sent to her own house, Jarrett brought them in my room with her—no reason was given for that—I did not think it odd her proposing to rig this servant out in a new suit of clothes, as she said her husband was a very peculiur man—I said at the police-court "I did think it rather funny, but as the mother</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Stead.</hi> When I was at Claridge's Hotel I have met a man named Ted in the washhouse, worked with him—Rebecca Jarrett was sitting on the flats the same as all the rest of the servants at dinner-time—we used to romp and lark, the same thing as passes among fellow-servants—Rebecca never told me what kind of life she had led, I am quite certain she never did—I found my own <hi rend="italic">grub</hi> and food there—we got no drink there—it is net true that I was dismissed from Claridge's for drunkenness; I left both times of my own accord; if the manageress at Claridge's says I was dismissed for drunkenness she is certainly not speaking the truth—it is not true that when I left of my own accord I bounced through the window; I wanted my bonnet and shawl—I said at the police-court, "and I bounced through the window;" it was a small window, but I did not jump through it; they hid my bonnet and jacket; I said I got a chair and walked right through it when Sarah Jones took my bonnet and shawl from me; I went rapidly through a window out of the hotel—after making that unceremonious exit from the hotel I did not go back again, I sent for my bonnet and shawl the next morning—I do not remember any girls that Rebecca used to tell me about of the name of Flo, or Annie, or Sarah, or Rosey, I do not know them I have never heard Rebecca talk to me about them, only when she pronounced the letter—she did not talk about the girls; she did not mention the name of Flo, Annie, Rosey, or Sarah—I never heard her talk to me about any of them as being her girls, or any one else—I never met any of those girls in company with Rebecca—I never knew that she had the management of those girls—I remember me and <hi rend="italic">Becky</hi> going along the Edgware Road when a young girl came up and spoke to her; she did not introduce me, I left them and walked on—I do not know whether she was a fast girl—I did not see Mr. Thomas after the girl came home—he turned round and said Rebecca Jarrett was a bad woman—he did not say to me that Rebecca had got young girls before this, the same way in which she had got Eliza Armstrong—Jarrett was not taken in at the workhouse infirmary, because they thought she had too much money; they thought, through her living at Claridge's Hotel, that she had some money—I did not know that she had any money—when Jarrett came to my house she went to St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I believe she did leave some money with me to take care of</p>

               <p>when she went there; I could not tell you how much it was; I gave it to her again I know—she did not give me a pound nor a half-sovereign, I am quite sure and certain of that; I think it was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember taking that money and putting it in a cup on the mantelshelf—I do not remember receiving 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Jarrett—I left the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there until I gave it to her again; I believe it was at Bartholomew's Hospital, either that or the New Infirmary, I know it was one of the hospitals—I did not expect any money from her—I told Mrs. Armstrong, when she asked me about the pound, that Jarrett had given it to me for the kind<lb/>ness and assistance I had done her—I did not tell her that Jarrett owed me money—when the Charity Organisation people came to pay that money at the beginning of last year, I signed a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in payment of the rent of the box—he asked me how much would I charge for the box being in my possession; I said I did not want anything—he said, "Well, how much do you think?"—I said, "Well, sir, I do not know, I will leave it to you"—he turned round and said, "Do you think half a sovereign will pay you?"—I said, "Sir, I will leave it to you," and he then paid me half a sovereign—the box remained in my house for more than six months—I did not charge anything; I would have given the box up without any money at all; I was not holding the box as security, but from mere friendliness—the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cleared up everything between us—when Jarrett came to see me this last June myself and Jane Farrer were in the room—Jane Farrer was after being for an errand for me—she was in the room and I was in the yard—she had come in from an errand—I had nothing to do with Margaret Fann; I heard Rebecca Jarrett talk to her, but I do not know what she said—when Jarrett came to me I do not remember her saying to me that she had gone back to her old life—if she had said that I should have thought she meant service—she did not say that she had got a house and picked up again with Sullivan, with whom she had lived before; she never mentioned him—I never heard her—I am quite sure of that—she said she was married to a com<lb/>mercial traveller—I did not say to her then, "Good luck to you. Rebecca, it does not matter whether you are married or single?"—I am quite sure of that, I did not mention such a thing—I was not asked to get a girl just over 13—she did not say "I do not want a girl that has been romping about with boys in the street"—I will swear she did not tell me she wanted a girl for a man—so help me God she did not—she never said anything whatever about wanting a girl for a man in my room, and not in my hearing at all—I do not remember about a month ago being asked that question, and saying I could not swear, but she may have said it—I did not at the police-court or elsewhere say that Jarrett said that she wanted a girl for a man—I never had any doubt about it—when she asked me if Eliza had ever larked about with boys and girls I did not know what she meant; only the same as the rest of the children larking about—I did not know that she meant had she been a pure girl, and that no one had been meddling with her; nothing like that ever struck me—Mrs. Armstrong on the Tuesday night said "I will not let my child go after calling me names"—she said "You are a b—cow, I will not let my daughter go"—I do not know why she said that; of course I do excuse a woman when she has had a drop—she sometimes</p>

               <p>calls me "Nance"—I was surprised that she should use that language, and walked indoors—I thought she blamed me for the girl going away—the woman had had a drop of drink, and of course I did not take much notice; I walked away—I do not know that she called me names which implied that she thought the place was very bad indeed; it is very ex<lb/>cusable in a person with a drop of drink—Albany Street was first men<lb/>tioned in my hearing on Tuesday night or Wednesday night; the first night before the child went away—Mrs. Armstrong was not there on the first night when the child went away—I never heard Mrs. Armstrong told about Albany Street till I told her myself the day after Eliza went away—I did not see Mrs. Armstrong on the night on which Eliza went away; not until the next morning—if Mrs. Armstrong states that she saw me on the Wednesday night she is either not stating the truth, or she has forgotten, or is wrong—I never said anything to Mrs. Armstrong about my going to stop a week in the country with Mrs. Jarrett—I never told Mrs. Armstrong Rebecca Jarrett was a genuine woman, or anything of the kind, I suppose she picked it out of the papers—Eliza was going for a month's trial—Rebecca Jarrett repeated in my room that it was for a month and not for a week—I said at the police-court that the child was going for a week on trial; she was to go for a month, and that she had to come back the same as she went—Jarrett did not say anything to me that she was to return the girl to me if she found she was not a pure girl; such a thing was never mentioned—when she said "If she did not suit" I understood by that, of course, if she was not able to do the work—I did not know what was meant by she would return her the same as she went no more than the poor mother did—I attached no bad meaning to it whatever—I said a month at the police-court—the question of scrubbing was mentioned when Mrs. Armstrong and Eliza were in the room; nothing was said about scrubbing until then—scrubbing and cleaning the oilcloths was mentioned on both days—Wednesday was the first day Mrs. Armstrong heard anything about it—when Rebecca gave me the sovereign I did not know how much it was—I said at the police-court it may have been a French halfpenny for anything I knew—I did not look to see what shape it was—I took it like this, and put it on the mantel-shelf—there were not two sovereigns there; so help me God there were not—whatshould I do with the other one?—I only found one sovereign behind the mantel-piece—I am sure and certain there was only one sovereign—when Rebecca gave me the sovereign, and I did not know how much it was, I said to her that she could not afford it—she offered it to me and told me to get some dinner, and get my shawl out of pawn; I could not tell what she said it was, I was too busy getting the dinner ready—she could have afforded a French halfpenny, I suppose—I took it from her hand and put it on the mantelpiece—I never thought of looking at it until such time as they were going to buy the clothes, between 1 and 2—I had found out what it was after buying the clothes, before she came back—I will not be sure whether I did say anything to her then; I will not be sure—I know I told her I fetched my shawl out of pawn—I was surprised when I found it was a sovereign; it was a great deal more than I expected—I believe I thanked her when she came back—I said, "Why, Becky! do you know what you have given me?"—she said, "I know, Nancy"—I</p>

               <p>said, "Thank you; that is more than I expected"—I asked her what did she give it me for, and she said, "I promised it to you, Nancy"—I have never said this before to-day about thanking her—I did not want money for her staying to dinner—she did not say she gave it for the trouble I had been at in getting her a girl—the agreement was not made with the girl then; she asked me to get her a girl the next day—when she pro<lb/>nounced about the shawl I thought it might have been a half-sovereign or a sovereign; I did not know—I cannot tell any reason why I did not look at it—Mrs. Armstrong came round to my house on July 11th or 10th, or about that time—she came and read a bit of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> about some child of the name of "Lillie"—she did not ask me any questions about it. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And she came and talked to you about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no one else had spoken to me about it before—I have not spoken to her since she went on to me, on the Thursday—the first time she came to me about her daughter was the time she abused me; at the same time she was posting two letters—it was after she went to the Magistrate she abused me—I have not seen her from the time she went to the Marylebone Court House to the time when she brought me in the piece of paper, after she went to the Court House—she abused me at the street door—that was on the Thursday, July the 9th, before I went to Court; that was after she had been to the Court—she had been in the morning, I think—I saw her the same morn<lb/>ing—I was in my own room; she came into the room—she told me she was going to the Marylebone Court House, and she blamed me for her going away, and said if it had not been for me the child would not have gone—she did not stop to say that Jarrett was a genuine woman—that was the 10th; she came to abuse me afterwards—I do not know whether it was a week or a fortnight after she had come and told me she was going to the police-court—it was before I came down to the Mansion House—I was standing at my own street door—she had these two letters in her hand, and she said, "Here is Rebecca Jarrett, she has actually been trying to take another child away—another girl away"—I do not know what that referred to; I looked at her then—I never answered, I never spoke a word; I stood at the door all the time—she called me everything—she called me whore and prostitute, and said I had been a prostitute all my lifetime; and I was not married to the man I was living with, and I was only living with him, and that she would have me up, the same as she would have Jarrett up; I don't know why—that is what I looked at her for—I never answered a word, good, bad, or indifferent—it was in the street—every one was there, the place was crammed—I never said a word, so help me God—I thought I would leave her to say what she liked, and I went down afterwards to the Marylebone Court House—I thought I would not answer her as she came and took on so—she said I sold her child for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I was a drunken brothel-keeper—she has not said any<lb/>thing abusive to me since—we are friends so far as we speak while we are on this occasion, like good morning or evening. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that Mrs. Armstrong received one pound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not swear to what I did not see—I did not see Mrs. Jarrett follow Mrs. Armstrong to the door of the room—I saw Mrs. Armstrong take something from her purse and put it in her hand—Mrs. Jarrett sat close to the door—I saw Rebecca put money into her hand only—I heard Rebecca repeat the words, and she said, "There's a shilling"—she may have done it without my seeing</p>

You ought to have left that until I came home;" and she went away downstairs—that is all that passed—she did not ask me for seven or eight shillings; I gave it to her before I struck her, before she told me Eliza was gone, or she would not have got none—it was about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock on the Wednesday night that I gave her seven or eight shillings—she told me she went to Mr. Bramwell Booth one day—she told me she had been to Mr. Booth, and he said the child had cost him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she could not have the child—I do not recollect the date—it was the same night she came home—she said she turned round to him and said "How did you come by my child to cost you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—she said he would not answer—I said "Why did he send her out of England?"—she said she did not know what to make of it—it is not likely that Mr. Booth, instead of asking for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., offered to pay her the wages of the child—we didn't want wages, we wanted our child—I am not aware that my wife told me that Mr. Booth offered to pay her money—she might have said so—I can't recol<lb/>lect about the wages—she said that Mr. Booth told her that my daughter was in a good situation, and well cared for; but not in the south of France selling <hi rend="italic">War Crys</hi>—she never told me that the child was in a good situation, or that the child was well cared for—he knew that we wanted her back—my wife did not tell me that he offered to pay her wages and give her money besides—my wife did not say after this that she had to write a letter to Mr. Booth—she told me after she had wrote it though—I think she told me she wrote three, one for a copy and another going somewhere else, one to you, I think, and one to Mr. Booth—I could not tell you when she told me that—she did not read the letter over to me—I am quite certain of that—I authorised her to sign the letter in my name, any letter she liked to write—that is my general instruction—she could always write in my name, I am not afraid of that—she did not read it over to me—I might have heard of the letter afterwards and forgot it probably—that letter was written with my knowledge and sanction—I could not tell you when I first saw that letter—I see it on the table and it was in the envelope, and that is all—there was three of them; they wrote three at once—<hi rend="italic">my missis</hi> told me that he would not give the child up under 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>Jarrett was there on the first day—there was no question of wages at all as regards me, or, so far as I know, as regards Lizzie Stevens—Jarrett said she wanted a girl to clean, and Lizzie Stevens was too big and too old, and I saw her going away—it was after that that I saw Eliza come in—that was about 10 minutes after Lizzie Stevens had left—she asked if she could go to the place, and then Mrs. Broughton asked where her mother was, and at first she said that she was upstairs, and when she told her to fetch her she said she had gone out—Mrs. Broughton said she could not take her without her mother's consent; and Jarrett said "No, neither may I take her without her mother's consent," and then she told her to "hook it"—no other girls came that day—the next day I saw Jarrett about 10 or half-past—she told Mrs. Broughton that she was going to stay to dinner—she did not say at first, "Have you been able to get a little girl for me?" that was later—Jarrett said, "You have got a shawl in pawn?"—I do not know how she came to know that—when Mrs. Armstrong came in she asked Mrs. Broughton to go and see her off, and Jarrett asked her if she had a shawl—that was the day that Eliza went away—I don't know how Jarrett knew that the shawl was in pawn—I saw something handed, but what it was I do not know—I went to the baker's shop with Mrs. Broughton, and she produced a sovereign; she said she didn't know it was so much—she did not look at it; she took it from the mantelpiece—I do not think she looked at it at all until she threw it down on the counter to pay for two loaves—she then said she did not think Jarrett had given her so much—she said that Jarrett told her to get a shawl out, but she did not think it was so much money as she gave her—I saw Mrs. Armstrong while Jarrett was gone for the clothes before we went to the baker's shop—Mrs. Armstrong first came on the second day about 11 o'clock with Eliza—when Mrs. Armstrong came back with Eliza she first made some apology to Mrs. Broughton for the names she had called her the night before; and then, turning to Rebecca, she said, "You can take my Eliza; don't take Alice West"—that was the first thing she said about Eliza—Jarrett asked Mrs. Armstrong whether she was sure that she was willing to let the child go—Jarrett also asked the child whether she wished to go, and she said she should like to go—it was after that that the question of clothes was mentioned; if the child had any better clothes; she said "No," and Jarrett said if she would wash the child, she would take her and buy some clothes; and then the mother took Eliza upstairs and washed her, and Eliza came back—Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong asked Jarrett what she would give her—she said she would give her nothing for the first month; she would buy her clothes for her—I think that was after the clothes were bought—nothing was said about what Eliza was to get, or whether she was to get anything till after the clothes were bought—I am quite clear about that—when Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong asked for the loan of sixpence, that was after the clothes had been bought—it is not true that Mrs. Armstrong said, "I want a penny to buy something to quiet the baby," what she asked was the loan of six<lb/>pence—Mrs. Jarrett gave her something; Mrs. Armstrong looked at it; I don't know whether she said "That will do much better," and went away—she said nothing about going round to the Board School for the key, she asked her to see the child off, because she was going to a funeral—</p>

               <p>Rebecca, send her home as she stands, and do not give her any money or clothes until we see that this is all over," because Mrs. Broughton asked me to put in to send her home the same as she went away—her mother came and called in to Mrs. Broughton, and told her she was at the police-court—I was there on the 10th July, I think it was, and I wrote the letter, it might be two or three days after—she had been to the police-court first—the letter is dated the 13th in my handwriting—she said nothing else when she came on the 10th—I had not seen her again between then and the time that I wrote the letter—I had not seen any one who had given information about it—the only information which I had when I wrote this letter was that Mrs. Armstrong had wanted her child back, and had been to the police-court about it—"until we see that this is all over" meant because Mrs. Armstrong accused her of selling the child for a sovereign, and she wanted the child to be brought home to show that she did not sell the child—I meant the disturbance about the child—I had heard that too—there was nothing else I heard from any<lb/>body that I can remember—her mother said she had the girl's likeness, and she would go if she could not see the child—she told me that on the day that she went to the police-court, the 10th—she said something was in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> that corresponded with her child going away—I ain't sure whether it was before or after she went to the police-court—I heard her say it when she went to the police-court on either the 10th or 11th—I was at Mrs. Broughton's when she said it—I did not see her on more than one occasion—when Mrs. Armstrong came in and spoke to Mrs. Broughton on this 10th or 11th July Mrs. Armstrong read a small bit of printed paper—I heard it read, but I cannot say what was in it—then Mrs. Armstrong said she was going to Marylebone Police-court to see if she could not hear no advice of her child—she said that Jarrett promised to bring her up within a month, and it was over the month, and she was going to Kilburn, and to have the girl brought home—she said the reading in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> corresponded with her girl going away—that was about all—about that time, as far as I can tell, she was quite friendly with Mrs. Broughton—Mrs. Armstrong said it was all through Mrs. Broughton that she let the girl go away—they used to speak now and again, when they met one another—on that occasion she was angry with Mrs. Broughton—I did not tell Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong that I had written this letter—I did not tell anybody—she said if it had not been for her she would not have let the girl go—I cannot remember nothing else she said to her—Mrs. Armstrong said that Mrs. Broughton had got a sovereign for the child—she said "Jarrett give it to her for the kind assistance she had been towards her"—I cannot remember anything else—I have written letters for Mrs. Broughton twice—nobody was present when I wrote this letter—Mrs. Broughton has only brought the letter from Jarrett at Winchester for her to read.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Broughton said "Go and fetch your mother;" and she said "She has gone out"—Mrs. Broughton said she would not let her go without her mother's consent—I do not remember if I said at the police-court that Mrs. Broughton asked Eliza to take the place—if I said that, it was not true—Jarrett said she would not take the child without the parents' consent—I am quite sure Mrs. Broughton said she would not let Eliza go without her mother's consent; and then Rebecca Jarrett said "No, she would not think of taking her without her mother's consent"—she mentioned her mother; and she distinctly said she would not take the girl without her mother's consent—she did not say she must see the mother first—Mrs. Broughton said she would not let the girl go with Jarrett without her mother's consent—then Jarrett said she would not let the girl go without her mother's consent; and she must see the mother first—I heard that conversation between Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Broughton, in which Mrs. Armstrong used bad words—Mrs. Broughton made no reply; she walked indoors—she did not talk to me about it—I have said nothing to her about it; I asked no questions; I made no remark, nor did Mrs. Broughton make any remark to me—the next morning I was there when Jarrett came in first—she came straight in, knocked at the door, and came in, and said "Good morning"—Mrs. Broughton said "Good morning"—Jarrett then told Mrs. Broughton she was going to stay to dinner—Mrs. Broughton said she had her dinner in—"Did you get me a girl?" was not the first question she asked, I am quite sure about that—there was no other conversation at all before that except about the dinner—it went all straight off—when Jarrett told Mrs. Broughton that she was going to stop to dinner, Mrs. Broughton said she had dinner in—Rebecca Jarrett offered her some money to get the dinner, and Mrs. Broughton said she had the dinner—it would be about a quarter of an hour or half an hour after Rebecca entered the house that she offered Mrs. Broughton some money—the first thing I heard was about the dinner—I am not sure whether they sat quite quiet all the time for the first half-hour after Mrs. Jarrett came into the house—it was about a quarter of an hour after she came in before the question of the dinner came up—at the police-court I said I saw Jarrett go out with the girl to buy the clothes—after she came back, Rebecca Jarrett took something out of her purse—I saw that; that was not directly she came back; it was about 5 or 10 minutes before Mrs. Armstrong come in—she did not take something out of her purse twice—she gave Mrs. Broughton the money before Jarrett went out to buy the clothes—it was not for Mrs. Broughton she took the money out of her purse, because she had given Mrs. Broughton the money before—after she came back Rebecca Jarrett took something out of her purse to give to Mrs. Armstrong—I did not hear Mrs. Armstrong ask Mrs. Broughton if Rebecca Jarrett was a genuine woman—I am quite sure she never did when I was there, nor ask about her character, nor if she was a married woman, nor where she lived—all that Mrs. Armstrong knew was that Jarrett was going to take her to Albany Street—Mrs. Broughton told Mrs. Armstrong she was going to Albany Street—I heard her say that on July 10th—I was in the room when Mrs. Armstrong came in—Mrs. Armstrong spoke to Mrs. Broughton at the door—I could hear all that was said—after Mrs. Armstrong had gone to the police-court, Mrs. Broughton said nothing to me—I said nothing to Mrs. Broughton</p>

I will pay you her wages monthly, or how you like, and I will give you her address, and you can communicate with her, and when she comes to England you can see her; if you will sign a receipt I will pay you the wages due to her;" and turning to me he said, "What do you think, two or three shillings a week?"—I said, "That is a question which I cannot interfere in, it is for the parents"—Mrs. Armstrong said, "No, Sir, I want my child back"—I said to Mr. Booth, "The mother seems to be under the impression that the child has been tampered with or outraged"—he said to the mother, "I can assure you that when the child was brought to me she was pure"—the mother clasped her hands together and said, "Thank God for that," and burst out crying—Mr. Booth said, "She was examined by a medical gentleman, and I have a certificate, and if Mr. Cooke would like to see it I will find it"—I said, "I do not think that will be necessary, but I will mention it to Mr. Cooke"—he said, "Why don't you let her remain?"—she said, "Because I want her back to take before a Magistrate to prove that I never sold her"—Mr. Booth said, "She would not know whether she was sold"—the mother said, "Oh, yes, a girl of 13 would know whether she was sold or not"—he then got up from his seat and went to a desk—he said, "Well, if you are determined to have her back," taking from the desk a piece of paper, "there, this is her address, that is all I can do for you"—that was the piece of paper with "L'Oriel" on it, which was produced the other day—the mother thanked him, and he said, "You had better consult your husband, and let me know if you determine to let the child remain"—she said, "Yes, I will, Sir"—we then left.</p>

Dear Sir,—I heard from friends in Winchester that Mrs. Armstrong went down there yeater<lb/>day inquiring for her child. I am surprised at this, because you well remember when she left me the other morning she was to consider with her husband whether they would agree to let the child remain where she is, accepting our assurance of its well-being, and communicate with me her decision through you. Have you heard anything further? From recent statements in the newspapers I cannot tell whether the woman is really anxious to have the child back, or whether she is being made the tool of others. I rely upon your letting me know what is the fact. I only desire the child's welfare; and I think it will be a great misfortune if it has to be sent back to its friends. I remain, yours faithfully, W. Bramwell Booth." I sent that to Scotland Yard—it is not correct, as stated there, that I had undertaken to let Mr. Booth know what the mother's decision was; that is a mistake—the paragraph in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper</hi> was on 12th July, 1885—this is the extract (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not remember having a conversation in July with Jane Farrer as to a letter going to be written to Winchester—I came back from my holiday on 19th August, and on the 23rd, Sunday, I went to Charles Street, Lisson Grove, and saw Mrs. Armstrong, who showed me the letter, which has been put in, signed "The Chief Director," with the stamp of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> office—on Monday, the 24th, at half-past 9 o'clock, I went again to Mrs. Armstrong—Mr. Thickness came in—I told him who I was—it was arranged that we should go down to Wimbledon with Mrs. Armstrong—on leaving the house with Mrs. Armstrong and her eldest daughter I saw the defendant Jacques at the corner of the street—we went to Mr. Stead's house at Wimbledon, and Mr. Jacques said to Mrs. Stead "This is Mrs. Armstrong, the mother of the child," and Mrs. Stead shook hands with her—Stead was not there; we were shown into a room—Mrs. Stead left the room, and returned in about a minute with the girl Armstrong and Miss Green; the mother said "Oh my child!" they kissed each other, and put their arms round each other's necks and began to cry; the child seemed very glad to see her mother, and the mother to see the child—Mrs. Stead suggested that they should be left alone to recover them<lb/>selves, and they were taken into another room and left alone with the eldest daughter—I went into the garden with Jacques, Mr. Thicknesse, and Mrs. Stead, and after about halt an hour Mrs. Stead went up into the room—when she came back she said to Mr. Jacques in my presence</p>

               <p>"The mother is resolved to take the child home, and the girl is deter<lb/>mined to go with her; they seem very firm on this"—Jacques said "Well, then, we must let then go"—I said "I am going to take the mother and child to Scotland Yard, and their statements will be taken; if you would like you can go with me"—Stead was not there—either Jacques Thicknesse said "Yes, we will go, as we want it made as public as possible"—Mr. Thicknesse is the secretary of the Minors' Protection Society—they accompanied me to the Treasury—the warrant for Jarrett's apprehension was issued on 22nd August, and I had been endeavouring to find her from the 22nd—on 29th August I went with Inspector Butcher to see Mr Booth at the Salvation "Army" headquarters—I said "I have come to see you with respect to Rebecca Jarrett, can you tell me where she is? You gave us the address of the girl Armstrong, and she has been restored to her parents; can you tell me where I can find Rebecca Jarrett"—he said "Yes; but perhaps it would be best that I should have her brought to London; she has been placed in my care by Mrs. Josephine Butler, who is at present on the continent, I will have her brought to London on Monday"—I said "If you will give me her address I will save you the trouble and expense"—he said "No, I will have her brought here; sometimes second thoughts are the best; what do you want to see her for?"—I said "It has been stated in the news<lb/>papers that Mrs. Armstrong sold her child; she denies it, and I want to see Mrs. Jarrett"—he said "It was Mrs. Broughton that had the money"—I said she also denies it—I heard from the solicitor that Jarrett surrendered at Scotland Yard at 2 o'clock on the Monday—when she came on 1st September to Scotland Yard her solicitor and a female, "Captain." Jones, were with her—on 3rd September I went to No. 3, Milton Street, into the house which was Madame Mourey's, and I noticed when I was in the room a curtained-off partition there—on 25th September I took Eliza Armstrong and her sister to 27, Nottingham Place, Marylebone Road—she identified the servant—it is a doctor's house—the child also pointed out to me No. 16, Albany Street, and the shops where the clothes were bought; and the door of the ham-and-beef shop in Poland Street, which has been spoken of as the next house, but is really the door of the ham-and-beef shop, No. 32.</p>

I and Jacques went down in company together to Wimbledon with Mrs. Armstrong and the eldest daughter—Mr. Thicknesse spoke to Jacques, and told him who I was—he mentioned that I was an inspector of the police accompanying the mother and daughter down—I went to Mr. Stead's house with them, so that both Jacques and Thicknesse were thoroughly aware that the police had charge of Mrs. Armstrong, and her case and interest—their only observation when I asked them to go to Scotland Yard wag that they wished the utmost publicity.</p>

Mr. Booth said to me "Don't you think it would be much better for the child if she could remain in a good situation?"—my answer to that was, "Yes, I do think it would be much better for the child to stay"—I told Mr. Booth at the first interview I had come to see him in reference to the child, and he promised me the address—I did not ask for it then and there, because he promised it before I had time to ask for it—at the interview of the 29th August, when I spoke about Rebecca Jarrett, where it was stated that Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong</p>

               <p>had sold her child, he replied "No, it was Mrs. Broughton that had the money"—I have no recollection of a conversation at the first inter<lb/>view with regard to the characters, as Mr. Booth believed them to be, of the father and the mother—I have no recollection of his telling me first of all that he thought I ought, before I went any further, to inquire into the character of the Armstrongs; to the best of my belief he did not—Mr. Booth did mention a woman at Folkestone who was pretending to be a sister of mercy, and under that garb was carrying on this traffic in girls—I believe he said he had been making inquiries to find who this woman was—I do not remember saying I should like to have the infor<lb/>mation if he could get it—he said he would send it to the police—I did not say it had better go to Mr. Munroe—the only time Mr. Munroe was mentioned was with respect to the address of the child Armstrong—I suggested to Mrs. Armstrong and to Mrs. Broughton that a letter should be sent by each of them when I found that Rebecca Jarrett had left Win<lb/>chester—I did not supply Mrs. Broughton or Jane Fairer with a piece of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper</hi> to put into a letter to send—I had no idea of the contents of that letter—I had not seen Jane Farrer at that time—I supplied them with no extract—the only extract I had was gummed on paper, and that is in the possession of the Treasury now—I never in<lb/>structed Jane Farrer to write.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mr. Stead.</hi> I had had this matter in charge from Scotland Yard—I am the only officer who has had it in charge, except when I have been assisted by one or two at an interview—the matter was in my hands—when I left town my reports had been submitted to the Commissioners—I was within three or four hours' call—I was called back on the 19th—I did not keep the case in my own hands after I had reported upon it—after I had reported, the responsibility for looking after it would rest with the Commissioners of Police—there is no person I can name who was personally responsible for conducting the inquiry after I reported upon it, unless the papers had been sent to some other officer—you can hold me responsible for the inquiries I have made myself—if I was out of town you would look to the Commissioners of Police—I first learnt from Mrs. Armstrong that "Lily" was regarded as identical with Eliza on the 31st July—I then read that article from the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> for the first time—I was struck with the identity between the letter that the mother showed me and the verses of the "Lily" story—if the mother has sworn in Court that she did not get the letter with the verses until August, that is wrong, because that letter was produced before Mr. Cooke, I believe—I think the letter was received about the 28th July—I was directed to attend before the Magistrate at Marylebone Police-court, and I attended before him, and took his instructions—I did not know that you had anything to do with the child at all—I did not come and ask some one at the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> office about it, because Mr. Booth told me that the child was under his control on the 31st July—on the same day that I saw the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> I saw Mr. Booth—that quite satisfied me—I had obtained the address very nearly three weeks before the father was sent to the South of France; that was the 19th August; I am speaking now of the 31st—I submitted reports, and I waited any further instructions—that cleared me of my official duty—I had so far traced her—I do not know why I should be going running about London and to the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> office when I found the person who had</p>

               <p>control of the child—to my knowledge no one ever came from Scotland Yard to ask the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> people a single question about Eliza Armstrong—I had no cause to go to you or the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—I did not come there—I was satisfied Mr. Booth had custody of the child—I did not send an officer running all over the South of France; the officer had started away before I got to London—so far I had completed my inquiry—when Mr. Booth told me he had control of the child I was satisfied; and on the following day he gave the address of that child—I was not aware that if I had come to the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> office I would hate got the information—if I had seen Mr. Booth, and had got no infor<lb/>mation from him, I possibly might have come to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—possibly the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> might have given me some information—I did not think it worth while to try after I found Mr. Booth had control of the child—it did not occur to me, and no one mentioned to me to the effect that I had only to go across from Scotland Yard to Northumberland Street in order to have the child given back to me at once—on the 31st July I saw Mr. Thomas—I had but very little conversation with him—I did not know he had been interesting himself in this case at that time—I was speaking to Mrs. Armstrong, and Mr. Thomas called her away, and told her not to speak to me; he did not know who I was—afterwards he showed me the articles in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—he said nothing to me, because we were then called before the Magistrate—when I went down to Winchester on the 15th to inquire as to the whereabouts of the child I saw Mrs. Butler, and had conversation with her—to the best of my belief she said she had been engaged on the Secret Commission of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—the reason that sent me there was because Rebecca Jarrett wrote from Win<lb/>chester—Mrs. Butler is the wife of the Canon of Winchester—I will not say she knew something about Eliza Armstrong, because of her connec<lb/>tion with the Secret Commission—the Secret Commission came into the conversation with reference to the address of the child—she said she had been up in London engaged on the Secret Commission, and had only just returned from London—I never made any inquiry into the character of the mother of the child at that time, and did not know it—I had no idea that the mother was a drunken woman at that time—I know now that she is given to drink, but nothing further—I reported at Scotland Yard and washed my hands of the whole business on the 1st August—I advised the mother to say nothing of what I was doing as regards my actions—it was not that I recommended the mother to have no more to say about the matter—I said to Mr. Bramwell Booth it would be much better for the child, if she was in a good situation, to stay than to go back to that place, by which I meant the locality where she resided; it was a bad street—I thought it was better for her to remain in a good situation than to go back to a drunken home—I thought it would be a good thing if she was in a good situation—I did not say that to Mr. Booth—as regards myself, I never promised to communicate at all with regard to Mrs. Armstrong, I was leaving town the following day, and it would be an impossibility—she was not to communicate through the police—Mrs. Armstrong would com<lb/>municate herself—I should think nothing was said at that interview that would lead Mrs. Armstrong to imagine that she had to communicate through the police—the conclusion at which the parents arrived was not to be conveyed through the police, but through the mother—nothing at</p>

               <p>that interview occurred which could have led us both to come to the con<lb/>clusion that the communication was to be made not through the parents but through the police—nothing I can recollect—I was not present at the Marylebone Police-court when Mrs. Armstrong made her application to Mr. Cooke—it was at a private interview with Mr. Cooke that Mr. Thomas showed the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> to me—I went down to your house with Mrs. Armstrong and the Misses Armstrong—possibly I may have there expressed myself concerning the bad character of Charles Street; it is a bad character place too—I took three or four detectives in plain clothes to your house because, in the first place, I held a warrant for the arrest of Rebecca Jarrett—I thought it possible that she might be the cause of bringing the girl back as she had taken her away, and I took them down to arrest Rebecca Jarrett for one thing, and the second thing to know who Mr. Jacques and Mr. Thicknesse were—Mr. Jacques had given the names—I thought the detectives would be able to find out at your house who they were.</p>

Urgent case. Will call in two hours. Money no object"—that, so far as I recollect, was the contents of the letter; it was a three-cornered note, written off and given by me to Mr. Stead—I believe Mr. Stead, Jarrett, and Eliza Armstrong left in the cab—subsequently I went to Nottingham Place; I got there, I think, a little after 2, Miss Hutchinson let me in—she had taken in patients for me before—I knew she was con<lb/>nected with the Salvation "Army"—Mr. Stead was not there when I got there—I had a conversation with Miss Hutchinson—I gave Miss Hutchin<lb/>son some chloroform, which I had taken with me—I gave her instructions to give it to the child—I went into the room while Miss Hutchinson was administering the chloroform; Jarrett was in the room in bed all the time, in a different bed from the child; she was awake—I spoke to her, I dare say, by her name, Mrs. Sullivan; I think that is most likely, that is the name I put in my notes—I had got that name from Mrs. Stead—the chloroform affected the child, she went off under the influence of it—I examined her just by the touch only; I examined her private parts, to see in fact whether the child was a virgin—that was in the presence of Jarrett—of course I had understood, and fully believed, that the child had been purchased—it is possible to ascertain whether a child is a virgin merely by touch; the finger is partly inserted in the parts; nothing but the finger—I had asked for vaseline—Miss Hutchioson was not in the room at any part of the time during this examination; she was outside—the child did not wake at all during the time—I spoke to Jarrett and then went out of the room—I subsequently wrote out a certificate—I had it forwarded to Mr. Stead; I sent it under cover—that certificate was sent then to Mr. Booth—I sent that certificate under cover to Mr. Booth; the certificate was to Mr. Stead—I put it in an envelope, which I directed to Mr. Bramwell Booth, 101, Queen Victoria Street, I think—I did not make more than one copy of it—the substance of the certificate was to the effect that I had examined Eliza Armstrong, and found her to be <hi rend="italic">virgo intacta</hi>—I sent that the same day, the morning of the 4th—I do not know how soon after that I saw Mr. Bramwell Bootn; I saw him at different times, and it is quite impossible for me to recollect when I saw him next—I have not the least idea how long afterwards—</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Nottingham Place, and occupy the drawing-room floor, the first floor, the second floor, and two rooms on the third floor—the occupier of the house, a doctor, occupies the ground floor; his name is on the door, and there is a night bell—I am in the habit of taking in patients for Dr. Heywood Smith; I have had a few of his cases—on Wednesday, 3rd June, I had one of his patients under my care—on the Wednesday I had gone to bed in the usual course, and late at night, or rather early next morning, I was aroused by the ringing of the night bell—I think it was between 12 and 1 o'clock when I heard the bell ring; then I listened to hear if the doctor's servant was getting up, because I knew it was the night bell ringing—the bell rang again, and then I got out of bed and heard the bell for the third time; and then I went on to the landing and heard the doctor's son, whose house it is, speak—I then heard that the persons at the door wanted to see me, and went down and saw Mr. Stead—I had never seen him before that time—he said that he had brought a note from Dr. Heywood Smith, and gave it to me, which I read, and destroyed it a few days aferwards—it was: "Can you take in Mrs. Sullivan and the child who accompanies her—an urgent case? We will call in two hours. Money no object"—I then asked Stead, who brought the note, if it was likely to be a long case, as I had only one room vacant, which was let for the following week—he said he thought it was a short case; I think he insinuated that the people had not been comfortable where they were—I do not recollect</p>

               <p>the words he used—this is as much as I can remember—that was the effect of it as far as I can remember—I then said they might come in, and Mr. Stead left the house—he never gave me his name; I did not ask him—I took them to the drawing-room floor; they had been waiting in a cab whilst this conversation was going on—Jarrett said she was sorry to give me so much trouble; something of that kind; I do not exactly remember—I said to her that the doctor had said in his note that he would call in two honrs—she said she thought he was coming the next day; I understood her to say that—there were no beds made up when they came into the room; I made up the beds afterwards, one for the child and one for Mrs. Jarrett—they went to bed; I sat up waiting for the doctor—Dr. Heywood Smith came; I cannot exactly remember, but I think it was about 3 o'clock in the morning—I let him in; he knocked—when he came in he gave me some chloroform, that was in my sitting-room, and told me to go and wake Jarrett up—I did so—Dr. Heywood Smith told me to keep the child asleep if possible; she was asleep—I do not remember what Jarrett said—she did not get up when I woke her, but she did afterwards—I then began to give the chloroform to the child—Dr. Smith told me to do that; he did not say how I was to administer it; he told me to begin to give it to her—I had seen it given a great many times; I put it over her mouth—Dr. Heywood Smith put some of the chloroform on the handkerchief, and I put it over the mouth and nostrils—I kept it there a very short time—Dr. Smith came in soon after I commenced to give it, and he went on giving it; he took the handker<lb/>chief from me—he then asked me if I had any vaseline in the room—I said "No, but I will get some immediately.;" I went upstairs to my bedroom and got it, and brought it down and handed it to Dr. Heywood Smith—he was then talking to the woman, Mrs. Sullivan, and he said he did not require it—then Dr. Smith told me to lower the gas, and we left the room together—I did not see anything that was done (the gas had been turned up before), nor was I told—the child was asleep all the time—vaseline is used for different purposes; it is used now a good deal instead of cold cream—it is a greasy substance—when the gas was lowered by Dr. Smith we left the room together, and went into my sitting-room—he told me that somebody would come for the people the next morning—we had some conversation about the money to be paid me, and I was paid a guinea by Dr. Heywood Smith a few days afterwards—he then left, and I went to bed—the next morning two women and a man came to my house—I think Mrs. Combe was one of the women; I could not say positively; I never heard her name, nor the man's—I do not see him here—Jarrett and the child had their breakfast, and they left, I think, between 8 and 9 o'clock—before Jarrett left in the morning she did not say where she was going with the child, or about the case at all—I never heard the child's name—I did not ask them any question, because the doctor told me I was not to know anything about it, and he could not tell me—I had often seen Mr. Bramwell Booth before this night—I knew him by name and from having seen him at the meetings of the Salvation "Army"—I used to belong to the Salvation "Army"—before the time when these people came that night I knew nothing whatever about this case; I did not know that they were coming at all—I am not a member of the "Army" now; I have ceased to be so about a month ago—when I was applied to on 1st September by the Solicitor to the Treasury I made</p>

I am an inspector of police at Scot<lb/>land Yard—on 19th August I was directed by the Solicitor to the Trea<lb/>sury to take the father, Charles Armstrong, to France to bring the child back—I went to the South of France, to a place called L'Oriol, 396 miles south-east of Paris on the way to Marseilles—at Marseilles I saw M. Berard—I found M. Berard had gone up in the mountains—I got the assistance of the French police, and saw M. Berard at his place, and he gave me this letter as his authority for giving up the child—I found that the child had left—it is Bramwell Booth's signature—I have seen him sign his name twice—I have compared the translation; it is accurate in my judgment.

Dear Theodore, You will look for the arrival of Edouard, if that has not already taken place, with a little girl thirteen years old. I cannot, for prudence' sake, give you at this moment an explanation of her circumstauces, but she is a modest little girl, and if you don't take her at this critical moment she will be lost body and soul. Take care of her, then, until I release her. Put her to whatever work you like, for she is handy and active, and you can let her go where you like, telling her that I am informed of her behaviour. If you require it you will be compensated; but if you give her food in return for her work and a little kindness in her desertion God will lay it to your account. Complete, my dear, the work which I have commenced at my risk and peril. You are in safety where you will fear nothing. Embrrce my son for me and send the news of him; say that she is a little servant, but not that it is the Army that has got her for you. Edouard, your nephew, is not known as an officer.

There is Doctors' Commons on the stamp, and rather illegibly July 11; this other telegram in French from Combe to Combe, 187, Quai Valme, Paris, to the best of my belief, is in the handwriting of Mrs Combe: "Conduct my protegee to L'Oriol." I have seen the envelope with the French postmark of 22nd July of Le Cailar—that is 130 miles further south, close to Marseilles—when I got back I found the child had been sent back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer—I attended the meeting at St. James's Hall, on Friday, August 21st, when Mr. Stead made a speech—I took it down in shorthand, the first portion of it—I have marked the part in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> down to where I am responsible for the report—I have corrected the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall</hi> by manuscript—there is a passage beginning, "Now, here I stand, perhaps the most abused and the most bepraised person in all England during the last eight weeks. The abuse I do not think that I deserve"—some one then cried "Eliza Armstrong," and then he made this state<lb/>ment further. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I will tell you about Armstrong. There is Mrs. Booth standing here as the representative of the Salvation 'Army,' who has been abused about Lizzie Armstrong, and I say that Mrs. Booth and General Booth, and all the Salvation 'Army,' who have been abused about Lizzie Armstrong, are as innocent of everything concerning taking that girl away as Mr. Stansfeld is. They had absolutely nothing to do with it (loud applause). I take some shame to myself that I have not taken an early opportunity of clearing the Salvation 'Army' absolutely from all responsibility in the matter, and I alone, standing before you now; I am solely responsible for taking Lizzie Armstrong away from her mother's house (loud applause). And I say this: that those good men and philanthropic strangers and others who are anxious to restore that child to her mother's house are taking upon themselves a responsibility greater by far than anything that the Secret Commission of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> ever took upon itself in the whole course of investigation. We took that child from a place that was steeped in vice; from a mother who has admitted that she was going to a brothel as she thought, and instead of taking her to a brothel we placed her in good and Christian guardian<lb/>ship. (Great cheering.) I ought to make one explanation; we did take that girl to a brothel for about half-an-hour; she did not know it was a brothel. She simply knew the was going to an hotel, but no suspicion or shadow of a thought of anything wrong crossed that girl's mind; we took her there, and we took her away from there; we placed her in the hands of the Salvation 'Army,' who had absolutely nothing whatever to do with taking her from her mother's house, and nothing whatever to do with the taking her to the brothel afterwards." And then there is in ink—for the half-hour in all innocence the girl went there; and yet they have had to bear contumely, reproach, and slander, from people who knew, because I have told them myself that I alone was responsible, and the Booths had nothing whatever to do with it (cries of 'Shame'). If they had only come and asked me, instead of raising all this hubbub about people who had absolutely nothing to do with the taking away of the child, I could have put them straight in five minutes. But they never looked near at hand. Now, when I think of the abuse and the praise, and especially the praise, that I have received, I feel bowed down with a grave sense of humiliation.")</p>

               <p>—she looked very hard at me, but whether she liked my appearance or not I do not know, but she said that she must go and consult her husband about it, which she did—before that I forgot to say the sister asked me where I came from, and I said "From the country"—she then went away to consult her husband, and she came back and told me that he would not let her go; whether she told me her mother was dead, or whether she told me that her mother was away, I cannot say, but she said something to me about her mother leaving this little child in their care, and through that the husband would not let her go—she went out, and took with her her sister—then somehow or other Eliza Armstrong came in; she came by herself—she asked me if I was the person who wanted a girl, and I said "Yes;" then I said, "Where is your mother?"—she went over and fetched her mother; they both came back together into the room to me—Mrs. Armstrong asked me if I was the person that wanted a girl, and I said yes—she asked me where I had come from; I said "From the country"—she said she should not let her go away from her—Mrs. Armstrong then told me the child was working somewhere near, where she was earning a shilling or two for herself, and that she should not let her go with me—she went away from me then, and the child too; they both left together—that is all that I saw of them that day—I did not say to Mrs. Armstrong on that day that I came from Croydon, I never mentioned any place, I said "From the country"—I did not say I came from Wimbledon; nothing was said about my having a six-roomed house at Wimbledon—nothing was mentioned during the whole conversation about being married any further than what I have said—nothing at all was said to Eliza the first day about being required to scrub oilcloth; directly Mrs. Armstrong found I wanted her for the country she went away home in a temper—nothing was said that day about my increasing lameness making it difficult for me to kneel, and therefore wanting some assist<lb/>ance—no individual place was mentioned upon that day at all—when Mrs. Armstrong and Eliza left I was alone with Mrs. Broughton—it was then I said to Mrs. Broughton that Eliza and little Alice would be about the girl that I wanted; I asked Mrs. Broughton how old Alice was, and how old Eliza was, and she told me that Eliza was 13—I asked Mrs. Broughton if she thought she was a pure girl; she said yes, she thought she was all right—nothing more was said about Eliza that day—by "little Alice" I meant the sister, the little girl, I do not know her name—I think I heard Mrs. Broughton call her Alice, but what her Christian name really was I cannot tell—I stayed to dinner that day, the Tuesday—Mr. Broughton came home to dinner—he remained for the dinner-hour and then went away—I was left alone with Mrs. Broughton—I left between 2 and 3 o'clock, to the best of my recollection—there was no more conversation between us about a girl, only I begged of her to try and get me one—I told her that I would come the next day, and she promised me that she would try and see what she could do for me, then I left—I have given all of the conversation, so far as I remember it, which occurred between Mrs. Broughton and myself on that day, word for word—nothing was mentioned about a situation, or marriage, or that I was staying with a friend of my husband's in Albany Street—I believe I told them on the Wednesday I was stopping in Albany Street, not on the Tuesday—nothing whatever was said about Albany Street, either to Mrs.</p>

               <p>Marble Arch, where I said good-bye to Mrs. Broughton, and with the child got into an omnibus—we took the omnibus from the middle of Edgware Road—I went with the child to Albany Street, where I saw Mr. Stead and had a conversation with him—after that some under<lb/>clothing was purchased for the child—when I put on the new things I took off her frock, and she came away with her chemise and two petti<lb/>coats—they were made up in a little bundle, and, I believe, to the best of my recollection, they were left in Albany Street—the frock and the jacket and the hat were left at Mrs. Broughton's house—in Albany Street she had, in the first instance, the same underclothing as she took from the mother's house—that was entirely changed, and I believe the older underclothing was left in Albany Street—later in the evening I went with the child to 3, Milton Street—on coming out of Milton Street I did not receive anything from the hands of Madame Mourey—the chloroform was given to Mr. Jacques—from there I went to 32, Poland Street, and from there to 18, Harley Street, and then from Harley Street to 27, Nottingham Place, and at Nottingham Place I went to bed and to sleep—in the course of that night I was awakened and saw in the room Miss Hutchinson, and afterwards Dr. Heywood Smith—after leaving that house next morning, the 4th of June, I started on my journey to Paris from Charing Cross—Mr. Stead was there—he left us at the house and met us again on the platform—accompanied by the child and Madame Combe, I made the journey to Paris on the 4th of June, and put up at the quarters of the Salvation "Army"—I stayed there on the night of the 4th of June, and on the morning of the 5th I went from the headquarters—I asked at some barber's shop for directions—first of all I went to a man who was standing near the cab-rank; he spoke French, and I did not, and he could not understand me—he took me to the barber's shop, and a gentleman was there who spoke English—in consequence of directions which he gave me, I went to the post-office and there made certain inquiries—after a delay I discovered a foreigner who spoke broken English—I have in my mind a description of that man—I received two postal orders in English for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and I gave him two golden sove<lb/>reigns; I also laid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down, and he gave me change in French coppers—the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was to pay for the orders—I had with me at this time some envelopes; one of them was addressed to Mrs. Broughton; I had addressed it myself; I wrote the address in Paris at the Headquarters; I then put the postal orders in the envelope—they supplied me with a stamp; I paid for it—besides the postal orders I put nothing else into the envelope—I stuck it with the gum, and put it in the box outside the post office—I then wanted to go round Paris, and I went and got into one of their flys, and as I could not speak French I had asked Madame Combe to write me an address in case I lost myself, so that I could give this address to people who could speak French, and they would understand it, and this address I showed the man when I got into the fly—that was the address of the headquarters—I showed it to him, and he took me back to headquarters—I stayed in Paris that day, the 5th of June, and started for England at 6 o'clock—I saw Eliza Armstrong before I left—she said she was sorry I was going—I said to her, "Now, Eliza, my dear, I want you to be a very good girl; you were handed over to me for something worse by Mrs. Broughton"—I cannot say whether I said</p>

               <p>then, "Your mother," but I believe I did—I believe I said, "And by your mother, too"—I won't really say that I did, but I believe I did—Madame Combe was in the room, and a captain in the "Army," Miss Young—they were both in the room when I said this to her—I came back to England on that night, and arrived at Charing Cross on the Saturday morning—I believe there had been an arrangement under which I was to be met by somebody on 6th of June—there was no one to meet me; I waited, but no one came—I had expected to see Mrs. Butler, but she was not there; nor any one—I then made my way to Waterloo, and there booked to Win<lb/>chester, where I arrived that Saturday about dinner-time, and saw Mrs. Josephine Butler next morning, Sunday—she was not in Win<lb/>chester when I arrived—on Sunday morning I had a lengthened con<lb/>versation with her—there had been an arrangement with me with regard to the custody of the child—I believe it was first mentioned by Mr. Stead at the time that I arranged to get the child—I believe he said to me, "What shall we do with the child when we get it?"—I said that I felt sure Mrs. Butler will allow me to have her at the cottage with me, and when I came back I asked Mrs. Butler if she would let me have her—she said "Yes, by all means"—I believe I told that to Mr. Stead, or to some one—I cannot recollect whether it was said at Albany Street, or where—it was before I left for Paris—I believe this was said to me, that she was to be sent to Paris for a little while, then at the end she was to come back to me at Winchester—I believe Mr. Stead said that—I was to have her in Winchester, at the cottage—I remained in Win<lb/>chester during the next week—I received from the child the letter of 10th June, addressed to "Mrs. Sullivan"—I believe it was about three weeks after—I remember the letter, but I do not remember receiving it so early—this is the letter—I wrote the answer to that soon after I got it, within the next week—I believe I wrote the letter to Mrs. Broughton commencing "Dear Nancy, signed Rebecca, Mrs. Sullivan" in the same week or the early part of the next—this is the letter—I wrote it from my own idea, I knew that a third person would read it, because I knew that Mrs. Broughton could not read nor write, so I as<lb/>sumed the character that I did assume when I went to her—I took the character of a gay woman when I went there, and I was not then leading a gay life—there is nothing in that letter indicating a gay woman—this is quite a good letter—I stayed on in Winchester for some considerable time—I remember one morning going to Mrs. Butler's when a Miss Hum<lb/>bert was expected from Paris—that morning it was arranged that me and Miss Humbert should meet Miss Humbert'a sister coming from Paris—I believe it was somewhere in July, I can't say in what part; but I went to Mrs. Butler's, to see if Miss Humbert had gone to the station—she is a friend of Mrs. Butler's, and I was to accompany her to meet Miss Hum<lb/>bert's sister and little Eliza, as I thought, and when I got close to Mrs. Butler's she told me that Miss Humbert had gone by herself, and as she thought it was too far for me to walk I was to stop there till they came—I waited there until about half-past 8 o'clock—we found Miss Humbert came alone without Eliza—then they told me that they would not let Miss Humbert have her—Major Clibbon, I think it was, of the Salvation "Army," told me so—I had made preparation at Hope Cottage to receive the child—my girls had got the breakfast ready for her, and about this</p>

I do not know whether that clerk is here—I have never been married—my first acquaintance with Mrs. Broughton was at Claridge's Hotel, in the beginning of 1883—I went to Claridge's, I believe, in May; previous to going there I kept a gay house in High Street, Marylebone; I shall not say what number—I have told you that I have led a bad life, and I beg of you that my past life should not come up here—it was 23, High Street, Marylebone—I did not rent it; Sullivan, the man that I lived with, did; the same Sullivan—that was, I believe, about the end of 1882 or the beginning of 1893—I also kept a gay house at Bristol; on the Cliffs, No. 6—I rented that—I cannot recollect how long ago it was, it was before I was at Maryle<lb/>bone; years before—it might have been two or three years before, but not ten years, or seven; I do not know as to five—the landlady's name was Mrs. White—I rented that myself, and passed by the name of Hayenes—I also kept a gay house at 3, Ward's Buildings, Manchester—that was before I went to Bristol—I did not rent that myself; the man I lived with did, Hayenes—Sullivan had been a commercial traveller—I do not know where he is now; I last saw him in Winchester—I first knew him, I believe, between two and three years ago, when I went to live with him first—I knew him before that—he had been a commercial traveller, but not after I knew him—I did not know Mr. Broughton before I knew Mrs. Broughton at Claridge's, and as far as I knew he was quite respect<lb/>able; there had never been any impropriety between us; I am quite sure of that; never at any time; not in act—when I was trying to get into the hospital, that is the time I left Claridge's, he had been very kind to me—I did not know that his nick-name was "Bash" till I was told—I heard from Mrs. Broughton that it was "Bash"—I do not suggest that there was anything improper in the name "Bash"—I was in the hospitals and convalescent homes from about August until the following April—after</p>

I am very happy and comfortable, for I am in a cottage, there is only four of us here, we have the best of living, you would like to be here, I am sure, we have the cottage all to ourself. it is furnished very nise, and all the food comes from the large house. the lady come every day to talk with ous. Miss Morley sent me here for three weeks, but the lady have given me the other, so I am going to stop four weeks give my love to Bash, and tell him I do not get any toast now"—I meant by that the same meaning as she had—I won't swear that that letter was not written before the letter which has been already put in; it might have been—by "I do not get any toast," I mean the same meaning as she has; it is a slang word that we had between us—I meant toasted cheese; when a person is going with a man it is getting warm, and when we used to be romping in the laundry, or anything like that, we said "Ain't you as warm as toast;" that is the full meaning for the word "toast"—I was not writing to the man at all; I was writing to Mrs. Broughton; that is a message that I sent to Bash—I do not know that I have seen or heard of anything done disreputable by Mrs. Broughton—I know of that; I dare say she could do it—I have never seen Mrs. Broughton committing any immorality, but I have seen a man in the room and he said he would like to go with me, in her presence—I have never known her from her own confession, or from what I have seen, guilty of any immorality—the same letter says, "Nancy, ask Sarah for some money, for I want some collars so bad; get me a dozen of paper ones, &amp;c.; give my kind love to Sarah"—that was Sarah Jones—I don't know whether she was respectable; I don't know anything about her; I know nothing by her own confession or what I have seen disreputable of Sarah, only she kept herself for two or three months without any income; so what was she doing without any money—I believe she was an immoral person—I could not say that this letter is in Sarah's writing, for I do not believe that she wrote it—if Sarah did not, the only suggestion that I can make is, a person who lived opposite in the front parlour; I do not know her name, but she was rather stout—I have seen her writing—I have had two or three letters, but I am sorry to say I tore them up—I do not believe that Sarah did write this letter—after I left Chiswick I got a situation from the Charity Organisation Society, and went to it; it was at Chiswick—I cannot recollect how long I stayed; it was in Chiswick Lane; I do not know the number—the name of my mistress was Pettit, I think—I went as a matron at the laundry—I believe it was Mrs. Hammond's character—I wrote this letter, "I know you are looking for a few lines, but I have been in hot water this last fortnight, for one of the matrons told me I was fetch out of the workhouse by the lady, and so I gave her</p>

"I will come round as soon as I can, my love to all, Miss R. Jarrett, Chiswick Lane, Turnham Green." That was Mrs. Hammond's home—I didn't go to any place at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, for I could not go; my hip was bad some time after, but I got into the George Hotel, at Northampton, but I didn't go straight there—I said that I went to service at a house in Chiswick Lane, as laundry matron; that was Mrs. Pettitt's, Mrs. Hammond is the lady superintendent of the society—Mrs. Pettitt is the matron—I didn't give Mrs. Hammond notice, they gave me notice—I wrote: "So I gave her notice, and thank God I have got another situation;" that was untrue—my object in telling Mrs. Broughton, from the Home, that I had got a situation at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year was this, I did not like her to know that they had taken all that trouble to get me into that place, and directly I got there I was discharged—I do not know that I was there for four or five months—I cannot recollect whether I was at the Home for four or five months in 1884, from April to September, 1844, I won't swear at all to the time—I do not know if all the other letters I wrote to Mrs. Broughton between the middle of 1883 and 1884 were true—I do not know what they were about—I will not swear that I had no situation to go to from Mrs. Hammond's; I had, but I could not go to it—it was at Northampton, as a laundress, at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I did not go there as laundrymaid there and then—I went there about the latter end of November, at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I did not go at once, because my leg was bad—after I left the Home I was living at Mrs. Sawyer's, No. 8, Turnham Green—I believe she is a laundress—I was not working there—I was there till I went to Northampton in November, about two months—I think I went there about the middle of December—I took the rooms in Albany Street on Saturday night, 30th of May—I do not know the name of the woman—that is the person (<hi rend="italic">Miss Morris</hi>)—I did not know what the house was when I entered it—I know now it is a respectable house—I did not tell Miss Morris I had a cottage at Wimbledon, or a house; I never mentioned Wimbledon—I do not know that I spoke to her when I went to take those rooms; I think the other person might have spoken; a friend of Mr.Stead, Miss Peck we used to call her; I believe she is in the Salva<lb/>tion "Army"—she is the young lady I referred to yesterday—I do not know whether she is here—I swear that Wimbledon was not mentioned to Miss Morris at any time—the name given was Mrs. Sullivan—Miss Morris may have asked me my name, and I may have said Mrs. Sullivan—I believe the lodgings were paid for in advance by Miss Peck—I bought the clothes which I call "gay" clothes on the Tuesday morning, not the same day that I went to Mrs. Broughton, nor the same week, it was the week before when I commenced the work—I had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given me by Mr. Stead—not for the clothes, it was to get the child—to cover everything—I never had more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. my clothes cost—I have not worn them at all during this trial—the bonnet I appeared in on one of the days in Court was not the bonnet; I had a hat on—I bought my jacket I think</p>

I got from Mr. Stead—I have not got my hat; I have the dress, it is at home, where I am lodging—it was not a neat stuff dress, it was a gay dress, brown, and trimmed with Scotch plaid—it was made as a stylish costume—I went on the Saturday to Lady Lake Grove—I do not know the name or num<lb/>ber or the name of the person, but I think it is 23—I believe I laid one shilling down for drink there—I did not succeed in getting any girl on the Saturday—I think I went there three times—the last day was the day before I went to Mrs. Broughton—they brought me a girl, but I did not succeed in getting her—on the Tuesday when I came away from Mrs. Broughton I had not succeeded in getting a girl—in fact I asked Mrs. Broughton to try and get me one—up to Tuesday night I had failed in my efforts to get a girl—I had seen Mr. Stead on Tuesday night and told him I did not succeed in getting a girl—I feel sure about that—on Tuesday I saw Mrs. Armstrong—she distinctly refused to let her child go with me—until I said to Mrs. Armstrong on the Wednesday "Here is a shilling for you" no amount of money was mentioned between us, but money had been mentioned—I gave her a shilling some time after she had consented to her child going—I had got clothes by that time—I represent to the Jury that Mrs. Armstrong consented to her child going to be used by a man, without any idea of what she was to receive; but she knew she was going to receive money for it—I swear that Mrs. Broughton knew the Sullivan, the commercial traveller, or the man who had been a commercial traveller, by seeing him backwards and forwards about Edgware Road and Bell Street—she had seen him two or three times—I cannot really say when—I do not know whether she has spoken to him, but she has seen him.</p>

She had been at school, could read and write, and although her spelling was extraordinary, she was able to express herself with much force and decision. Her experience of the world was limited to the London quarter in which she had been born. With the exception of two school trips to Richmond and one to Epping Forest she had never been in the country in her life, nor had she ever even seen the Thames, except at Richmond. She was an industrious, warm-hearted little thing, a hardy English child, slightly coarse in texture, with dark black eyes, and short</p>

But she was a loving, affec<lb/>tionate child, whose kindly feeling for the drunken mother who sold her into nameless infamy was very touching to behold. In a little letter of hers, which I once saw, plentifully garlanded with kisses, there was the following ill-spelled childish verse, 'As I was lying in my bed, &amp;c.'"—I do not think "Lily" was Eliza Armstrong—I don't now think it is Eliza; I have a doubt—I believe it was—we have another child, and we have her history—I believe it was another child—I recollect receiving a letter from Eliza—I recollect the verses that are in it; they are quite the same that appeared in that article—I am quite willing to say, but I really do not think it is the same child now. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In both the passages the child is said to have been taken to a street that corresponds with Albany Street, "examined by a midwife who charged 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the chloroform, then taken to a brothel in 'P—'Street, put to bed under influence of chloro<lb/>form, and then called out 'There's a man in the room!'"

Now I put it all to you, do you now represent that you do not think it is Eliza Armstrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I want to speak truthfully, and if you will allow me to say a few words—I do not know how to answer, whether "Yes" or "No"—I did not think then that the article when it called the girl "Lily," really referred to Eliza, but I might think it now; I do think it now—but there is a little girl, and I have always been allowed to think that little girl has gone through all this—that will show you that I really did not think it—I want to speak truthfully, but I have always been led to suppose that this other little girl is the real one, because I have seen the little girl; I have had it from the child's own lips—I can<lb/>not tell any one who has told me that another little girl, and not Eliza Armstrong, is the original of "Lily"—I have never mentioued it to any one—I have not heard it mentioned—I believe the little girl referred to will be brought before you—I know her first name is Grace, but her other name I do not know—I do not know where she is—I saw her with Mrs. Bramwell Booth; the last time was about a fortnight or three weeks ago—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I received—I never received the one of 9th July—the only letter, I can assure you, was the one with "the little thoughts I had" in it, the one of 10th June—I did not give that letter up to Mr. Stead—I believe that Mrs. Butler read the letter—I did not tell Mr. Stead that "Lily's" mother or Eliza's mother had asked me on Tuesday to take her daughter—I did not tell him I had agreed with a procuress, but I told him that I had the promise of a girl—no money was mentioned, not the sum of money—I believe Mr. Stead had got other women doing this sort of work besides me—I do not know their name—he did not tell me so; I do not think he did, but I have seen others that have been trying to do this work—I did not tell Mr. Stead that on Wednesday the father was told that his daughter was going to a situation—what I told Mr. Stead was that I sent the child in to the father and mother to bid them good<lb/>bye, and the child came out and told me that the father was lying on the bed—I did not tell Mr. Stead that the father was a drunken man; I did not know what he was—I told Mr. Stead that I should agree to give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a girl, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when her virginity was certified—I might have told him that I had agreed to give the procuress, Mrs. Broughton, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid down and the remaining 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after her virginity had been pro<lb/>fessionally</p>

               <p>I meant—that was my home, but I did not want to lead them to think I was down there—I meant this, that I did not want them to think I was not there—I had to leave Winchester because my old friends came down, and if they had found out that I lived there, they might have come and annoyed me again—the man I was living with, for one—Mrs. Broughton might have spoken to some one out of doors, and they might have traced out where I lived—that was my real motive for putting those words into the letter, and no other motive whatever—<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> is her husband, the same as "Bash," "and her mother" is Eliza Armstrong's mother—on my oath, I did not think nothing about whether Mrs. Broughton would show that letter to Mrs. Armstrong—I did not know who would read it for her—I knew some stranger would read it, perhaps—I meant to send my love to Mrs. Armstrong, the woman who had sold her child, and I meant to go and see her, too, afterwards—I did mean to go and see Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Broughton—I had no time appointed—I remained in Winchester all June—I went to Portsmouth—my object in writing that letter was, that I wanted to go home after, to let them see I had altered my life; and I meant to take little Eliza with me to her mother, and say "You gave me your daughter for an immoral purpose, and I have not used her, but have been trying to make a Christian girl of her"—according to me, the girl had been sold to me for an immoral purpose; therefore I thought neither her mother nor Mrs. Broughton cared a bit about her—they had given her to me body and soul—I wrote this letter because I thought if I took the child home, and it was seen I had not used her for an immoral purpose, it would have roused them up and made an impression upon them to see the wrong that they had done—I thought it would bring them to a sense of the iniquity they had perpetrated—I did not care whether Mrs. Armstrong saw that letter or not—she had handed her child over to me for that purpose, and I had not used it—I did not write after the 9th—I dare say that was before I went to Portsmouth in July—I went to Ports<lb/>mouth before the home was shut up for a week I think it was—I cannot fix the date, but I believe it was somewhere about the end of July I went down—I was at home at Hope Cottage, High Cliff, Winchester, when I received that letter Z—I have not got the envelope—the day I wrote those two post-cards I received the letter—I do not think this is the letter I received—I received only one from Mrs. Broughton—it was the morning that these letters came after to the cottage—I don't know where the letter is that I received—I have not got it—I think it has been produced—I never received the telegram and I never received that letter—there was a letter written the same day as those post-cards—I don't know who received that letter—I have never seen it—I left Winchester on 10th of July, the day I wrote those post-cards—on the Saturday—the post-card of July 11th stated, "Your daughter is all right and doing well. But I have been so poorly, I have not been to my own home yet; but as you are anxious to see her, she shall come next week to you. Yours truly, Mrs. Sullivan"—Mrs. Butler did not know of my sending these post-cards—I had been poorly—my say<lb/>ing, "I have not been to my own home yet" was done to evade them, not Mrs. Broughton—it was to the mother, not to Mrs. Broughton—I signed that post-card to Mrs. Amstrong "Mrs. Sullivan" because I was under the assumed name of Mrs. Sullivan to them—I said, "My own home" to</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The following post-card was then read:</hi>—"Dear Nancy, I have been poorly, but Eliza is all right and doing well; but if her mother wishes to see her I will send her up to London next week with a friend of mine.

I was to pay for them—I think the sum was to be fixed when she gave me the girls up—I was to see what sort of girls they were, and then the money which she wanted for them was to be fixed—she was to bring two to Waterloo Station—I was going to take both to Winchester—Mrs. Butler had promised to take care of them—after having made that inquiry I went down to Winchester and told Mrs. Butler what I had done—I came up on the Saturday, and met you at Waterloo Station; the girls were not there—there had been some small mistake—I went down there again, and was cheated that time—the girl was brought in and ran away after I had paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her—it was a gay house I went to at Lady Lake Grove—when I went down there I asked for one—I had not been there before—I told you that I was much disappointed about that failure, and I said I would have to go amongst my old friends—I was very reluctant to do so, and I told you that I would only go amongst my old friends on con<lb/>dition that you would not prosecute them—I did not want my old friends exposed in any way whatever—you said to me that I had not to go and send any one out to seek fresh girls, but only to get girls that were in stock—I think I saw you somewhere on the Tuesday, but I forget where it was—it was in the night-time, I believe, after I had been to Charles Street—I told you then that I had been to a bad woman who lived in a bad house—I meant the other person; you were mistaken in believing; that I meant Mrs. Broughton—I think it was in Spencer Street I saw the little sister of the woman who had been on the streets—I did not know her name—I saw a little girl at Mrs. Broughton's, but I saw another little girl in Spencer Street—that was not the same girl "who in all probability would be seduced and follow the profession of her married sister"—I told you that I had not told Margaret Fann what I wanted her for; you have mixed it up as it is written here—I did not tell you I told Margaret Fann what I wanted her sister for, but at the other house where I had gone to in Spencer Street there was a little girl brought to me there—"When this woman entered a brothel in—Street, M—," that I took to mean Spencer Street—I believe I told you Spencer Street; I feel sure I did—I told you on the Tuesday that I had seen a little girl that night, but her mother had refused to let her come with me—I think I told you on the Tuesday night about Mrs. Armstrong refusing to let her little girl go with me—if I did mention it I only mentioned it as one of my many failures—I did not see you again until the Wednesday night at Albany Street—then I told you about Mrs. Armstrong, that Mrs. Armstrong had had a sovereign, and that the other money was going to Mrs. Broughton—I always worked on my own account in my past dealings—it is usual to pay the procuress, and then sometimes she and</p>

Amelie Humbert was to bring her by Southampton to Winchester—she is my private secretary—it was a very great disappointment to me as well as to Rebecca Jarrett that the child did not come—I know the letter of 10th June which has been put in from Rebecca to Mrs. Broughton—I was aware of it a few days after<lb/>wards—Rebecca by my directions left Hope Cottage on 11th July—she</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the Salvation "Army," and live at the headquarters in Paris, in the Avenue Laumiere—I recol<lb/>lect Rebecca Jarrett arriving in company with Mrs. Combe and the child in Paris, on, I think, the 14th of June—I was not told how the child was brought to Paris, or how she had got possession of her—I was simply told briefly that she had been rescued, and that I was to look after the child kindly, and I did so—the child seemed very much attached to Rebecca—I recollect the Friday evening, 5th of June, when Rebecca left, the day after she arrived—I recollect her speaking to the child and giving her kindly advice as she was leaving, and on part<lb/>ing with her she kissed the child and told her to be good—she said, "Your mother did not give you to me for service, but for something worse."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">from a statement handed in by Stead</hi>). I have been editor of the <hi rend="smallCaps">PALL MALL GAZETTE</hi> since the midsummer of 1883—I had since 1871 been connected with the press—since my connection with the press I have constantly written in favour of the alteration of the law for the protection of women, and I was cognisant of the labours of the Committee of the House of Lords on this subject, on the amendment of the Criminal Law, in 1883 and in 1884; I was aware of the various Bills for the protection of women that passed the House of Lords, and were in some way defeated in the House of Commons; and I, as a public writer, dis<lb/>cussed those measures as they appeared from time to time, and constantly pressed for their amendment in the sense of further protection being</p>

               <p>given to women and girls—Mr. Benjamin Scott was also very much inte<lb/>rested in this question; I may say his letter upon the subject of the foreign traffic in English girls was one of the determining causes which made me come to London from Darlington in 1881, where I edited the <hi rend="italic">Northern Echo</hi> for nine years—one of the determining causes for my join<lb/>ing the London press was in order that I might the more efficiently advo<lb/>cate this cause—Mr. Benjamin Scott had a committee of his own, meeting on the subject in order to promote the improvement of the law; and he communicated with me on the subject on the 23rd of May of this year, the day after the Criminal Law Amendment Bill was talked out in the Com<lb/>mons—I called on him on the subject of the failure of the Bill, the absolute sacrifice of it as I was told—Mr. Scott and I went together, and saw Mr. Bramwell Booth on that subject that afternoon—the subject of our con<lb/>versation was the further protection for women and girls—I had previously received communications from Booth on the subject—and he, as well as Mr. Scott and myself, was interested in this subject—we discussed what best might be done in order to promote the cause I had at heart, with the view of getting facts—we did not know what could be done then, but what I did say was that before anything was done we ought to get to know the facts—Mr. Scott did not assist me in getting acquainted with Rebecca Jarrett—he took me across to the Guildhall to give me some information—he had nothing whatever to do with Rebecca Jarrett—from Mr. Booth I learnt that there was such a person as Rebecca Jarrett—he wrote to Mrs. Butler at my request, and sent up Jarrett on Whit Monday—I went to Bee Mr. John Morley, my predecessor on the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> shortly after I left town, and I communicated with Lord Dalhousie, who was the Chairman of the Committee of the House of Lords—he had introduced the Criminal Law Amendment Bill into the House of Lords—I first saw Jarrett on Whit Monday afternoon, the 25th May; she brought with her a letter of introduction from Mrs. Butler; I have it somewhere; I do not think it is here; there were several things of a private nature in it—I have no objection to putting it in if necessary; it was merely an introduction—I had a long conversation with Jarrett; about two hours I think—I questioned her very closely as to her past experience in the business of procuring girls—she gave me a considerable number of details of a very ghastly character—I told her that if all was true that she told me, she must prove it; it was too horrible to be believed merely upon the word of a person like her—she objected, and I insisted—I told her that if she was truly repentant she ought not to object to help us in this matter, or to help me, I do not know which, but you will see that it is immaterial from my point of view; that she deserved, if what she said was true, to be hanged in this world and damned in the next, and the least she could do was to make what reparation she could for the crimes which she had confessed—I think that argument had weight with her—I said that if she had procured girls for dissolute men she must procure some girls for me, as if I were a dissolute man—I said, "If what you say is true, there are girls who are in the market who are sold to brothel-keepers; if that is so, the best way to prove it is to go and buy in the market; will you go and buy for me one, two, or more girls who are in stock, and who would probably be sold"—I may have said, "who would be sold to some one else if you do not buy them"—she hesitated, and said she must ask Mrs. Butler—I had a long</p>

               <p>conversation, and I explained to her that, having bought the girls, instead of ruining them as they would be ruined in the ordinary course of business, we intended to rescue the girls, and then be able to use the facts of such purchase in such a way as to render all such purchases in future impossible or dangerous—I pressed upon her the consideration that if she would do this thing she would be the means of saying far more girls than all those whom she admitted she had helped to ruin in the past—she was much perplexed, and left me to go to Mr. Bramwell Booth, to whom she had a note from Mrs. Butler—that was the end of that interview—I did not see her again until the Saturday following, the 30th of May—in the interval I saw Mr. Booth—it was in the interval between these two days when I saw Jarrett on the Monday, and when I saw her again on the Saturday, that I met Mrs. Butler and Mr. Bramwell Booth—Mrs. Butler confused that with the prior interview—the inter<lb/>view between us three was in the interval between the Monday and Saturday—Mrs. Butler's narrative is substantially correct, with this difference, that Mrs. Butler and Mr. Booth, and subsequently Mr. Benjamin Scott, came a few days later I think—I had said that I was to employ Rebecca—I was instructing Jarrett, and I regarded myself as having the sole responsibility for what she did—I told them that—it was quite distinctly understood—I said so to both Mr. Booth and Mrs. Butler—I did not ask them, and would not ask them, to share any responsibility for the purchase; what they had to do was to help to take care of the girls after I bought them—that is what I said to Mr. Booth particularly—the "examination" was not mentioned as I remember—I said I was to purchase the children who were in stock, and who would be ruined it I did not buy them—at this interview I had not discovered Madame Mourez—Mrs. Butler and Mr. Scott had agreed to contribute to the expense of this inquiry, but as they never did con<lb/>tribute, perhaps I may explain how they did not—it was a guarantee fund in case the inquiry resulted in nothing, whereas I said if the inquiry results in facts which are publishable, of course the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> will pay the expense; I could ask the proprietors to pay the expense of the inquiry—I have no pecuniary interest in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> abso<lb/>lutely none; I get my salary—the guarantee fund was to be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I personally, out of my private means, undertaking to meet 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one-half of that; the other half was to be made up by the other guarantors, by Mr. Booth and Mrs. Butler, and subsequently Mr. Scott came in—I do not know whether Mr. Scott's was his personally or on behalf of the committee; but as the inquiry resulted in matter which we did publish in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> the expense of the inquiry was borne by the proprietors—the inquiry cost about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—Mr. Booth advanced altogether about 40<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> he advanced it at various times; the first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on the Friday, the 29th of May; that which was sent down to Mrs. Jarrett at Winchester at my request—that was advanced for me—he knew what it was for; it was for the purchase of two girls, who were to be delivered at Water<lb/>loo Station next day, but they were not; and at various times he paid the expense of Eliza Armstrong going over to Paris, but I considered myself bound to recoup him for his expenses in this inquiry—the reason I didn't advance the money out of my own pocket was that the person that went to Winchester was a member of the Salvation "Army," a young lady called Miss Peck, and she left from headquarters and went down;</p>

               <p>she called at the office—I would have advanced it, but Bramwell Booth had the money in his pocket at the time, and he handed Jarrett the money at my request—Jarrett left on the Tuesday and came back on the Wednesday—Miss Peck went down on the Friday with the money—I think I did not see Miss Peck, to have any communication—I got a message from Jarrett through Miss Peck, and in consequence of that message I expected to receive two girls at the Waterloo Station on that Saturday—I went to Waterloo Station to receive two girls—I didn't find them—on Thursday, the 28th of May, I re<lb/>ceived a letter from Mrs. Butler—I have it, but not here—Rebecca told me the same story that I had previously heard from Miss Peck to the effect that she had arranged for the delivery of two girls at Waterloo station that day—three were to be brought, out of which I was to select two—Mrs. Butler had previously told me that she would like to buy the third one, in order to save her from what appeared to be her inevitable fate—Jarrett said they were to be brought by a brothel-keeper down Whitechapel way, and when they did not come she explained it on the ground that possibly a letter had miscarried, that she was not sure about the address, and there might have been some mistake—I do not know whether I saw Jarrett again until the eve of the Derby Day, that is the Tuesday, the 2nd of June—I saw her at the house of a friend—I will give the name of the friend, in Oxford Street—Jarrett then told me of her failure to secure the girls down Whitechapel way, she had been to see the brothel-keeper, and asked how it was she had not delivered the children according to contract—she said that she had expected a letter from her confirming the bargain—Rebecca said she had written but the number was wrong; she discovered that the number, was wrong—that was on the Saturday—the brothel-keeper promised on the following Monday to get her a little girl—on Monday she had gone to get the girl, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down for a girl as half the purchase-money, and the girl, hearing that Jarrett was going to take her into the country, bolted, and got out of a cab where Jarrett was—Jarrett also told me that she had found it more difficult than she expected owing to her having been out of the business, and that it was necessary for her to go and take lodgings in some notorious street; that she had taken them in Albany Street, in what she believed at the time she took the lodgings to be a gay house, in the hope that the landlady might put her in the way of buying the girls in connection with the house, and ripening for seduction, as you may say; finding them first, and then buying them; that she had found out that the house was not a gay house, at least they denied that it was, but she then had suspicions—at Albany Street she said she had to go back to her old friends, which she was very reluctant to do, and although she had gone so far, she would not carry the negotiations further unless I would promise most solemnly not to expose any of her old friends or acquaintances—I promised—I did not wish, I told her, to expose individuals, I had no wish to incriminate any person who helped her in bringing to light the facts, that if her friends helped her to buy a girl in stock, I would take care not to bring their names out—she said she had been among her friends, and had been to a woman whom she had described as a bad woman living in a bad house, she had linked this woman to help her and a little girl was offered her—something was said about a little girl, but I do not remember the exact words—this</p>

               <p>little girl had a sister who was on the streets getting her living, and who was in the house of this bad woman when Jarrett visited it—she had hopes that she would get this child the next day—she told me that the sister, who was on the streets, understood exactly what the girl was wanted for—its father was dead, its mother was far away, and this elder sister was, she did not use the word "guardian," but had charge of the child—that was in substance of what Jarrett told me on the 2nd June—she told me that she had to go back again next day if I was willing to give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the child on condition she was pure—I said of course I would buy the child if the child was for sale; and she had my authority to go next day and buy the child, and I said I would go to Albany Street to tea and see the child—I went next day to Albany Street in consequence of that arrangement, about 5 o'clock I think—I found Eliza Armstrong, Jarrett, and Miss Peck there—I first had some conversation with Rebecca about the girl—Eliza Armstrong and Miss Peck went into the other room—I had two conversations with Rebecca when Eliza Armstrong was not present—one was when I first went into the house, and the other after tea; but I cannot exactly remember when—there is one thing I am quite sure was before tea, Robecca said "This is not the little girl that I expected to get, that little girl that I told you about last night has another sister who is in service, and this sister hearing of the intended destination intervened"—that was the substance—"this is another little girl whose mother has got to know of the bargain and suggested to the woman who was procuring her that her Eliza would do"—she was a drunken woman, she told me; and then she said to Mrs. Broughton "Won't our Eliza do?" and Mrs. Broughton said "No; she is going to have another little girl," or "to get a little girl"—I have got awfully mixed about the little girls, and more so since I came into Court—she might have said <hi rend="italic">the</hi> other little girl—Jarrett said, when she went back, Mrs. Armstrong renewed her proposal and offered Eliza to Mrs. Broughton—I said to Jarrett, "Are you sure the mother knew what her child was wanted for?"—Jarrett said, "Quite sure; I told her that she was wanted for a man, that she must be a pure girl"—she told me she had asked Mrs. Broughton also whether Eliza was a pure girl, and Mrs. Broughton said something about Eliza messing about with boys in the street; romping about, I suppose, she meant—she had told Mrs. Broughton that if Eliza was in the habit of romping about with boys in the streets she might not be pure, and if she was not pure she would not serve her purpose, so she was particular in asking Mrs. Armstrong about her daugh<lb/>ter being a pure girl—she mentioned Mrs. Armstrong's name, I presume; I do not remember particularly, but I think she did—I think she called her "the mother" mostly—that the mother said she was pure; and, on that understanding, Rebecca agreed to take her—she said she got new clothes for the child, and dressed her up in them—before that, before she went to bid the mother good-bye, she said that she had given Mrs. Armstrong a sovereign for her Eliza—I think Rebecca used the phrase, "a golden sovereign;" put it into her hand for her Eliza, and that she had given Mrs. Broughton 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the rest had to be sent to her, "if the girl was proved to be pure"—Rebecca added that it was a proof of the confidence which Mrs. Broughton had in her that she was willing to take the verdict of Rebecca's doctor, instead of having her examined by her own, as was the case when strangers were dealing—she described</p>

               <p>Mrs. Broughton as a bad woman, who lived in a bad house; I under<lb/>stood that she was a brothel-keeper, but I could not say that she used the phrase brothel-keeper—in point of fact, having a doctor doing her business, but not constantly in employment—Rebecca also said that she had dressed the child and sent her to bid her parents good-bye—she told me her mother had gone out drinking, and that the father, who was lying down, did not care enough about his daughter to ask where she was going—I do not remember whether she said drunk or not—I think Jarrett told me that the father was told the girl was going to a situation, but I do not think that it was just at that time—I think that it was at Albany Street—I do not remember Jarrett using the words that the father thought his child was going to service, but Jarrett said that she had asked the mother twice or thrice over if she was quite willing for the child to go; that the mother said, "Yes;" and, to give her a last chance, I think that was the phrase, of relenting, she had sent the child back, dressed in its new clothes, so that the mother might relent, and not let her daughter go; the father being indifferent about his daughter, indifferent in not caring sufficient about her to ask where she was going to—Jarrett did not go to Mrs. Armstrong to ask her for the child—that Mrs. Armstrong came twice over, hearing a child was wanted for prostitution, and thrust the child upon Mrs. Broughton—these conversations between I and Jarrett lasted, I think, the first one about three minutes; and the second, when we were at tea, twenty to twenty-five minutes—I was most urgent with her—it was not merely a narra<lb/>tive, but questions put by me with a view of eliciting facts, because I felt bothered about it—I questioned her as to the mother's willingness to let the child go; as to the mother's knowledge of the destination; and as to the perfect indifference of the father to the fate of the child—I in<lb/>quired what sort of a child it was.</p>

               <p>"Are you Mrs. Sullivan?" and if it was Mrs. Sullivan, he was to take her into Madame Mourey—I gave him those directious, after leaving Albany Street, at my own office that evening—I kept him in the dark just then about the girl having been procured, because I did not know very much about him then—I went to Milton Street—I got there about 8 o'clock I think; it may have been about 9 o'clock—I do not think I went with Jacques—I went to Mr. Jacques there alter he had been there—the child was there in the house when I arrived, and I waited outside till they came out—when they came out Jacques and I followed to Poland Street—Jarrett, Eliza Armstrong, Jacques, and myself were there, nobody else—they were driven to Poland Street by Jacques's direction—Jacques had told me he had asked Madame Mourey to have the outrage consummated in her own establishment, as he said she allowed her house to be used for that purpose, but she declined—we knew the house in Poland Street was a brothel—I did not want to go there myself—I should have preferred to go to a swell house at the West End, but Jacques suggested that Poland Street was the safest—he told me that you could procure girls there, which I subsequently verified by having one brought by the brothel-keeper for me—having arrived at Poland Street, Jarrett and the child went into the house, accompanied by Jacques and myself—I hired two rooms, and ordered liquor to be brought by the woman of the house, so as to bring her into the room where the child was—the liquor was supplied in that room—Jacques and I went into one room, leaving Jarrett and the child in the other—I should have mentioned that on leaving Madame Mourey's, Mr. Jacques produced to me the phial of chloroform, for which, he said, he had paid the midwife 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she remarking that Eliza was very little, and that it would hurt her very much when she was outraged; and he said, "Had not you better give me something to alleviate the pain?" and she sold him the chloroform for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the certificate of her vir<lb/>ginity—Jacques told me the examination which had taken place was almost momentary, and there had been no objection made—the child was restless, and I suggested to Jarrett that she had better see if she could doze her over by putting some chloroform on a handkerchief—the child has told you what happened; she did not like the smell, and pushed it away—I went into the room, and she cried out, "There's a man in the room, take me home;" and I went out very rapidly, and did not return; I had had enough after the child cried out—I soon afterwards left the house, and one reason why I left was, the brothel-keeper came and knocked at the door, and said that the time was up, showing that she knew the reason the room was taken—we were there a little longer than an hour—on leaving the house I told Jacques that we had proved very well that women received children for that purpose—I then dismissed Jacques, and Jarrett and the child and I went to Dr. Heywood Smith, and then to Nottingham Place, where the child was examined at my desire, with the object to clear myself; and also to enable me to say to Mr. Bramwell Booth, when I asked him to take care of the child, that I had not sent a girl to him that would prove in the family-way—there was a general understanding that Mr. Bramwell Booth would take charge of any child from the Saturday—I think I told him on the Tuesday that I expected to get a child, and asked him to arrange to have a good trustworthy woman to take the child I expected to get the next night across to France—I spoke to him that night and told him I had a child and wanted her taken</p>

               <p>charge of—before I had taken the child to Nottingham Place I saw him briefly, just to say I had a girl, and then I saw him afterwards when I explained all the circumstances—I arranged with Mr. Bramwell Booth that he had to supply me with a trustworthy woman to take the child to France—on the Tuesday I asked him, so far as I remember, I may be wrong, to have some one to take the child to France—I know it was before Wednesday, because he brought the woman on Wednesday—on the Wednesday I told him by telegram or otherwise to come and bring the trustworthy person to meet me at the only place where I knew I was going to that night, Dr. Heywood Smith's—my impression is that I talked generally to him on the Tuesday because nothing was specifically settled—I did not know the child was coming—I could not make a definite arrangement—I could only ask him some time before I got there, to meet me with this trustworthy person at Dr. Heywood Smith's, and I believe I saw him with Madame Combe—after going to Nottingham Place I saw him again at a friend's in Oxford Street—I told him the story that the child was sold by her mother and Mrs. Broughton—I told him fully all that I had learnt from Mrs. Jarrett in the course of that afternoon, and we agreed there and then that having | bought the child, which Mrs. Armstrong had twice over offered to sell to prostitution, we would not let that child go back to that mother unless we were driven to it—I said she had twice over asked if Eliza Armstrong would suit when Rebecca Jarrett was asking for a girl for a man—next morning I met the child and Rebecca Jarrett and Madame Combe at the railway station and saw them off—I did not speak to any of them, I think—I did not know myself the detailed address to which the child was going in Paris, only that she was going to the Salvation Army Place—I, shortly after her departure, desired Mr. Bramwell Booth to communicate to Paris for me—it was in conversation—I met him at the railway station when the child went off—this "something" was said after the child had gone to Paris—I had made no arrangement about Rebecca before she left—I did not intend Rebecca to go to Paris, but the child would not part from Rebecca—she would not go without her, so I had to send Rebecca, and that entailed the inconvenience of Rebecca not being able to pay the money over to Mrs. Broughton the next day, and so I told Mr. Booth—I do not think Mr. Jacques knew where the child had gone or what I did with her until long after—he only did what I employed him to do—I considered that I had handed over the child to the Salvation "Army," and that all I had to look after was the payment of the money to Mrs. Broughton—on the after<lb/>noon, I think, of the next day I received from Mr. Bramwell Booth a sealed letter from Dr. Heywood Smith, containing the certificate—this was dated June 4th, 1885, addressed, "18, Harley Street, Cavendish Square: I hereby certify that I have this day examined Eliza Arm<lb/>strong, ✗etat thirteen, and find her <hi rend="italic">virgo intacta,</hi> and I am convinced that no one has ever attempted criminal intercourse with her.

               <p>shown the letter Eliza had written by Mr. Bramwell Booth—I have the letter here, and I will produce it—it has not been put in yet—this is what is called the "suppressed letter"—the date on the letter is the 8th of June—I saw it after the 9th of June when was the division which changed the Government—Mr. Booth said "What are we to do with this letter?"—I read it through, and I had considerable doubt what to do about the matter—from one point of view it would have been very good to have sent it to the mother, but from what seemed to me the chief point of view, that the mother should not get the child again to sell her to vice, I thought it was better to suppress the letter, and I suppressed the letter accordingly, and it is here—the letter was as follows: "My dear Mother,—I right these few lines to you hopping you are quite well. I am very happy. I have got a good home. I got good cloveing. I am in France. I goes in the park every night give my love to my brothers and sisters don't fret about I as plenty to eat. They are very kind to I like the place very much. I am going to another place soon. I will come and see you soon as I can. How is little Charley giting on. I hope you are gitting on. I am a good girl, they likes me very much. How is Miss Woodworth gitting on. That all I got to say at preasant. 'As I was in bed," &amp;c.—it was dated "8-6-85"—the address upon it was illegible—I did not alter that address—I do not know who did—it has been altered in order to make it illegible, I should think for the same reason as that for which I suppressed the letter, in case the letter was sent to the mother so that the mother should not know the child's address if the letter had been sent on to her—it was altered in that way when it came to me—I think I kept the letter until I handed it over—I had a conversation with Mr. Booth about it at the time I received it—I made the remark to Mr. Booth "Why this address looks as if it was altered"—I think he said, so far as I remember, "Yes, it is some of our stupid people in Paris have been doing that"—I could not charge my memory with it exactly, but I do not think there is any question about it, although I could not say he told me; my impression was that the address was a right address at first, and was subsequently altered in order to avoid giving the the mother a clue to where her child was, so that she might regain the child, that she only wanted to get in order to sell to vice again—that was my idea—I acted upon that information all through, the statement made to me—my first article in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> on this subject was published on the 6th of July, except I may have occasionally, and probably did, inquire how she was getting on; I think that is all, and I heard she was getting on very well—I thought Rebecca Jarrett had come back from Paris—that article of 6th July, contains the story of Lily, says that I was prepared to lay before the Archbishop of Canterbury and other people, the evidence that I had received, on condition that nobody was prosecuted; that there was no exposure of individuals—it was not in the story of Lily that that was stated, but it was in the same number of the paper that contained the story—it was all one article—it was an article that extended over four pages, I think; and on the second page there was a statement that I was willing to place full particulars, names, dates, and places, for every</p>

T. Reid, the Queen's Counsel—before that Committee sat Mrs. Butler told me that the man Sullivan had been to Winchester—upon learning that I gave instructions as to where Rebecca should go—I do not know that I issued an order, but I talked to Mr. Bramwell Booth and we agreed that she had better be sent out of the country, because I said Sullivan would break her head—that was the only reason I had whatever for asking her to go to Jersey—I never saw Sullivan—I was never at Winchester—Mrs. Butler reported to me—all I knew about the matter was from Mrs. Butler—Jarrett never wrote to me—the Mansion House Committee sat in the course of that month of July four times—I produced before that Committee Rebecca Jarrett on the last two occasions—Eliza Armstrong was not produced, she was in France at that time—Mr. Thomas appeared before that Committee on the last sitting, on the 29th, as the representative of Mrs. Armstrong, Mrs. Broughton, and company—Mr. Thomas produced Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Broughton before the Mansion House Committee—there was a number of little girls there—I think Jane Farrer was produced—they were examined by Mr. Reid—I should fancy I first knew, not that the police were inquiring, but that the mother went to the police-court, and that would be the day after she did go to the police-court—Saturday, the 11th July, would be the first time I should hear about it I think, but the police had made no inquiries at that time—it was simply reading a report in the papers, and I saw that Mrs. Armstrong had appeared before Mr. Cooke, and that he had scolded her and had said she was a very negligent woman, and so on—I do not know whether I took any part in the changes of residence of the child or not—I may have been consulted—I took no leading part in the charge—that was done by people belonging to the Salvation "Army"—I do not exactly know when she came from L'Oriol to Paris—I had told Mr. Bramwell Booth that considering the row that had been kicked up about the child he had better have the child ready for delivering to the mother whenever she wanted it—I knew of her coming back, and assented to it—I knew from Mr. Booth of his interviews with Inspector Borner; he told me at the time—I saw the letter that he wrote to Inspector Borner, in which he expresses the expectation of hearing from the police if Mrs. Armstrong wanted her child back—I asked him from time to time—I inquired whether the police had made any com<lb/>munication, or whether the mother had made any communication, or whether any one had asked him for the child—I learnt not—I was told that the mother asked for the child on the 1st July interview, and he talked to the mother and she was mollified, and she went away to con<lb/>sult her husband as to what she wanted—I understood she was to let him know, either personally or through the police, and I asked him from time to time, if she had ever told him, either personally or through the police, and he said "Never," and the last communication I had from him was the letter, stating that the police had asked him to</p>

               <p>leave the matter over until the 24th—I wrote on the 22nd August to the mother, because on the previous night I had taken, publicly, the sole responsibility for Eliza Armstrong—it was the first time I had ever done so—that was at the meeting at St. James's Hall—on the 22nd I wrote to the mother, after I had seen Mr. Catlin, of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Newspaper,</hi> who told me I might take it from him that the mother wanted her child, but the mother would not come and tell Mr. Bramwell Booth she did—Mr. Catlin was the first person who delivered to me any desire of the mother to have the child back—I saw him imme<lb/>diately before the Hyde Park Demonstration, on that Saturday, and I wrote that letter immediately after the Hyde Park Demonstration—Mr. Thicknesse and Mr. Jacques brought me a verbal answer to that letter—Mr. Jacques accompanied Mr. Thicknesse as my messenger with the letter—on the 23rd August they saw the mother—they could not see her on the Saturday night—they saw her with regard to the journey down to Wim<lb/>bledon on the Monday—Eliza arrived on Sunday, 23rd—I asked Mr. Bramwell Booth to send her over to me that I might have her at my house, so that if the mother did want her she should not be eight or twelve hours off—the interview was on Monday—I told Mr. Thicknesse he had to get the receipt for the child signed—it may have been my handwriting—I do not know whether it was my handwriting, or whether Mr. Thicknesse wrote it, but the nature of it I indicated beforehand—Mr. Thicknesse will be called—I knew the contents of it, if I did not write it—I think this is Mr. Thicknesse's own handwriting, it is not my handwriting—it corresponds with the signature at the foot—that was handed to me on his return by Mr. Thicknesse, or by Mr. Jacques, I will not be sure which—I was busy getting the paper out, so that I could not go down; and I therefore asked Mr. Jacques to go down, as I might have asked any one else—Jacques is not employed in my office; I only employed him in these investigations—I asked him to go with Mr. Thicknesse on the Saturday night to see Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong—he went on the Saturday; and then I think on the Sunday night I asked him to go to Wimbledon on my behalf with Mr. Thicknesse—I told Mr. Thicknesse my wishes—my instructions to Jacques were, to endeavour to save Eliza Armstrong from the pollution of going back to Charles Street, and hearing the whole question discussed about the Lily story, and that the best thing would be to offer heranot her situation where her mother could see her and see that all was right; but if, after those considerations being presented to the mother's mind, the mother still wished for the child, the mother was to have her—the child went away with her mother.</p>

Except what Rebecca Jarrett told me, I had no authority for the state<lb/>ments made in the article of 6th July—the latter part relating to the midwife in Poland Street does not depend upon Jarrett only, but the first part depends upon Jarrett only—I had Jarrett's word, and Jarrett's word only, for the description of the purchase of the child—the whole of the article, from the first down to the asterisks just at the bottom, relates to Eliza Armstrong—"I can personally vouch for the absolute accuracy of every fact in the narrative;" that was the statement made by myself—there are three sections in that article—the first section, relating to the purchase, depends upon the statement of Rebecca Jarrett, whom I employed, and who informed me what she was going to do before she did it, and who informed me what she did afterwards—the second section depends upon Mr. Jacques, who I employed, and the third on my own personal knowledge—when I said "I can personally vouch for the abso<lb/>lute accuracy of every fact in the narrative" I meant that I had actually, by my agents, done every step in that narrative—that was my idea—I, by myself or my agents, had been all through it personally—if the inter<lb/>pretation is that I can personally vouch for what occurred with regard to the purchase I am wrong—I mean there to say that I personally believed it, and did it through my own agents—I regarded this as very im<lb/>portant—it was the only thing that I had done myself right round, and therefore I could speak to it—the others were given to me by other parties—I took the greatest care to be accurate in what I put down—so far as the communication from Jarrett was concerned I did my utmost to put down exactly what she told me, but I did not put it down at the time—to the best of my memory what is in the paper corresponds exactly with what Jarrett told me on the 2nd and 3rd June—I had no statement from Rebecca Jarrett on any day after that prior to the 6th July—I wrote the article myself—the copy is in my own hand<lb/>writing—I think I wrote it about the 30th June or somewhere about that time—that was nearly four weeks after the conversation—I do not think I made any notes of any of the facts at the time or shortly after—I do not remember having done so—I certainly made no notes at the time she</p>

               <p>told me—I do not remember putting any notes down—"Lily was a little cockney child," that referred to Eliza Armstrong, and the whole article referred to Eliza Armstrong—I re-published this article as a twopenny periodical, not after the passing of the Act—the article was published the next week, and the Criminal Law Amend<lb/>ment Bill was not passed until August, as you will very well remember—I went on selling it after the Act had passed—this article when repub<lb/>lished, had to be republished in a sixteen page extra as we call them—there were nine columns too much, and my proprietor had great objection to the publication of the articles as they stood, and still more to the republication of them—the consequence was they were not republished by us for some days—a piratic version was brought out, which was selling in the streets—Mr. Thompson then consented to republish them on condition that it was an expurgated edition—it was handed over to my assistant to make it as clean as it could be made, and certain passages were struck out—I mentioned it to the Mansion House Committee that that child had been put under chloroform a second time that night—in the course of these proceedings I had not till Dr. Heywood Smith was examined—so many people got into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> through helping me, I was not going to bring more into it than I could help—I produced the certificate to the Mansion House Committee—I think Mr. Poland demanded the medical certificate from Mr. Waddy at Bow Street—I had got it in my possession at the time—the demand was addressed to the Salvation "Army" Solicitor, not to me—it would have been more candid and straight<lb/>forward to produce it, but I thought I should get Dr. Smith into trouble if I produced it; that is the sole reason—I did not desire to get Dr. Smith into trouble; that was solely the reason—supposing there had been no question of getting any one into trouble I should have told them at once, although the demand was not addressed to me—I received at Bow Street, on 5th September, a notice in writing, to produce a letter written by Eliza Armstrong in the month of June, 1885, when in Paris, and addressed to her mother, Elizabeth Armstrong, of Charles Street, Lisson Grove, con<lb/>taining the lines quoted in the article in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> of 6th July, 1885, headed, "A child of thirteen bought for5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," beginning, "As I was in my bed"—that is the letter produced to-day—the question came up for discussion among the Counsel and I was told I had better not produce that letter in the police-court proceedings at that stage of the proceedings—I had no Counsel; but, of course, we are all in company, the defendants—I heard read by Mr. Waddy on Friday a letter of 4th August, written by the mother to Mr. Bramwell Booth—I had previously heard the mother repeat the contents of that letter in the police-court—I have never seen that letter yet—I first heard of its existence in the police-court when the mother recited it—that is when I first heard that she even alleged that she had written one—I never heard of its existence until Mr. Waddy stood up there and mentioned it—I did not believe that the mother had ever sent the letter—that is exactly why I always argued, I did not send for the child at once—I did not believe she had ever written it either then—I heard when Mr. Poland called for the letter and called for the notice to produce, Mr. Waddy say Mr. Poland was going through a farce, he never had received it—I should think, as near as I can remember, I told Mr. Bramwell Booth to send for the child very shortly after the meeting of the Mansion House</p>

               <p>Committee, that would be the 29th—he promised to bring the child home some time between the 29th, when I first saw the mother at the Mansion House Committee, and 5th August—Mr. Bramwell Booth showed me a letter on 5th August asking, as I thought it wise, for the child to come back—I do not think from the time I got Eliza Armstrong up until Mr. Thicknesse went on 22nd August, that I ever made any inquiries about either the father or the mother, excepting seeing the mother and hearing her tell her story to the Mansion House Committee—from first to last I never made any inquiries as to the details of the transaction, but I did as to the character of the street and people and among the neighbours, and that kind of thing—I made the inquiries as to the Armstrongs' character from people in Charles Street—I never went to Charles Street; I asked friends to go—I myself made no inquiries either as to the Armstrongs from the 3rd June right down to the 22nd August—my understanding is that the only brothel re<lb/>ferred to in this article is Mrs. Broughton's house—I understood a bad house and a bad woman to mean a "brothel," and I wrote a "brothel"—Rebecca Jarrett had told me that Mrs. Broughton's house was a bad house—I will not say she said Mrs. Broughton's house, but the house she went to—I have represented it as Mrs. Broughton's house—I do not know whether she told us at the Mansion House that Mrs. Broughton was a person who had lived in service with her at Claridge's Hotel—before I wrote this article she never told me that she had lived as fellow-servant with Mrs. Broughton, to the best of my remembrance—I understood that Mrs. Broughton kept a brothel; I may have misunderstood her, but that was my understanding—I have tried quite recently to find out this woman who lodged in the house—I believe it was on Friday night I tried to find her—the procuress was Jarrett—the whole of this I wrote from what Jarrett told me, the first part of it, as closely as I could possibly remember—I think Jarrett told me "It was agreed that she should be handed over to the procuress for the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> while the negotiations were going on, a drunken neighbour came into the house, and so little concealment was then used that she speedily became aware of the naure of the transaction. So far from being horrified at the proposed sale of the girl, she whispered eagerly to the seller, 'Don't you think she would take our Lily?"—Jarrett told me that on the Wednesday, not on the Tuesday—I never heard of it on the Tuesday night—I think it is quite possible she may have said "while the negotiations were going on," in relation to the Tuesday night or Wednesday morning—I think the obvious meaning is, that I intended to represent there that on the Tues<lb/>day night the mother had offered her child; but I think, at the same time, when you ask me a question like this, whether I was told then or not, I may have been misled—I was endeavouring to write the story down with the greatest possible accuracy; I say that what I do remember was that I heard nothing of this drunken neighbour until the Wednesday; that is the only point I am absolutely clear about—I heard Jarrett cross-examined—she never told me on the Tuesday that Lily's mother ever absolutely refused to let her child go; I never heard anything on Tues<lb/>day about Lily's mother—she did not tell me at the conversation of Wed<lb/>nesday, when she gave me the details, speaking of Lily's mother, that Lily's mother on the Tuesday had refused to let her go—I know nothing more about Mrs. Armstrong than what is here—I think I understood that</p>

               <p>the thrusting the daughter forward which I have referred to in the witness<lb/>box was one thrusting on the Tuesday and the next thrusting on the Wed<lb/>nesday, but I cannot say that Jarrett really gave me to understand so at the time—I may have misunderstood Jarrett—I have no doubt that Jarrett told me that "she was living respectably in a situation, and, on hearing of the fate reserved for the little one, she lost no time in persuading her dissolute sister to break off the bargain"—I have not found the respectable person who saved her sister from this frightful fate—I have tried to find that respectable person—I made inquiries some time ago, and again on Friday night, which resulted in nothing—I do not remember who made the inquiries some time ago; it was about July 29th, I think, when that question came up—I remember the question being discussed as to who it was—I remember talking to Jarrett on July 29th as to where this person was, but I do not remember very much more what I did afterwards—I do not think a very serious endeavour was made—I think I may have asked some people on our paper to go up there—I think some one inquired—Jarrett told me "the brothel-keeper sent for her"—that is the mother—"and offered her a sovereign for her daughter"—I heard Jarrett swear a great many things which surprised me, because they did not agree with what she had told me, and I thought it pos<lb/>sible you had bothered her—until you put to Jarrett the questions you did I implicitly believed in Jarrett—I say I do not believe in her as implicitly as I did—I have not the same confidence in her memory as I had—I think she means to tell the truth—I went on to say "Her memory seems defective; but I have no doubt she intends to tell me the truth"—Jarrett told me this to the best of my memory—so far as I can remember, she told me "the father, who was also a drunken man, was told his daughter was going to a situation"—I have said so frequently—that all this story was written from her state<lb/>ment—I wrote it exactly as she told me, and even if I had not heard her evidence I should not have had the slightest doubt—she also told me, to the best of my belief, that he received the news with indifference, with<lb/>out even inquiring where she was going to—the incidents about Rich<lb/>mond and going to Hampton Court and to school were taken from herself, and the little verse was taken from the letter to the mother—I do not suggest that the father knew that she was bought for immoral purposes, only that he did not care anything about the child.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. ) I objected to criminal proceedings being taken against those who had given me information, first because I had obtained the information under the promise of secrecy, as I stated to Jarrett in that particular case; to have done so would have made me a common informer, who would have wormed himself into the confidence of persons who were criminal, and then appeared in the witness-box to punish them, and I had not been two or three days in the investigation when I found I could not do that—I will tell you exactly how it occurred to my mind: the first or second day that I was in a brothel, drinking champagne with the mistress of that brothel, and telling her lies about what I wanted, as I had to do, otherwise I would have been summarily ejected, I felt, after getting into her confidence in that way, I could not go and expose her personally; there are a dozen or more persons doing the same as this</p>

               <p>woman; I cannot find more than this woman (or only two or three more), who has helped me to ascertain what the system is, why should I be the means of punishing the one individual, out of a hundred equally guilty, who have enabled me to expose the system—I have stated that the police were prosecuting me, whilst they were allowing persons whom they could have prosecuted to go unprosecuted, and I think it is true—I have never communicated to the police any information as to any individual; I have said so, and I would not do so—the facts which were communicated to me were communicated under the influence, while I was drinking champagne and giving money pretty freely; that is the only way in which you can obtain any information concerning what goes on, to go to brothels and act as the people there do—I think the information so obtained is perfectly reliable—the police do this kind of thing constantly; as the detective force do assume those disguises, and worm themselves into people's confidence when engaged in dynamite conspiracies and otherwise, I think, in the interest of young girls, and for the exposure of an infernal system like this, they might and ought to worm themselves into the confidence of these people, it is their business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. My object was to get at this horrible state of things cost what it might—if I had communicated to the police I should have had to say that such and such a brothel-keeper is in the habit of procuring young girls—the Attorney-General has asked if I could possibly expect the police to do that kind of thing—can you expect me, after worming myself into the confidence of women, one tithe of the women, to select for punishment the only person who unwillingly helped me, while the other ninety-nine persons were all equally guilty?—I declared to Jarrett over and over again that I would not expose Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong or Mrs. Broughton—I had never mentioned Mrs. Armstrong or Mrs. Brougbton; not only that, but I have asked Mrs. Butler and Mr. Booth not to say anything to bring Mrs. Armstrong into trouble—I was told by Jarrett that the mother had sold the child—it did not occur to my mind that by pursuing this course I was tempting parents of poor children to commit the most horrible crime conceivable, for this reason, I have stated to the Court repeatedly it was only girls in the market that I wished to buy, and not other girls; for instance, there are many mothers who sell their daughters to be seduced as soon as they come to seducible age—that is my statement, and the statement made to me—I said to Jarrett and to others, "If you know of any such cases from the brothel-keepers, of girls who would be sold if I did not buy, will you buy them and hand them over to me?"—I mean to say that Eliza Armstrong was in the market, that was my impression, so I was told, that she had twice over been offered to Mrs. Broughton—I fully believed that if I had not taken Eliza Armstrong somebody else would have ruined her—that is the essence of my case.</p>

               <p>case as in the other—I say that I always gave the assurance that I would give the child up if the mother wished her back, if her mother really wished her back—I thought she would be used as a catspaw by those who had a spite against the Salvation "Army," and a spite against the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>—I knew on the evening of the 13th of July that she had applied to the Marylebone Police-court on the Saturday the 11th—when Mrs. Armstrong was examined at the Mansion House, on the 19th of July, I was in the room—it was not the police-court, but a private inquiry—the woman was very much affected there; she cried, and told her story—I do not remember speaking to her at all—nothing was said in my presence about her not wanting her child back, not that I know of—Jarrett had been previously examined without Mrs. Armstrong being present—Mr. Thomas was there—I do not think any question was put to Jarrett by anybody representing Mrs. Armstrong; but I do not remember exactly—I was not in the room from the time that Mrs. Armstrong came in and went out—I was there at the first part of her statement, but left in the middle of it—during the time I was there a suggestion was made to Mrs. Armstrong that she had sold her child—I think it was by Mr. Reid, to the best of my memory—to the best of my memory I will swear it—I mentioned the 19th just now, it was mis<lb/>take—it was the 29th; it extended over a fortnight; it began on the 11th and ended on the 29th July; and it was on the 29th that Mrs. Armstrong came down—I do not remember Mr. Thomas asking to be allowed to put some questions to Jarrett—I did not hear Mr. Reid say that it was wholly unnecessary—on the 29th July, truly or falsely, Mrs. Armstrong had come, and with more than tears; but with tears had told the Mansion House Committee she desired to have her child back—I think that was the substance of what she said—"I want my child," and then she burst out crying and said "I want to know who has taken her away," and all that kind of thing—I did not take any steps between 13th July and 22nd August to find out whether that mother wanted to have her child back or not, not in the way of going to Mrs. Armstrong; I went to Mr. Booth, because he was in communication with the police who had the case in hand—in the letter of 22nd August, 1885, I state, "I am informed to-day for the first time that you wish your daughter Eliza restored to you"—Mr. Cattlin had informed me; that was true—I had learned it by the two applications that she had made, one on 13th July and also on the 29th—Mr. Thomas brought Mrs. Armstrong down—she was lying under the shadow of a great charge—it was obviously her interest, I thought, to try to disprove that charge—she goes to the police-court in order to clear her character from that charge—she goes to the Mansion House and there says various things, which to my mind did not leave an impression that she wanted her child back; and I heard it further from Cardinal Manning, who was present—then on 31st July, two days after the Man<lb/>sion House Committee, Mr. Booth informed me that a detective had come down to say that he thought the mother was satisfied with the assurance that the child was well, and would leave it where it was—I heard on 13th July, or 11th July, and 29th July, that she wanted it in a kind of way; I heard her say that at the Mansion House—you have seen people of this kind crying, and their crying does not prove the sincerity of their feel<lb/>ings; there is a certain kind of drunken crying—she was not drunk, but she had that kind of maudlin way, and my impression was the same as</p>

               <p>Cardinal Manning's, and I talked to him about it, and I did not think that at the Mansion House she formulated a demand "I really want my child back"—I thought she was more anxious to know who had taken her child away, and whether her child was quite safe, than any<lb/>thing else; and two days afterwards the police, who were in constant communication with the woman, said that she would be satisfied with an assurance that the child was well, and would let her stop; then I thought it was all nonsense; I thought Mr. Thomas had put her up to it—I thought that was correct, having regard to what had happened previ<lb/>ously—I must qualify that to this extent: that if you take the literal mean<lb/>ing of that phrase, the phrase is incorrect in this sense, that I ought to have said "If you really wish your daughter back"—I knew they were making a clamour, but I thought that was to shield her own guilt—it is true that "I am, and always have been, perfectly ready to comply with your request"—I have children—Mrs. Armstrong saw my wife at Wimbledon—I was not there, but I will tell you what my wife told me—I was at the office—I saw the woman once at the Mansion House Committee—it was not arranged either on or before Tuesday, the 2nd June, that any children I could get, Bramwell Booth should take charge of—the arrangement was that either Mrs. Butler or Mr. Booth would take charge of them—I did tell Mr. Bramwell Booth of the supposed transaction of buying the two girls—these people in Whitechapel were not in my confidence; they were bad people—I have endeavoured to trace out that wicked woman—I have succeeded—I do not know her name—she lives in Lady Lake Grove, I think No. 23—I have not been there myself—a detective has whom I employ, Mrs. Fibey—she is not a Salvation "Army" person; I brought her from the north—I did not arrange with Mr. Booth for the girls coming from Whitechapel; I think they were going to Winchester, these two girls—I think I arranged on the Tuesday with Mr. Booth that a trustworthy person should be forthcoming to take a girl home I expected to get, but I cannot charge my memory—I think so; but it was only a contingent possibility—I might have mentioned it, but there was no arrangement—my memory is very hazy about that day; but as far as I remember I mentioned it in the course of conversation with Mr. Booth—I do not remember exactly asking him to provide a woman to take charge of the girl I hoped to get—I have no reason in the world to keep it back; I have only a hazy remembrance—it was not in consequence of that con<lb/>versation that Mrs. Combe appeared on the Wednesday; that was definitely fixed afterwards, on the Wednesday night—I arranged with Mr. Booth to take charge of the little girl after I left Albany Street with him, after 6 o'clock, between Albany Street and Milton Street—no other woman was to have come in pursuance of the Tuesday's suggestion—I knew nothing of whom it was to be, only a trustworthy woman, that was all—I did not know the name of the woman—I was told on the Wednesday night when I met her for the first time—Mr. Booth introduced her, I think, but even that I cannot absolutely say—between the time when the child left me at Charing Cross, on the morning of Thursday until some time in the end of July, I think we talked about whether she would be brought back or not—I think there was something said about a situation—I was never consulted as to the child being sent off to L'Oriol—I never heard of L'Oriol until some time after—I believed she had gone</p>

Altogether between the 24th of May and the 3rd of June I saw Jarrett to have conversation with her about three or four, four or five times it might be—in those conversations several young girls were spoken of, said to be in several distinct places—I don't think I ever committed to writing in any definite form what purported to be Mrs. Jarrett's statement to me—until my article of the 6th of July appeared my view of what Jarrett said to me never appeared in any definite form—the article was written about a week before then, during the time that I was going about, in the way I have described, to these brothels, I was in a state of very great excitement, intense excitement; I was going about to these brothels between the 3rd of June and the 6th of July; I went first to a brothel, I think the first time in my life, on the 26th or 27th May, and I continued going to various places of that kind until about the end of June, and then I wrote the article—Eliza was only one among a whole series of facts, which I thought so immaterial at first that I almost left the story out.</p>

               <p>weeks or four weeks after, during which time I had been through a Ministerial crisis, which in itself was rather exciting—I am the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette;</hi> the Government changed hands, and Mr. Glad<lb/>stone went out and Lord Salisbury came in—that naturally increased the strain and tension upon me during the time of the crisis—before and subsequently I was in the habit at nights of going to brothels to meet the brothel-keepers as a customer, and to drink with brothel-keepers—I am a teetotaler—it was difficult for me to drink champagne, and therefore I would like to say that in justice to Jarrett, that drinking and smoking as I was not used to it before I undertook this inquiry, I might have con<lb/>fused some of the details of what Jarrett told me; but, to the best of my belief, when I was writing on the 28th June, the first part of that manu<lb/>script was written from what I remembered Jarrett told me, and I had no object or reason to insert a single word beyond what I heard, I have told the story as near as possible as it was told to me as I remembered it—but I took no notes at the time, and three weeks or a month of a Minis<lb/>terial crisis, to say nothing of what I went through, was enough to confuse one as to details—that story was written, with Eliza instead of Lily, and it was altered in proof for two reasons—first because I did not wish to expose Mrs. Armstrong or Mrs. Broughton, and secondly because the story was told up to the time that the girl cried "Take me home;" and then the asterisks were inserted, and went on to "actually outraged"—I had another girl who had been outraged in that very brothel, whose name was. Elizabeth, and not Eliza; and when I corrected the proof I thought it would be more correct to give a mere fictitious name to a girl, the story of which was compounded out of two girls, and so I called her lily—I would like to ask whether I should be allowed to put the real girl into the witness-box—it has nothing to do with the abduction of Eliza Armstrong.

               <p>proposed that she should spend the afternoon with her, or something of the sort—Mr. Jacques went with me to Charles Street on Monday morning—Inspector Borner was in the room—I did not know who he was, but Mrs. Armstrong said might he go with her; he explained who he was, and I said he had better go, when I knew who he was—we all went to Wimbledon together, and the eldest daughter Elizabeth went too—Mrs. Stead met us and put us in the drawing-room—Mrs. Armstrong was with me, and Mr. Jacques went out with her to fetch Eliza, and then came back, and Eliza walked into the room, Mrs. Armstrong was sitting on the chair, and she said "Why, Eliza, where have you been?" and Eliza came up to her and put her arms around her mother's neck, and Mrs. Stead took the mother and two daughters into the dining-room, as we had previously arranged, and they were left alone, so that they might talk about anything—Inspector Borner said his intructions were to take the mother to Wimbledon, and not to interfere with her dis<lb/>cretion; if she wished to take the child away his instructions were to bring her to Scotland Yard; he did not interfere with her in any way—I had not the least idea that there were detectives about the house—after lunch I had a talk with Mrs. Armstrong—myself, Mrs. Jacques, and Mrs. Armstrong were present—Eliza was not present—I understood from Mrs. Stead that nothing would induce themother to leave the girl—I gave that up as hopeless—she seemed firm upon that—she said that Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong said she would take her child home with her, and I told Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong that it was a great pity, but we accepted it as decided by that time—I did not hear Mrs. Armstrong say to Eliza "They took you to a bad house, Lizzie"—I asked her if she was. satisfied that her daughter was all right, and had been well looked after, and so on, and whether she had any reason to believe from her conversation with her daughter that she had been subjected to any outrage—I read the paper slowly to her—I asked her generally if she was satisfied that the daughter was all right before reading the paper, and she said she was, and she appeared so—we had some conversation at lunch about it—I made the offer of a medical examination after reading the paper—this is the paper I read (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read the whole of it as it is there slowly—I am certain I read these words: "I am quite satisfied that she has been subjected to no outrage or bad usage"—I paused for her assent—she nodded her head, or said "Yes"—I offered to have a doctor called that she might be examined if it was wished, and the mother refused—she said she was quite satisfied that there was no need for it from what Eliza had told her—I handed her the paper, and she took it to the desk—I cannot say whether she read it, but she had every opportunity, and she put her signature where it is now at the bottom—it was written at the same time—the ink is a little bit smudged—Mrs. Stead was coming in and out—I read it over to her clause by clause after I had written the whole of it—I am certain that I read that she had been subjected to no outrage or bad usage; I laid special stress upon those words, and after I had read the whole I did not put a pen to paper beyond signing my name as witness—I swear that most solemnly—then I went and told Mr. Stead what had happened—I showed the certificate to Inspector Borner as we walked out of the house towards the station, and handed it to him—I think I offered a medical examination after Mrs. Armstrong signed the paper—I am quite satified that she understood that the medical examination was</p>

               <p>offered—I looked in her face at the time, because we considered that the chief point in the paper, and she assented without reluctance—we then came up in the train with the inspector and the children, and went to the Treasury and made a statement—that is all I had to do with the case.</p>

When I saw Mr. Stead on Saturday, 22nd August, he told me that the child was coming to England, I under<lb/>stood, and would arrive on Sunday morning—he did not say she was abroad, but I understood she was in Paris; this was between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday night—I do not think he had made up his mind where she was coming to—he may have mentioned that Miss Green was bringing her, 1 do not know—I dined with Mr. Stead and Jacques on that Saturday at the National Liberal Club, where the interview was, and after the dinner Jacques and I went up to the house to try and see the mother—I had not been there before; that was my first visit—when I say that I thought it a pity the child should go back to that house, it was not entirely in consequence of what I read in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette;</hi> it was not on account of the fact that I understood that the mother had sold the daughter, but if she went back to that home a great deal of harm would be done to her which had not been done already—I knew nothing except what I had read in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> of the character of Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, and in the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Gazette</hi>—I did not see Mrs. Arm<lb/>strong that night, but at two o'clock on Sunday, the 23rd—when I told her that she should see her daughter the next day, she appeared to be delighted, and finding that was the case, I went back and reported that to Mr. Stead, and that she was delighted to hear that she was to see her—when the child saw her mother she rushed to her—I do not think the—girl sobbed—if I said to Sir Augustus Stephenson that the girl sobbed, I have no doubt that I said it; the matter was much fresher in my memory then—they were both affected—it was not in consequence of the state in which they were that Mrs. Stead said they had better be left for half-an-hour, that was a previous arrangement—Mrs. Stead came out of the garden and said to me as the net result of the inter<lb/>view that nothing would induce the mother to leave the girl—it was after luncheon that I went upstairs and wrote this memorandum for the mother to sign—I had written it all before Mrs. Armstrong came into the room—I did not write the first part of it and read it over to her before the offer was made to have the child medically examined to see if there had been any outrage or bad usage—I did not add the last paragraph afterwards, I am quite sure about that—Mr. Jacques was in the room, and the mother, and no one else—I read the letter to her before she signed it, slowly and distinctly—Mr. Jacques paid the wages, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., before I started with him—on the day I went down I left Mr. Jacques in the street—I heard all that passed between him and the mother.</p>

Our headquarters are 101, Queen Victoria Street—I reside privately at Darenth "Road, Stamford Hill—I have been for the last ten years considerably engaged in the work of rescuing women in connection with work of the Salvation "Army"—before the end of May I had been in communication with Mr. Stead and Mrs. Josephine Butler, and many others—I recollect Friday, the 22nd May, or thereabouts, when the Criminal Law Amendment Bill was talked out—after that I had negotiations with Mr. Stead and Mrs. Butler—I saw them together at headquarters during the to take shares in a guarantee fund—the first occasion on which I heard from week following—there was an interview between us, at which I arranged any one anything in connection with any girl, who subsequently turned out to be Eliza Armstrong, was on the evening of the 3rd June, the Wednesday—I really do not remember whether it was or was not the Derby Day—I was at headquarters, at a small meeting of our staff, some 60 or 70 people—in consequence of a message I came out and saw Mr. Stead—that was the first occasion on which I heard anything, on the Wednesday evening—as near as I can remember it would be about 8 o'clock, probably a little after—he told me that that day Rebecca Jarrett had purchased a young girl from two women, one of them being a former friend of Rebecca's, and the other being the child's mother—that was all that he told me then about the child—he asked me to provide some motherly person who would take charge of the child and go with it if necessary, I am not quite clear whether he said to the Continent or to Paris; but certainly one or the other, the next morning, and he asked me, if possible, to bring that person to meet him at Dr. Heywood Smith's that night about 10—I assented, and he went away—I had heard of Rebecca Jarrett—I had not personally seen her before that I know of—she resided at the Whitechapel Home for fallen women, which is under the care of Mrs. Bramwell Booth, but not at our private house—I arrived at Dr. Heywood Smith's about 10 o'clock—before going there I sent a message to Madame Combe (she is a 8wiss lady of private means, who had arrived from the Continent a few days previously) telling her to come down and see me—I saw her, and took her in a cab to this gentle<lb/>man's house—as near as I can remember, I described to her, in the Hansom's cab, in general terms, something of the terrible evil we were endeavouring to expose, and I asked her if she would be willing to take charge of a little child who, I had just heard, had been rescued from a</p>

               <p>Madame Combe that she was to go with Jarrett to Paris in company with the child—I did not tell her to go to Nottingham Place—I think she got that address from Miss Peck—I did not go to Nottingham Place—I saw her off at the station—Mr. Stead was there too—I ought to say I really did not see the child although I knew she was there—I had told Madame Combe nothing further, down to the time she left for Paris—she went to Paris, and resided at the Salvation Training Home there—I said to Madame Combe that I wished to have the child removed from Paris, and asked her if she had any friends in France who could receive the child and train her properly; and Madame Combe said she had a sister, or a brother, or a sister-in-law who would take the child if she requested it, and would teach her and train her, and bring her up in a virtuous and Christian manner—I do not think I asked Madame Combe where these people resided—I had the fullest confidence in Madame Combe, and with her assurance that the people referred to were of that character, I assented to the child being sent there—then I asked her to telegraph to Paris to her own son there, as she told me that the child knew her son, and would probably travel with him without demur, and comfortably and happily—I asked her to send a telegram desiring or instructing her son to take the child to this house, which afterwards turned out to be at L'Oriol—on the 16th July I had a visit from Inspector Borner—he introduced himself, and as near as I can remember he told me he had been instructed by the Magistrate at Mary<lb/>lebone to call upon me with reference to a child which had been inquired for by her mother, and named Eliza Armstrong, and he asked me if I knew where the child was, or anything about it—I said yes, the child was in our care, and she was in good hands and well cared for—I am not sure whether I volunteered the child's address to the inspector or not—my impression is that I volunteered the address—if I did not volunteer it he did not ask for it—we went on to speak of several other matters—he told me that Mr. Munroe, one of the Commissioners, was very much interested in recent revelations—the next interview was on 31st July, and I saw him a third time the 1st August—he at neither of those interviews asked me for Rebecca Jarrett's address—there was certainly nothing said about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the last interview, the third interview, or the second interview—I was going to say that nothing was said about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the interview on the 1st August, when the mother was present, and I was about to say that I think the Inspector has confused something that was said on the previous morning when he called upon me—in speaking to him of the child and in reply I said I was so desirous for the child's welfare, or something to that effect, that I would be prepared to make an application to the Court of Chancery to make her a ward of Court, even if it coat 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I did use those words upon that occasion—I told him that I was really very much concerned for the child's welfare and that I thought it would be a most terrible calamity for her to go back to her old associates—at that same interview he asked me if I would see the mother and assure her of the child's well-being, and I said "Yes"—then what he has described took place—he said, "When would I see her?" and I said, "The next day, any time between half-past 10 and 4 o'clock"—I think I said that, and he made an appointment for the next morning—then I saw her the next morning, which was the third interview, in the presence of Borner and another inspector, Conquest—</p>

               <p>Conquest was present at the 1st August interview—I and the mother on that occasion had rather a lengthy conversation—so far as I can remember in substance she said she wanted to see her child—I told her that her child was well and well cared for and in good hands in a good situation, and being trained up in a virtuous and Christian way in a good home, and I said I thought it would be a pity to bring her from so long a distance merely to see her, would she accept my assurance of her well-being—I reasoned with the mother with the view to persuade her not to disturb the child from its present surroundings—I think then Inspector Borner said, "The mother wants to be assured that no harm had come to the child"—I then said she might take it from me that no harm had come to the child; that she had been examined by a medical man; and, speaking to them collectively, I said, if they wished, they could see the certificate—when I had told the mother this, she expressed herself as very thankful that this was so—she may have said "Thank God," or "I am very thankful," or some expression of that kind—I said to her, "Did you not know something of Rebecca Jarrett?"—I think I said, "I understood from what you said to <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi> reporter," or some words to that effect, "that you knew Rebecca Jarrett before this," to which she said, "Yes, I did"—I then said, "Did you know what sort of a woman she was?" and she said "Yes," and I said "What?" and she said a gay woman—I then said, "Was it not a very extraordinary thing that you should let your little child go with such a woman?"—she made no answer—I then asked her if she knew where the child was going, and she said yes, she understood she was going to Croydon—Mrs. Armstrong, Inspector Borner, Inspector Conquest, as I have since learnt, and one of my people named Gysien, were present then—I then asked her whether she understood she was going to Croydon that night, the night she left—she said no, she thought she was going to Jarrett's mother in Albany Street—I then expressed surprise and said did not she know what sort of street Albany Street was—when there was a mention of Albany Street, before she made an answer, the Inspector made an observation which I did not quite catch, but which I understood to mean that he was surprised and dissatisfied that she had not told him about that before—I had asked her whether she did not know what sort of street Albany Street was, and she said "Yes"—Mrs. Armstrong and the Inspectors rose to go—I said we shall be willing, if she would leave the child where she was, to pay her wages to her mother here, and I said what amount would be fair, and the mother did not seem to respond to my suggestion—I turned to one of the Inspectors and said, "What would be a fair wage to pay?" and he said the mother would be the best to decide—after the subject of wages had been mentioned then I came back to the question of the child coming home again to see the mother, and I think it was then I came across the room and gave her the address—I am not quite clear whether it was just before the subject of wages came up or immediately after that I gave her the address and told her to write to her, and I said as to the question of coming back, it would be expensive to bring her all that way, and I hoped she would leave her where she was—I did not say it would cost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bring her back altogether—I did not mention 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said two or three more words about the disadvantage of removing the child from her then</p>

               <p>time to Paris to wait our orders there, as I quite expected from the conversation I had with the mother that she would communicate with me, either through the police or that the police themselves would com<lb/>municate with me—upon 5th August I wrote: "We beg of you to send the little Eliza Armstrong by the bearer of this authority, with the view of taking her back to London. Saluting you, and with best thanks for your kindness, <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BRAMWELL BOOTH</hi> "—that is the authority I refer to—I had no communication from any one when I wrote that letter on behalf of Mrs. Armstrong except from Mr. Stead—I did not receive the mother's letter of 4th August, I really do not know who did—I really do not know who opened that letter of 4th August—that French letter of 5th August is in the handwriting of one of the clerks at headquarters—the former part of it is Vint's handwriting; I gave him instructions to write it—between the interview of 1st August and the writing of this letter of the 5th I really cannot remember whether I had any com<lb/>munication from Mr. Stead—I do not think I had any communication in writing; I may have had a communication with Mr. Stead—I did not receive Mrs. Armstrong's own letter—I did have a communication with Mr. Stead between those dates; I cannot possibly fix the date; I will swear it was between those dates—between those dates, to the best of my recollection, I did receive a message from Mr. Stead himself—he said to me he thought it would be better that the child should be brought home, and as I had that interview with the mother I quite expected she would make an application for the child to be ready; I made out that order and sent it, so that the child should be brought to Paris, at any rate—I really do not know who found the mother's letter of 4th August; I do not know when it was found; the first communication I had about it was on the evening of the day before the last day at Bow Street, I think—Mr. Waddy was my Counsel at Bow Street—I knew that Mrs. Armstrong had proved addressing the letter to me on 8th September—I had heard my Counsel say, "You know we never received any such letter"—I read afterwards that my Counsel said that Mr. Poland had gone through the farce of calling for the letter, I did not hear it—I only heard of that letter's existence on the night before the last day of the hearing at Bow Street, and I heard of it from Mr. Waddy, who told me that some one had communicated to him the fact that the letter had been received at my office—I was entirely in the hands of my legal advisers then—I remember being called upon to produce the doctor's certificate; I had not it—it was sent to me in a closed envelope—I knew Mr. Stead had it—I think that was the only reason I had; I could not produce what I had not got—I said to Mrs. Armstrong that the child had been examined, and that they could see the certificate if they wished—I had not it with me on 1st August; Mr. Stead had it; at any rate, I handed it to him as soon as I got it, and I did not have it alter—Madame Combe sent that telegram on 11th July, "Conduit ma protegee chez Theodore, L'Oriol, ce soir," but I wrote it, I believe; I told her to do so—I think it was sent some time in the afternoon—I sent instructions by telegram to take the child away to L'Oriol, because that morning I had seen Mrs. Jose<lb/>phine Butler, who told me that the Sullivans, and so on, were down at Winchester harassing Rebecca—I was under the impression that the Broughtons, whom I knew then or by that time, had learnt, had sold the child, were friends of Rebecca's before, and I thought that if Rebecca</p>

               <p>yielded to the temptation to go back to her old life, one of the first things would be that they would try to get this poor child back, consequently I was very anxious to get the child to an address that she did not know, because I knew she knew where she was in Paris—I had not heard that that morning the mother had been to the police-court, nor the previous day—to the best of my recollection and belief at this time I had no intimation of it, and if I had, I do not think it would hare influenced me in sending the child away, because I knew that if the mother made a formal demand upon me for the child I had no claim to it, and it would have been perfectly childish for me to send it away from Paris merely for the sake of hiding it from its mother, because I knew its mother would come to me—but the real reason for sending the child from Paris was that I was afraid that Rebecca would yield to the tempta<lb/>tion of her old companions, and that she would let the Broughtons or some one thereabouts know the address of the child, and we should probably have to send it back—I was afraid if she got back with Sullivan and her old friends she would yield to their entreaties and want the child back, she and the Broughtons; for this reason, that if she told them no harm had come to the child she could get it back again, and sell it over again—I remember receiving the letter of 8th June from Paris; Mr. Stead showed it to me; it was enclosed to me under cover—I read the letter at my office; Mr. Stead handed it to me to read after he had opened it at my office—I handed it to him and said "What are we to do with this letter?" and he opened it and read it—I see the word "France," which had been altered so that people could not read it, and the addresses made illegible—that was done when the letter came to me—I gave it to Mr. Stead, and he did not think it was advisable it should be sent on to the mother, and I am bound to say I agreed with him—my feeling was that if the mother was so degraded and abandoned as to part with her child for the purpose for which I believed she had come into Mr. Stead's hands, the best thing of all others was to keep her from all knowledge of the child's whereabouts—I do not know who it was who told the child not to put any address on her letter—I had not given any instructions to Mrs. Combe about that, but I think I gave instructions to one of our people who was over from Paris about that time, to the effect that the child had been purchased, and that its own mother had consented to the sale, and that on account of that fact I did not wish it to communicate with the mother, or at all events I did not wish its mother to know its whereabouts—Mr. Stead had told me that he expected to get a child—he did not on the Tuesday, not specially—he may have repeated his statements of Friday, but it was a general statement to this effect: "I am expecting to purchase one, two, or more children; I have nowhere to put them"—it was a general statement to the effect that he had purchased or was about to purchase—I think it was the Friday morning I saw him at his own office—he said he was expecting to buy one or two or more children, as though for an immoral purpose; that he had nowhere to put them; I remember his saying that he could not take them home to his own home, and that he could not have them at the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> office, and would I undertake to take charge of them; and further, if he wished to send one or more of them to the Continent would I have some person who was able to do that, had I any one who was able to do that—I do not think I saw or heard from Mr. Stead at all on the Tuesday, so far as</p>

               <p>I can remember—in the event of his purchasing I would take charge of them—I knew that Rebecca Jarrett was going to try and get them—before the Tuesday I knew that Mr. Stead was going to try to get them through Rebecca Jarrett, and that if he succeeded I was to take them, and I was to send some of them abroad, if Mr. Stead wished it, his idea being to show how girls were sent out of the country to the Continental brothels—the Salvation "Army" do not send thorn to Continental brothels—his idea was to send one or more children out of the country in order to show what could be done, and I undertook to find a motherly person was the expression, to take charge of them; I was as anxious as he was to show up the iniquity of the system—I sent a mes<lb/>senger to Madame Combe first—my recollection is hardly clear about this, but I think I spoke to her first on the same Friday that Mr. Stead spoke to me, and I said to her in general terms "Are you willing to go on the Continent if I wish you to do so?" and "Can you travel easily?" and so on—I do not think I saw Mr. Stead on the Tuesday at all—I sent no message to Madame Combe on the Tuesday—about 8 o'clock in the evening of Wednesday, the 3rd, I saw Mr. Stead—it was between the Wednesday night and the Thursday morning, after midnight, that Mr. Stead told me that Jarrett said the father knew what the child was going for—I really do not know if Jarrett had told the father the purpose; the statement made to me by Mr. Stead was merely that the father knew, as also that the mother had partici<lb/>pated in the amount of the purchase—I read in this morning's report that Mr. Stead had sworn that he never suggested anything of the kind—I explained just now that, so far as my recollection serves me, I offered Inspector Borner the address of the child, but I am not quite clear about that; any way, I told him it was in our care, and well looked after—I do not think Borner told me on the 31st July that I had not sent the address—I attended at the Mansion House—I did not see Mrs. Armstrong there.</p>

               <p>before the next morning—I went in this cab to what I now know to be Dr. Heywood Smith's house—I saw several persons that I did not know—I saw them coming in and going out of the room I was in, but I did not know them—I was in the parlour, and then in a small room, study, I think, waiting—I was first put in the parlour, and then in an ante-room, I suppose to make room for people—I did not see Jarrett that night, nor the little girl, or speak to any one else—I may have spoken to Mr. Stead, but I cannot recollect, really—I did shake hands with a gentleman, but as to saying who he was I could not now—I was not introduced—I had no conversation with anyone—I had not known Mr. Stead—I never saw him before in my life—after waiting there some time I was taken away rather late in another carriage, I fancy, and taken to some friend's house at that time—I found the people in bed, and I was sent to bed, and I spent the night there—I do not know whether Miss Peck was with me or not—nothing further occurred until the next morning, then I breakfasted with the family—a young man and two young girls were present, I think—nothing was said on the subject of this matter at that breakfast table—I went with Miss Peck to Nottingham Place—we went on foot—we arrived, and were introduced into a room in which I saw Rebecca and the little girl—that was the first time I saw her or the little girl—that was the morning of the 4th—there was no conversation of much consequence, so far as I remember—the young lady went out of the room with Rebecca for a few minutes, and I was left in the room with the child—I tried to cheer the child—she did not look happy—I asked her if she would go with me; and I told her that I had children of my own, and I said I suppose what I thought would make the child feel happy with me—Miss Peck went to buy a jacket for the child a few minutes before she left the house to go to the station—I and Rebecca and Eliza went to the station in a cab—I do not know what station—I think Mr. Booth told me, after breakfast, that I should have to take the child to Paris—when I got to the station the tickets were already taken—we were rather late, and we had nothing to do but step into the train, and the tickets were handed over to us—up to that time I had not heard a word further than I have told you about the child, how it was got, or whether it had a mother or father, or anything—we arrived in Paris, I think, between 5 and 6 p.m.—then I took the child to 3, Avenue Laumiere, which is Miss Booth's house—it was not the headquarters—it has been made since into a training home for women—at that time there were some four or five respectable young ladies living there, being trained for the "Army"—the following morning, or the next day, I know that Rebecca had a letter, because I remember well her letter came enclosed in one to me—I did not read Rebecca's letter—in the morning I was not ready for breakfast—I saw Rebecca coming from the post-office—I cannot say I saw her go—I do not remember that clearly, but I saw her come back—when she was starting I did not know she was going out alone—I remained there during the week, until I received orders to go back, or a telegram—the child never went out alone—on the 14th I returned to England—I received a letter or two from the child when I wrote to her—afterwards a telegram was sent by my authority to my son—if I wrote it, it was only on a slip of paper—I did not send the wire—I gave it to "Captain" Vint, I believe—I sent it by Mr. Booth's instructions, if you call that instructions, that I was to get somebody from Paris to take the child</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188510190284"/>
               <p>down to my brother's—as I knew no one in France except my brother who would take charge of the child I sent a wire—I am not sure that Mr. Booth told me to send the wire really, or whether I took upon myself to send it—then I sent the letter commencing "Dear Theodore," of which I have heard a translation read—the expression in the letter, "passer par ou vous voudrez" means "she will be obedient;" I meant to say, "she will be obedient if you inform her I know of her conduct"—I knew the child loved me, and would care for my approval—in saying in that letter, "Complete, my dear Theodore, the work I have com<lb/>menced, at my risk and peril," I meant the taking her over and finding a comfortable home for her—I proposed the thing, and if he accepted taking the child, he would complete what I had done—my brother's house is a comfortable home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Examined by Stead.</hi> I was present when Jarrett bade Eliza Armstrong "Good-bye"—I heard Jarrett give Eliza Armstrong advice to be a good girl, and obedient to those with whom she left her; that we should be kind with her, and she ought to be thankful to be where she was, because her mother had not given her for a servant, she said "service," but for something worse—I never heard the name of "Broughton" before I came to the Court—the child heard that "something worse"—she hung down her head, and said nothing—I thought she did not seem to feel it very much; I was surprised—during the time that I have had anything to do with Eliza Armstrong I never received from you directly or indirectly to my knowledge, any words of direction, any information, or anything at all.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness here described the assault, as at page 896.</hi>) She did not hurt me—I was not aware of what was going to be done to me—I tried to get away—she afterwards went with me into the next room, when I said to Jarrett "She is a dirty woman," referring to Mourez—Mourez said nothing—she did not ask me who I meant—shortly after that they both left the room and returned in about 20 minutes—Jarrett and I left the house together—I did not see Jacques there; I saw no one else but the servant who opened the door—when we got outside, a four-wheeled cab was waiting—Jarrett and I got into it and drove to a ham and beef shop in Poland Street, Oxford Street, where I saw Jacques and another gentleman go into a house—I recognised Jacques on 24th August—Jarrett went into the house in Poland Street with me.</p>

After leaving Albany Street I did not see Mr. Stead at all that night—there was a conversation at Albany Street about having my hair cut and frizzed—I told the lady who suggested it that I would not have it done, and yet I did not object to Madame Mourez doing what I have said—I believe Jarrett mentioned the words Milton Street in the cab—there were only us two in the cab, and no one but Jarrett who could have used the words—I saw no man speak to Jarrett from the time we left Albany Street to the time we got to Poland Street—I said that Mourez was French from the way she talked; she spoke English, but not much—I cannot tell a French woman from an Italian woman or from any other foreigner—I do not know how long Mourez and Jarrett remained in the room we were first shown into, it was not very long—I said at the police-court, "We remained in the room for half an hour without either of us speaking"—they spoke about the day, that was all—Mourez told me to go into the next room; I went in first, and she followed me—she said "Go into the next room" in English, or "Come"—I was there about 20 minutes—there was no conversation between us—I stood there, and she done it, and she pulled out a little bottle of stuff—I was frightened to go back to Jarrett; I was in a strange place with strange people—a doorway with curtains separates the room into two parts; Jarrett was on one side of the curtains, and I was on the other—I could not have passed through the curtains before that; the door was shut when we went into the room—I did not ask</p>

I drive a four-wheeled cab—on 3rd June, Derby day, I was on the rank in Great Quebec Street about 9.30 p.m.—Jacques came up and told me to go to 3, Milton Street, but to stand this side of the door and not drive close up—I believe he said I should have to go to Poland Street, but I am not certain—I stopped where he told me in Milton Street, and the second gentleman spoke to me—I believe that was Mr. Stead—they spoke together, and Mrs. Jarrett and the little girl came out in about a minute, got into my cab, and I drove them to Poland Street—as Jarrett was getting the change I saw two men walking behind, which excited my suspicion—they were there almost at the same time as myself—I believe Jacques and the other gentleman left first—Jarrett got out at the ham-and-beef shop and got change for a sovereign and paid my fare—I recognised the two men at Bow Street they were Jacques and Mr. Stead—I afterwards saw them all four together—I drove away leaving them there.</p>

It is my business; I am a midwife"—she spoke broken English, I had a difficulty in understanding her—she said "I have been in London twenty years, and at this house ten years"—I am positive she said this in her broken English—some<lb/>times she wandered into French, and then I put up my hand and stopped her, and she began again in English—I saw some curtains dividing the room into two parts, the centre of them was open and I saw a bed on the other side; the curtains were green to the best of my belief—I gave evidence at Bow Street Police-court—I saw this bottle produced by Mr. Stead in the course of his statement and handed to Mr. Poland.</p>

I told Mourez I was a police officer—I had no occasion to caution her—I did not notice any word like diploma on the brass plate which was on the railings with her name on it; I did not look for that—I said at the police-court that there might have been other words there—I have been there since and found the brass plate had been removed—I am sure I mentioned Armstrong as the name of the child to Mourez—she did not use the words Eliza Arm<lb/>strong in the course of the conversation—she did not mention the name of Rebecca Jarrett—I made a report in writing of the conversation, within an hour—I believe she said newspapers, not papers—I may have said papers at the police-court—I do not speak French—she said "I laid the child on the bed"—she used the word intact; I had not previously used that word myself.</p>
