I had a fight with Crow last night. I hear he is dead. I struck the man. I did not mean to kill him; it was a drunken quarrel"—he was charged and when it was read over to him he said, "I will take that charge. I gave myself up; I am sorry he is dead. They wanted to <hi rend="italic">go down</hi> him," meaning to rob him—I examined the prisoner and on his right elbow I found a piece of flesh knocked off—his hands were marked and he had a scar on his face—he said the flesh had been kicked off his elbow by one of the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at 17, Love Lane, Shadwell—the prisoner is my first cousin—last March we were keeping company, but we were not engaged to be married; he had asked me to marry him and I had said yes, but the death of my sister had prevented it from being carried out—in August I saw him and told him I would have no more to do with him—since then he has been down several times to my house and has told me that rather than me have anybody else he would sooner do for me—on one occasion he showed me a carving knife, which he took from a drawer in the house and said, "I will kill you"—I know his writing—I received several letters from him, some of which I have destroyed—on November 2nd I received this letter from him: "Dear Janie,—These few lines to you which I must write. I am now going to do my duty and carry my words out the first chance I get. I can see now that you mean to part from me, which I consider you have been persuaded, so therefore you will suffer for others' advice. I am left en<lb/>tirely to the world and have got no friends, so I am sure I do not wish to live any longer myself, and I am not going to make an end of myself unless I serve it on you first, which I have thoroughly, made up my mind to do, and I must do it. I will watch every movement until I get the chance, and the sooner it comes the better, for I am alone, but the Lord will forgive me for my doings. George. If I break in the house I will do it"—on November 8th I received this letter: "Janie, I am going now to do what I said. This is the last letter I shall write, but if I cannot</p>

               <p>catch you out I will do it through the kitchen grating, but will take care I shall do myself in as well, but if it is six months more you shall not escape me. I mean it this time; daylight or night I will have you, so you can make sure of it before you shall have another. George"—after that I was very nervous and afraid to go out alone—I applied for a warrant, and the day I had to go to the Police Court I got this letter from the prisoner: "Janie, I hear that your father has been looking for me, but I am looking for you, and the more it goes on like this the worse it will be. I am going to do what I say to you and nobody shall stop it, but there is plenty of time for you and me, so prepare yourself. I shall have you in this way. G."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, of 101, Salisbury Road, Kilburn—at 11.35 p.m. on October 2nd I was in Harrow Road when I saw a woman knocked down by Macdonald—I stopped him and he said, "All right, <hi rend="italic">guv'nor</hi>; it is only my old woman"—I said, "Your old woman or not, it is a very cowardly action"—I went into the Neild Arms, when he followed me in with another man and the woman—he told me that he belonged to the National Sporting Club and asked me to treat him, as he could get me into that club at any time I wished—thinking that he was a genuine man, I treated him with one or two others—he produced to me this paper [<hi rend="italic">Read: From the Secretary of the National Sporting Club, King's Street, to George Symmonds, Paddington, dated September</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th, stating that he was accepted in a heavy weight novice competition which would be boxed on Monday evening, October</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd, at</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>] and asked me to lend him a shilling on it—I brought out a florin and went to the bar and said, "Give me two shillings for one. I will lend this man a shilling on this paper"—Macdonald said, "Don't trouble about it; let me have the two," and I let him have the florin, and I took possession of the paper—I paid for three pots of beer, and also for some whiskey for two women—I treated them to three packets of Woodbines—the landlord said to me, "I think you had better get away," through a matter of conversation about military business—I do not think he suggested that I had had too much to drink—I did not hear him recommend me not to stand any more drink nor have any more myself—I went out by myself—when I got about eight yards away to the corner of Chippenham Mews Macdonald came in front of me and asked me for some money—I said, "What do you want money off me for?" and I refused to give him any—he was with two other men, one of whom was Allen—Macdonald struck me a deliberate blow on the jaw with his fist, and I was felled to the ground insensible—on recovering my senses I was sitting on the pavement, when Bryant, who serves me with vegetables, came and picked me up—the prisoners had gone away after having searched my pockets—I had 35s. in silver in a canvas bag in my right-hand pocket, a sovereign and two half-sovereigns in the watch pocket of my waistcoat, besides loose cash, which might have been about 3s. or 4s., my briar pipe, and the handle of my shop door which I took out nightly, all of which were missing; also my keys attached to my key chain were wrenched from me—I recognised Allen as I was being felled</p>

               <p>to the ground—I had a kick on the head and I remembered nothing more—I cannot say who kicked me—I cannot positively say whether I had the wound on my head from falling on the corner of the pavement; I have an idea that I was kicked—the next morning I gave information to the police, and the following Tuesday week I was taken to the police station, when I saw thirteen men with different hats and caps on—Pollard said to me, "Can you identify the man who assaulted you last Monday?" and I pointed out Macdonald without the slightest hesitation—about a month after that, on November 9th or 10th, I was again taken to the John Street police station, where I was asked to identify the other man from nine other men, and I picked out Allen—I treated him in the public-house on the night I was robbed—he was drinking with me in the public-house a matter of twenty minutes altogether.</p>

I am the licensee of the Neild Arms, Harrow Road—about 11 p.m. on October 2nd the prosecutor, whom I had never seen before, came into my house—Macdonald then came in with several others; I do not quite remember Allen—I saw them served with pots of ale and whiskey, for which the prosecutor paid—I heard him and Macdonald talk<lb/>ing about the Army, and then I heard a further conversation about a two-shilling piece—I took particular notice of them because the prose<lb/>cutor was a stranger to me, but I knew the others as rough-class characters—the prosecutor appeared to me to be a military man; he was treating all the others—I thought there would be trouble if I did not get rid of them, so I refused to serve—that was not in consequence of their being drunk—they stayed some time asking for further drink, but I remained firm—the prosecutor then went out, followed by Macdonald and the others in rotation; they all seemed to go at once—the prosecutor was not in<lb/>dignant with me for not serving him with further drink; he simply smiled.</p>

There were four of us, and two of them cleared out with it all"—he then gave me the names of three men who were concerned with him which he asked me to treat in confidence—in consequence of information received, on November 8th I arrested Allen—at 10.30 p.m. he was placed with nine other men—I told him he was suspected of being concerned with James Macdonald, better known to him as "Fighting Mac," and another man, not known, for highway robbery and violence on a gentleman opposite the Neild Arms on October 2nd—he replied, "I do not know Fighting Mac; I never get up that end"—the prosecutor was then brought in and he picked him out from the nine other men, who were of a similar description to the prisoner, most of them being clean-shaven—immedi<lb/>ately he was picked out he said, "I have never seen that man an before. I do not know this man"—I took him to the Carlton Bridge police station, where he was charged to which he replied, "All right; I will kick Fighting Mac's b—out if I get a chance at Brixton prison, for <hi rend="italic">shopping</hi> me.

I said, 'Well, I have nothing to run away for'; with that he said, 'I am going to clear away—me and the others.' I saw him two or three days after and he said, 'I think it has blown over now.' I said, 'You have done a very silly thing, and you ought to have known better.' I told the policeman, when I was locked up, the three men who had done this; the man who struck the prosecutor was brought to the police station and they could not identify him. He said he hit from behind or otherwise. I have done my best to catch the right man. I told this man that if I had known it was going to happen I would have stopped them; he said, 'I am sorry now, as they gave me nothing out of it and I have not seen them since.' "</p>

Last Friday morning, between 10 and 11 a.m., I met the man Gillott in Black-friars Road. We were both looking down the "Chronicle" column. He said, 'Been out long?' I replied, 'Six or eight weeks.' He said, 'Where were you working last?' I told him Steeger &amp; Smart, Milk Street, City, and told him they were curtain manufacturers. We came out and walked over Blackfriars Bridge, where I left him at the corner of Ludgate Hill</p>

I walked up Ludgate Hill, Cannon Street, down Queen Street to Chitty's Dining Rooms, Upper Thames Street, and got there about 12.40 p.m. I had dinner and left there about 1.20 p.m. I then walked to London Bridge, over the Bridge, down the Borough to the Elephant, along the Walworth Road to a coffee house at the top of York Street and got there about 1.50 p.m. and remained there until 4.30 p.m. (Signed) William Henry Simkins."</p>

I practice at Roseville, Winchmore Hill—on September 19th I was called to Westfield by Mrs. Earl—I arrived there about 10.45 p.m., about five minutes after I was sent for—I was shown up to a bedroom on the first floor—there was no light—the door was open—I lit the gas—I saw this girl kneeling on the side of the bed—the bed-clothes and her bed-gown were saturated with blood; there was a considerable amount of blood on the hearth rug, and the chamber was half full of blood—I heard the feeble cry of a child—I said to the girl, "You have had a child; where is it?"—she would not reply—the mistress from the ante-room said, "Why don't you answer the doctor, Lydia?"—after looking about she said, "It is under the bed," where I found it—the child was absolutely without covering—I took it up, and found it was a fully-developed female child—it was very cold—the cord had been torn across, and not severed by the scissors, and there was about a foot of it still attached to the child's body—there was a nasty gaping wound on the face, and on putting my finger inside the mouth I found that the jaw bone had been cut through, and there were several other wounds on the body of the child—I wrapped it up, after getting some wrappings, for there was nothing in the room, and I had to look about and get things to wrap the child up in, when I made it as comfortable as I could—I then attended to the mother—I removed the after-birth—when I found the child was in the condition in which it was I said to the girl, "You wicked woman, you have been cutting this child about; what have you done it with?"—she said, "With the scissors"—looking about I found a pair on blood-stained scissors on the floor of the room—the child was still alive; crying, just breathing, that was all—it lived about two hours—the gurgling noise probably came from the child's mouth, through the blood in its efforts to breath, as a gurgling noise would be the result of any fluid down the throat—after removing the after-birth I sent out for female assistance—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, the details of which I can now give: I found that the child was a fully-developed female infant, measuring twenty-one inches long, and weighing five and a half pounds; there was an incised wound, extending from the right corner of the mouth for two inches, and completely severing the cheek and facial artery, and the lower jaw bone near its angle, also slightly wounding the side of the tongue, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130026"/>
               <p>some of the adjacent soft tissues—considerable force must have been used with this pair of scissors, which are not very sharp; there was a superficial wound on the neck just above the centre of, and parallel to, the right collar bone, three-eighths of an inch long; a superficial crucial incised wound in the front part of the right arm pit, half an inch each way; five scratches on the left side of the face and neck; one superficial incised wound, three-quarters of an inch long, running transversely midway between the left ear and collar bone; a punctured wound three-eighths of an inch long, just below the wound between the left ear and the collar bone, extending into the throat, immediately behind, but not wounding the great vessels of the neck; a split wound of the anus, probably caused by the forcible passage of some instrument—all those wounds could have been caused by these scissors—the punctured wound in the throat might have been caused by the scissors being inserted, and then opened—I should say there was nothing abnormal about the confinement, which was quite natural—there was no exceptional laceration—the girl's demeanour was very morose, and it was difficult to get anything out of her—she spoke quite sensibly—I gave her tea—after I had attended her I left her in charge of Mrs. Barrell—that was about 2 o'clock—early the next morning I found her in such a good condition that I could recommend he removal to the workhouse infirmary, where she was removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was a first delivery, which is usually attended with greater pain than subsequent cases—I think probably five of the wounds had been caused by the scissors being drawn together, as though one was cutting something—in child-birth sometimes women by reason of the agony they undergo are deprived of self-control—that pain very rapidly diminishes after the birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> By being deprived of self-control I mean that there is such a condition from necessary pain that for the time being there may be a loss of self-control—the mind would be affected temporarily—the patient would be quite conscious—as to knowing what she was doing, that is a very difficult thing to give an opinion about: whether there is an absolute knowledge at the time; I think there might be a condition of frenzy, which would be very short—possibly a woman might struggle in a mad sort of way with scissors, without knowing what she was doing—it is difficult to measure between what is knowledge and what is not knowledge.</p>

I am the wife of Noah Barrell, a coachman, living at Eastnor Cottage, Winchmore Hill—on September 19th I was sent for to Westfield House and arrived at about 11.30 p.m.—I saw the prisoner in bed in a room—Dr. Vivian was there—I saw the child on the foot of the bed, alive—I attended to the prisoner—I was there all night—the child lived till about 2 a.m., and then it died—I noticed some blood on the hearth rug, and on the bed, and between the bed and the fire place—I cleaned the room—these are the scissors, which I saw on the mantelpiece in the bedroom—a quantity of blood was on them, and pieces of flesh—I washed them, and gave them back to Dr. Vivian—I continued to look after the prisoner till 6 a.m., when I was allowed off for an hour and a half, and I came back and stopped till she went away the next day—I only asked</p>

                  </hi>, M. B. C. M., M. R. C. S. I live at Blet<lb/>chenden and am the Medical Officer of the Edmonton Infirmary—Lydia Green was admitted into our infirmary on September 20th, and remained under my care until she was discharged on October 23rd—with regard to her physical condition, she was fairly well, considering she had undergone a recent confinement—with regard to her mental condition, I regarded her of very low intelligence; in fact, her demeanour the whole time she was in the infirmary was quite inconsistent with knowledge of her position; she took no notice of those about her, she never spoke unless she was spoken to, and her general condition convinced us that she did not realise the terrible condition in which she had placed herself—in conversation she told me that she was in such agony that she did not know what she was doing; that what she did with the scissors was whilst the child was being delivered; that she took the scissors, and tried to deliver herself; but until some gentleman from Messrs. Wontners came down she never realized her position in the least—she appeared to me, and to my assistant, that she had such a low form of intelligence that she was not in a right mental condition—scissors are the proper instrument to sever the umbilical cord if they are used in a proper manner, and, if properly done, are what is generally used for the purpose—something like 3,000 cases of parturition have passed through my hands—it is not a common thing for women in child-birth to lose self-control, but it is not unknown—first cases are usually more severe, and more prolonged—women do lose self-control, but it is usually practically for a few minutes that they lose self-control, or become demented, not knowing what they do—in that case they would be irre<lb/>sponsible, and may do acts which they otherwise would not do; in fact, that is the reason why in many cases chloroform is administered, so as to enable the patient to endure anything, or to become unconscious of it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130028"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She told me that while the child was half out of her she endeavoured to deliver herself from it with the scissors, to lever the child out of her, as I understood, and to deliver herself, although she did not use the term "lever"—I did not see the wounds on the child, and it is difficult to say whether they are consistent with that—the question de<lb/>pends upon how long she was in labour—some of the wounds have been described as cutting, and some were punctured, and I do not express any opinion on that, or from her description—she told me she might have picked up the scissors and tried to free herself—the patient might or might not remember, because directly the child is delivered the pain ceases practically, though while in labour she may be absolutely uncontrollable—I should consider it rather a case of temporary loss of control than of temporary insanity—I do not know that I should say that she became in<lb/>sane, but her demeanour was absolutely inconsistent with premeditated intentional injury to the child; she went so far as to say that she did not know that she was pregnant—she never told the supposed father of the child that she was pregnant, which is not consistent with the ordinary run of girls—I have seen scores of such cases, and all of them are too ready to go and tell the reputed father of their trouble, but she seemed to know nothing about it—all that indicates that her intelligence was of a low order, and that she was a stupid, silly girl, I take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think in her suffering she was able to decide whether her action was proper or not—I think in a very severe case the patient becomes quite irresponsible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Officer in charge of H. M. Prison, Holloway, which is used for the detention of females—the prisoner from the time of her admission on October 23rd has been entirely under my supervision and care—I have had experience of a large number of cases of this kind, where the general bodily health has suffered—I frequently conversed with the prisoner—I think she is a person of low intelligence—when she first came she was a little bit depressed, but I could not certify her as insane—I have seen many cases of child-birth—I have known instances where women at the time of the birth of their child, by reason of their great agony have lost for the time self-control—I have heard the evidence in this case—in my judgment it is consistent with this young woman having been for a short period quite deprived of self-control, owing to the agony which she endured, and during the actual period of the frenzy owing to the pain—I do not regard a person under those con<lb/>ditions as being responsible for her actions—I consider such a person as being deprived of the power to appreciate the nature and quality of any act she may commit—it is possible that the injuries inflicted by the scissors upon this baby might have been inflicted by this unfortunate young woman without her really appreciating what she was doing—scissors are the proper instrument to use to sever the umbilical cord—during the period the frenzy lasts a person may suffer from a form of transient in<lb/>sanity, consistent with the person being of normal mind—that is quite a recognised condition, and it may be of sufficient degree to prevent the sub<lb/>ject being able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar merchant of Lisle Street, Leicester Square—in September Levoi showed me these contract notes for 4,000 cigars, which had been pawned at Messrs. Bravingtons and at Messrs. Brooks, of Wardour Street—I went with Levoi to see the cigars at the pawnbrokers—I eventually bought the contract notes for £2 10s.—I took some of the 4,000 cigars out of pawn and some were taken out by my order—we looked at the cigars before they were bought—I gave them to Levoi to sell for me—practically Levoi bought them to sell to Harwood, but on my invoice—I think the cigars cost me £43 9s. 6d. end I sold them for £44 15s.—I had to pay £4 to the pawnbrokers and interest—I lost a small amount over the transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Brooks, pawnbroker, of Wardour Street—on September 8th Garbett pawned with me ten boxes of cigars for £10 in the name of John Harris for C. Weingott—this is the contract note—he came in the morning—we paid him two £5 notes—I think he handed me some invoices and receipts at the same time for the purpose of showing that Weingott, for whom he acted, dealt in cigars—one receipt for £49 14s. 4d. was headed Muratti—on that, which I assumed was a genuine document, I advanced the money—I had not seen Garbett before—the cigars were redeemed on September 25th, and I have marked that at the back of the contract note.</p>

I live at 1, Belt ram Road, Fulham, and am a baker in the St. George's Union Workhouse in Fulham Road—the prisoner has been an inmate about fifteen years, but I have known him about three years, ever since I have been employed there, as a person receiving relief in the workhouse off and on—his duty was to assist me in the work-house—I know his writing; I have seen him write—my mother lives at High Street, Shefford, Bedfordshire—I have never given her address to anyone—on August 4th the prisoner had access to the mess room when my coat was hanging there, from which a letter was stolen bearing my mother's name and address, and I suspected the prisoner of having stolen it—this telegram, of October 3rd, is in the prisoner's writing: "Mother, send £8 by telegram at once. Urgent. In trouble. Am writing. Joe"—I gave no authority to the prisoner to write that—received no answer to that telegram, but my brother called on October 3rd and showed it to me, when I made a statement to him—this second telegram is also in the prisoner's writing, and the answer is in my brother's writing. <hi rend="italic">The answer was: "Meet Frank King's Cross</hi>, 3.30. <hi rend="italic">Wire if not."

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector S.</hi>) On October 17th, with Inspector Kyd and other officers, I visited 224, Goswell Road, about 5 p.m.—I said to the Fenigsteins, "We are police officers, and have come to see you with regard to a stamp album, a tantalus, and a marble clock" (a tantalus is a decanter stand with three flasks, which are locked)" which have been stolen by two men by means of housebreaking, and they are in custody. Have you those articles here?"—Alfred said, "A man brought a stamp album here about a week ago for us to sell; he promised to call for it, but has not done so"—Barnett said, "Yes, that was a week last Thursday"—I asked where it was, and they pointed to a shelf near the back door in a par<lb/>titioned off portion of the shop—Mr. Taylor, who was with us, identified the stamp album—I said, "Have you sold any of the stamps?"—both of them said, "No"—I said, "have you attempted to dispose of any?"—both replied, "No"—I had received information about Baldwin—I said, "Did not you take some of the stamps to Baldwin in an envelope?"—Barnett replied, "Yes, to get them valued. I brought them back"—he then produced an envelope from a letter rack, and another from the safe—those two envelopes are produced here, and contain stamps—I had other information—I said, "Are you sure you did not get anything else from that man?"—Barnett said, "No, we did not; he has never brought a marble clock here, nor a tantalus"—Alfred then said, "The man has only been here once, when he left the stamp album, for which he promised to call the following week, but has not done so"—I had a search warrant—I</p>

               <p>read it to them, and proceeded to execute it—in the safe I found these two tankards, which were identified by Mr. Taylor—I said, "How do you account for the possession of these tankards, and pointed out that the initials had been filed out—Barnett said, "The same man left them to have the initials taken out, and re-plated"—I said, "Who is the man?"—Barnett said, "We do not know him; he gave us his name as C. Rows, 36, Great Ormond Street"—I said, "Did not he bring other things in?"—Alfred said, "No, he did not"—I proceeded with my search—I said, "Can you show me any entry in your books relating to those articles?"—both of them replied, "No, we do not enter repairs"—I said, "How do you know whose goods they are?"—I received no reply—I told them I should take them into custody and charge them with receiving the tankards and the album, knowing them to have been stolen—Alfred said, "We may have taken them unconsciously"—Barnett said, "Surely you are not going to lock us up?"—this list produced is circulated among pawnbrokers and other kindred businesses containing notification of losses—in it appears, "Two tankards, with initials E. H."—I found it on the desk—I pointed out the entry to them—Alfred said, "That was a long time after, and you cannot remember everything "the list was published on October 14th—the goods were stolen between October 2nd and 9th—I found invoices, one containing an entry respecting a plated decanter stand—the heading on the invoices is "Fenigstein Brothers, gold, silver, and platinum refiners, buyers of every description of materials, gold, silver, or platinum"—Alfred said, "That would be a tantalus, as you call it; it is at home, but I bought that from another man"—I asked who the man was—he said he' did not know him, but he described him as of soldierly appearance—other goods were mentioned in the invoice—I asked Alfred if he bought them from the same man, and he said he had not—I asked them what their practice was with regard to invoices from people from whom they made purchases—they said (I think it was Alfred) they made out a duplicate invoice which they gave the vendor, and kept the duplicate—I said, "You, do not appear to have done so in this case"—Alfred, I think, said, "No, the man did not give me his name, therefore I could not put it on"—I took them to the police station—they gave their address as 25, Rushmore Road, Lower Clapton—I took from each of them a bunch of keys—I then went with Inspector Kyd to that address—Barnett pointed out this large key on his bunch, which he said was the key of the safe in his bedroom—Inspector Kyd made a note of what we did in Rushmore Road—later on I went to 224, Goswell Road, where I found this dessert spoon, which ha been identified by Mr. Taylor as his property, also the mackintosh, as the proceeds of housebreaking—I also found a bag of coins, since identified by Robert Evans as taken from 85, Melrose Avenue—the previous day I had asked Alfred, "Whose mackintosh is that?"—he said, "it is mine"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "A lodger that left our house left it behind"—that is the reason I did not take that day—I also found in The safe at Goswell Road this gold ring with a gold pig on it and a charm, identified by Mr. Crabtree as taken from his house at Forest Gate—I found at the prisoners' house these chased silver stick mounts and four plain ones—those have been identified as the property of Goodwood &amp;</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went to the prisoners' premises at 224, Goswell Road, both prisoners were present—I had three officers with me—I did not at first tell Alfred I had a warrant—they were in the front of the shop and I asked them to go into the back part—we did not want to create public attention—I am not able to say if any stamps are missing—Baldwin is a respectable man—his specialty is Colonial stamps as distinguished from Continental stamps, and so on—no stamps were sold to Baldwin—I have no evidence of a sale of stamps to anyone—the key of the safe is large, and I said, "I suppose this is the key of the shop?"—there is a police whistle with it—I have not the original note given to the prisoners' father—I gave it to the father as I received it—the terms were general, something like this: "Dear father, something has happened, and we are now charged at City Road police station with receiving some stolen pro<lb/>perty. The officers are enquiring about that decanter stand. Go and bring it from the safe"—Fenigstein, the father, was about to do that, and I said, "I want to look in that safe—there we found other stolen property—he could not read the note and I read it for him—it did not say, "Give the officers every assistance"—Alfred said the tankards were left by a man named Rows—Barnett, who was by, did not say, "oh, this is Rows, of Great Ormond Street"—he picked up a book and showed me the name "C. Rows, 36, Great Ormond Street," written in it—he said, "Here it is"—as far as I could judge, the purchase price of the articles found at 224, Goswell Road, would be £8 or £9, not including the album—the police notice to pawnbrokers and others was delivered between 8 and 11, on October 11th, possibly at Goswell Road, about 10 a.m.—the articles were delivered between October 2nd and October 9th, some days before the issue of the police list—we went on Friday about 5 p.m.—I found about twenty police lists on the counter on the premises—I did not take possession of them—I looked through them casually—I do not think all were there—they were not in order.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">who had pleaded guilty</hi>). I was released from prison on March 30th last on ticket-of-leave—I have been employed as a painter, and have been gaining an honest living until I was arrested for failing to report myself, for which I received' one day's imprisonment at Beacons-field—I did not report myself after that—I had a reason for it—amongst other places that I have broken into is the house of Mr. Taylor, of 75, Hillfield Road—I cannot remember the order I took the houses in—I can remember some of them—I remember taking the stamp album, the marble clock and two tankards—I pawned the album—I opened the album and found that the values of the stamps were written over each stamp in the book, and I found a piece of paper with some pencil marks on it,"£48" odd, "1s. 7d.," I believe—I took the album and the marble clock to 224, Goswell Road, the shop kept by the prisoners; I had dealt there before—one stamp has a mark over the top of it of £6—I think it is in the envelope—I said, "I shall want £10 for the stamp album"—a few of the stamps are marked in lead pencil on a slip of paper—ultimately, after arguing, I received £1—I had dealt with them before—they had the clock and tankard—it was the same day of my breaking into the premises and stealing the articles, or the following day, that I took them to the prisoners—only one of the prisoners was there when I went—on that occasion as I was going out, I met the other one coming in, and I went back again with him—the prisoners gave me £1; they were to give more if the articles were found to be of value—I would not like to say the date when I called again, but when I called, the prisoners said that they had taken it to a Mr. Baldwin, of Duncannon Street, Strand, and that he had said they were all forgeries—I said that they had been through all the post offices in the world, and that could not be the case—I left the album with them—besides selling them the album, the clock, and the tankards, I sold the other articles at times—I know there were some cigar cases—one of the houses we broke into had the name of "Commissioner for Oaths" on the door—from 42, Aberdare Road, I took the gold watches</p>

                  </hi>. I am a director of public companies in this country and have a good many business connections and interests in America—I have an office at 28, Victoria Street, on the second floor, consisting of two rooms, Nos. 15 and 16, each with a separate door opening into a corridor—my room was No. 15, and Miss Toovey's, my secretary's room, was No. 16, and next door to mine—coming down the corridor you first come to No. 15 and then to 16—the two rooms had a communicat<lb/>ing door—Miss Toovey had been my secretary for eight or nine years—at the street door there is a hall porter's box, where the keys are kept—a porter is there on duty throughout the day, and letters are also put there for tenants—in my room there was a safe with large doors, and inside it two drawers, each with a separate lock—if the doors of the safe were unlocked and opened you would see a big space above and two drawers below—in the upper space I was in the habit of keeping my books of accounts, cheque books and pass books; also some old used cheque books—there were two keys to the door, which opened the safe; I kept one and Miss Toovey the other—the keys for the drawers in the safe were kept exclusively by myself—there were no duplicates of those keys—the safe had been there for two or three years before Septem<lb/>ber, 1904—I kept the key of my door—my key would not open her door and her key would not open mine, they looked alike, but one would not open the other—so far as I know, these were the only two keys of the corri<lb/>dor doors—I have no recollection of leaving my door key with Bliss Toovey, but she would have access to it, because I sometimes deposited it with the hall porter below when I went out, and if she had wanted it she could have had it—she had authority to get it from him and he would give it to her—up to September of last year I had three banking accounts in London—the Chancery Lane Branch of the Union Bank of London was one—I have had an account there for twelve or thirteen years—in the summer months of last year that account was an open current account, but I operated on it very little—there was not a very large balance there; it was the smallest of all my accounts—I also had an account at the Joint Stock Bank, in Victoria Street, and at the Bank of British North</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130066"/>
               <p>America, at 5, Gracechurch Street—the latter was also a current account up to September, 1904, and much larger than the Union account—it was an active account and sometimes it was large; I had £5,000, £6,000 or £8,000 there, and on one occasion I had a very much larger account there—the London Joint Stock Bank was within a few doors of my office—I have had an account there for twelve or thirteen years and it was he most active account which I had, and was very frequently operated upon when I was in London—in the summer of last year the balance there was rather low, only about £3,600 to £3,700—on many occasions it has been very much larger and has been higher than £6,000 sometimes—I do not think that my current accounts at all the banks at that time would be more than £10,000, but I think I had £4,000 or £5,000 in each bank on deposit in addition to the collective balance of about £10,000, but I am speaking entirely from memory and my transactions were quite large—in my safe I usually kept cheque books on each of the three accounts in the big part of the safe, but sometimes I kept my London Joint Stock cheque book in my pocket—when not in my pocket it was always in the safe—I kept all the pass books of the banks in my safe and when the cheque book on one of the accounts was exhausted it was the practice to get the cheques back from the bank and paste them on to the corres<lb/>ponding counterfoils—it was Miss Toovey's duty to do that, and in the safe I had several old cheque books made up in that way in June, July, August and September, 1904—in the drawers in the lower part of my safe there were some loose stones and some packets of diamonds—they were wrapped up in paper and not sealed—there were a few diamond pins and some diamond cuff buttons and a diamond watch chain, or rather a diamond set in a watch chain; they were in a packet of tissue paper—they did not all belong to me, but I was holding them for a friend—there was £600 or £700 worth of jewellery belonging to my wife in a packet kept separate from the others, both in the same drawer—there had been some correspondence about the jewellery which I was keeping for my American friend which I had dictated to Miss Toovey and which was copied into the letter book—there was no entry in the book with regard to my wife's jewellery, and I do not think it was known to Miss Toovey that it was there—my recollection is that all those jewels were there in the summer months of last year—my wife's jewels had been there for a few years and the rest for some months—this (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is my cheque book on the Union Bank, Chancery Lane—it was not an active account—this is the current cheque book, which I had at that time, and is the only cheque book I had on that bank at that time to my recollection, but it is an old book—the first cheque pasted in is an old cheque of 1895—I discontinued using that bank, but a few cheques had been used down to August, 1896—several cheques pasted into the cheque book have been passed through the bank—I see in this book the remainder of three counterfoils from which apparently have been torn the remaining portions of the adhering cheques—the last one remaining whole is 7504, then come some which are torn out and then 7508 and there are three tags left in—this book (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 3, <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my current cheque book on the London Joint Stock Bank, Victoria Street, in September</p>

               <p>last year, and I see between cheque 95122 and the next one to it, 95125, that cheque forms have gone and that in the binding there are two little bits of paper which have just been left in, two unused cheques having been abstracted—I find that 95127 is also missing, and there is a similar little bit of paper left in the binding—it is torn up to the binding nearly as close as could be—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) purports to be drawn by me in favour of Walter Stone or order for £819, dated September 22nd, 1904—it bean the endorsement "Walter Stone" and also the mark of the bank showing that it has been paid—it is not signed by me—it was not drawn by my authority and is a forgery—the number is 95124 and is drawn from this book—last year I went abroad on August 1st and I was last at my office on that morning, but I closed the office on the Satur<lb/>day previous and gave my clerk a holiday—I have no other clerk besides Miss Toovey in that office, but I was a director of a company which has offices close by, but in these two rooms there were only Miss Toovey and myself—she was in attendance on the Saturday and knew I was going away—I had intended going on the Saturday and she asked me if she could have a holiday on the Monday, as it was Bank Holiday, and on the Monday I went down to get my letters—this particular cheque book I obtained myself from the London Joint Stock Bank on Saturday morning, July 30th—it was new at that time, and I went up to my office and drew a few cheques for small amounts that were due, put it in my pocket and went away and did not come back for three weeks, as I was motoring on the Continent—I took the cheque book on the Continent with me—during the three weeks' absence I told Miss Toovey she could go away, but was to look after the cables and so on—she had not to go to the office regularly, but to call me if there were any cables—while I was away I still kept my safe drawer arid big door keys—I do not think I took with me my corridor door key—on my return to London I went to the office again and put the cheque book into the safe—from the date of my return until September 22nd the cheque book was sometimes in my pocket and sometimes in the safe—after my return there was no cheque drawn from this cheque book until August 27th; that is about the time I returned—the counterfoil is in Miss Toovey's writing—she frequently writes the counterfoils and the bodies of cheques if I am busy, leaving me to sign only—on September 22nd I looked at my pass book and found that I had about £3,600 on current account there—I did not go to the office on September 22nd; I had been playing golf, but I came to the office late in the afternoon, when they telephoned for me—I got there a little after 5, I think, and Miss Toovey then made a communication to me and I saw this cheque for £819—one of the bank officials was there—I pro<lb/>nounced the cheque to be a forgery—I saw Inspector Fuller there—this key, labelled 5, belongs to one of my office doors—I think it is my door, or it is very much like it, I cannot really tell—my recollection is that I only gave one key to Inspector Arrow—on September 26th this year I was at my office with Arrow and a locksmith, who took off the lock of the door of No. 15, and I saw the locksmith with a piece of a key in his hand and I saw the same piece (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) at Westminster Police</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WRIGHT</hi>. During the last four or four and a half years Miss Toovey occupied the position of shorthand writer and typist, and for five and a half years she has been my book-keeper and secretary—during the last four or five years I have had nobody else per<lb/>manently in the office—during that time I have been abundantly satisfied with Miss Toovey and she has been a faithful clerk, and I have had ab<lb/>solute confidence in her integrity—she had the key of the safe, but never the keys of the drawers; I always kept them myself—to my knowledge I never saw Bridgwater until I saw him at the Police Court—when I left the office at night my custom was to leave my office key in the hall porter's office, and it was hung up on a nail or something of that sort with the number of the rooms attached—besides my key and Miss Toovey's there was doubtless a key kept by the people of the house for the pur<lb/>pose of entering and cleaning—I do not know where they were kept and I know nothing about them—it was with my knowledge and sanction that Miss Toovey took the office key home with her—there were no duplicates of the keys of the drawers in the safe—on August 23rd I arrived at Waterloo in the morning and went to the office—I cannot say if I went to the office every day between August 23rd and 27th, but I probably went two or three times—the cheque book which I obtained was never out of my possession from the time I got it until I went on my motoring tour—during my motoring tour I confided it to the charge of my valet—it was in my bag, which was unlocked, and he had the key—if he had so chosen he could have had access to the bag—he had then been in my service six or seven years—he is not in my service now, as I have dismissed him—I do not wish to throw any aspersions upon him, and I did not accuse him, but I was suspicious and thought I would make a change—my suspicions arose soon after the forgery took place, but I kept him a few months after that—I discharged him on January 1st—when I went away on July 30th I had a chauffeur in my service—I think he had been with e perhaps a year and a half—he is now with my family in America and still in my service—neither my valet nor chauffeur had any right to look at my cheque book—the valet had the right to open the bag, but the chauffeur had not—from August 23rd to September 22nd my current cheque book on the London Joint Stock Bank was either in the safe or in my pocket, or at the Hyde Park Hotel—when I dressed or undressed it was in a drawer at the hotel with my other papers, but was not locked up—after my return from abroad my valet stated to me that he was aware while we were away that three cheques were missing from the cheque book, and at that time I had no reason to doubt the statement, but it does not at all accord with what I heard at the Police Court—it was two or three days after the forgery that he said he had noticed whilst he was packing my bag in Paris that three cheques were missing from the interior of the book—he did not say counterfoils—I informed the bank of the fact—I regarded it as his bounden duty, as an honest man, to tell me at once when</p>

               <p>he found that the cheques were missing, but he never said anything to me about it until after the fact of the forgery was common knowledge in my house—I first doubted his statement about the end of September or beginning of October—the bank manager first suggested it to me—I had not direct communication with the police; I do not think they credited the statement—I do not know where my valet is now—I also spoke to my chauffeur about the matter and he corroborated the valet's statement that the cheques were found to have been missing by the valet in Paris—the chauffeur said that when he entered my room in Paris the valet said, "There is a cheque missing from Mr. Fox's cheque book"; that he, the chauffeur, said, "Why don't you tell Mr. Fox?" and the valet said, "Oh, I suppose he took it himself; he often takes cheques."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have never taken cheques out of the body of my cheque books; I sometimes, for convenience, tear out the next cheque when I am going away, but I would never take it from the middle of the book and I should not tear out the counterfoil—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my pass book at the London Joint Stock Bank—this page reads: "1904, amount £3,763 Is. 8d."—that is the credit, and on the opposite side: "1904, £1,222 1s. 9d."—it was two or three days after the discovery of the forgery that my valet spoke to me about the cheques being missing in Paris—he was not interviewed by the police before he made a statement to me, so far as I know—I know they interviewed him when this fact came out—I spoke to the bank manager within two hours of my valet making the statement to me, which was on September 24th, 1904.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now undergoing a sentence of six months' hard labour at Wormwood Scrubbs—I was sentenced at this Court on July 26th last to that term for uttering counterfeit coin, and at the same time I was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude concur<lb/>rently for office breaking in the City, and I had been sentenced in this country twice before that, the last time being a term of two years' hard labour for attempting to obtain the impression of keys from a postman at a pillar box—I have also been convicted in America for several offences, my sentence including one of ten years' penal servitude for forgery—when I was arrested upon the last occasion this box of wax was found in my possession—it has got upon it the impression of a key—it is what is called modelling wax, and there are grooves in the side of the box for the barrel of the key to sink into at the side—I have known Dr. Bridgwater about four years—I remember saying that, at the Westminster Police Court in this case, and he said he had never seen me in his life before—I came out of prison from the two years' imprisonment on the first Saturday of June last year and I called at Bridgwater's place on the Monday at the corner of Oxford Street and Soho Street—I called there to see him and to see other people whom I expected to meet there—when I saw Bridgwater I asked him where Wigram was—he is a man I used to see occasionally—he is the same as myself; I mean he mixes up with a lot of people who are not exactly straight; he is in Scotland now—his line of business was handling forged cheques or anything he could get any money at—we called him the "Moocher" or "Bill"—I asked after him by the</p>

               <p>because she was so well treated by him and that he judged from her remarks that Mr. Fox had this amount of money on deposit at the bank—he told me that Wigram and Robertson had tried the key upstairs on the office door, but could not get in and must have gone to the wrong door on the landing, as there are three or four then—he sug<lb/>gested that I should go up and get the impression from Miss Toovey; that I was to go up in the morning or evening, when she would be in, and say that I had seen a notice of her room at the station at Streatham—it was not there at that moment, but it had been there a month previously; of course, I was not out at the time—I was to ask for a furnished room or two, if necessary, and Bridgwater said she would be only too anxious to let it to an American if she thought I was an American, because she thought they were very liberal with their money—I went up there and <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as be directed—I was to get the impression from her safe key and door key, which he told me were in a little hand bag that she carried—when I went to her I gave her the name of Dean—at Bridgwater's I went in the name of Blair; that name was given me so that Bridgwater's helps should not know my real name—Bridgwater knew me as Blair and Fisher and every name that I took—I took Miss Toovey's lodgings about the latter part of June—I had the front parlour and bedroom—I paid my rent weekly, in advance; it was not a question of money—I had a couple of bags and a hat box there—having got into the house as a lodger, I waited to see if she left the bag on the dining room table—eventually I saw it there by the sewing machine—I went the first or second night to try the door leading into the dining room by the bath room, but it was locked—it is a flat threw—there was no other lodger besides me—I had my meals separately in the front room; this dining room was hers—the door on the first night was locked because her sister was there—after a few nights it was left unlocked, and I went in and found the keys in a little bag and took an impression of the door key and safe key and two little desk Keys, I believe they were—one was a Yale key, the key of the house where we lived, and I did not take that—I took the impression next morning to Bridgwater, and he said he would have the keys made by the next day or so, but the impressions were poor and I was to get more—he told me he had them made, and gave them to me, and I took them to the Victoria Street offices and tried them—I knew which were the offices—Bridgwater brought me up there and showed me, and I tried the door next to Mr. Fox's office—there are three doors there—the result was that I broke the tumblers off the key in the look—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the piece of the key I broke off—after that I hurried back to Bridgwater's place and told him about it, and said I was much worried about it, and feared that it would stop the look and be an obstruction in it—he said he was sorry and was afraid it would be a tumble, but told me to go home, and wait and see, and that I could tell by Miss Toovey's actions when she came in how it stood—I went back to Miss Toovey's house, and when she came in everything looked as sweet as it could be, and I thought it was all right—the next thing was another impression, which I obtained—I pulled up a plant in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130072"/>
               <p>the garden, and when she came in I met her and showed her the plant which I had pulled up, and said somebody had pulled it up—she had to go upstairs, and then came down to fix the plant and so gave me a chance of getting an impression—she looked at the plant, which had only been there a few days, and got a little trowel and ran downstairs and put it into the ground—while she was downstairs I went to the adjoining room and got the bag out, had the keys and took more impressions, which I took down and gave to Bridgwater—I got three more different keys from him, specimens of each lock; three duplicates of each key—the door key that I received opened the office door and a board room door beyond—when I got into Mr. Fox's office I ran round to see if the safe was there—I found it and shoved the key in and turned the lock, but I threw it back again, because I had not time, and I did not look into the safe—I went out—I next visited the premises about a week or ten days afterwards—I allowed that time to elapse because a man saw me at one of the doors—the next time I went there was a Monday—the cheque was put off at the bank on the Thursday in the same week, and the Monday would be September 19th—before I went in that time I was looking over some of Miss Toovey's things at her house, and got a letter of recommendation which the doctor (<hi rend="italic">Bridgwater</hi>) said she had from Mr. Fox—it was to copy the handwriting—she kept it in a large book with other letters which she had in a book case, a large sort of portfolio—she showed it to me because I brought up the conversation about things which she kept in the portfolio, letters about herself, and she was only too proud to show me—there were two testimonials from Mr. Fox; one was a large one of three or four pages, and the other, I think, was only a single page—I took the larger one, of course—I had seen it on the Sunday, and I took it on the Monday after I had been to the safe, but the same day—I went to the safe about 10 a.m. on Monday—Bridgwater went with me to the building, but not into it—it was arranged that he was to wait for Miss Toovey coming along in order to hold her until I got out—she would come to the office across West<lb/>minster Bridge and up Victoria Street—when I got to the safe and saw the inside of it I looked round for the cancelled book or the book which had cancelled cheques in it—after some rummaging over the papers, I saw one—it was four or five years old—I tore three pieces out—by pieces I mean cheques, and I pulled them out of the stub—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the cheque book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at the Westminster Police Court—on September 30th I took the depositions of Charles Robert Fisher when he was giving evidence against the prisoners—that was the first date on which he gave evidence—in the course of his evidence Bridgwater made an interruption which I took a note of—Fisher said, "I have known Bridgwater about four years, whereupon Bridgwater said, "May I say I have never seen that man before in my life.'

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The case had been opened in Bridgwater's presence before Fisher was called, and it had been stated in his presence as an opening that he had had all these dealings with Fisher.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">C. R. FISHER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Examination continued</hi>). After I had torn out the used cheques I looked for a cheque book which was not used—I found one and tore three cheques out, two in succession and one further on; I only left a small margin—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the book—there was also what looked like a small tin cash box in the safe, which I picked up and shook to see what was in it—I put it back again—there were a lot of papers in the safe, but I did not look at them or examine anything else except this pass book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), as I wanted to see how much balance there was, and I found that it was about £3,500—besides the cheques and the balance I was looking for Mrs. Fox's diamonds, which were supposed to be in a jewel case, but I did not see it there—having got the used and the unused cheques I brought them out and gave them to Bridgwater, who was outside near the corner—I gave them to him at a public-house, the first one as you cross from Westminster Bridge coming over the bridge—he asked me if I had seen the diamonds and I told him I had not seen the jewel case—he said it was very funny and looked at me very suspicious as if I had them—I put my hands into my pockets and said, "They are not there," patting them—he asked me how much balance there was and I said I did not think it would stand for more than £3,500—he asked me if there were any more, and I said I did not think he had any more than that—he said, "All right, I will put in the first piece for a little to get some 'ready'"—that was ready money, as we were broke; he meant a small cheque—we had a drink and talked for three or four moments and then left and went to his office, where we arrived about 11, when he took the pieces or cheques up to his room and put them between a book to keep them smooth and told me I should go over and get the handwriting of Mr. Fox in the recommendation or testimonial, which I did—I had mentioned the recommendation to him which I had seen there on the Sunday—I was acquainted with Miss Toovey's hours at her house—she generally went out about 10 a.m., sometimes a little before, and sometimes she would be back about 6, and sometimes a little later—I had a latchkey and there was no one in the house when she and I were absent—the place where the scrap book was kept was not locked—I got back to Bridgwater's premises with the testi<lb/>monial, I think, after 1 o'clock—I gave it to him and he handed it to Shackell, who came there between 1 and 2—he had been there when I got back from Miss Toovey's, and I was only in there a short time when he came in again; he used to run in and out—I had seen him before on that day—when he came in again he took the letter and wanted to sit down and practise there—Bridgwater was there all the time; it was in his sitting room upstairs—Shackell was a bit nervous that day and Bridgwater told</p>

               <p>him to go home and take a tonic—he practised some characters of Mr. Fox's writing sitting down at the table with a pen and ink, and I stepped out of the room—Bridgwater came out and left him, as he wanted to be alone, but he was not able to do it that day, but he tried to do a "piece"—I saw it on the landing with Bridgwater and Shackell—no one else saw it then that I know of; it was one of the cheques—Bridgwater said it had not been done well enough to go in—I looked at it, but did not see much the matter with it—the doctor had a little double glass that he put up to see if the were shaky—the amount was £600 odd—the doctor said Shackell was to straighten out and go home and take a tonic and come back again—that is all that was done about the matter on that day, and I went back to Miss Toovey's—next day I came down to Bridgwater's office and met Shackell—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I saw Holmes there every day I went there, in the drug room or dispensary or all over the house as he had the run of it, and he was there when I went there between 12 and 1 on the Tuesday—it was arranged that Shackell was to try to do the thing again on the Tuesday, but he could not make a success of it—he did not try on a cheque form, but on a piece of paper—as he was unsuccessful the doctor said he was to go home and come down next Wednesday—on the Tuesday Holmes, Bridgwater and myself were all together, sitting in the consulting room, which we often used to do when no one else was there—the subject of the conversation was that Holmes was to put the piece in when it was ready, butfnot to get cash; he was to put it through an account—this was on the Tuesday and Wednesday—when Shackell sat down and practised he was in the dining room above the drug room—Holmes was present when we were talking about it, but he had to be downstairs in case anyone should call, because the place was open—on the Monday or Tuesday Bridgwater said to me that Holmes was to take the cheque and get the money for it—I think he said that on the Monday—on the Tuesday it was talked of in Holmes' presence when Shackell was there—on the Tuesday night I went back to Miss Toovey again and on the Wednesday Shackell came to the office when I was there with Bridgwater and Holmes—after talking and having several drinks Shackell went upstairs again to try it, but could not make a success of it—he sat down to practise from the recommendation from Mr. Fox to Miss Toovey—the cheque was put off on the Thursday, and I believe it was actually written on that day—I was then on the top floor, but not in the room—Shackell was in the dining room; I judged it was then between 12 and 1—I was sometimes in the next room, which is the doctor's sleeping room—the kitchen was also on that floor—Shackell was by himself when he did it—Bridgwater was up there with me; he went in and then left Shackell in the room—Holmes was in the drug room—I saw the result—I was at the door when I examined it—when Shackell opened the door of the room, I knew it was finished and he showed me the two pieces or cheques filled up—Bridgwater was there and examined them and then showed them tome—Bridg-water had a small glass to examine them with and said the work was not A1 work, he thought it would go through, but he thought he ought to have done</p>

               <p>better—Holmes saw them up there about ten minutes afterwards—I do not remember if he expressed any opinion—the cheques were then put into a book to keep smooth—I stopped around there mostly all that day and had Mr. Fox's letter given to me, which I put in my pocket—I stayed there until the cheque was cashed—I may have gone out for a short time, but I did not go home—I think I put back the testimonial in the evening so that Miss Toovey would not miss it—that day Holmes and Bridgwater went out to get one of the cheques cashed—one was for £819 and the other for £600 and some odd—before they started the doctor said in Holmes' hearing the £600 one would be put down—Shackell was upstairs then with us and present at the conversation—as near as I can tell, they went out to put down the cheque about 3 o'clock—Holmes was dressed in a long Prince Albert coat and a top hat—I call a Prince Albert coat a frock coat—he had a light overcoat on his arm—I judged that they returned about 6 p.m.; it might be a little before—I saw Holmes and Bridgwater—nobody else was present besides we three—Bridgwater said, "It has come off and there is nice clean money," showing me some £50 notes—I was given to understand by Bridgwater that it was the £600 cheque which had been put down—it was arranged that I should get one-third, which would be £200 odd, but Bridgwater said that after deducting expenses, my corner, as he called it, would come to about £115, but I did not get £115—he said there was the expense for office hire and money he had spent on taking Miss Toovey to dinner and theatres in order to sweeten her up on the first start—Bridgwater gave me £10 in gold and he wanted to give me English notes, but I would not take them—I took the £10 in gold, as I wanted to use it—I wanted the banknotes exchanged, as I did not care about taking them, and he said he would get them changed with his money to French money and would send them away that night to France by his wife—I understood him to mean by his wife, Mrs. Foster—I had seen her before, and he had introduced me to her as his wife—I knew from Bridg-water that she lived at Seaford—he said he had sent for her; I think he said he had wired—I saw her that night at the doctor's about 7, but I did not speak to her—I saw her going upstairs to the upper floor and she went out with the doctor to the station—the doctor told me they were going down by Holborn Viaduct and he was to leave her on the train for Paris—I saw them go out about 7.30, and that is the last I saw of her that night—the doctor said he was to change a couple of notes at Cook's—he did not say who was to do it, but he went down there with Holmes to change them—that was said on the Thursday night before Mrs. Foster arrived—I went back to Miss Toovey's on the Thursday night and saw her and noticed that she acted rather strange and a bit excited, and she looked queer—next day I saw Bridgwater at his office and told him that I thought it must have been a tumble by the way Miss Toovey acted; I meant that she must have discovered that there was something wrong with the cheque, and it might have been found out in some way—Bridgwater said he did not think so and I was to go back that night—he had said that the second cheque was to go in on the Saturday—on the Friday I saw Holmes in the evening across the way from the doctor's place, standing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130076"/>
               <p>at the corner of the street, watching the office, waiting to see the doctor—he had been into the office on that day, but there was not much doing—when I saw him in the evening opposite he told me he wanted to see the doctor in order to get something, I suppose money—he said he wanted to get the rest of his corner—he told me his share in this matter was to be 25 percent.—I told him that the doctor would be round in a moment, but before that I said, "This <hi rend="italic">ain't no</hi> place for you; you had better keep away from here on account of Miss Toovey"—I said Miss Toovey was likely to come round there and it was not a place for him or me either—that is all I said about Miss Toovey, and I went home that night and saw her and had a conversation with her—I noticed her appearance before I spoke to her—she looked very much troubled—I saw Bridgwater afterwards and told him what I had said to Miss Toovey—next morning I formed an opinion as to whether she had found out anything, and in consequence I packed my bag ready to go that morning, and I paid Miss Toovey in advance for my lodging—I think I gave her about £4, which would keep the rooms open for me for three or four weeks—I judge I came away about 6 o'clock in the morning (<hi rend="italic">September</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)—I left my bag at the luggage office, first at Black-friars, then I went to the doctor's and rang the bell; he slept upstairs—it was his dwelling house as well as his business premises—I got there about 7 a.m., and saw him and told him I was certain now from what Miss Toovey had told me that the piece or cheque could not go in because they knew of the one already cashed—he said he was glad I had come down and told him, as it would save a man—he asked me if I had my things, and I told him I had taken all away and cleared off—I took my luggage to Addison Road station from Blackfriars—I had previously had another trunk there which I had taken from Victoria—I left the whole of the luggage in the cloak room at Addison Road—later on that day I saw Shackell at the office—he told me he had only got £50 for his corner al<lb/>together; that he had had £70 given him, but he had given £20 to a man whom the doctor had introduced to him to change for him and he had run away with it—he said his name was Bill the Barman—it was on this occasion that Shackell told me they had cashed the £800 piece instead of the smaller one—he said he knew that because Holmes had told him how much he had put it down for—he told me that the doctor had told him that he had sent the money over to Paris, and he, the doctor, had lost it, as hey had stuck to it over there—I think it was about a week after it was put off that Shackell told me that—I saw him mostly every time I went to the doctor's office—the doctor's excuse for not giving Shackell his full I money was because he had lost the money in Paris, and Shackell said he was going to stick around off and on, until he got his full part—I saw Shackell often after that date at the doctor's house, and sometimes I met him outside in Argyle Street—I did not see Holmes on that Saturday—when I saw him on the Friday outside the doctor's house he had a soft hat and a very light coloured overcoat—I had never seen him dressed like that before—he usually had a tall hat and a long black coat—on the Saturday night I was at the doctor's until about 9 p.m.—I saw Foster</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130077"/>
               <p>and the doctor there about 9 o'clock—I had no conversation with her, she came into the consulting room and then went upstairs to the doctor's—I saw her several times that night—that evening I got the rest of the money to make up £115—I got it shortly after the doctor came down-stairs from leaving Mrs. Foster—it was in French money, some paper and some coin—that night I slept at the doctor's in Oxford Street—on the Sunday I went down to Seaford with Mrs. Foster and the doctor, and went with the doctor to Mrs. Foster's house, which is named "Iron clyde" or "Ironside," or something similar to that—it faces the see and is about three or four minutes from the station—it is a corner house—when you come out of the station you turn to the left and it is right op<lb/>posite the sea and the railway track—I was in one of the upper bedrooms there—I think there are only two floors; I mean the ground floor and one above it—it is a peculiarly built house—I was also in the dining-room and kitchen, which is at the back of the house towards the yard—there are windows only on the left side of the entrance door as you go in—there is a garden at the side of the street on the door side of the house, and there were some very nice pears growing on the wall—I do not know their name—while I was there we had dinner—Mrs. Foster was there, but no servant—no one else was there but we three—at dinner Bridgwater handed Mrs. Foster three fivers or £5 notes and said, "This is towards the expenses of going over to Paris"—she took the fivers and said, "All right"—that day we went to a couple of public-houses and had some drink, and from there crossed the downs to the coastguard station, where the doctor got a basket of mushrooms and a few fresh eggs from the coastguardmen—he told me he always went down there and liked to show himself around—I spoke to the coastguardsmen in Bridgwater's presence, but I do not remember exactly what I said—next morning, Monday, Bridgwater and I left Seaford and came up on the same train—I paid four or five other visits to Seaford after that—that was the first one I had paid—I always went down on Saturday nights or Sunday mornings with one exception—one day we made another trip to the coastguards, when we took a carriage and drove to Alfriston—Mrs. Foster did not go, only Bridgwater and myself—he was there all the other times; I always went down with him—we spent the rest of our time going round to public-houses when they were open; there were only two, but that took up pretty near all the afternoon—I was generally with Bridgwater but I went oncer twice alone to one of the houses, but the long expeditions I always went with Bridgwater—while I was staying with Miss Toovey I saw some photographs in her possession—I took one of them and brought it home to a room I then had at Shepherd's Bush—that was after I was staying at Miss Toovey's—I did not take the photo from Miss Toovey's until the day I left—I kept it in my possession up to the time of my arrest—it was in my trunk at 5, Portland Road, Holland Park, which is very near Shepherd's Bush—after my arrest it remained there, as far as I know, until I saw it at the Police Court—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is it; it is a photograph of Miss Toovey sitting up in bed (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1)—she told me her brother took it—while I was visiting Bridgwater's, and after the forgery,</p>

               <p>I had something done to my teeth—I forget the dentist's name; he was around in Charing Cross Road—the doctor gave me a letter of intro<lb/>duction to him—he crowned three teeth and made a few false upper teeth—to the best of my recollection I paid him twelve guineas—while I was visiting Bridgwater's there was a man named Darby employed there; he was drug clerk before Holmes went there—when I first visited Bridgwater's I was supposed to be a patient of his, so far as Darby was to know—there was a call book there kept by Darby—I often saw my name written down in it—some days while Darby was keeping the book I called three or four times and my name was written down three or four times on one day—I had a conversation with Bridgwater about the book and told him that Darby was enter<lb/>ing my name so often in the book and that it would look bad if my name was connected with him—I was going in the name of Blair—that is Darby (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to a man</hi>)—Bridgwater said he would tear my name out when the thing was over and when he had got rid of Darby—Darby left, to the best of ray knowledge, three or four weeks before the forgery—this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the call book in which my name was entered; there are now pages missing from it—there was a man called Everett employed at Bridgwater's—when he first came he was in charge of the reception room and would take the names into the consulting room to the doctor—th patients had to put their names on a slip of paper, and if the doctor was not there Everett would probably go into the drug room—Everett would put the names or the paper—he was there until I stopped going in January last—he war not there when I first went there on June 6th; I should think he came in July or August—I ceased to go to the doctor's the first or second Monday in January—I did so on account of Holmes getting into trouble—I went to America in December of last year—I only stayed a few days—I was over there for Christmas—I sailed from New York the last day in December—Holmes was arrested while I was in America or on the way—I visited Bridgwater's place one day after I came back from America—I saw Bridgwater and he told me about Holmes being in trouble and asked me for some money towards the defence—I did not con<lb/>tribute anything then—that was a couple of days after I landed; I believe it was on a Monday—I never went back to Bridgwater's after he told me to keep away—I know those two men (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to Berry and Eastwrick</hi>)—they are the two coastguardmen—on one occasion when we visited the coastguard station there was a little girl there, I think—I gave her a coin or it may have been a few coppers—both the coastguardmen were then a short distance away—I think the little girl belonged to the man with the beard (<hi rend="italic">Berry</hi>)—I remember the mother looking out of the window and calling her, and the one with the beard attended to her—one of the public-houses that I went to with Bridgwater at Seaford was the Terminus, and the other the Wellington—the Wellington was a short distance from the Terminus—I know that man (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to Hadlow</hi>)—he is the landlord of the Wellington—after the forgery Bridgwater told me that Miss Toovey had called on him and told him that she was up and down Hol<lb/>born Viaduct to Chancery Lane looking for my office, as I had told her that</p>

               <p>I had an office in the district, but I did not have any—she thought I had an office in that district and wanted to find it—Bridgwater said I had better keep away from that district—he told me that Miss Toovey had told him that the Scotland Yard men were down at Fox's office and that three or four photos were shown to her, and that one looked very much like her lodger, but she was in doubts and would not recognise it, but thought it looked like him; that is what the doctor told me she said, and also that she said she would like to find me to show me to the detectives, as she was quite satisfied her lodger had not done it—Bridgwater discussed with me the probability of arrests being made after Miss Toovey had called and before I went to America—he said if there was any trouble he was fixing up an alibi for himself, and of course he would look after the in<lb/>terests of Holmes—he told me he had palled up someone at Seaford—I do not know who he was, but someone connected with the railroad—he said he was strong enough to see it through, as he was £500 or £600 strong—he had a watch and chain and a large pearl locket, or it looked like a pearl in a horseshoe, and also a diamond ring—he said he had pawned them in order to prove he had no money at the time the forgery was committed—that is what he told me, and I know he pawned the ring, because I saw she ticket—I do not know where he pawned it—it was a little time after the forgery—he said he meant to pay the quarter's rent and some drug bills with the money he got for pawning the ring—I know a man called Flack-man or Flatman—I have seen him at the doctor's office—he was the manager, I believe, of an hotel at Southend, and the doctor said he could always have Flatman in case he wanted him to prove an alibi—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is my note book which was found upon me when I was arrested—this entry at the bottom I made at the time I went to Seaford, and after looking at it I now remember that the name of Mrs. Foster's house was "Ingleside"—I know where Shackell lived, but I cannot remember the address—I had it in my book—he lived over Clapham way—I made this other entry in my book at the time I saw Shackell, just before the forgery began—I went to his house once about a week or two after the forgery—the address is 2, Beauchamp Road, Lavender Hill, W.—that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to F. Bollard</hi>) is the dentist who did my teeth—when I last saw Holmes on the Friday about the time of the forgery he told me he intended to leave the doctor's and go off in the public-house line looking after fixtures or something like that—he said where he intended to do that, but I did not pay much attention to it—it was out of town, and as long as he went away I did not much bother about it.</p>

I hope I am a truthful man; I am a truthful man in all this matter—I have no doubt that, apart from this matter, I have told fibs—I never told one unless it was absolutely necessary for my own safety—I would tell a lie for my own safety, but I would not do so on my oath—I do not know that Inspector Arrow has said he would not believe me on my oath unless I were corroborated—if he has said so I do not agree with him—I was born in 1854—my first conviction was not in 1866—I say that at the age of twelve I was not convicted for robbing my grandfather—I have a fair memory, which goes back probably twenty</p>

               <p>years—I swore that it would not go back more than five or six years, but at the moment I did so it probably would not go back five or six years—that was when you were cross-examining me—to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion I was first convicted in America in 1883 or 1884—I have worked at several businesses—I have been in the jewellery line honestly for an Englishman and for a Londoner—I do not saw I have not been dishonest, but I do not remember it—I have been in the grain weighing business, the tinning business and gold business—it would not be true to say of me that I made no secret of the fact that I was a thief and a forger by profession and an expert in all the arts of professional thieves in England, America, and on the Continent—I do not remember anybody giving any description like that—I do not remember Arrow saying so, and if it is in the newspaper, with all due respect to the newspaper people, I think they invented it—Arrow may have said that I was a German and that one of my chief methods was to carry a box of wax, by means of which I took an impression of any keys I came across, but it is not true, as I did not always carry wax; but part of it is true—I do not believe he said that I was one of the moat notorious and desperate criminals that he ever had in his ken—I have been convicted two or three times in America; my sentences were ten years, three and a half years, and six months—I came here in 1892 or 1893; I think it was 1893—I remember Cincinatti gaol; I escaped from there—I said before that I did not escape, but quietly walked away—six or seven others were with me—an impression was not taken of the keys of the gaol and false keys made, but the gaoler left the keys in his room while he went to breakfast—it was usual for him to do so; it is laughable, but it is a fact—nobody was left in charge, and half a dozen prisoners were walking about, so any of them could get the key, and walk downstairs, which they did—that is not a fair sample of the prison system in America—I did not serve the whole of my three and half years—I served probably about eighteen months—that was several years after I escaped from prison, but it was on the same charge—I got a parole; it is the parole system there—it is not the same as the ticket-of-leave, as you can get a parole nine months after you are sentenced, for good behaviour, and if you have anybody who will give you employment—I got my parole on account of good conduct—my good conduct did not consist in giving information to the authorities of three or four persons who I said had been connected with me in my crimes—I will swear that—in several States in America, and especially in Ohio, it is usual for anybody to get a remission of eighteen months or two years out of a sentence of three and a half years—a life man can get out after serving two or three years—I had a couple of thousand dollars in my pocket in 1893 and I thought I would take a run over here and see what I could do—I may have stayed here about eighteen months—during that time I bought and sold articles of jewellery and knocked about race tracks—I dealt in jewellery honestly—during the whole of the time, I was getting my living honestly and took some jewellery over to America with me—I remember a robbery at a fine Art depot in Bloomsbury; that was later, I think in 1897 or 1898—I went to the fine art shop and asked the price of a valuable picture, but did not buy it—I then complained of my feet being very bad and</p>

               <p>asked for something to knock a nail down in my shoe—I believe they gave me a hammer, but I objected to it because I wanted to get the im<lb/>pression of a key—there was nothing the matter with my foot and no nail in my shoe—having taken back the hammer I believe the people gave me a key to knock down the nail, and while they were there I pulled out my wax and took an impression without anyone seeing—there was not a robbery at that shop a few nights afterwards, but a few mornings after I went in there and came out again—I did not commit a robbery—I was not disturbed; I went in to see if the key would fit and to see if the place was as represented to me—I served six months for that—when I came to England the last time I opened a banking account here—I did not open it in 1892 or 1893; I opened it in 1900, when I came over with my wife—I opened a small account at the Birkbeck Bank—it was not opened for financing forgeries and robberies in this country; I would not open an account for that purpose—I do not say I have not done anything dishonest, but I would not open a banking account for a dis<lb/>honest purpose; it is very easy to find money—in all my life I can only remember once turning upon people whom I had alleged were my part<lb/>ners in my crimes; I think that was in 1881 or 1882 in America—I was not convicted then; I got off by turning upon my companions—they were convicted—I have never turned on my accomplices on any other occasion—at the Police Court you ran me up so and I was a little puzzled, and I may have said that I would not swear that I had not done it four times—I said I was nervous, and you can see that that is true—I use the name of Fisher, Dean, and Blair; Roberts was another and Keeping another—I cannot think of any other names—now I recollect Conrad and Simpson—I was convicted on July 26th this year, when I got the six months and ten years concurrently—I was arrested, I believe, on July 1st, and I sent for Arrow between that day and July 26th; it may have been on the 8th or the middle of July—I spoke to him first, I believe—it was in reference to the present case, and eventually I made a state<lb/>ment to him in respect of the prisoners—I did so because I wanted to throw off everything in connection with my previous life, and I wanted to make it without any connection with my previous life; I am repentant of my crimes—I have been repentant many times, but have gone back to my previous life—I was sick and tired of going about doing wrong, and am now—I was pretty well tired of it before I got the ten years—the treatment I received was enough to make me repentant and tired; I mean the treatment by all who I have been connected with—it did not occur to me in making my statement it would help me in freeing myself from the charges against me, and after I was convicted I did not think that my statement would help me in getting a remission of my sentence—I did not think about it at all—I said before that giving this information was an effort on my part to change my character, and I hope it is so—it is a certainty I am done with all those classes of people now, and have a desire to lead a new life—that desire seized me before I was arrested, because I was going to leave the country the following Wednesday, and I had partly negotiated for my tickets—I think I wrote to Arrow before</p>

               <p>according to Bridgwater's directions—while I was at Miss Toovey's I had a latchkey; I was the only lodger there—I did not know if every cupboard and every drawer in the house was left unlocked, but I know the doors were—I did not go through her drawers and cupboards, because I had no reason to—I first went to Bridgwater's about four years ago, but I would not go to him as a patient; I have got my doctor now and have had him for years—I was represented to Bridgwater's people as a patient—there may have been five or six rooms in Miss Toovey's house; I can only count four now—I was not constantly in and out of her house during the day, because it was a long way from the City, but I could have gone if I had wanted—the conversation between Miss Toovey and myself about the photographs and testimonials in the scrap book was on the Sunday before the forgery—Bridgwater told me that she had a reference, and I only knew it from what he told me, and I brought the matter up so that she could bring out the things—I believe she is an absolutely truthful woman—when she went down into the garden to attend to the plant she was away three or four minutes—when she went out the keys were where she always kept them: in her small reticule bag, upstairs—Miss Toovey only had one floor—I think it was a flat; downstairs is called one house and hers another—when I want to take an impression I do not have to melt my wax—sometimes you can take an impression in a second; it all depends on the nerves of the person doing it—on this occasion I took an impression of the door key and the safe key—there were other keys, but none like them—I think there were only three small drawer keys outside the two large ones—that occurred in the evening after she was through her business, about 6 or 7 p.m.; it was not on a Sunday, but I cannot tell the date—Bridgwater was in Victoria Street with me on two occasions—the last time was on a Monday morning when the safe was opened by me and the things taken out, and the other occasion was some weeks previous, when he came up to show me the right door—I do not think anybody saw the doctor on either of those occasions; we were very careful they should not see us together to make the connection—I saw the doctor and Mrs. Foster together six or seven times—on September 22nd I saw her in the evening; I will not swear the exact time, but it was between 7.30 and 8—I next saw them together on Saturday, the 24th; I think it must have been between 8 and 9 p.m.—I know it was before 9, because the doctor closed his place at 9 and it was not closed then—I did not go to Seaford that night, not until next day—I said in my depositions that I went down on Sunday morning—I went down once without the doctor, because he told me to, but I never went there on my own account—that was about a week or two after the forgery—I did not go to Mrs. Foster; I went down to look at the Wellington Hotel safe, which the doctor said was a difficult one—the Wellington is a goodish-sized hotel—I never knew there was such a place as Seaford until the doctor sent me there, and I was never there until after September 22nd—I made four subsequent visits; I think the last would be in the latter part of October or the first of November—on all those visits the doctor was with me except on one occasion—I slept at</p>

My chief occupation in life has not been forgery and office breaking—I have done a little of almost everything—it seems every time I have done anything I have got into trouble about it—forging and office breaking require a great deal of audacity and skilful<lb/>ness—I do not know that I can plan a dishonest operation—I was well trained by Bridgwater to ingratiate myself with Miss Toovey and to get the testimonials, or I should not have been able to do it—I could not have done it if I had not been led away by him—I knew that Holmes was tried in February and March, but I was on the Continent at the time—I did not know more of that case than what I read and what Bridgwater told me—I read one or two papers in Paris—since my return from Paris I have taken no interest in Holmes' case except this present case—I did not read of his trial at this Court at all; it was in the Police Court when I read it in Paris—I think I was in Paris; it was after Bridgwater told me he was arrested, and I went over there; it might have been the trial, but I do not think so—it was only a little article—I did not take much interest in it, I only wished it was over very quickly—when I first went to Oxford Street in June, 1904, Darby was in the drug room—I cannot say if it was late in August that Holmes came; it was when Darby left—I think it was the latter part of July—it may have been August—before he came I was posing as the patient Blair, but Holmes knew my proper name because the doctor introduced me to him in my proper name of Fisher—I was put down as Blair, and the other helper thought I was Blair—Holmes came every morning, nearly always dressed in a tall hat and frock coat; I never saw him dressed otherwise—he did not change his dress in the day—he had the run of the house—I will swear that Holmes spoke about the cheques when they were discussed—when I gave the doctor the returned cheques on the Monday I said, "Well, we have got it"—Holmes was there then; he was in the drug room and I had to pass the door, which was open—part of the conversation took place upstairs and part in the drug room—what attracted us to the drug room was the whiskey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Cook &amp; Sons, tourist agents and bankers, and in September, 1904, I was employed at their Ludgate Circus office—on the afternoon of September 22nd I remember a man coming into the office to change these two £50 notes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) into French money—they have now got my writing on the back, which I wrote at the time; they are dated January 12th, 1905, Nos. 58307 and 8—I think he came in about 4.30 p.m.—he asked for £100 worth of money—I said, "I have not got £100 in French gold; I can give you 1,000 francs in gold and the rest in notes—he seemed to hesitate and to</p>

               <p>if it was very long before September, 1904, that I was first introduced to Mrs. Foster—I think it was about August—I had not met her before June, when I came out of gaol—between 1900 and 1902 I had been occa<lb/>sionally to 59, Oxford Street, but I never saw Mrs. Foster until about August, 1904—when I refused to take the English banknotes I believe that Bridgwater had already arranged to send the money over to Paris by Mrs. Foster—on September 22nd Holmes, Bridgwater and I were at 59, Oxford Street, between 12 and 1, and after Holmes and Bridgwater went out at 3 o'clock I did not see Bridgwater until 6—when would not take the notes which he offered me he said he would put mine with his and send them over to Paris, and that he was going to send his anyhow—I do not know if it was then that he sent a telegram—it is not possible that I have made a mistake, and that I did not see Mrs. Foster till Friday night—I am quite sure that I saw her on Thursday, some time before 9—before the Magistrate I said that she had a sealskin jacket or cape with a flowery lining—I do not say it was embroidered, but there can be a lining with a print on it—I cannot say if her hat was trimmed with white poppies—I cannot say how it was trimmed; I never notice ladies' hate—I do not know its colour; it was the cape which took my attention particularly—she had no luggage with her when I saw her—in that condition, without any luggage, she went off in a cab with Bridg-water to catch the 7.30 train at Holborn Viaduct—I do not exactly know what time the train was—Bridgwater said they were going to catch the evening train—I did not say before the Magistrate that they were going to a hotel—I know there is Spiers and Pond's hotel at Holborn Viaduct, but I did not know if they were going there; why should they?—on the Saturday Mrs. Foster slept at Oxford Street—the hall door there was shut at 9 p.m.—when Mrs. Foster returned on the Saturday night I believe she was dressed in the sealskin cape in which she had left on Thursday evening—I have sworn that she was, and it is a fact—I cannot tell you if she was wearing the same hat—I do not know that I should notice if there had been a change of hat when I went down to Seaford on the Sunday morning with the doctor and Mrs. Foster—the doctor and I walked slowly to the house—a couple of hours after we got there we had a meal—I should judge it was about 2 o'clock; that is what I refer to when I said before that we had dinner—I believe there was some bread for dinner and we had some meat; it seemed to be cold fowl and £some potatoes—we had tea there in the afternoon—I am a tea drinker and take milk in my tea; I had some in my tea that afternoon—I do not know if I have done any petty larceny—I might take a little silver here and there—I did not rob my grandfather; I love my people too well—I would not rob respectable people if I were staying in their house—I did not find any spoons at "Ingleside"; I am above that—I did not take a note of the contents of the rooms which might be worth putting in my pockets—the dining room is the front room on the first floor—I believe there are two front rooms; one has a doctor's chair is it—as you enter the front door you turn to the left, after going along the passage, to get to the dining room—it is on the ground floor and faces the sea—</p>

               <p>go until 6 or 7—it depended on the amount of work, which consisted of attending to Mr. Fox's correspondence, both taking dictation and writing letters myself—a press copy letter book was kept, a bank pass book, and cheque books—attended to them all—when the paid cheques were returned from the bank I stuck them into the corresponding counter<lb/>foil books—I had a key of my own door into the corridor—that was the only door key I kept in my possession, but I very rarely used it until after the forgery, because the key of Mr. Fox's door was as a rule left in the building overnight in the porter's box—there were hooks on a key board, but their numbers did not correspond with the numbers of the doors—my door was 15 and the hook 49—you could not get into room 16 with the key on hook 16—occasionally Mr. Fox would forget his key and walk out with it in his pocket and then I used my own key next morning—I also had the safe door key and a big bunch of my own keys—I had no other office key—all the keys were kept on one bunch, and when going away in the afternoon or evening I carried them in my pocket or in a small bag, in which was my purse and pocket handkerchief—at night, it was my duty to put away the account books and things—Mr. Fox never did that, because he never handled the books unless I was there, and then I did it—in the safe in June, July, August, and Sep<lb/>tember, 1904, there were kept account books, pass books, used cheque books and current cheque books—I do not think there were used cheque books kept of all the banking accounts, but there were of some—the used cheque books I put away as soon as the annual audit was done—I did not have keys of the drawers in the safe—I knew there were some, securities there, papers and documents, and I knew that Mr. Fox had two or three diamonds there belonging to a gentleman; I do not know exactly the number—they were not of great value, I believe—I have not seen them, but there had been correspondence about them—I had not the slightest idea that Mr. Fox kept Mrs. Fox's jewels there—I have only ascertained his bank balance when he has asked me—he would only ask once in a while; only when he was going to draw a very very big cheque—I attended to drawing the bodies of the cheques and paid in cheques which were paid to him—I went through the pass book from time to time and checked every item—in that way I was fully acquainted with his credit at the various banks, but I never bothered my head about it unless he asked me, when I found out and told him—when I paid cheques in I saw the pages of the pass book, but I did not check them—I left that for the auditor—I should call it a big cheque when it runs into four figures, and if Mr. Fox was going to draw a big cheque I would ascertain if there was enough in the bank, and in that way I ascertained that his balance ran into thousands—his business was on a large scale—he only dealt with large sums of money, nothing small—I cannot say if his balance ran into more than four figures—in June, July, August, and September, 1904, this cheque book (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2) on the Union Bank, Chancery Lane, was in the safe; that was not an active account, and this book has used cheques pasted into it—there is a more recent one than this—I got it before this one was finished—we often had two cheque books, both kept in the safe—I should</p>

               <p>fancy that there were some used cheques pasted into the other book as well as into this one, but I am not quite certain—I should think there would be some cheques in the other book drawn in 1902 or 1903—I think the two books were going together—there was also a cheque book on the London Joint Stock Bank kept in the safe—the date of the first cheque drawn in this book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is July 30th, 1904—that was the first date the book came to us—it was drawn by Mr. Fox—I know on that day that Mr. Fox was contemplating a holiday, and I did not see him again until August 23rd—for the first week during that period I went to the office every day and after that about two or three times a week—I at<lb/>tended to any letters—I never saw this cheque book until August 27th—after that it was not always in the safe; it was backwards and forward between the office and the hotel where Mr. Fox lived—it was in the office, and during the night it was kept in the safe—I was at the office from a day or two before August 23rd until September 22nd—on that day I drew this cheque out of this book—from the time of Mr. Fox's departure up to September 22nd the safe key was in my possession all the time, and the door key was on the same bunch—about 4.30 on September 22nd I got a communication from a clerk from the London Joint Stock Bank, and one or two other clerks from the bank saw me—after I had had some communication from them I telephoned to Mr. Fox—he arrived at the office about 5—I saw the forged cheque before his arrival—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I do not think Inspector Fuller was present when the cheque was shown to me, but he came later and was in the office when Mr. Fox arrived—I got out the current Joint Stock cheque book and Fuller and I looked through it together in the presence of the two clerks—I noticed that two cheques had gone—that was the first time I had noticed it—on that day I think I showed Fuller some old cheque books in which used cheques had been pasted, but I am not quite certain—the Union cheque book was not among them, only the Joint Stock cheque books—I did not know of the three cheques having been taken from the Union book until I was at the Westminster Police Court in this present trial—I was examined there on September 23rd—I know Bridgwater—I first met him, I think, in the early part of 1903—I got to know him first through seeing an advertisement in a paper—I had then a trifling ailment and I consulted him in reference to it and went to the premises at the corner of Soho Street—I cannot tell you how many times I went there as a patient; about five or six in about a month or two—I got on friendly terms with him and after he ceased to attend me as a patient I continued to visit there—a mutual friendship sprang up between us and he told me that I need not keep away, but to come again if I thought I was not quite well—I got on affectionate terms with him, but I do not know about his feelings—I understood him to be single—he spoke about my capabilities and said I had a good business capacity and said he thought we could work well together, and said he would like to go abroad again, and mentioned crossing Asia into Australia and India—we were to work in the medical line—I know something about medicine—I went to the Hippodrome with him, to Frascati's, in Oxford Street, and to the</p>

               <p>the house, and he said he did not want meals—I told him he could come in when he liked after the first night—I said he could not go in the first night as I had somebody in the house, and I could not get ready—he did not come for a day or two—he brought a large trunk, a dressing case and a hat box—I think he was dressed in a black coat and tall hat—his luggage arrived without him, but he arrived in the evening—he had a latchkey, so could let himself in at any time he pleased—from that date, whenever it was, up to the week after the forgery he was my regular lodger, and was there every day with the exception, I think, of one—my times of going out and coming in were the same during the time he was the lodger as they were before, and he went out about 7 a.m., almost always dressed in a frock coat and top hat, and sometimes he had on a tweed suit—I never took particular stock, but I think he had on a frock coat more than anything else—I do not know what time he returned—he was always in before 10, sometimes from 6 to 10, more often about 8—he did not have breakfast before going out, except once or twice, and never anything in the evening—I did not generally get in until 9 p.m.—sometimes he would be there then, sometimes not—I have talked with him once or twice—I have not had many chats with him—he never actually told me in what line of business he was, but I gathered from his conversations that he had something to do with the jewellery trade, and I was under the impression that it was in the neigh<lb/>bourhood of Holborn—he spoke about America once and again—he was an exceptionally quiet lodger and his payments were always regular, and I never had to ask him for them—on Sundays he would be in part of the day—he would not go out so early, and generally had his breakfast in on Sundays—I took it to his own sitting room and left it—I did not have breakfast with him—Bridgwater has been to my house at one of my places, but I do not know if it was at Streatham or not—my other place was at Battersea Park—after leaving there I went to Streatham—I left in September, 1902—I asked Bridgwater to come to my place dozens of times; to come and spend the evening with me—I wanted to have a quiet <hi rend="italic">tete-a-tete</hi>, and I could not get it at his place—none of my private affairs have anything to do with the forgery—I was on very confidential terms with him—when I asked him to come he said he would, but he always made some excuse; some patient had called him away or something like that—I think he came only once, but that was not while Fisher was a lodger; it was in 1903—I do not know if it was in the summer or winter; it was in the evening, I should think, in the summer—my Battersea address was 63, Silverthorne Road, and I went straight from there to Streatham—I have got the title for my new house, but it would not show the date I went there—I had some furniture to move, but I have not got the bills for that, as I paid cash—I think I have a record in my diary at home of the day I went in—the 1904 diary is lost—I think it would be October 20th, 1903—I have met Fisher two or three times in Brixton, near my house, on my way from the station, and once in Victoria Street when I made an appointment with him to go to the Army and Navy Stores to get me something, and I met him there—I had a meal with him that day at Lombardi's restaurant, nearly opposite the stores—I did not</p>

               <p>get on friendly terms with him—he was only a lodger—I did not have any long chats with him, but I had a few chats—all the time he was them he was saying he was going to America—he would say, "Miss Toovey, I think I shall leave by the Wednesday steamer"; when the Wednesday came he did not go, and then said he would go by Saturday, and then he did not go, and it went on week by week—I saw him once nearly every day, and sometimes more—when I went home in the evenings I took my bag with me with the keys and other things inside, and when I got home I put it on the little table in my dining room and it would be there all night—the dining room is not locked at night—I kept up that habit while Dean was there—in the summer I used to do a little gardening some evenings after going home—Dean never helped me—on one occasion he told me that a plant had been pulled up in the garden and I went down to attend to it and planted it with a trowel—in my dining room I have a bookcase where I keep scrap books containing some papers, scraps, letters and photographs, and also some certificates and papers about myself—I showed Dean the scrap book one Sunday, or rather I went to the scrap book to show him something—in it I kept these two testimonials from Mr. Fox (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), dated April, 1902—just about that time Mr. Fox was intending to go out of business and he gave them to me—in the scrap book there were some photographs—I did not know this one (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 1) was there—as it has been mentioned so much, I wish to say it was taken seven or eight years ago in another house by my little brother after an illness, and I never showed it or gave it to Dean—there are a lot of them about like this—my brother was an amateur and practising to make his living by photography—I had letters from my business address at my house—I did not keep my papers or scrap book locked up, but they were in my bookcase where nobody was supposed to have access—on September 22nd, when the forgery was brought to my notice, I was very much upset about it—I remember seeing Fisher that evening and showed him I was upset by my off-hand manner—he asked me what was the matter with me—I said, "I am upset; something has occurred in my business, to upset me," and he asked me if he could do anything for me—I said, "No, I do not want anything; leave me alone"—I did not tell him about the forgery—I have been upset about it ever since—I had some talk with Dean, next day and was oil-hand with him then—he said he could see perfectly well there was something wrong—he followed his usual habit that day of going out early—I think he left me early the following week, beginning September 26th—he paid me three weeks' rent in advance, as he said he knew he would be three weeks away and it might be more—he asked me to keep the rooms open for him—he said he was going to America—I saw Fuller on September 22nd, and I think he called at the office each day for two or three days afterwards, and afterwards he asked me to go to Scotland Yard, which I did—I was shown some photographs in a book there, but I saw nobody in it with the slightest resemblance to anybody I knew—Fuller asked me a lot of questions, which he put into a statement and which I think I signed—I heard a description of the man who had passed the cheque on the first day the bank clerks gave their description—</p>

               <p>about a week or ten days after the forgery I called on Bridgwater and saw him in his consulting room, and I told him all I knew about the forgery—I cannot recollect what I told him, but I told him about it having occurred—I do not think I went into the minor details, but I told him the gist of the whole thing—I must have told him it was a cheque—I do not remember if I told him whose cheque it was, but I suppose I must have told him it was Mr. Fox's—it was in the papers—I did not go up till it was in the papers—I believe I mentioned about the bank clerk's coming to me—I do not think I mentioned anything about the signature of the forged cheque—I only went up to unburden myself, as I wanted to tell somebody and I had not told anybody—I mentioned about Fuller having put questions to me, and that I had been asked to go to Scotland Yard—I do not think I mentioned Fuller's name; I do not think I knew it then—I do not think I mentioned that a cheque had gone out of the Joint Stock cheque book—I did not tell him about the cheque form and where it had been got from—Bridgwater said he was sorry, until I mentioned about a doctor—at Scotland Yard the inspector had put some questions to me, which I answered, and I repeated to Bridgwater the substance of what I had been asked and how I had answered—I told Bridgwater that the inspector had asked me a lot of questions about my private affairs and wanted to know what people I had about me, and that I had spoken the truth and said I knew a doctor—the question was, "Have you got a sweetheart?" and I said, "Yes, a doctor"—Bridgwater said, "I do not know what you want to go talking about me for"—I said, "I did not talk about you; they asked me if I had a sweetheart and I said, 'Yes, a doctor'"—I gave him the description the bank clerk had given me of the man who had cashed the cheque—in the conversation he said, "Where is your lodger?" or, "How is your lodger?" and I said, "He has gone to America"—I may have told him that I had a lodger—I probably saw Bridgwater in July, August, and September, but I have no absolute recollection—when I told Bridgwater that my lodger had gone to America he said, "Do not you think it I funny, his going?"—I said, "No, I have known he has been going for weeks and weeks"—after I told him that I had said I had a sweetheart he was vexed and nasty over it—he said, "I do not know what you want to mention it for," but anybody would be vexed by being pulled into a matter like that, and I was sorry about it, as I did not want him annoyed—I had not mentioned his name to the police—I simply said he was a doctor—nothing was said about my lodger in connection with the forgery—Bridgwater and I had a few unpleasant words about the matter and I left—he was annoyed because I had spoken about the doctor, and I was annoyed about what he said of the lodger.</p>

At times patients called and saw the doctor and returned in an hour or two for medicine, but not many—I may have said before, "Blair called twice a day," and I think I said, "More than twice a day"—sometimes patients other than Blair used to knock at the dispensary door and walk in—the doctor was very punctilious about my bringing in proper names, and for that reason made me write down the names—he was a very free and generous man both to his friends and employees, and at times would give patients whiskeys and sodas when they called—I think I had two interviews with Inspector Kane, one at my place, and once I met him in Oxford Street—when he called on me he asked me if I knew anyone named Blair and if I could recognise him, and said he had called on me respecting an affair of Dr. Bridgwater's, a forgery—I won't say that he told me about Mr. Fox, whose offices were at 28, Victoria Street, and I won't say that he did not—I do not remember giving Blair medicines or lotions which had been made up previously when he called a second time in a day—it was not within my province to deliver medicine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I may have seen Shackell on the doctor's premises between the time he went out in the morning and when he returned in the evening, but very rarely—I have never seen him or Blair go up to the doctor's part of the premises—I may have inspected the men before I succeeded Shackell, but very seldom—I should do it after 11 a.m.—that was at the time I was a folder, but not while Shackell was in the employment—I did the folding then and he took the inspecting on—when I became inspector I still kept the folding on—I was sent on errands by the doctor, fetching provisions in and that sort of thing; that was mostly in the evening or perhaps in the morning, first thing—my dinner hour was from 1 to 2, and I had from 6 to 6.30 for tea—I went out to my meals.</p>

               <p>refer to the forgery then—I think I saw him again a week or two after the second visit, some time in November—nothing took place—it was just a call at his premises, in and out again as I was passing—Dean did not tell me in so many words that he had some business in Holborn or that district, but I gathered from his conversation that he did work in that district—after the last trial of Holmes, in which there was something which made me do it, I went to look for Dean—I thought I might run into him, so I walked from the bottom of Chancery Lane, up through Holborn, up the right-hand side of Gray's Inn Road, down the left side, and then along Holborn as far as Kingsway—I only did that once—I may have been there many times when I had other business, but I did not then especially keep my eyes open—when I went to look for him I lost my way and found myself in Drury Lane—at Holmes' first trial here I saw Bridg-water and had a word or two with him—at that trial he mentioned something about my lodger, which he emphasised at the second trial, which made me go and look for him—I thought I would try and find him and, if there was a third trial, get him to show himself—up to the time of the second trial I did not believe that my lodger was in any way connected with the matter—I had not the slightest suspicion until I was told of these stories—at the trial Bridgwater said that I said that my lodger resembled the description of the man who had passed the cheque, and I never said such a thing—what I did say was that I gave a description of the man who cashed the cheque, but I never connected Dean with him—I do not know what I said to Bridgwater here at the first trial—I saw him two or three times and once I said, "I think it was foolish of your counsel not to have the valet put in the witness box when he was asked"—by that I meant Mr. Overend, Holmes' counsel—at the second trial I was again a witness, but I do not think I had anything to say to Bridgwater then, but I cannot say now—I think I saw him here; I was annoyed with him—I was never at his place between the two trials; I never saw him except in Court—I did not know where my lodger's business was, and I did not tell Bridgwater of my lodger having some connection with the jewellery business—when he was making suggest<lb/>tions about my lodger I only resented the aspersions on his character—I never told anybody I was going to look for Fisher; in fact, I did it on the spur of the moment—if Fisher says he heard from Bridgwater that I was looking about for him he is telling a lie or he must have seen me and watched me—I was rather surprised I did not run into him, because I was going about at the time and I understood he was about there—I did not see him, but of course he may have seen me—I made a lot of enquiries and went into several places and enquired of postmen—Bridgwater made me one or two presents—he sent a case of whiskey and some port to my house and I expect I wrote, thanking him for it—I wrote one letter commencing, "Many, many happy returns of the day," and I also sent him my photograph—I also sent him this letter, dated March 4th, 1904, from Victoria Street, and I also sent him this letter headed, "The Harvey united Steel Co., Limited, 28, Victoria Street, Westminster"—that is the company I referred to on Saturday,</p>

During the time I was Mr. Fox's confidential clerk I was in possession of all the details of his business, and during that time I have been faithful and true in all details with regard to Mr. Fox's interests and I have not spoken of his business to a single soul—I do not recollect ever mentioning his name to Bridg-water—I never mentioned to him the existence of a safe in the office or the details of the office—it never entered my mind to speak of there being diamonds and jewels in the safe, and I did not know that Mrs. Fox's jewels were there—if Fisher states that Bridgwater told him all the details of Mr. Fox's business and that he had learnt them from me, he is a liar—I am absolutely certain no information has been learnt from me; there are three other channels for information to be got through besides me—my knowledge of Bridgwater began, I think, in the beginning of 1903, and then it was solely that of medical man and patient—I have nothing to complain of, of the way he has treated me—I never told Bridgwater that Mr. Fox had an office at 28, Victoria Street, but I have evidently written him letters from there—I suppose a week never passed without Mr. Fox's name being mentioned in the newspapers, so if anybody wanted to find out where he was, they could do so; there are very few men so well known, I suppose—I first had a notice put up at the bookstall that I wanted a lodger three months after I went to Streatham, probably</p>

               <p>early in 1904—I think Dean first came to me a few days after July 18th—the notice was put up twice and I think a third time—I paid 2s. 6d. and they kept it up for a month and then took it down, and then I paid again and they put it up again—they were not three consecutive months—I never looked to see if the notice was up—I do not think it was there in July, it would be there in June possibly—it would be well known by those who came in and out of the station that I had rooms to let—while Dean was in my house my sister was there part of the time—she was there when he came, and stayed for quite a week—with that exception, nobody else was in the house except Dean—it is my impression that Dean left on Monday, September 26th, because I was so annoyed and I wanted the place to myself, and it seemed a long time before he went—I did not give him a key of the outer door the first day he came, but I did within two or three days, and from that time he could go in and out of the house at any time—there was no one at home all day long—on Saturdays I came home at 3, or 4, or 5—Dean had breakfast on Sunday morning as soon as I was up—I told him I should not hurry; I do not hurry for any<lb/>body—he had it between 9 and 11 a.m.—I do not think I have a single thing in my house locked except a cash box—during the day Dean could have got at my papers if he had chosen; it would have been more risky at night, as I am a very poor sleeper—I very seldom took my keys in the bag up to my bedroom unless I was very tired and went straight upstairs, otherwise I left them in the dining room—I generally went to bed about 10 p.m.—Fisher was sometimes in bed before I got home—I was generally home by 10—I had about twelve or fifteen keys on my bunch, of all sizes—I had an ordinary big latchkey and a Yale latchkey to my house—unless a man knew which was the key of Mr. Fox's safe, it would be awfully difficult for him to tell which it was—I cannot say what part of last year it was that I went up to Bridgwater three or four times—I cannot say when I last saw him before September 22nd—I did not see the Joint Stock Bank cheque book until August 27th, and if the cheques were removed from it in Paris it must have been prior to August 23rd—I was here at the trial in March and heard the valet, Joseph Bricusse, examined [<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

               <p>poke out there a long time—if my lodger was wicked enough to endeavour to take impressions of my keys, he had in the summer time, almost every night, ample opportunities if he had the cheek to go into my room—I used to be sometimes all the evening in the garden—it takes an hour to water it with the hose—on Sundays I never go out except I take an excursion somewhere—while Dean was my lodger he was only away one night, when he told me he had been to Wales—when I told Bridgwater of the forgery he seemed surprised, as one would expect a man to be—I think Dean wore his frock coat and high hat during the last week he was in my house, but I cannot say for certain—anybody who wanted to get my key from the receptacle where keys were kept by the porter at 28, Victoria Street, could easily do so—the porter was not there when I came in and out—I do not know if he was supposed to be there all day—I never saw Dean from the time he left my house until I saw him in the Police Court—when I knew him he looked aged, about thirty-five and sprightly, and when I saw him at the Police Court he looked very much older, but I had no difficulty in identify<lb/>ing him—I could not help remembering his jaw and tiger mouth—perhaps it would not be easy for somebody else to recognise him; of course every man has got his double—when I had the conversation with Dean about my scrap book it was nearly the end of his time with me—I did not go to show him the book, but some conversation started and I went to the book and turned over the leaves in front of him, and then I showed it to him—he could then have seen the two testimonials—there were four testimonial pinned together, and Mr. Fox's were at the top—he could have seen them, as he had shark's eyes—I did not tell Bridgwater that I had been looking for Dean, and I never told a soul that I intended to look for him—I made a lot of inquiries of postmen and other persons—I never knew he had another name besides Dean—I never told Bridgwater that Mr. Fox was a wealthy man, or that he was connected with Carnegie—he was connected with Carnegie—I was paid generally by cheques, which I sometimes cashed or changed at my bank, and sometimes I have kept them for three or four days in my purse, which would be in my bag—Mr. Fox never wrote to me at my place; he always wrote to me at the office, but I may have taken his letters home—none of his letters were anywhere except in my portfolio—I have seen since that in that portfolio there was a printed biography of Mr. Fox, and a lot of information could have been got from that—it was there the whole time Dean was with me, but I did not know it.</p>

I want you to take particular notice of them and see if you can see anybody who you have seen at your station with Bridgwater"—I did so and picked out a man whom they told me was named Fisher—I had seen him with Bridgwater at my station, I think, twice, but I am certain I saw him once—I remember the <hi rend="italic">Dippy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dieppe</hi>) boat was running at the time; it was pretty loppy as she passed and I said, "There are a tidy few who will not have any dinner to-day,"</p>

In September, 1904, I was a cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, Victoria Street, and I was there when this cheque for £819 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) was presented on September 22nd, about 4.65 p.m.—a man came in with it and placed it on the counter—my suspicions were not aroused—I examined the signature and it appeared to me to be quite correct, and I asked him how he would take it—he said he would take it half in fifties, half in twenties and £19 in gold—I paid him 19 twenties, 2 tens, 8 fifties and £19 in gold—it was so late that my supply of notes had been taken away, so I walked to the back of the office and got some, which I banded to him—I made a note of the numbers—these are the £20 notes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—they have now had their corners torn off—they are all here—the man then walked out—I did not see him after that—shortly after he had gone the cheque was put before the manager and I examined it again and in consequence we sent a clerk to see Miss Toovey—I went round afterwards and then we gave information to Scotland Yard—that same day I gave a description of the man who had cashed the cheque, and on January 6th last I was taken to Westminster police station, where I saw a number of men, from whom I picked out Holmes—I said I was uncertain between two men and I was told to touch both of them, and I went up to Holmes first and then to the other man and touched him—I have now no doubt whatever that Holmes is the man—when he came into the bank he had on a frock coat and a tall hat, and a large expanse of white shirt front, which looked almost as if he had on a white waistcoat; his coat was buttoned low down—when he was on his trial I heard him give evidence and noticed his voice, which seemed familiar, as it is rather a peculiar voice—it seemed to be the same voice as I had heard in the bank.</p>

               <p>called my attention to the cheque about fifteen minutes after it was cashed—there was a little screen in front of my desk—the man did not stand behind it; he was in full view—when I gave my description at Scotland Yard Sisman was present—I do not know if Barrett went with us; I think we all three were there—Barnett would hear what we said—my description to the police was, "A big min, dressed in a black frock coat, with silk facings, and a tall silk hat, showing what seemed to be a white waistcoat or shirt front, big build, tall and stout"—I altered that to "rather stout"—I did not say a word about his moustache—I noticed that he had one; it must have been an oversight—Holmes would look bigger about the shoulders in a frock coat than he does now—I have talked this matter over with the people at the bank and I have had several interviews with the police—I was shown photographs of a man with a moustache and without one—I was shown the description in the "Police Gazette," which was, "A man aged forty-five to fifty, height six feet complexion sallow, hair and moustache dark, wearing a black frock coat with white vest and silk hat"—I do not remember mentioning that the man had a moustache—I did not help the inspector to get out that description, but he discussed the question with me—it was after I had been the "Police Gazette" and the photographs that I went to West<lb/>minster for the purpose of identification—I cannot say if Holmes was the only man with a dark moustache—I cannot say if the other man I picked out had a light or brownish moustache—he was dark and rougher than Holmes and of fairly gentlemanly appearance—all the other men had not dark moustaches—I have seen Holmes at both his trials.</p>

Thomas Cook &amp; Sons, of Ludgate Circus—I was there on the afternoon of September 22nd, 1904—these two £50 notes have both on the back of them, "Exc," standing for "exchange," in the writing of Mr. Hurd Smith—they were tendered for exchange on the afternoon of September 22nd, I should say about 4.30, by a man—in January last I went to the Westminster Police Court and saw about ten men in the yard, and amongst them recognised Holmes as the man who had tendered these two notes—he wanted French money in exchange for them—I was not certain at the time whether he wanted gold or paper—we had not exactly what was asked for—whatever he asked for we had to make it up with the alternative, and we gave 2,510 francs for the notes, half in paper and half in gold—the change was put on the counter and he left part of it there as he was leaving the office—I am not sure which part he left, but I think it was the gold—I called after him and said, "You are leaving part of your money on the counter"—he turned very quickly, grabbed it, as it were, and rushed out of the office—I should say he was not in the office more than two and a half or three minutes—this coin is a 20-franc piece, and coins of that issue are current in France—there might be two or three coins of that kind in change given at the office; it has the Gaelic cock upon it.</p>

Dozens of those coins pass through our banks in this country—I did not attend to the man who came into the office—I was at my desk when he came in, two desks lower down, but be<lb/>fore the transaction was finished I went down to my colleague for some purpose or other and it was the fact of the man leaving the money on the counter which attracted my attention—when we got the numbers of the stolen notes it was called to my mind—I understand the police came in later that day, but they did not see me—I believe they saw Mr. Smith—in January at the Police Court I gave the police a description—I was shown no photograph by the police—I gave a rough description before I went to the police station—I saw no papers—I did not have a conversation with Mr. Smith on the subject; he was away—I did not pay any attention to the man at first—when he came back I only got a glimpse of him as he took up the money—I saw him full face for a moment—I noticed nothing particular about his features except that I thought he was a well-built man and was inclined to be dark—I told the police on January 6th he had a moustache—I do not remember the police coming to me before that—I had a better view of the man's general appearance than of his features

               <p>—when I went down to identify him I had the idea of a well-built man dressed in a certain attire—I thought he resembled a casual acquaintance who comes up in the train with me—when I went into the yard the man was standing with a number of others—there waft no other man who had a resemblance to my acquaintance—I did not pick out a suitable body and put my friend's head on it—I only saw his front then—I did not see Holmes walk in the yard—I described the man of-medium height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live at 23, Burton Crescent, King's Cross—I have known Shackell for ten years, and have lived with him as his wife for five years—I ceased doing so in September, 1904—on August 24th of that year the banns of our marriage had been put up and we were to be married at St. Pancras Church on Saturday, October 1st, at 12 o'clock—the marriage did not come off because he left me on Septem<lb/>ber 27th—for some time before that I had been ill and owed 35s. for rent—shackell had always promised that that would be paid—after he left me I went to Bridgwater's two or three times to try and find out where he was—I saw Bridgwater and afterwards Holmes—I saw Bridg-water the same week that Shackell left me and I asked him if he knew where Shackell was, as he had not been home, and he said he had not been him for a day or two as he had not been back to work, and he did not know where he was—I said I could not understand his staying away, as we were to be married and I did not know what to do—he asked me to call again if I was passing that way, and if he heard anything of Stackell he would let me know—I called on the following Saturday, the day we</p>

               <p>were to be married, and saw the doctor—I asked him if he had seen shackell, and he said yes, he had been in the day previous, but had only stayed a little while—I asked Bridgwater if he would be kind enough to let me have a little money to pay my rent—Shackell had told me hat they had been doing a little betting and that the doctor owed him some—Bridgwater did not make any reply when I asked him, but gave me half-a-sovereign—I saw the doctor again the following week and asked him if he had seen Shackell and he said he had seen him at different times just running in and out of the office during the week, but not to stay—I told him that I had heard that Shackell had been with another lady and the doctor said he was not quite sure if he was with anybody or not, but that he had seen him with somebody, meaning another lady—I saw Holmes at the doctor's a fortnight after I was to have been married—I asked him if he had seen Shackell or could tell me where he was—Holmes said he did not know where he was living, but that he had seen him occasionally—that was all the informa<lb/>tion I got from him—in November, 1904, I went to 2, Beauchamp Road, Clapham Junction, and saw Shackell there with Mrs. Thomas, who was then in the name of Annie Harris—I said I wanted to speak to Shackell and I was asked inside—I asked him why he had not been over to see me or written—he said he had not made up his mind what he was going to do, but would come and see me the following day at my address—I was still in the same house where he had lived with me—he came to the station to see me off by train—nothing was said about money on that occasion—he came alone the following day and saw me and asked me not to go to Beauchamp Road again—he gave me no reason, and I said it was rather hard for me, as I had known him for more years than this little woman had known him months—he told me he was not going to stop with her—I asked him for some money—he said he had not got any—I said, "They are worrying me again at home for the little debt which is owing," and he said, "I will give it to you as soon as I get it"—Mrs. Harris told me something about his spending money, but I did not mention it to Shackell because I did not see him to speak to after I was told of it—when Mrs. Harris came to my address she was wearing a plush coat and three rings which I had seen before, but I did not speak to Shackell about them because I did not see him—Mrs. Harris came to my address when Shackell was away—I went to see him at 2, Buckingham Street, off Great Portland Street—that was Mrs. Thomas's house after they left Clapham Junction; that was in September last—Mrs. Thomas came to the door and I asked to see Shackell—she shut the door in my face and said he was not at home—I said I knew he was at home because I had seen him in there, and I would like to see him as I had two letters to give him—in the end I saw him—he said I had no right to come there to him and told me to go out—I said I should not go out until I had said what I wanted to—I asked him if he was still going to remain with this little woman and he said that was his business and added, "Do not you come here again," and asked me to leave—I said, "I have two letters to give</p>

He informs me he has been your secretary for some years. Will you kindly acquaint me if this is correct I Also if you consider he is able to</p>

Dodd—I have not the least idea who Dodd is—I think he came out of possession on February 19th, but I cannot say to a day—he promised faithfully to pay the three months' rent two days after he left, and I discovered he had left by my applying for the rent—I did not go personally—I do not know whether Temple went—I re-let the house months afterwards—I had no notice of his going, and on February 28th I wrote to Bridgwater a letter of which this is a copy—I did not post it myself—I did not get any reply and I wrote again—I think I wrote four times altogether—I never received any reply—the dates I wrote on were February 23rd, 25th, and 28th—the only rent I ever got was for slightly under three months, although I referred to a solicitor, Mr. Tomkin.</p>

Cook's office is rather a large one and is divided into departments—the counter has an iron network or grille in front of it which rises higher than the head of the woman from whom I took the notes—the jacket was a very dark one; I think it was a fur, but I am not certain; it was not a smooth cloth and it was not a cape—she walked two or three yards away to indorse the notes and stood up while doing so—the banking department closes at 6; she must have come almost at 6 o'clock—if you wanted to get into the banking depart<lb/>ment at 6 you could not—I do not know that there is a train from London arriving at the lord at 6.4—there is a train from Charing Cross at 9 a.m., which gets to Paris at 4.45—the station is twenty or thirty minutes' walk from the office—if you go from Holborn Viaduct I cannot say if the only train is 11 a.m. and which gets to Paris at 6.45—on Novem<lb/>ber 1st, when the identification took place, there were twelve women there all dressed in hats and cloaks—I did not really look at the others;</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Messrs. Barclay's Bank at Seaford and have been so for about ten years—I know Mrs. Foster as a customer of the bank, keeping there an ordinary current account in the name of Eliza Foster—I produce the Signature Book containing her signature when the account was opened—it is Eliza Foster—I never saw the other prisoners till the proceedings at the Police Court—these eight cheques (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 21) were drawn by Foster on that account in the name of Eliza Foster, except three, which are signed "E. Foster"—these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 24) were drawn by Bridgwater &amp; Co. in her favour and indorsed by Eliza Foster—they passed through her account—these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 24) were drawn by her, also these fourteen cheques (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 30)—these have been paid and charged to her account—this letter and envelope (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 32), signed "E.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALSH</hi>. There is a great difference in classes of writing according to the position the people occupy, whether educated or uneducated—these bank note indorsements are obviously the writing of an uneducated person; it is not what I call good writing—sometimes you find highly cultured people write badly—as a rule there is great similarity between the writings of country people—Foster's account was opened on September 25th, 1903, and ran on through 1903 and 1904 very much in the same way as it did in 1905—it has not varied much—it was a small account—a great many cheques on it were drawn in favour of local people, such as the Seaford Gas Company and Messrs. Under-wood, grocers and drapers—all money, whether cheques, notes, gold, silver, etc., would be entered in the pass book as "Cash"—the particulars are entered in the Waste Book—in the ledger it is entered as "Cash"—Foster's writing varies slightly—looking at this bank note indorse<lb/>ment and comparing it with those on the other eight bank notes, the "S" in "Smith" is different from the others—it is more like a "G"

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130126"/>
               <p>than an "S"—the variations are entirely a matter of opinion—the "p" in "Clapham" on the notes curls round—the "p's" in the two cheques in "pounds" are different—also the "p's" in "Seaford Gas Company" vary; some of them resemble very much the indorsements, but they also differ very much—the letter "t" in "Smith" on the bank notes is looped up to the "h"—in "Foster" on this cheque of October 15th, 1903, it is a straight stroke down and a straight stroke up—five of these fourteen signatures have got a "t" similar to the one of October 6th—the majority of these "t's" are straight down—some of the same letters on the notes vary as compared with the letters on the cheques, but I do not say they are very unlike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Taking this photograph of the notes, I find this G-like "S" there—I find the "S" in "E. Sayer &amp; Son" on this cheque (<hi rend="italic">Sheet</hi> 3) very much like it—also the "S" in "Seaford Gas Company" on this cheque is very similar; also in "Moore &amp; Sons"—taking these two letters (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 32 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 33) I find the "S" in "snowing" is very similar—they are all like the "S" in bank note No. 5—the "S" in "E. Smith" on bank note No. 3 differs from the others—the "S" in "50, Oxford Street," on this envelope is similar to that on bank note No. 3—also the "S" in "Shaw" is similar—also the "9's" on the bank notes are very similar to the "9" in "59, Oxford Street" on the envelope—all the "9's" are very similar—referring to the "9" on sheet 3, No. 5, of July 29th, I see it comes round at the bottom, it has a hook up at the bottom—there is a slight hook to the "9" in cheque No. 6 of October 29th—the "S" in Moore &amp; Sons is similar to that on the majority of the bank notes—the "p" in Clapham on the bank note is a peculiar one—I should say it is a similar "p" on this cheque of September 12th, 1905—it is a similar "p" on cheque No. 6—also the "p" in April on cheque No. 3 is similar—also the "p" in "pounds" on the same cheque—I say the bottom of the "t" in "Foster" on a great many of the cheques is not straight—this one in cheque No. 8 has got a round bottom, also No. 7—also No. 2 is round, but not quite so fully round—No. 4 is fully rounded—the "E" on bank note No. 6 has got a flat back—it is a very similar "E" in "Eliza Foster" on cheque No. 5 in sheet 1—looking at this enlargement of the "E" of the note, I should say it is very similar to the "E" on this cheque—looking at the "a's" on the bank notes, I say they are very peculiar; they each look like two "e's" joining almost together—I find very similar "a's" in the two Frickart letters in "Dear," "Darling," "please" and "Torquay"—looking at the writing on these notes, I say it is our customer's.</p>

               <p>point out a number of similarities between them—I have not heard the evidence of the last witness—taking bank note No. 5 on the photograph, that has an "S" in "Smith" which resembles a "G"; I find similar "8's" in cheque No. 2, sheet 3, cheque No. 3, also cheque No. 8 on sheet 3, also in sheet 5 in the word "snowing"—I also find a different character of "S" on the bank notes which do not look like a "G" but which finish off with a loop more like an "S"—several of those appear on the notes, one on the indorsement on note No. 3, another on No. 4 and another on No. 6, on the envelope sheet 5, No. 3, also in the word "snowing" on sheet 5, No. 2; also in the word "Sons" on sheet 2, No. 7, another in the word "see" on sheet 5, No. 2—on the notes I find two capital letters "E" which are different characters—the "E" on note No. 2 is similar to the "E" on sheet No. 4, cheque 6—the "E" on bank note No. 6 on the photo<lb/>graph is a different kind of "E"; it has a different kind of top; the back of the downstroke, instead of being curved, is a flat stroke—I find a similar "E" on sheet No. 1, No. 5; also on sheet No. 2, cheque 5—taking the "a" in "Clapham" on the bank notes, the first "a" is frequently written with a double loop, almost like two "1's"—it is notice<lb/>able in the indorsements on Nos. 1.4, 7, 8 and 9 notes—I find similar "a's" in Frickart letter No. 1 in the word "Dear," again in the words "please," "Darling," "Torquay," and again on sheet No. 2 in the words "Thursday," "Darling," and "Torquay"—I call particular attention to the "p" in "Clapham" on note No. 9; the same "p" appears in the word "September" on sheet No. 4, cheque 4, of September 12th—there is a similar "p" on cheque 6, sheet 3, in "fourpence"—there is another instance in "April," also cheque 6, sheet 2, "April" again; on several cheques on sheet 2, Nos. 2,3, and 4, there are "p's" of a somewhat similar type to that in "pounds"—taking sheet No. 4, of September 12th, the combination "th," I find similar combinations on the notes—the shape of the loop in "h" is one feature; it is rather triangular, and the finish of the "h" drops very much below the level of both letters"—that peculiarity appears in several indorsements.</p>

               <p>1895 case which were known as the incriminating documents were, owing to the similarities that I saw, in the handwriting of Beck, who was being tried—I said I was not positive about that—other documents were shown me in connection with the previous case of 1877 and I said that those documents were the same writing as the man who had committed the fraud in 1895; consequently, whoever that was, it was the same man as in 1877—when I was standing in this box in 1896 I was asked questions simply with regard to the first portion of my report—then counsel for the defence asked me if I had not been to see certain documents relating to the 1877 case—Counsel for the Prosecution objected, and after a discussion between Judge and Counsel the rest of the evidence was ruled out to order—I say if the whole of my evidence had been given, in all probability the matter would have been cleared up and the prisoner would not have been convicted—I say that my mistake did not contribute to Mr. Beck's conviction—sixteen witnesses swearing positively to the identity of Beck, and the Jury not leaving the box and not asking to see the writings at all, my evidence did not contribute to his conviction—that is my opinion—I do not say that it did harm—so far as it was admitted, it was mistaken—I do not often find a strong similarity between the writing of different persons, but on rare occasions you may find a strong similarity—you may often find a slight similarity—writing by the same person with a glove on or off would be different.</p>

This writing I should say was natural, but somewhat of a scribble—I see no intentional disguise—there may be a similarity between the writing of people in one condition of life—the writing of people who write a good deal may be called cultured writing—I do not think there are greater similarities in the writings of people who do not—in cultured or cultivated writing the similarities are prominent, they are easy to get hold of; in the writing of people who write very seldom, there is not so much to get hold of, because there is less peculiarity in them—I do not think when I was asked by the police to compare the incriminated documents with the admitted writing, I had anybody else's writing put before me—I only had the Frickart letters, the envelopes, the cheques and the bank notes—I also saw the indorsement on the two Bridgwater cheques—I should not say that "Eliza Foster" on the admitted cheque was a laborious signature—I agree with the last witness that there are many similarities—there are some dissimilarities; I do not think a great many—the amount of matter is not great and it is nine times repeated in the indorsements, and as the similarities affect the "E," the "S," the "h," the "o," the "r," the "9," the "c," and "p," it is more than half the letters in which there are similarities—most decidedly there are dissimilarities even in the bank notes themselves; there always are; there are dissimilarities in all the Foster cheques as compared with one another.</p>

I have had the conduct of the inquiries of this case—I was in charge of the case when Fisher was arrested on July 1st in connection with coining—I had several interviews with him—I also received a number of letters from him—he made certain statements to me with reference to this case—on September 23rd last a warrant was issued at the Westminster Police Court for the arrest of the four prisoners—on that day, about 12.10 p.m., I went to Bridg-water's, at 59, Oxford Street, with Inspectors Fuller and Kane—I saw Holmes at the street door—he was speaking with Kane—Holmes went upstairs and I followed—I saw Bridgwater in his consulting room—I said to him, "You know me, Mr. Bridgwater?"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Arrow"—I paid, "I have a warrant for your arrest"—I read it—it was for forging and uttering the £819 cheque—he said, "Absurd, preposterous, mon<lb/>strous"—later on he said, "It is a conspiracy on the part of the police"—as he left the house in charge of other officers he said to a young lady who was present, and whom he had described to me as his housekeeper, "You wait here while the police search; they are capable of anything; they may put something here and say they found it"—the lady's name is Bird—I said to him, "Will you give me your keys?"—he said, "I have no keys; everything is unlocked"—to Miss Bird he said, "You wait here and put no obstacle in the way of the police"—assisted by Fuller I made a search of the premises—Fuller searched the consulting room and dis<lb/>pensary, and I searched the rooms above—Holmes was arrested at the same time as Bridgwater—I read the warrant to him; he said nothing—having</p>

Surely I have a right to ask"—I said, "I cannot tell you more"—when charged the prisoners said nothing—I saw Foster before her arrest—it was on August 15th, 1899, at 59, Oxford Street—I told her I wanted to see Dr. Bridgwater—I do not remember the exact words—she said, "I am Mr. or 'Dr.' Bridgwater's wife"—I found these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 22) on Bridgwater's premises in his bedroom; also this agreement, Bridgwater to Darby (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 31), these two letters signed "E. Frickart," and two case books—in one case book I find this entry: "Oswald, Mr., York Road, Waterloo," and in the margin "Chronic tonsilitis"—underneath, across the page, "10.9.04, 15th, 22nd, 29th, 6.10.04" and between the 22nd and 29th the words, "Removed tonsils"—I find there are about 3,000 cases in the books—I have examined them all and find no other entry of "Removed tonsils"—I do not find in the books the name of "Blair" entered as a patient—I produce a pendant notebook—Bridgwater was wearing it when arrested—I find on page 52, "Oswald, of tonsils, 4 p.m. Thursday, 22.9.04"—there is only one page in the book with nothing on it—the earliest date in the book is "25.1.00" and the latest "9.2.05"—I found this call book at Bridgwater's, also this "Every Hour" diary for 1905—about one-third of the call book had been removed before I found it—I found no diary for 1904, nor any call book containing entries of 1904—in this diary I find the name of Flatman entered as a caller—January 6th, 1905, is the earliest date, and July 4th, 1905, the latest date of his calls—I find he called twice on February 9th, 1905—there are about twelve names between the two entries—that was the date of Holmes' first trial—he appears to have called on February 10th—I found in Bridgwater's possession a number of counter<lb/>foils of cheques to Wigram—they are in Bridgwater's writing—on Sep<lb/>tember 26th last I went to Mr. Fox's office with a locksmith—Mr. Fox pointed out door No. 15—the locksmith took off the lock and shook out a part of a key that was in it—I examined Mr. Fox's safe and found in it this green cheque book (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2)—three cheques and part of the counter<lb/>foils had been torn away—at Bridgwater's I found two letters from Arthur Flatman; also this bill of sale, Bridgwater to Foster; also these letters from Miss Toovey.</p>

               <p>I have known Fisher about seven years—I would not believe him on oath without corroboration—the first interview I had with him about this case was on August 15th, but on July 3rd at Bow Street Police Court he made me the first offer of giving information generally, but did not mention this case—I told him that if he wished to see me he should apply to the Commissioner of Police for an interview with me—he then wrote me two letters—I saw him then at Brixton prison on July 8th on a Home Office Order—he did not then mention this case—before he said any<lb/>thing as to this particular charge I mentioned it to him—I did not say to him that I wanted the Victoria Street matter cleared up—I did not hear his evidence here—something of this sort may have occurred on August 15th:—I cautioned him that anything he said might be used in evidence against him; after that he said, "I was in the Victoria Street forgery; I can tell you all about that," and I might have said, "Well, I shall be glad to clear that up"—I do not remember having said that—since the Police Court hearing I have thought over that matter and I might have said then, "I shall be glad to clear that up; let us start on that," and then we started on it—it has happened that a convict by giving information has derived a most substantial advantage—I have not been down to Seaford and I do not know it—I believe the proceedings in Holmes' trials were fully reported in the papers—I do not know that Wigram was a man who betted heavily—there is an entry in the little book about an operation for tonsilitis—I believe the tonsils grow again and are taken out again—Bridgwater, I believe, was not a throat specialist, but a blood and nerves and private diseases specialist.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, Powis Square, Bays-water, and am the manager of the New Theatre, Charing Cross Road—I was the lessee of the Grand Theatre, Fulham, up to December 24th, 1904, on which date Mr. Robert Arthur succeeded me as lessee—Leslie was in my employment as working electrician at that theatre from Oc<lb/>tober, 1899, to December, 1904, at a salary of £3 a week—I knew Webber as carrying on an ironmonger's business at 63, High Street, Putney, quite near to the theatre, and it was his custom to do small jobs and supply material at the theatre from 1897 down to the date of my leaving—Rosenberg was employed occasionally, I believe, as an assistant to Leslie, receiving 1s. 6d. a performance; he used to manipulate the lights for stage purpose—he was paid by me—Webber's account roughly used to come to £250 a year; it varied from time to time—just before I left the theatre I received this requisition from the London County Council with regard to some electrical improvements they required, dated De<lb/>cember 21st, 1904 (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 70)—I had previously told Leslie about some of these things, because I knew they were wanted to be done—on receiv<lb/>ing the requisition I asked him to prepare an estimate showing how much it would cost—in consequence, he submitted to me two documents at different times, the first of which (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 2) is headed: "Approxi<lb/>mate cost for putting right the following items as per the requisition of the London County Council," in his handwriting, and purporting to be an estimate for materials only, and it works out to £54—subsequently he submitted a second statement to me which included the first, and brings up the cost of material and everything to £80—I had an arrangement with Mr. Arthur by which I should do that work, and the few occasions on which I went to the theatre after I left was for that purpose—I paid three or four visits in the beginning of January, when there was work being done under the requisition—it was going forward, but in the Result it was not entirely completed—I had no communication at all with Webber in reference to this work; I did not give him any instruc<lb/>tions nor orders for sparking plugs—all the work which Webber did upon the theatre, which was connected with plumbing, was done by means of written orders or estimates which my manager, Mr. Merer, had authority to issue to him; he did not do any electrical work—when by estimate it would be submitted to me and authorised by me, and when a</p>

               <p>written order it was under the hand of Mr. Merer on a printed form—Mr. Merer remained on in the same capacity with Mr. Arthur after I left—up to the time I left, Webber's account for 1904 was settled as between him and myself; he used to send in accounts periodically, some<lb/>times weekly, and I then discharged them, when he would give me a receipt—I never handed Leslie any letter under which I became respon<lb/>sible for any such sum as £3,000 for electrical repairs or work to be done in the theatre; nor before this case did I know of the existence of any such document—I never heard of the existence of any undertaking by Mr. Arthur involving him in the payment of any sum at all for Leslie—I do not think I visited the theatre with reference to this work after January—I went down with the specific object of seeing whether Leslie had done the work which is mentioned in the first paragraph of the esti<lb/>mate, the running of the iron barrels to the back of the stage in the engine loom, and re-wiring one of the staircases, and 1 found that had been done—with regard to the work for which 1 was to pay Leslie, no account was ever sent to me, and that account is still outstanding between him and myself—on July 20th I received a visit from a clerk of Messrs. King, Adams &amp; Co., Webber's solicitors, and he handed me this letter (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">read: From Messrs. King, Adams &amp; Co., stating that they enclosed copy of order upon him by Mr. George Webber to pay them £100, and they would be obliged by his handing bearer a cheque for that amount payable to their order</hi>)—the authority indorsed upon the letter runs thus: "To A. F. Henderson, Esq., New Theatre, St. Martin's Lane. I hereby order, authorise and request you to pay my solicitors, Messrs. King, Adams ob Co., of 66, Gannon Street, E. C., the sum of £100 and their receipt therefore shall be your discharge. Dated this 20th July, George Webber"—I had no ar<lb/>rangement under which by Webber's authority I was to pay anybody £100—I wrote to him on July 20th (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 5, <hi rend="italic">read: Stating that he would he interested to know his (Webber's) explanation for authorising him to pay £100 to a representative of King, Adams &amp; Co., and that he was indebted to him (Webber) in a sum of £25,000 as stated by King, Adams &amp; Co.'s representative</hi>)—I do not think I received a reply to that letter—on July 21st I received this letter from King, Adams &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 6, <hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "July 21st, 1905. Dear Sir,—Mr. Webber has sent us your letter to him of yesterday's date. We are investigating the cir<lb/>cumstances connected with the delivery of the goods to your theatre. The value of the goods which have been delivered on the order of Mr. Leslie amount to the sum that we named, and, we believe, considerably beyond it. We shall probably have to file Mr. Webber's petition and the matters will have to be dealt with by the Court. In the meantime you will please that the notice served upon you yesterday as a charge in our favour for the amount named. In due course the particulars of such part of the account as is attributable to you will be got out and sent in"—I do not think I answered that letter—I had no knowledge what-ever of any sum of £25,000 outstanding between myself and Webber—I believe some invoices came to the theatre from Webber in connection with this electrical work, but they did not come to me—I received no</p>

               <p>invoice of any description from Webber—in January Webber sent an invoice to the theatre for a small amount for some glazing he had done, and it was returned' to him for some reason, but that is the only one I received from him in the course of the year—the original total cost of the electric installation at the theatre was between £2,000 and £3,000—I never had any of these sparking plugs (<hi rend="italic">Pognon sparking plug, Produced</hi>) in the theatre—I did net know of any intention to have an extraordinary theatrical display at the theatre necessitating vast preparations and vast outlay.</p>

Leslie was about six years in my employ—he was not a sort of sub-contractor authorised to employ two or three men to carry out any works I required, charging me the whole amount, and paying the men himself; he was simply a working electrician to ovary out alterations, or any work connected with the installation that might be required, as my servant—when I said at the Guildhall that he used to pay his own men I was alluding to the night hands who manipulated the limelight—he used to render an account of his own wages and the names of the men he had had on the stage—during the whole time he was with me I regarded him as a very trustworthy and able man—on September 13th, 1904, I gave him this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Dear Leslie,—It will give me much pleasure to testify to the extreme care and attention given to your duties during the past seven years in the capacity of the engineer to the Grand Theatre, Fulham. I shall be at all times more than pleased to give you a testimonial.

The Grand Theatre was opened in August, 1897, and Webber was the first to supply ironmongery goods—I cannot remember who recommended him; I think the shop itself recommended him to me; it is a nice large shop—he continued to supply ironmongery goods for about two years before I came into communica<lb/>tion with Leslie—he did not come through Leslie in any way—I had a gas-engine driver and my consulting engineers besides Leslie—I had nobody, other than Mr. Merer, to see to the ironmongery repairs—Webber used to call very occasionally about the business he did for us—Leslie would be there to meet him about his business, so they would be brought a good deal in contact with each other—I got some electric lamps from Webber once—he would hand those over to Leslie, it being his department—Leslie took on this London County Council work as a sort of contractor, and the rule as to written orders to Webber would not apply to that work—I should say that Webber would be justified in accepting orders from Leslie for that work without written orders from myself or Mr. Merer—this was quite a different sort of arrangement; it was the first work of that nature that Leslie had ever done for me—I did not know</p>

               <p>Webber was doing it—I did not see him in 1905 at all till I saw him in the dock at the Guildhall—Mr. Merer represented Mr. Arthur after I left, and Leslie represented me—I did not inform Webber of that fact; I had no communication with him at all—when he sent accounts into Mr. Merer on my behalf they reached me through him—I am still the lessee of the theatre and am still responsible for it; I have only sub-let it to Mr. Arthur—I believe that Webber sent dozens of invoices addressed to me to Mr. Merer this year which near reached me—to the best of my recollection I never had any communication with him this year in reference to a disputed account—I have looked through my papers for an invoice sent directly to me, or which came to me through Mr. Merer, and I have no such invoice—I have a recollection of receiving an account from him purporting to be an account rendered for about six or seven invoices, and writing and asking him what he meant by it—I cannot remember the month; I should not think it was as late as March—I got a similar document to this (<hi rend="italic">Invoice from Webber, Produced</hi>), but whether this is the right amount, or the right details, I cannot remember—the last item is March 1st and purports to show that eleven invoices have been sent in, coming altogether to £51 6s. 9d.—it is addressed to "A. F. Hender<lb/>son, Esq., Debtor to G. Webber. To amount as per invoice, £4 2s. 6d." and then follow ten other amounts as per invoice, making £51 6s. 9d.—I now think it must have been in March—the item of £4 2s. 6d. was the only item which I knew anything about at all, and I have a recollection of writing to Webber and saying so—Leslie was continually calling on me; I think he must have called about this—he said that he was getting the material from Webber for these repairs—I wrote to Webber saying that I was satisfied with Leslie's explanation and would pay the amounts—I have not paid it yet; the work had not been completely finished and I intended to wait until it had been before I paid it—I did not re<lb/>pudiate it; I only said that I knew nothing about it except the first item—Leslie informed me that the accounts were for materials supplied in connection with the London County Council work, and I believed what he said—I was not prepared to pay Webber without having seen the invoices upon Leslie's assurance that it was all right; I certainly intended to see the invoices and the details of the goods supplied before I paid, in the ordinary course—I do not think I asked Webber to let me have any details—I think Leslie told me that Webber was upset over it—I presume he was upset at my saying that I knew nothing whatever about the accounts—I presume he thought I had received the invoices [<hi rend="italic">At</hi>

I live at 4, Seville Row, and am the lessee of the Grand Theatre, Fulham, which I took over in succession to and from Mr. Henderson on December 24th, 1904—I knew from the negotiations with him that the London County Council had required some altera<lb/>tions to the installation and Mr. Henderson agreed to take that upon his shoulders—on my entering into occupation Leslie was the working elec<lb/>trician and he kept on in the same position and with the same wages—Mr. Merer, Mr. Henderson's manager, became my manager; I took over the staff—Mr. Merer would know about the charges of Leslie's workmen; that was in his department—I had never seen Webber before I saw him at the Guildhall—until a letter of July 14th I never had any communica<lb/>tion from him (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 7, read): "Dear Sir,—Would you be good enough to pay to Messrs.

Arthur"—I have no knowledge of any secret electrical installation or display at the theatre from the time I took it over, nor any knowledge of any syndicate of persons interested in such a thing—there was nothing in which extraordinary effects were desired to be brought about other than the ordinary theatrical effects—I never wrote a letter in which I authorised Leslie to spend £8,000—I had no communication with Leslie beyond writing and telling him that I thought he was not getting on sufficiently well—under my arrangement with Mr. Henderson he was to pay any sum incurred in satisfying the requirements of the London County Council.</p>

I am the manager to Mr. Arthur at the Grand Theatre, Fulham, commencing my duties in that capacity in December, 1904, having been manager is Mr. Henderson from the time the theatre was opened eight or nine years ago—during the time I have been manager Leslie has been the working electrician and has had a small room in the theatre—his wages ultimately were £3 a week at the time of the change from Mr. Henderson to Mr. Arthur, but I think they were less at the beginning—he would be expected to do all the repairs as regards the wiring of the theatre and electric light—Jamieson and Rosenberg assisted him—I do not remember Rosenberg being an assistant to Leslie until Mr. Arthur took the theatre over this year—Jamieson was there before this year—I knew Webber as an ironmonger of 63, High Street, Putney, and during Mr. Henderson's time he had done repairs and odd jobs generally at the theatre; he would supply iron standards that were required or that sort of thing; his account came, roughly speaking, to about £250 a year—I wrote the orders to him and invariably signed them—they were kept in duplicate, so I have a record of the orders given out—he sent his accounts in sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly, and sometimes quarterly; it varied—if I wanted to check the order, then he has once or twice sent me the written orders back—in Mr. Henderson's time I had the power of drawing and signing cheques, and that is how I paid Webber's accounts, but if they were small I paid in cash—I paid Leslie's wages, in Mr. Henderson's time—in the early part Mr. Henderson used to sign the cheques, but the last two years I used to sign them—in Mr. Arthur's time the cheques were obtained from Regent Street signed either by himself or his secretary—we have a treasurer who takes them to the bank and cashes them—I would look at the accounts for work at the theatre to see whether they were correct, and then I would forward them on to the office in Regent Street and the cheque would come from there—as to the wages, the treasurer goes up to Regent Street on the Friday, obtain the cheque, goes</p>

               <p>to the bank, got the cash and pays them—under Mr. Arthur I continued signing written orders, and small orders of that kind have been given to Webber—from December 17th, 1904, to June 21st, these accounts (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 11, <hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) have been rendered by Webber, amounting to £12 or £13, and they are marked "correct" with my initials—I knew that a certain amount of re-wiring was required to be done by the London County Council and that Mr. Henderson had arranged with Mr. Arthur to satisfy those requirements—I was representing Mr. Arthur only after December 24th, and if any letters came addressed to Mr. Henderson they would be sent on to him at the New Theatre—letters addressed to Mr. Arthur I would open unless they were marked "Private"—for this particular installation work Leslie was decidedly looked upon as the representative of Mr. Henderson—after Decem<lb/>ber 24th I got a number of envelopes addressed to me from Webber enclosing invoices, practically all by post—of course I knew the invoices would be for supply of iron materials, but I did not examine the items—I cannot accurately say to what department the goods referred to, but I should say more for the electrical department—I handed the invoices to Leslie, assuming they had something to do with the London County Council work—the invoices were similar to these (<hi rend="italic">Bundle produced</hi>)—I should not say all of these were received by me, but a portion of them—I did not notice the amounts; I did not keep them long enough—I re<lb/>member, when I handed them to him, Leslie saying, "Oh, this is Mr. Henderson,"—he seemed to understand them and said he would take them—I have seen Webber a couple of dozen times at the theatre, I should think, since December 24th; I have seen him on the stage and in the corridor, and sometimes with Leslie on the stage—he had access to the theatre at any time and has been there frequently for years—Webber sent in some invoices addressed to Mr. Arthur for small sums, which I took and paid—I never saw any from him addressed to Leslie—up to July 19th I never had any conversation with Webber about the electrical work, nor about any work at the theatre of that kind; he never mentioned the subject to me—I met him frequently in the theatre and in the street, but he has never discussed with me the position of Mr. Arthur or Mr. Henderson in connection with that work Leslie was doing—on one occasion I saw a switchboard outside the stage door and on another occasion, when I was in the front of the house, I saw a van come up and the man presented an account—I asked him what it was and e said, "A lathe"—he gave me an invoice for Webber, and I directed him to take it to Webber, which he did—I saw no other goods delivered at the theatre, either by Webber or his men—after July 19th I saw some wooden cases under the stage, but I did not see inside them—I saw from the labels they were from the "Union Electric Company," addressed to Webber—on July 19th Mr. Hohne and Mr. Parsons, repre<lb/>senting Gent &amp; Co., came to see me at the theatre, and I had a conversation with them—we looked over the theatre and they recognised some lamps outside the front of the house and some carbons under the stage—the next day, July 20th, Mr. Hohne and Webber came to see me at the theatre</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130151"/>
               <p>—Webber asked me if this apparatus, referring to the electrical goods, was required at the theatre—I asked him why he had not spoken to me before—Mr. Hohne asked him why he had supplied all these goods and he said he had seen a letter from Mr. Robert Arthur to Leslie authoris<lb/>ing him to expend £8,000 on his behalf on this electrical work, and a similar letter from Mr. Henderson to Leslie authorising him, Leslie to spend £3,000 on his behalf—I asked him if he had the letters, and h said that Leslie had them—I remember saying that it was hardly likely that £11,000 would be spent in repairs on a building that possibly only cost about £30,000—Mr. Hohne asked him if any accounts had been sent in to Robert Arthur and he answered, "Yee"—I asked him to whom they were directed and he said to Leslie—I then asked him why Mr. Henderson's accounts had been sent to me instead of Leslie, who represented Mr. Henderson, and why Mr. Arthur's accounts had been sent to Leslie instead of to me, who represented Mr. Arthur—he did not give any satisfactory answer; he evaded the question by saying that he had always sent Mr. Henderson's accounts to me, and thought it was right to continue to do so—they then went away—Webber did not in any way point out any parts of the theatre to Mr. Hohne as far as I know, nor did he point out where any Pognon plugs had been fixed—I have never seen a Pognon plug at the theatre—the last time I saw Rosenberg at the theatre was on July 17th; he was working at night as a limelight man from the middle of May—sometimes he worked in the day at this wiring—I cannot remember his doing any day work the last six weeks before July 17th—Leslie was connected with the limelight, and they were together at the theatre—Leslie had to be there till the theatre closed for fear something went wrong—we made our own electricity.</p>

               <p>coil, £25; 500 lamps—so far as Webber knew, I might have put those invoices before Mr. Henderson—I was not communicating or seeing Mr. Henderson from time to time—I wrote to him on another matter to this—I believe he came to the theatre once or twice, but I did not see him—I was mostly in front of the house and I did not see the goods delivered—no electrical goods were delivered in the first five months of 1905 to my knowledge—I said before the Magistrate that during that time a good many electrical goods were delivered at the theatre by the Union Company, but I said that in consequence of what I had heard—the door-keeper would know more about that than I—I cannot be sure that on the interview on July 20th I arranged that Mr. Hohne and Webber should come at 6.30 p.m. on the next day—I do not remember them coming on that day—I was not doing any work for Mr. Henderson in the first five months of this year—as regards the item of £4 23. 6d. in the invoice sent by Webber to Mr. Henderson, as to which Mr. Henderson said he was writing to me to pass as satisfactory, that was for some windows that had to be repaired and re-glazed, and he wanted my approval of the work before he paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As soon as I saw that the invoices were headed to Mr. Henderson I just marked the envelope "Leslie" because I put all my papers in one little drawer so that I could hand them to Leslie—that would be from the beginning of this year—I never looked closely at them and I really took no notice of the amounts—the theatre was closed from Sep<lb/>tember 17th to December 24th—I was no longer manager for Mr. Hender<lb/>son, so that these invoices did not concern me; I presumed they were in connection with this London County Council job which Leslie was looking after in the interests of Mr. Henderson—it was perfectly well known that Mr. Henderson had gone to undertake the management of the New Theatre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the cashier of the London &amp; County Bank, Borough High Street, Southwark—on July 25th, 1904, Cheesman opened an account at the bank in the name of Francis Cheesman, of 10, East Hill, Wandsworth, and 108, Hop Exchange—she gave as references Mr. Rohls, of Hurlingham Road, Putney, our Putney branch, and she said that she worked for her brother-in-law, who was trading as "G. Sinclair &amp; Co.," carrying on business at 108, Hop Exchange—she said the contemplated opening an account at our Putney branch, but she considered it would be more of an advantage to have an account near to her business, and she had been to our branch several days previously—we inquired of our Putney branch and after taking their report we accepted the account—we did not inquire of Rohls—the account was opened with a payment in of £50 5s. 6d. on July 27th, 1904, and the last operation on it was on July 20th, 1905, which left a credit balance of £3 16s. 1d. which is still there—this is a certified copy of that account (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and I see by it that on September 30th, 1904, the credit balance was 8d.—on August 27th and September 13th, 1904, respectively there are two credits for £15 by cheques drawn on our Putney branch by "G. Webber"—on December 31st, 1904, there was a credit balance of £1 17s. 7d.—on November 9th there is a cheque to the London, Chatham A Dover Railway, for £1 17s. 6d. for the rent at 83, Terminus Chambers—the balance on March 31st,</p>

Stanley," drawn by "F. Cheesman" and indorsed "H. Stanley," which was cashed, £200 in gold and two £50 notes—moneys were paid out both in the form of notes and gold; about £2,500 was drawn out in gold altogether—this (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 98) shows the gold and the numbers of the notes which were paid out against the cheques drawn on that account from May 15th to the end—Cheesman generally paid the cheques in and drew the money out; nobody else had power to operate on that account—the last payment to "H. Stanley" was paid to a man—I did not pay the cheque myself—Cheeeman always signed her name "Francis"—in explanation of drawing out notes and gold she said she was making payments to some French people she was doling with who demanded notes and gold—she informed us that she had got a valuable patent, and the goods were being manufactured in France.</p>

Cheesman said the Electrical Accessories Co. had got a valuable patent, and she also said that by paying in notes and gold they got a better price from the French firm who were making the goods—I understood from her that the patent belonged to the Electrical Accessories Co., of which she was practically the proprietor—she did not say she was merely a clerk—I do not think she ever told me she was the sole proprietor, but I understood she was part proprietor; she said she was trading as "The Electrical Accessories Co" with others—we know that Webber had an account at our Putney branch, but we did not know it at the time when Cheesman called upon us—I cannot remember that she gave me any reason for opening an account at the Putney branch; I guessed it was because her references were with Putney people—I cannot tell you in whose favour the £100 cheque was drawn by Webber on June 30th—none of the cheques drawn by Miss Cheesman were signed "Francis. Cheesman, Secretary"—I cannot remember whether she indorsed cheques in that manner; if she indorsed for the Electrical Accessories Co., she may have indorsed "Proprietor" or "Secretary," I do not know which—she indorsed cheques on behalf of the company, bat it depended upon whom the cheques were made payable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of Gent &amp; Co., manu<lb/>facturing electricians, of 3a, Upper Thames Street—about April 29th Leslie called upon us and had a conversation with me; he said he could place some large orders in my hands—I said if such orders were for electrical or similar goods I should be pleased to execute them if I could—he said, that he should require some commission and I told him that I should see hat he would not lose anything on it if the business were satisfactory—he told me then that the orders would come through Mr. Webber, of 63, High Street, Putney, who carried on the business of an ironmonger, and who also had supplied electrical goods to the Fulham Theatre for some seven or eight years—he said that this year they were preparing some very unique and wonderful electrical effects—I presumed he meant on the stage, but he did not say so—I endeavoured to use every argument and persuasion I could to find out exactly what it was they were going to do, but Leslie's invariable answer was that it would be violating a confidence to tell me, and possibly result in the lose of his position—I think he may have given me at that interview details of goods that were required, but at any rate he did on subsequent interviews—he particularly mentioned the chief things were sparking plugs, accumulators and batteries together with the general electrical material—he said they would be wiring some 30,000 lamps—he told me also that the sparking plugs were procurable at only one place in London and that the reason Webber was coming to me for them was because he could not obtain credit for such a long period as he would require from these people, the Electrical Accessories Co., Terminus Chambers, Holborn Viaduct, who, as it was subsequently shown, wanted cash—he also said a certain type of battery which he wanted could be procured at the Electrical Accessories Co.—he said it was the Pognon plug—I had heard of sparking plugs, but I had not heard of this one—he said the reason he was bringing me the order was that he had taken some orders in the past for another firm near, who, although having promised him commission, had not paid it—the only other particular point of importance that I remember at these inter<lb/>views is that Mr. Robert Arthur's, the lessee of the Grand Theatre, Fulham, name was mentioned as being the one responsible person to Webber for any electrical goods that Webber was supplying—I suppose he visited my place about three or four times between April 29th and May 12th—Leslie said he courted the fullest investigation and Webber would be found to be a perfectly honest tradesman—I made inquiries as to Webber through two or three trade detection societies and the results were satis<lb/>factory inasmuch as that he was generally spoken of as an honest trades-man—I did not make inquiries financially; the person who was financially responsible was Mr. Arthur—I put through an inquiry as to Mr. Arthur's financial position and found that he was considered responsible for £5,000—all these inquiries were finished, I should say before the first order was brought—this order (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 47), dated May 12th, 1905, was for, amongst; other things, lamps, electric fans, and so on, including twelve batteries,</p>

               <p>two gross of plugs with adapters, two more gross of plugs with adapters, and twenty-four plugs, was brought on May 12th by Leslie—it is on a printed memorandum, "From Mr. G. Webber, 63, High street, Putney"—it was not immediately executed—on a Saturday after that, I cannot say whether it was one or two Saturdays After, Leslie came and asked me whether I was going to supply these things—I said, "Yes, I think so," and he said, "I must have them to-day; we have got a gang of men working at the theatre all this afternoon and all night and all day Sunday to get the effect completed. It must be ready for Monday night"—he particularly wanted the plugs, so I took a cab to the Electrical Accessories Co.—I saw Miss Cheesman; this was about 2 p.m.—I asked her to quote me for Pognon sparking plugs in quantities, holding out the probability of having some more orders coming along—to the best of my recollection she quoted 5s. 9d. each—I bargained with her, and I think we got down to 5s. 3d. each—on one occa<lb/>sion Leslie told me they could be bought for 5s. 9d.—cash terms were not mentioned—I gave an informal order on a piece of paper or two gross and said that I would go back to my office and confirm that on one of my official order forms and send it by messenger—I did so and sent the messenger with the order, telling him to bring back the two gross of plugs with him—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), by which I see it was Saturday, the 13th—Leslie came into my office about five or ten minutes after my messenger had left and asked me whether I was sending these plugs on to-day—I said, "My messenger has just gone to fetch two gross, and he said "Two gross will not be sufficient. I must have four gross, or else I must try and get them elsewhere"—I did not want him to do that—he asked me if I would mind giving him a note authorising him to collect the two gross my messenger was collecting and a further two gross, so he could get them all away quickly to the job at the. Fulham Theatre—I said, "It is rather late in the after<lb/>noon, and it is not the usual thing, but if you bring me a signature for them, I will do so"—I gave him an additional order to allow him to take delivery of four gross—this was about 2 or 3 p.m.; I was really keeping open late because this business had turned up—he went away with the order and I did not see him any more that day—he came in two or three days later and brought me a counterfoil out of a counterfoil book with no particular heading; it stated that he had received delivery from the Electrical Accessories Co. of the four gross, and I believed that he had re<lb/>ceived them—I told him that if he required to take personal delivery of any goods to Mr. Webber, in future he must have orders made out to bearer—the next order he brought was dated May 20th for forty-eight batteries, four gross of plugs, with adapters, four ditto, and forty-eight ditto, which were supplied by the Electrical Accessories Co.—prior to the second order I sent my traveller, Mr. Murray, to see Webber, and he made a report to me—the second order was, "Please supply to bearer"—on May 22nd I wrote this letter to Webber (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 49, <hi rend="italic">read: Thanking him for the orders received, which they were delivering to Leslie, as they understood in doing so they were carrying out his (Webber's) wishes</hi>)—I got no answer to that letter—on May</p>

I will call and see you to-morrow"—the goods in these invoices (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) were certainly delivered to Webber's own place—the sparking plugs ordered were to be delivered direct by the Electrical Accessories Co. by arrangement with Leslie—by Exhibit 125 fifty dozen Pognon plugs were ordered, which work out at £157 10s.—Exhibit 126 orders two gross of plugs, with adapters, and Exhibit 127 is the invoice—further plugs were ordered by Exhibit 128, and on June 17th we got an order signed by Webber for forty-eight six-way stage plugs—the last order was Exhibit 130, for two figures fitted with electric light, which we sup<lb/>plied ourselves—just before June 29th we made an application to Webber for payment, when he wrote to us saying that he would forward cheque during the early part of the next week—yielding to demands for immediate payment from the Electrical Accessories Co., on June 30th we paid them a cheque for £613 10s.—the cheque has been returned to us in due course paid, indorsed, "F. Cheesman," for the Electrical Accessories Co.—Webber not having paid, on July 5th I went down to Putney and saw him—I asked him for a cheque and he told me he had been unable to get one from the theatre people—I told him it was a very large amount for a first transaction, although I had had good references; that he had promised me faithfully that I should have a cheque by the end of the week—I asked him then what these plugs were being used for, and he told me it was an invention or patent that was being taken out for a lightning effect at theatres and the plugs were being used for that—he told me the plugs were very satisfactory, but the experiments were not completed, although they would be in a very few days—I asked him if I could go to the theatre and see them, but he said it was a secret, and that nobody could see it until it was finished—he said that he had seen them himself constantly; that he had been to the theatre and saw them being fixed, and that there were hundreds of them already fixed—I was then satisfied to leave the matter for a few days—he said no would send a cheque the following Satur<lb/>day, when he got his money from the theatre—on July 7th I wired to him and received this reply from him on that day (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 134, <hi rend="italic">read: Acknowledging receipt of wire; and stated that he regretted he should have to disappoint him</hi>

I know you can only purchase them from one place; that is the Electrical Accessories Co., of Terminus Chambers, Holborn Viaduct"—I had not heard of the Pognon plug up to that date—on May 25th we received an order for one gross of Pognon phigs, with adapters (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 17)—when I went to the Electrical Accessories Co.

They have paid me thousands of pounds, and it is all right"—I believe he said "thou<lb/>sands of pounds," but I will not swear to it—he wrote to us on June 10th saying he would let us have a cheque on July 3rd, but no cheque came on that day—Leslie called on us on July 1st, and said that we were pressing Webber, who was annoyed, unduly, and if I could get our people to stay their hand until Monday (this was a Saturday) we should be paid; that he knew very well the manager of the theatre had promised Webber a cheque and we should have ours in due course—about June 27th we had an account from the Electrical Accessories Co. for £232 15s. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that had been preceded by some correspondence between us in which they were insisting on immediate payment—it culminated in our sending a cheque for that amount on June 26th, with a letter saying that having regard to their ar<lb/>bitrary manner in dealing with the transaction we finally closed the account with them—on July 8th a cheque was sent by Webber to our head office on the London &amp; County Bank, Limited, High Street, Putney, for £331 2s.

I saw Cheeeman after Leslie had been to Mr. Archer—I have seen her three times, I should think, to ask her about the plugs—she quoted the price to me as 5s. 9d. and she gave me a sample plug off the counter—I did not see similar articles about; I saw a little stock there, but not large; a few batteries—I do not know about any parcels that were closed up—I went there on one or two occa<lb/>sions, when I found the door of the office closed—Leslie said that 5s. 3d. was the price Webber paid for the plugs; that they could be got for 5s. 3d. and I told Mr. Archer that—I asked Cheesman if 5s. 9d. was the lowest price and she said, "Yes"—I said, "We can get them at a lower price," but I did not say anything about Leslie to her; that is all that passed on that interview—I went down and saw her after the order had been sent, and told her that we had not received the plugs, and she said they would be sent on—I did not see her again until she came into oar shop about a cheque—whatever I asked her on any occasion she answered openly—when I returned, after having seen her about the price, I did not make any note of it—I am sure that Leslie gave us the price as 5s. 3d. and that Cheeeman quoted 5s. 9d.</p>

I am the accountant to Strode &amp; Co.—my firm had some correspondence with the Electrical Accessories Co. at the end of June with regard to their account—on June 27th I went to Terminus Chambers with a blank cheque, which I filled in there—I saw Cheeeman there—she gave me no name at the time, but she signed a receipt in my presence in the name of "A. Morton" or "Norton"—I explained to her that I had called in reference to the account and that we were surprised at the way in which they were pressing for payment; that we</p>

               <p>had a definite promise from our own clients for payment in a few days, and I asked her to let the account stand over till the following Monday—I also asked to see the principal—she said that the principal was a Mr. Cheeeman and she could not let the account stand over, and he was going to issue a writ against us—on that I made out a cheque, she making up the statement for me, making it payable to the Electrical Accessories Co., and crossing it" Account of payees only"—I appended my signa<lb/>ture—she said there was no such account at all for the Electrical Accounts Co., and all cheques had to be payable to" F.

It is very unusual, I should say, for a man in your position"—he practically repeated what was told me in the first instance: that I had no need to fear; the matter was all sound business and there was a lot more to follow—I said, "I ought to have some guarantee for it. Mr. Webber, senior, whom we know to be a responsible gentleman, should either be your guarantee or the theatre company"—he said very little to the point, but that he would consider it over, and I told him I would leave him to consider which he should do; either let me have a guarantee or a cheque—he did not mention to me that there were a number of other persons with whom he was doing business in plugs—I cannot remember the exact date of the visit—three days after Leslie came with the orders, Webber called on me because I refused to execute them until I had seen him, as I had told Webber I mistrusted the man who was bringing me the orders, the reason for that being that he (Leslie) had asked what he was to get out of it in the shape of commission and he was rightly told by my secretary, "Nothing at all"—I told Webber exactly what had taken place, that Leslie was asking for commission and that I had told him that I would see that he was looked after to the tune of 50s.—Webber said, "Did he?"—he did not seem very much astonished—he said on that occasion I need have no fear at all; the orders were perfectly right—he said distinctly, "I am doing very large work for the Robert Arthur Theatre Co."—I understood that to mean that he was doing work for many theatres, and I rather gathered from the bulky orders that it was not this one theatre, but probably it was going to the other too—I looked upon Webber to get the money for the work from Robert Arthur—he assured me that was where it was coming from, and said that he was getting his money at the end of the month—I never got paid anything with regard to my £800 account—I think I may say I paid him three or four visits to his shop at Putney after that, at all of which inter<lb/>views he reiterated what he had said before; in fact, he assured me from start to finish that there was nothing but what I might be perfectly satisfied with—he had been on our books for many years and I believed him—the account we previously had had with him may probably have been £100 a year, such as we would expect from an ironmonger of that sort—he wrote to me on June 30th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>):"In reply to fours of the of 29th instant I will write you in the course of a few days stating the very earliest I will remit a cheque on account. You must admit the arrangements you suggest are not quite in keeping with the circumstances, considering the matter from every point"—that is the answer to the request that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130178"/>
               <p>should have one of the two alternatives, either letting me have a guarantee or some money—the Electrical Accessories Co. were very peremptory in asking for payment; they had a most substantial claim against us—the first payment we made was one for £225 and the next one was for £661, we believing that the goods bad been supplied.</p>

                  </hi>. Up to a short time ago I was employed as the stage doorkeeper to the Fulham Theatre, where Leslie was employed as electri<lb/>cian, Rosenberg being one of his assistants—I have seen Cheesman on one or two occasions waiting outside the stage door for someone—Webber was a very frequent visitor to the theatre when Leslie was working there; he was there pretty nearly every day when I was there; I went on April 10th and left in the middle of September—he generally asked if Leslie was in and went downstairs if he was in, and if he was not he waited for him—between April and July considerable quantities of electrical goods arrived at the theatre, the majority being addressed to Webber—Webber had a track connected with his ironmongery Business and I have seen that arrive at the theatre with, as far as I could see, electrical goods upon it—if Leslie's men were not there, I stood them in the corner just inside the stage door until Leslie, Jamieson or Rosenberg arrived, and then they were taken down to the stage, and that was the last I saw of them—I do not know exactly where they went to—I had no instructions as to them, but I signed different papers four or five times for them—as far as I can remember, there were Pognon plugs in nearly all the parcels—before I signed for them I made the man tell me everything that was in the parcel; I did not examine them—on one or two Sundays I saw the men engaged rewiring the stage, and on one Sunday I saw them making a box for Loie Fuller's performance on the Monday following—I think it was some time in June—she came for six nights—this is the only work I saw done—engaged on it were Leslie, Jamieson, Rosenberg, Johnston, who, I think, used to work at Webber's, and another man named Newman—on several nights I saw parcels taken away, sometimes by Leslie, sometimes by Jamieson, and sometimes by Rosenberg, in their arms—I only saw one truck load of stuff taken away—Jamieson and Rosenberg took that—it was not Webber's truck—that was a solid brass rod—it was towards the end of June—the parcels taken away were of the same description that came; they did not look as if they had been opened at all—the last delivery to the theatre came about 9 and 10 a.m. on about July 19th; they came from Webber's, and Leslie and Webber were at the stage door when they came—during my time I never heard of any great electrical display which was contemplated at the theatre—any such change of programme would be known to the employees—I never saw anything like this (<hi rend="italic">Pognon plug, Produced</hi>) being used at the theatre.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as an electrical engineer at 49, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square—somewhere about the begin<lb/>ning of June Leslie called upon me with an order from Webber for 600 "plugs, with adapters" and other goods (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 114)—he said that it was a patent plug of which the London County Council had approved, and it would save bother if I went to the Electrical Accessories Co. for them, and he gave me the address—we wrote to them and eventually gave them the order—at 12 a.m. on June 17th he came and asked why we had not attended to the order, we having not yet sent the goods—he said he had a rehearsal on the Sunday morning and so I gave him an order to take to the Elec<lb/>trical Accessories Co. to get the goods ready and said that I would send my carman along to pick them up—my carman followed within five minutes of Leslie leaving—I did not see anything more of Leslie that day—I saw my carman later, when he made a communication to me—it subsequently came to my knowledge that Leslie had taken away the goods, or said ho had, from the Electrical Accessories Co. on that day—on June 19th I had this letter from Webber (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 115, <hi rend="italic">read: Thanking him for prompt delivery of plugs and batteries</hi>)—Leslie had represented to me that it was Webber who wanted the goods, and I had made the usual trade inquiries, which I had found satisfactory—I had a doubt about the goods having arrived so I sent a representative to Terminus Chambers but he came back—I called myself three times before I was successful in getting access to the office—on the third occasion I saw a lady, who to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130183"/>
               <p>the best of my belief was Cheesman—I asked Her who took the goods away and she said that it was someone of the name of Leslie—I asked her to show me the signature for the goods, but she could not do it then, because she said the books were at the works, promising to send it on to me—she said they had stores in Mill wall and Farringdon Road—I asked her to show me what the plugs were like and she showed me a large stage plug or a portion of a large stage plug—I was rather suspicious about the size of the office, it being only about eight feet square and divided into two parts—there was nothing of any value that I could see, the value of the goods I had ordered being £337—I told her that I thought it was very funny that these goods had been delivered to Leslie when my carman was sent for them—I think I pointed out the quickness with which my carman had followed Leslie—she did not say anything about having seen my carman; it simply passed off in general conversation—a few days afterwards I received this letter requesting payment and threat<lb/>ening to issue a writ—on referring to their letter I found it was payment within seven days—I declined to pay—the day before they started pressing me, about three days after I saw Cheeeman, Rosenberg called, giving the name of Knight, and saying he was from the Electrical Accessories Co.—as the billhead of the Electrical Accessories Co. bore the name of Knight I assumed he was the manager—he said he wanted payment of the account—I said I was not satisfied that the goods had been delivered and I should have to make further inquiries—he did not say very much, but simply that it would have to be paid, on which he left—I forget what was said about a signature—the next day I received a writ, dated July 1st, claiming £337 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; setting out the goods that had been sold and delivered (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Richard Knight was the deponent—I placed the matter in the hands of my solicitors—proceedings were taken against me under Order 14—my defence was that there had been no delivery And I swore an affidavit to that effect, alleging conspiracy to defraud—the action was put back and I did not hear any more of it—I did not pay anything in respect of their alleged claim—I have lost in all about £30 worth of goods which I supplied from my own stock—this sparking plug is used for igniting charges in gas or combustion engines—one plug would be required for each cylinder.</p>

I saw Cheeeman between 12 and 1 p.m.; I swear it was not 6 p.m.—I did not see anybody in the office beside herself—I do not remember telling her that I had received Webber's Acknowledgment of the goods; I may have done—on second thoughts I do not think I did say anything to her about Webber—we talked About motor cars, and so on—I suggested to her that we might arrange it as a bill in payment, £160 the first month and £150 the second month—I have not been asked that before—I did not say to her that mine was not a large firm and I wanted to arrange so as to get a little time for payment—my object was to delay payment as long as possible—I had a motor car, and I should think I went to the theatre to see Leslie on it three or four times after the Electrical Accessories Co.'s invoice came—on the last time I saw him at the theatre I said, "Is Webber</p>

               <p>have dealt with him in a small way for eight or nine years—he said, "Good-morning," and passed on—when they had got about six yards away they turned and came back—at that time I aid not know it was Leslie who was with him; Leslie stood two or three yards off—Webber asked me if I could supply some Pognon plugs; he really did not say at that moment what particular sort of plugs they were, but he would give me a sample if I would send down to him the same evening—he said he wanted fifty dozen for some stage effect which was a secret only known to himself and the electrical manager at the Grand Theatre, Fulham—he said they were wanted on Mr. Robert Arthur's account—I knew Mr. Arthur to be a very sound man—he said they were wanted for electric lighting effect and they were to be put into a slate bed—I sent in the evening to the theatre and got a sample, which I found to be a Pognon sparking plug—he said that the price he could afford to pay would be 7s. 6d. or 7s. 9d., each, but he did not tell me where they could be obtained—he said I should receive Mr. Robert Arthur's cheque within thirty days, out of which I was to allow him 5 per cent.; I was to debit him in my books with these goods—following that, he said his father, whom I know to be a responsible man, would guarantee payment—I agreed to supply them—Leslie, who was within hearing, took no part in the conversation—I found out in the trade where to get the plugs from, and I sent to France and got 600 plugs; they are a patent thing, only made by one small man—I tendered them at Webber's shop and he signed for them—he then sent a lad with my carman in my van and they were absolutely delivered at the theatre by his direction—this card is signed "G, Webber," and dated June 17th, 1905, charging the plugs at 5s. 9d. each (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 103)—they were then minus the adapters, which I supplied within seven days, charging him 1s. 6d. each: 7s. 3d. was the price of the plug complete—the value of the plugs as invoiced was £215—I have paid the French firm from whom I got them, but I have never been paid by Webber, and there is a small current account outstanding besides this—all the plugs I supplied were each separately numbered; I got an invoice with the numbers from the French house—I have been shown some plugs by the police, and by the numbers I have identified them as mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DICKENS</hi>. They came from France in a case which was delivered intact to Webber; they were tendered at his shop—I should like to explain the plugs are handled two or three times before they get into motor people's hands in this country, whereas I get them from the actual producer—I paid 3s. 4d. each for them without the adapters, which I got from John Bolding &amp; Sons, paying 8d. or 9d. each for them—Leslie must have heard part of the conversation; he walked about and stood still; he might have heard a few words; he was within three yards—I said to Webber after he had passed, "Well, Webber, how are you? You have not done much lately. Cannot you give us an order to-day?" but that referred to his ordinary business—after he returned he said to me, "I do not suppose you go in for small fittings, do you?"—he came back immediately and said that—he had only got about six yards away—I said, "What sort?" and then he mentioned electrical</p>

               <p>fittings, afterwards mentioning that they were sparking plugs—he said they were used for the Grand Theatre, but he did not understand how they were used—I cannot remember whether he said they were a French made article—I do not think he did say so—Mr. Tremmer, who is my principal, came up—I never heard Mr. Tremeer say that he was going to Paris for his Whitsun holidays and he could find out where to get them—Mr. Tremeer was going to Paris for his Whitson holidays, and he did go, as a matter of fact, and obtained the plugs—I really did not hear any con<lb/>versation between them, nor did I hear Webber say to him that they were a French-made article and in consequence of that Mr. Tremeer saying he was going to Paris and would make inquiries where to get them—Mr. Tremeer obtained the knowledge where to get them from Webber and another man at the theatre in the evening when he went there—it was in consequence of that information that Mr. Tremmer went over to Paris and got the plugs—there was nothing mentioned about the price in the morning; it was arranged that the transaction was to be talked over in the evening between Webber and my principal—Leslie had nothing to do with that transaction in the morning and took no part in the con<lb/>versation at all—my principal gave me a sample which he brought away from the theatre—the price was mentioned in the morning, but we could not fix the exact figure—with reference to Mr. Arthurs cheque and Webber's father giving a guarantee, that was all in the evening—I was not there in the evening and it is really hearsay on my part—Webber in the morning said that he was not at liberty to tell me how they were to be used—he gave me to understand that part of the apparatus for use of these sparking plugs was in his workshop, and he invited me to call and inspect it, which I did—he also said that I was not to tell anybody in the trade about this secret stage effect—to the best of my belief he gave me to under<lb/>stand that he was not at liberty to divulge; he told me he was not at liberty to divulge—I cannot swear that he said he did not understand how they were to be used—he knew for what purpose they were, but he did not understand the adaptation of the sparking plug for electrical lighting purposes—he did not quite understand the action of the electricity—the emphasis would be on the word "quite"; he understood some of it, but not altogether.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He spoke as though he were a man embarking on a first transaction in connection with sparking plugs—he said he had just secured a contract from Robert Arthur, the proprietor; a contract which involved the use of these plugs—a few days later I went to High Street, Putney, to see Webber, and he showed me two slate beds with 600 holes drilled in them to receive 600 plugs—nothing was said to me about his having received a number of plugs from the Electrical Accessories Co.—I was given to understand that this was the first transaction—there was no written order whatever.</p>

               <p>other people were charging him, that he could not pay more than 7s. 3d. nor anything of the kind; he said other people were quoting, but there were no other plugs to be got in London for immediate delivery—I think now that I have said the whole of the sentences—if I had been asked questions on these other points I should have answered, but it is impossible to give every word—I understood he had just secured this contract for the lighting of this theatre in this particular manner, but ultimately more would be required for the remainder of Mr. Robert Arthur's theatres, whatever they were; I do not think he mentioned what theatres they were—I understood that if this was a success, the same contract might be obtained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the managing director of Frank Suter &amp; Co., electrical engineers, of 66, Berners Street—we had a number of orders giving the name of Webber to supply goods to the aggregate of £300 on the personal instructions of Leslie—we have ordered £215 worth of goods from the Electrical Accessories Co., and we have paid them—with regard to the debt incurred by Webber, we received a cheque dated July 10th (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 144) which was dishonoured—I have been through the whole of the invoices for goods supplied by the whole of the contractors, and I have also been through the whole of the invoices from Webber to Mr. Henderson, and I have made summaries of both—I have had for the purposes of comparing the invoices the orders given to the contractors in this case by Webber, and find 42,999 plugs were invoiced by contractors, of which, according to Webber's books, I found 2,400 were sold to Mr. Arthur—1,271 accumulators were supplied, and invoiced none, not in his books even; and nine electrical fans invoiced by contractor, none sold; 827 small switches invoiced by contractors, none invoiced by Webber; 909 stage plugs invoiced to Webber, none invoiced by him; 843 lamp-holders invoiced to him, none invoiced by him; 6,115 yards of flexible wire invoiced to him, 1,296 invoiced by him; 37.12 electric cable, none invoiced by contractors to. Webber, 999 invoiced by him; of 61 12s. another thick<lb/>ness, he purchased none, but sold 1,100 yards; 37.14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., purchased none, sold 550 yards: 19.22's, purchased none; sold, 660 yards: 19.12's, purchased none; sold, 440 yards: 19 14's, purchased none; sold, 600 yards: 19. 15's, purchased none; sold, 550 yards: 7. 16's, purchased none; sold, 1,430 yards: 3.20's, purchased none; sold, 110 yards: 1.18's, purchased none; sold, 220 yards—he bought one 4 h.p. electrical motor and one 5 h.p. electrical motor, and invoiced neither of them—there were 7.317 electric lamps invoiced to him, and 4,200 invoiced by him—some of these lamps are described in his books as of 600 volts, which is quite an imaginary lamp; no firm could ever supply 600 volt-lamps—at page 442 in his journal in the account to Robert Arthur there is entered up a coil of cable, 37.12, at £50; and lower down, "two coils, 61.12 at £125 a coil. £250"; and again "two coils, 6112, £150," which shows, although they were the same size, there is a difference of £100 in the price—the matter of quality would only affect it to the extent of £8 a coil—I find charges to Mr. Henderson vastly in excess of what purport to be the cost prices—on March 7th a cable is charged to Mr. Henderson at £19 16s., the net cost of which was £8 11s. 3d.—in</p>

               <p>getting out these prices I took the medium quality from the catalogue which was in use at this date, and I took off the trade discount, so that is the net cost—on March 14th two coils charged at £50 cost him £17 2s. 6d.; March 16th he charged £25 for a cable costing him £3 10s.; on March 23rd he charged £27 to Mr. Henderson for a thing costing him £9 12s.; March 28th he charged £16 10s. for a thing costing him £8: April 1st charged £26; cost, £2 8s.: April 3rd the same thing occurs: April 6th charged £38 10s.; cost, £8 16s. 9d.: April 7th, charged £135; cost, £70: April 8th two items charged £54 each; cost £4 16s. each—I have prepared a grand summary of the contractors' invoices.

Webber cannot now be found at his usual place in Putney. I went there and he could not be found there"—when I went there he was not there, and there was nobody there to say when he would be back—I swore that because we wanted to get hold of him—I did not suggest anything, only that he was not to be found—42,999 represents the number of plugs that were invoiced; there were thousands more ordered—the invoices begin about March and end in July—the invoices found on Webber, when arrested, to Mr. Arthur go down to the end of April—I cannot accept the statement that the accounts to Mr. Arthur in the books go down to July 20th, without seeing them—Mr. Henderson's invoices go down to April 10th—on looking at Mr. Henderson's account in the ledger, I see the accounts go up to May 20th—the invoice of April 10th is entered up in the ledger under May 20th—the invoices are entered up all <hi rend="italic">over the shop</hi>—there are two separate folios—all the invoices in Exhibit 10 are entered up in the book—Mr. Arthur's account goes to April 9th—in the day book there are items against Mr. Arthur for goods which have not been carried out against him in the account up to July—I find amongst these invoices an account for 600-volt lamps as in the journal—a 600-volt lamp would cost a lot of money—an ordinary lamp would cost Webber about 1s. 1d.—I see this 600-volt lamp is invoiced at 1s. 6d., but I am not talking about the price, but as to the fact that 600-volts are never made—any electrician would know that—it is to Mr. Henderson that the largest amount over cost price is charged, an item charged at £18 which cost £112s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the Sun Electrical Co., Limited, of 118, Charing Cross Road—about the end of March Leslie called upon me stating that he was the electrician to the Fulham Theatre, and he referred to Webber and mentioned Pognon plugs, saying that they could be got from Sinclair &amp; Co., of Terminus Chambers, Holborn Viaduct—after that I received orders from Webber, including orders for these plugs which I ordered from Sinclair &amp; Co.—I also got some Pognon plugs from the London agents of the Pognon patent, but Leslie stated they were not the correct article and I got the remainder from Sinclair &amp; Co.—this is an order signed by Webber, dated March 7th (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 151)—later on I got this order for a 4-cylinder petrol engine (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 153), dated May 1st—Leslie visited me with reference to it and said he wanted it at once—he said that the Middlesex Motor Co., of 731, Fulham Road, had got an engine of the type which would suit him and I could get immediate delivery from them—I communicated with the Middlesex Motor Co. and purchased an engine for £97 8s. 6d.—I paid a cheque for that amount in favour of "F. Walker &amp; Co."—I got delivery of that engine and delivered it to the Fulham Theatre in accordance with Leslie's directions—I sent in my account to Webber in the usual way—he owed me up to the end of July £286 19s. 2d.—I brought an action against him and got judgment on July 19th, which judgment, of course, is unsatisfied—I have since seen the engine at the garage in Dryad Street, Putney, which was shown to me by the police.</p>

I should not have taken the paper, but I should have signed the letters," and that is correct—I saw Cheesman many times in the house adjoining the workshop, 22a, Bangalore Street, in the presence of Mrs. Leslie—she assisted in little jobs in the shop—she was always under the direction of Leslie or Mrs. Leslie—she lived there, to my knowledge, as a lodger; she was not supposed to have any occupation as far as I know—from beginning to end Leslie has always told me that she was the sister of his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the London &amp; County Bank, 152, High Street, Putney, where Webber had an account—I pro<lb/>duce a certified copy of that account from March 1st, 1905 (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 99), going up to August 18th—from time to time from June 1st there were large sums in notes paid in—I produce another certified extract showing the numbers of the notes—a sum of £4,000 came in in that way—from July 4th until the close of the account, August 13th, a number of cheques were presented against the account which were dishonoured, as is shown by Exhibit 102 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there are thirty of those cheques and they come to about £7,700—the names of the payees' cheques are Croggon, Evered, Emmanuel, Brush Electrical Co., Verity, Suter, Sperati, Chandler, Purcell Nobbs, Smith, Hales Bros., and others—I also identify the pass book of Leslie at the same branch, where he kept an account—it shows that he opened it in April, 1902, giving as references G. Webber and J. H. Blake—the bank advanced £200 on May 3rd to Webber on the security of his lease of 63, High Street, Putney, and this is the document of charge.</p>

I have got a signed document here from the manager that Leslie opened his account, being an electrical engineer, of 22a, Bangalore Street, Putney, in April, 1902, references being George Webber and J. H. Blake—this document does not show that Webber gave any reference at all—I cannot say whether Leslie's references were applied to—this list of returned cheques starts with a cheque of Phillips, £116 9s.—going down lower, on June 21st there is the same cheque—Croggan, £250, is there twice, as is also Verity, £397 9s. 3d., and Emmanuel, £200 0s. 4d., is three times over—I was asked what the total of these documents roughly come to; they are treated as returned cheques each time they are returned and I added them all up as different cheques—</p>

About 8 p.m. on July 21st I was in High Street, Putney, when I saw Webber—I said to him, "Are you Mr. Webber?" and he said, "Yes, that is me"—I told him I was a police officer and should arrest him on a charge of conspiring to defraud, and I should take him to Putney police station, where he would be detained pending the arrival of Mr. Willis with a warrant—on the way to the police station he said, "Have you got Leslie!" and I said, "Not yet"—he said, "That is the man you ought to have got first; he has been doing them all. In fact, he has done me as well, and I am going to file my petition on Monday"—he was detained at Putney police station, and I was present when Inspector Willis arrived—the warrant was read to him and he said, "Where am I mentioned?" and later he said, "All right"—his name was mentioned in the warrant for conspiracy with other persons—he was afterwards taken to the City, where he was charged, and he made no reply—I afterwards searched the room, which was pointed out to me as Leslie's room, at the Grand Theatre, Fulham, and I found among other things the exhibit in this case, No. 170, which purports to be the cost of material for work of an electrical character to be done—under the head of "Lantern" it works out at £30, and under the head of "Switchboard" it works out at £20; £50 altogether—it is headed, "Cost for putting right the following items, as per the requirements of the L.C.C."—there is a memorandum at the back as to the cost of the cable—I also found Exhibit No. 171, which is headed, "Must come in," and contains a number of names, including a number of electrical firms: Bolding, Dawson, Emmanuel, International Electrical Co., Evered's, Croggon, Purcell &amp; Nobbs, Verity, Banks, etc.—on the bottom in pencil are the names of Messrs. Weston, Clements, Clarke, Chapman, and some other electrical firms in the neighbourhood of Fenchurch Street—on this document (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 172), which I found, there is another list of names, some of which have given evidence in this case, Bolding, Gent, Dawson, Suter, Emmanuel, and Strode being amongst them, and with amounts., against them amounting to an aggregate of £2,418 1s. 6d.—on the back of them there is an abstract in which the names are put—I also found there five separate sheets (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 173) in which the electrical firms in different parts of London are allocated into districts under the head of "Cannon Street," "E. C.," "Finsbury," "Bond Street," "Oxford Street," "Victoria Street," and so on—I should say they have been taken from the directory and put down into districts, so they could easily be got at—I also found Exhibit 169, which is a letter from Rosenberg, dated October 31st, 1904, headed "Platt Motor Car Co., Gardner's Lane, Putney," which is crossed out, and the address as it stands is "The Middlesex Motor Co., 731, Fulham</p>

Receipt in due course will oblige. Yours faithfully, G. Webber"—that is to Messrs.

I was away from the theatre working at motor car work last year for about ten to twelve months and went back to work for him about last December at the theatre at wages 25s. a week, which was increased by Mr. Leslie to 32s. 6d. a week. He then suggested to me that he had some work for me to do in the city which I heard no more of until about six or seven weeks ago, when he took me to Holborn to buy me some clothes so as to appear well-dressed, because he said I should have to see some people in London to collect money off of them which they owed him for goods supplied, which I have done, calling on them for the money owing. The solicitor was Mr. L. White, of Holborn. I was calling on these people and the solicitor for about three weeks, representing myself as Mr. Knight, the manager, by Mr. Leslie's instructions. He told me to do so because he did not want anybody to know that he was connected with the firm, because he did not want the theatre people to know he had other business to attend to besides the theatre work. This work went on to last Thursday week. Then I went up to London to meet Mr. Leslie, as arranged, at 10.30 a.m. at the Monument. Then he gave me a cheque to change for £300, which I changed for him at a bank in the Borough. Then he gave me, I think, two £50 notes to change for him at the Bank of England, which I did. I got five £10 notes, five £5 notes, and £25 in gold. He gave me five £5 notes and £25 in gold and told me I could go away for a holiday and suggested Clacton-on-Sea, but I would not go because my wife was in delicate health, expecting a confinement, so I told him I would go away to my wife's sister at Little Haseley. He told me to stay away until I heard from him, which would be in a week or two, and then I should go back to him and start work for him at his motor-car works which he proposed opening in Putney. The reason he gave me for me going away so suddenly was that he owed some money and there was a writ against him, and he thought it best that he should shut up the office until he had come to some arrangement for paying this money back. He always gave me the impression that everything was honest and straightforward,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130196"/>
               <p>and I had not the slightest idea that it was otherwise. I have always placed the utmost confidence in him, and done what he told me. Signed, Richard Thomas Rosenberg, August 21st, 1905"—in that statement he makes reference to a cheque which he cashed at the instance of Leslie and, as he says, for £300 at the London &amp; County Bank, Southwark; this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 96) and it is payable to "Mr. H. Stanley," dated July 20th and indorsed, "H. Stanley"—I am able to say from having seen him write that statement that that indorsement is his writing—between July 21st and September 16th I had been searching for Leslie and Cheesman, but I was not successful—on September 16th I was in Aberystwith, when about 9.40 p.m. I followed Leslie into the Aberystwith railway station—I had never seen him before—I was with Detective Thorpe—I said to him, "Your name is Leslie"—he said, "You have made a great mistake"—I said, "I have not; anyway, we will discuss that at the police station"—I took him to the local police station—on the way he attempted to break away—at the police station he again said, "You have made a great mistake"—I pointed out to him that his hair was dyed red and said, "You have dyed your hair and you have had your moustache shaved off"—originally his hair was black—I then said, "I am satisfied that you are William Leslie. I hold a warrant for your arrest for conspiracy to defraud, and I shall take you back to London with me on that charge—Thorpe searched him in my presence, when he found two three-stone diamond rings, one single stone diamond ring, one single stone diamond pin, a gold watch, number 38121, a gold chain, and sovereign purse, and some buttons that he had evidently removed from his trousers, with a name of a Putney firm on them—in company with other officers I went to a house in Smithfield Road, where I saw Cheesman—she was sitting in the front sitting room on the ground floor—I said to her, "Good-evening, Miss Cheesman"—she said, "You are mistaken"—I said, "Well, what is your name; is it Alice Norton?" and she made no reply—I said, "I have reason to believe you are Francis Cheesman. I am Inspector Willis, of London, and hold a warrant for your arrest for conspiracy to defraud. Leslie is already in custody and you will be taken with him to London on that charge"—I then questioned her as to the notes and gold, the proceeds of the fraud, and she said, "I shall say nothing"—I saw on the mantelpiece this bag (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I said, "Is this yours?" and she said. "No"—I opened it and found a small purse with a sovereign in it, which Cheesman said belonged to her—I also found two diamond cluster pins and a receipt for luggage left at the Aberystwith railway station in the name of "Bond"—they occupied a bedroom and sitting room in the name of "Mr. and Mrs. Bond," and they had been there for some considerable time—in the bedroom I found two canvas bags in a box wrapped in rags—the bags contained £1,982 in gold and £330 in Bank of England notes in a piece of paper—I went to the railway station and presented the receipt, and I was given that large basket (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on opening it with a key I found on Leslie, I discovered, wrapped in old clothing and straw, a small bag which contained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130197"/>
               <p>two canvas bags containing exactly £4,000 in gold—the value of the jewellery found was £1,500 and it was bought at different places in London prior to the prisoner absconding—altogether there was £6,330 in notes and gold, and jewellery to the value of £1,500 found at Aberystwith; on Rosenberg was found £30 4s. 7d. and there is £4,000 which has passed into Webber's account, making altogether £11,880 odd—the amount unaccounted for is the difference between that and £18,650—I find that over £7,450 in Bank of England notes has never reached the Bank of England—I have not been able to find out in whose custody they are—at 83, Terminus Chambers, I found two copy letter books containing copies of different invoices sent to different firms for these Pognon plugs, these three books from which the leaves had been torn out, another book with orders, apparently from some firms, in Cheesman's writing, some receipts appar<lb/>ently signed by Leslie, and a receipt in blank (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 91) on a memo form of the Electrical Accessories Co. signed by Leslie, a stamp of the company, and a counterfoil delivery book—I found no bank book or pass book nor any book showing any account of Pognon plugs supplied to the Electrical Accessories Co., nor any receipts showing the receipt by the company of any such plugs—I found in the office a box containing about 150 Pognon plugs and in the basement fifty dozen plugs and some batteries behind a door; they had no right to put them there so far as I am informed—those plugs have been identified—the Sun Electrical Co. supplied eighteen dozen, and out of those I have recovered thirteen dozen and two—Escape and Denelle supplied twenty dozen and eight, and identified fourteen dozen and five; Bowley supplied fifty dozen, and identified twenty-eight dozen and six; making a total supplied of eighty-eight dozen and identified fifty-six dozen and one—they were all found at Terminus Chambers with the exception of seventeen which I found at the garage in Dryad Street, Putney—I have fourteen dozen and five still unidentified—of the enormous numbers of plugs which were supposed to be delivered by the Electrical Accessories Co. I have found no trace whatever—I found a number of documents where the delivery form in ink is filled up in the handwriting of Miss Cheesman, addressed to a firm, and at the foot of which the name of Leslie is written in pencil—I found three letters from Webber addressed to Sinclair &amp; Co. (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 117), one of February 15th enclosing cheque for £20; one of August 24th, 1904, enclosing cheque for £15; and one of September 7th, 1904, with another cheque for £15—these letters are long before Cheesman's account was refreshed by the large sums—I went to the garage in Dryad Street, Putney, and made this list (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 93) of the goods I found there, amongst which were seventeen Pognon plugs—subsequently a number of these things were identified in my presence by the owners of them—roughly they are worth £2,000—amongst other things there was a lathe and a 4-cylinder motor, which has been valued at £100—this letter (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 155) is in Rosenberg's handwriting, as is also the signature of "Knight" to this affidavit (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 116)—on three Bank of England notes there is in<lb/>dorsed "R.

W. Rosenberg, a tailor at Putney—all these payments to Leslie and Cheesman, added together must amount to some hundreds of pounds—there are twelve counterfoils which show payments apparently direct to Cheesman which come to £95, roughly, the last being on May 4th, 1903—I have not only the twelve counterfoils, but the twelve cheques—I know her writing—they are cheques dated respectively October 3rd, 16th, 21st, November 3rd, 22nd, and 29th, 1902, January 6th, 22nd, one in April, one in July, 1902, and one in December, 1902—one of them is indorsed by Leslie and another, of May 4th, 1903, appears to be indorsed by Cheesman, in her natural undisguised handwriting in the name of "W. Leslie"—they are made payable to "A. Cheesman" and two, I think, have been apparently made payable to "Mr. A. Chees<lb/>man," which has been afterwards altered to "Miss A. Cheesman"—I found all the cheques in the condition in which they are now; they have not been altered—the largest amount of any individual cheque is £12—on searching 22a, Bangalore Street, I found seventy-one of Webber's orders, blank so far as the name of any firm to which they are addressed is concerned—they are signed by Webber and in Webber's handwriting, to the best of my belief—there are about fourteen of December 30th, 1904; I have not counted them—the latest date is May 1st, 1905, and the earliest in December, 1904—there are seventeen other orders which had the names of firms upon them, but with that exception they resembled the others—the first appears to be dated December 23rd, 1904, and the last May 20th, 1905—I found a number of letters and invoices to Webber from various firms—there is an invoice from Croggon &amp; Co., relating to some accumulators, dated May 13th, and others—Leslie and Webber banked at the same branch of the London &amp; County Bank—I seized a number of Leslie's cheques, many of which were drawn in</p>

I take to refer to Leslie—in consequence of information received I went to 12, Wymond Street, which is a matter of three or four minutes' walk from Webber's shop—a man lives there of the name of Meadows, who was very friendly with the prisoners and with Jamieson—Jamieson, who is now living at 22, Bangalore Street, used to assist Leslie at the theatre as an assistant electrical engineer—I found at Wymond Street two promissory notes, one for £4,000 dated July 4th, 1905, and another for £100 of the same date, in a carburettor; they are not addressed to anybody, but are both stamped and signed by Webber—I also found four documents purporting to be receipts in Webber's handwriting for different sums of money pur<lb/>porting to be received from B. Rohls, amounting in the aggregate to £1,300 and dated respectively June 8th, 17th, 19th and 23rd, 1905—I found them in enclosed envelopes, which I opened; there are no receipt stamps On any of them; they are on Webber's forms—I found them on October 31st at 12, Wymond Street—I received the information which led to the search warrant after the last hearing at the Police Court—the prisoners had not then been committed—there was a formal remand for the purposes of the committal, and they were committed on November 3rd—I have not been able to ascertain to whom those promissory notes have been given.</p>

The first cheque to Cheesman is September 22nd, 1904. and the last May 4th, 1905—the whole of the payments to her would work out less than £2 a week—I did not ascertain before arresting Leslie that he had been living at Watford—he left Aberystwith, I understand, for several days at a time and returned—I have not ascer<lb/>tained whether the basket left at Aberystwith station had come there from another station and was not taken straight there—at the cloak room they were not positive who had left it—they were under the im<lb/>pression it was left by a man—as to Leslie's attempting to break away, Thorpe had his right arm and I had his left, and he suddenly stopped and tried to throw us away from him—there was not another young lady staying with Cheesman when I went there, but I ascertained there had been, and that she occupied another bedroom—I did not ascertain that there was another bedroom used by Leslie when he was there.</p>

I was searching for Rosenberg a fortnight before I got his warrant—I should hardly call his a good hand-writing—it is very clear—Leslie's writing is not nearly so clear as his—I said before the Magistrate, "I have made inquiries as to Rosenberg and find he is a very respectable and industrious man. I know nothing against his character. To the best of my belief he has given me every information and has offered to give me any assistance. I searched him and his effects and found nothing beyond the bank notes. He was willing to be searched. I have heard he has gone by the name of Miller.' His</p>

Miller"—in all the specimens of his handwriting that I have seen I should say he has not endeavoured to disguise it.</p>

Amongst the documents in Leslie's room at the theatre I found this paper, which appears to be in Leslie's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it says: "Paid out Cheesm. £3,300; Webber £3,500," and there are the figures"£4,226" beneath—there is drawn out the"£3,500," which appears to have been subtracted from the £4,226, leaving a balance of £726—beneath that again is £726—"Cheesm., paid out £3,300," has been scratched through with the pen, as though it had been paid, but "Webber, £3,500," remains intact. [<hi rend="italic">A statement made by Leslie the day before his committal (November</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd) was then read (Ex.</hi> 182)]: "Sir,—Will you please allow me to make these few remarks with regard to the notes to the value of about £6,000 which you state are somewhere in connection with this case? I want to assure you honestly that I have not had them, neither do I know where they are. There have been many remarks made against me, especially previous to my arrest, which are absolutely untrue and most unfair. Up to the present I have made no attempt or endeavour to defend myself. All I hope is that I may be given the opportunity of speaking the entire truth in this somewhat remarkable case. Before this case leaves the Court I desire to truly and earnestly state Rosenberg and Miss Cheesman are absolutely innocent of any wrong whatever. It is with the greatest regret that I have seen these two innocent persons suffer as they have done in this case. I would have told you all I knew of the affair long while, but was re<lb/>quested to say nothing until the trial. Yours respectfully, W. Leslie" [<hi rend="italic">Another statement made by Leslie (Ex.</hi> 183) <hi rend="italic">was then read</hi>]: "Sir,—I wish to again apply to you and ask if you will kindly allow the notes which are at present held by the police to be handed over to my wife. I wish to state she is quite without means, and having a little child to look after and both being in very delicate health her present position is a very sad one. I want to strongly point out the absolute proof there is that these notes are not in any way connected with this case. These notes were paid to me by a man named Mr. Jamieson, who bought two motor cars from me. His name is indorsed on the back of them, and in addition to this proof, there is also the name of the bank stamped on them showing where they came from. I must respectfully submit that more absolute proof than this surely cannot possibly be required. If there is any question of the rightful ownership of the property sold, I can produce</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rosenberg, in his defence on oath, said that he had first met Leslie in</hi> 1899 <hi rend="italic">of the Grand Theatre, where he was employed as a gas-engine driver, receiving</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week, Leslie being the electrician; that after travelling abroad he re<lb/>turned to the theatre in</hi> 1902 <hi rend="italic">as odd man at night, working in the day for the Platt Motor Co.; that in</hi> 1904, <hi rend="italic">whilst employed at the Middlesex Motor Co., Leslie requested him to copy a reference in the name of S. Wenlow (Ex.</hi> 118) <hi rend="italic">because his handwriting was clearer than Leslie's, which he did; that being unsatisfied with his position at that company Leslie employed him at the theatre for both day and night work at a salary of</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which rose to</hi> 32s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that in consideration of being paid such a small wage Leslie promised to pay him a lump sum at the conclusion of the work which was then being done at the theatre in connection with the London County Council's requirements; that Leslie asked him to write some letters (Ex.</hi> 154-168) <hi rend="italic">purporting to come from the Middlesex Motor Co., to which he signed the name of "F. Walker &amp; Co.," Leslie saying he had authority from Mr. Walker for his doing so; that he did not suspect in any way that there was any fraud connected with the engine to which that correspondence had reference; that in June</hi>, 1905. <hi rend="italic">Leslie told him that he had work for him in the city collecting debts on behalf of a firm, which he subsequently learnt was the Electrical Accessories Co., saying that people were financing him, mentioning the names of Cheesman and Webber, his (Leslie's) being the brains; that his instructions were to take the name of "Knight" as the manager of the company; that he was to receive nothing but the money, failing which he was to issue a writ; that in swearing the affidavit against Banks (Ex.</hi> 116) <hi rend="italic">he believed it to be true; that as regards the cheque for</hi> £300, <hi rend="italic">he had cashed it under Leslie's directions, signing it "H. Stanley "in the belief that that was Leslie's banking name; and on the same day Leslie instructed him to change two</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">notes at the Bank of Eng<lb/>land, which he did, indorsing them with an address which he had left for some time, and that in spite of the cashier's knowing this he changed the notes; that Leslie soon after told him that his creditors were pressing him; that he was not to go back to the theatre, as his presence there would lead to inquiries about himself (Leslie), he (Leslie) not wishing it to be known that he had business outside the theatre; that he (Leslie) gave him five</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">notes and</hi> £25 <hi rend="italic">in gold, being the lump sum promised and also</hi> 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">per cent. Commission on money collected, as agreed; that he then went to Little Haseley, Leslie telling him he would let him know when to return to work at his garage in Dryad Street; that in using the name of Miller, which was his wife's maiden name, he was only doing what he had done on occasions before, he having found his own name from its foreign sound handicapped him in obtaining employment; that although it was true that he had had a motor car accident he did not mention it to the people at Little Haseley as the reason for his presence there; and that throughout the whole of the transactions with Leslie, who had always given him a helping hand and whom he implicitly trusted, he had not the slightest idea there was any fraud.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Lewis, who is employed in the Mint, and we live at 16, Wall button Road, Brockley—from September 19th to 23rd I employed a girl named Constance Phillips—she smacked my little girl, aged three, so I gave her notice through my husband to go at once, and she left on September 23rd—I told her about it and then I spoke to my husband and gave him the money to give her—he told her, as I was not very well—before leaving she made no complaint of any kind, but she cried—she had scarcely seen my husband—on October 19th the prisoner called with a man named Egan about 1.15 p.m.—my char-woman opened the door and they stayed in the hall and I went to speak to them—Phillips said, "Are you Mrs. Lewis?"—I said, "I am"—he said, "Mr. Lewis is not at home"—I said, "No"—he said, "Your husband is employed at the Royal Mint"—I said, "He is"—he said, "We have come upon a very serious charge. Will you take us into a room where no one will overhear us?"—I opened the door of the dining room and took them in there, and Phillips said, "Now I almost think I will write it; will you fetch me a sheet of writing paper?"—I said, "Cannot you tell me? I am his wife"—he said, "If you will fetch me a sheet of paper we will decide what we will do, whether we will tell you or write it," so I fetched a sheet of writing paper and when I took it in Phillips said, "We have decided to tell you now. Sit down, take it calmly; we have no wish to punish you, only Mr. Lewis"—I then said, "Who are you?"—they said it did not matter; what they had come about was about a young woman named Constance Phillips, who had been in my employ as mother's help for five days, and had left though the improper conduct of my husband—I said, "It is a lie; I gave her notice myself, through my husband, for smacking my child, and I also gave him the exact money to pay her the 3s. 8d.—Egan then said, "There is a slight discrepancy here, as Constance acknowledges receiving 5s."—Phillips said, Oh, that is of small consequence; that does not matter. The serious thing we have come about is your husband's improper conduct"—I said, "It is a lie, because when she was discharged she cried and said that she wished now she had accepted the engagement to go on the stage and play the violin, only she would have to wear tights"—Phillips said, "She is not that style of girl at all; it is an illusion, but your husband is the biggest blackguard on the face of the earth, and it is not the first time There was a similar case at the Mint some years ago, but we are content not to put it into the hands of the Public Prosecutor for the matter of £200"—I said, "But we have no money," and then they both laughed and Phillips said he knew better than I did what money my husband had—I then said, "I will send for my father," and I was trying to go to the door to fetch him, but they both stood in front of the door and would not let me go out—I had a speaking tube, which they could not see, on the other side of the fireplace, and I rushed across the room and blew down the tube and told the charwoman to go at once for my father—they said they did not wish a third party to interfere, as it could be settled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130209"/>
               <p>between Mr. Lewis and them—they still kept on repeating about my husband being the biggest blackguard on earth and the best thing for me would be to get a separation—I said, "Cannot you wait until my father comes; don't you see you are killing me?"—just then I saw my father coming down the garden and I went to the door and let him in—I said to him in the prisoner's presence, "You remember that girl, Con<lb/>stance Phillips?"—my father said, "Yes"—I said, "These men, I do not know who they are, they won't tell me, but they say that they have come about Constance leaving at a minute's notice herself on account of the improper conduct of my husband, and you know quite well that I sent her away for smacking baby, because I told you all about it and you gave me the exact money to give her, as I had not change, but these men say that my husband is the biggest blackguard on earth, but they are willing not to put it into the hands of the Public Prosecutor for a matter of £200, and I have told them we have no money"—my father then asked them who they were, but Phillips said that it did not matter, as they had the proofs in their pocket as my husband had written to the girl making appointments and had also been to see her at her lodgings; that he had sent letters to the girl's landlord and that this letter had got into the hands of the girl's landlord's governor, and that he was likely to lose his situation through it for keeping a girl of immoral character—my father asked them to show us the letters, as we both knew my husband's writing, but they refused, so my father and myself ordered them out of the house—Egan then turned to my father and said, "If you would only be reasonable," or something to that effect, but I was listening to Phillips, who was saying that my husband was the biggest blackguard on earth and that he was going to the master of the Mint, who was a personal friend of his, and that he was already in com<lb/>munication with him—after they left I did not see them again that day, but I next saw them about 10.30 next morning, when my husband was present, as well as my father and the charwoman—I was watching to see when they came up the road and also for a detective—as soon as the door was opened to them by my husband, Phillips said, "Are you Mr. Lewis?"—my husband said, "I am," and took them into the dining room—they said, "Mr. Dawson?" (that is my father), and Mr. Lewis said, "Yes, he is coming in a minute or so"—Phillips said, "What are we waiting for? We have been here nearly three minutes now," and I called out, "You are waiting for the detectives. I am going to have you both locked up," and with that they went to the door and went off as fast as they could—my father had come then and he and my husband went after them—before that we had communicated with the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crass-examined by the prisoner.</hi> There was no one else present at the conversation between Egan, yourself, and myself, but I repeated it to my father—my statement that certain things were said to me is absolutely uncorroborated—I told my father the tale that you had told me in front of you—I did not say that I would do anything to screen my husband—I said I had nothing to screen him from—I asked you if you were a police officer, not if you were a solicitor—you did not say, "No, I am not a</p>

               <p>solicitor and I may as well tell you that I have not consulted a solicitor, because if I had done so he probably would have taken one or two courses. It might have taken the form of a Magisterial inquiry or it might have taken the form of an action for damages for libel, the libel being contained in a third letter in which the writer made serious charges against my daughter and threatening that if she were not turned out from the apartments she was staying at, the police would be informed that the landlord was keeping a disorderly establishment and that the damages which might be given by a jury might be assessed at £50, £100, or £200, according to the view they took of the matter"—the only sum I heard of was £200, and there was nothing about a claim for damages—I have not made a mistake and I have always been credited with a wonder<lb/>ful memory—you had no claim upon us—you were not threatening me, but you told my father you would sell us up and make us bankrupt and that my husband would lose his situation and be sent to prison—I did not hear you tell my father that—the Magistrate discharged Egan—you could not judge from the appearance of the room what money we had, because the painters were in and there was simply a table and chair left there—this letter "A" is in my husband's writing with the exception of the word "Affectionately"—I say that that word is not in his writing because I have known him for ten years—he is a Welshman and he has never spelt that word out in his life—he always puts "Affect," and he never puts "Affectionately yours"—I believe that this letter has been traced or copied, as he wrote the letter on paper from the Mint—I believe this letter "Al," dated from the Mint, is in his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Asked Schools, Pepy's Road, New Cross, of which I am the caretaker—the schools communicate with 16, Wallbutton Road, where my daughter lives, through the garden—on October 19th, between 1 and 2 p.m., a message came to me and I went across to my daughter's house—I went into the dining room, where I saw Phillips, Egan, and my daughter—she told me in their presence that they had demanded £200 on account of her husband having assaulted a young lady, named Miss Phillips, and said that they said that her husband had been writing letters and making appointments to meet the young lady in the evening, that he had also written letters to the landlord where the young lady was lodging, and that a letter unfortunately had dropped into the hands of the landlord's governor and was likely to get him discharged—that is what my daughter told me Phillips had said—I asked Phillips what authority he came from, and who he came from, and who he repre<lb/>sented, and who they were, and their names; also if they were police officers—to that he said, "No," but he refused to say who he represented or who had sent him, or give his name—I told him I did not believe there was a word of truth in anything that he had said—he said he had the evidence in his pocket in the form of eight or nine letters written by Mr. Lewis to the young lady—I asked him to let me see them, but he refused—I then told him he must leave the premises, as I did not believe there was any</p>

               <p>truth in what he had to say—he said, "What cannot speak cannot lie, and I have the letters in my pocket"—I again asked him to let me see them, and as he again refused I opened the door and turned them out—as they were going, Egan, in Phillips' hearing, said, "You had better come to business in this matter, Mr. Dawson; we are reasonable men and we are willing to meet you honourably and make a compromise with you"—I did not say any more, but turned them out—about 3 p.m. the same day they came together to my house, which is a lodge belonging to the schools—Phillips said, "You asked to see these letters?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "We have been talking this matter over and have decided to let you see them on one condition, and on that one condition only"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "That you ask the headmaster of these schools to come into this room and read the letter and hand it back to me"—I said, "I shall do no such thing, as the headmaster of these schools has nothing whatever to do with this case; neither have I, any more than what it concerns my daughter"—he said, "One of the other masters who holds a responsible position we will accept"—I refused to call in any master in connection with it, and refused that the master should be brought into it in any way—I then said, "I have been caretaker of these schools between seventeen and eighteen years; if you like to let me read the letters or lay them on the table I will pledge my word of honour that I will not touch it or destroy it or do anything to the letter, but you shall take it up and do as you like with it without injury"—with that he laid one of the letters on the table, which I read—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is similar to the one I read, but it is not the same; it was on a half sheet of blue paper—the contents are practically the same, but the paper is not—the handwriting is similar to this, and I took it to be Lewis's—the contents were exactly the same as far as I can remember—I cannot remember seeing in that letter the word "affectionately"—I asked him to let me see the other letters, but he said that that one was quite sufficient, so I said, "Well, you had better see Mr. Lewis himself about this matter. It is his affair, not mine"—Egan replied, "Mr. Dawson, you had better come to terms. You will find us very reasonable men; it is a very serious matter, but you will find we are able to meet you in a reasonable manner and make a com<lb/>promise with you"—Phillips then said, "If you do not, we shall sell your daughter up, we shall make a bankrupt of her, and we shall put Mr. Lewis in prison and throw him out of his situation"—I said, "I will send for Mr. Lewis at once; I will send a wire for him if you like to wait or call again a little later and see him, and let him speak for himself"—Egan said he could not come again—I said, "Will you come this evening?"—he said, "I have another appointment; I cannot come"—Phillips said he could—I said, "Well, you had better both come together"—Egan replied that he could come any time in the morning before 12—I said, "Can you make it 10?"—they said, "Yes," and we agreed to meet at 10, and I said that Lewis should be present—the following morning, between 10 and 10.30, I went to my daughter's house about half-a-dozen times, but they had not arrived—at 10.30 I saw Lewis, my daughter, Egan, and Phillips there—I said, "Good-morning," and I turned to speak to Lewis and my</p>

               <p>daughter, to tell them that I had sent for a policeman—Phillips and Egan could not hear that—Phillips said, "What are we waiting for, Mr. Daw<lb/>son?" We have been here very nearly three minutes"—I replied, "I have asked a friend to come in to hear the evidence on both sides, so that we shall have something to work upon"—my daughter was a little excited and called out, "He has sent for a detective"—they heard that and laid hold of the door and bolted as hard as they could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first came into the room Mrs. Lewis told me you had demanded £200 and then she burst out crying—you never promised to give us your name at all—you did not say to me in my room that my daughter was very hysterical and not responsible for what she was doing—I may possibly have said that she had been upset owing to the death of a friend and that she was very highly strung—I never said that I was disappointed about my son-in-law, and I did not tell you that he was out of a situation when they were engaged and had afterwards received a permanent ap<lb/>pointment at the Mint—you said that you wanted an apology and an undertaking that these abominable proceedings must stop and that you had been put to such an enormous expense in sending this young lady away to the country that the money must be paid—you did not say, when I read the letter, that that was sufficient for your calling upon me, because it was improperly signed, "Affectionately yours"—when I said that I should be present at the interview with Lewis you said you would be very pleased to see me—you did not say to Egan in my presence, whilst we were waiting, "It seems to me, Mr. Egan, that these people are acting very rudely to us; we have come in accordance with their appointment and I don't propose to wait any longer"—when my daughter said that we had sent for a detective you said, "That is right; if you had not we should," and at the same time bolted—I had to run to catch you up—letter "A" was not shown to me until the last hearing before the Magistrate—my daughter told me in your hearing that you wanted £200 in addition to the apology, and you told me the same thing in my own house when you said that you must claim something on account of the enormous expense you had been put to—after I had been cross-examined at the Police Court I did not add this alleged demand of £200 because I had discovered that my daughter had told a cock-and-bull story which was unsupported—during the whole of the interview I was calm and collected; I showed no indignation or surprise—I was calm because I wanted to know the truth, and it was not because that statement had never been made by you.</p>

We have been here now nearly three minutes, so I am off to the Mint," so they hurried off and went outside—this letter "A" is in my writing with the exception of the word "affectionately"—I also wrote this letter "Al."—"R.M.E." means "Royal Mint East" (<hi rend="italic">Part read</hi>): "Please don't write to the above until you hear again; I am going away for a few days.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant P.</hi>) I was present during the hearing of the charge against the prisoner and Egan before the Magistrate—by the directions of the Magistrate I went with the prisoner to his house on October 28th, and the prisoner found these three letters underneath a book in the first floor front room—I saw him take them from that place—he had every opportunity of searching for and producing any other letters—he told me where the letters where on the way to the house.</p>

He denied that he told Mrs. Lewis that they wished to have any further person present; that either he or Egan prevented her leaving the room; that she said they were killing her; that he ever uttered any threat; that he used the words "Public Prosecutor"; that Egan said they were reasonable persons and could come to terms; that he demanded</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">or any sum in addition to the apology; that they would return at</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">o'clock; that he said he would show the letters to Mr. Dawson on one condition only; that he suggested or asked for the headmaster to be present, or referred to him in any way; that he said he had sent his daughter away at vast expense that she might not be molested by Lewis; that he said he would ruin Mrs. Lewis or make her husband bankrupt, or get him turned away from the Mint; that he said he knew the present master of the Mint; that the letter shown was the blue letter, but it was the letter subsequently marked "A"; that the time fixed for the interview was</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, but was 10.30; that he said he had waited three minutes, when he had waited fifteen to twenty minutes; that anything was said about detectives or previous meetings; that he and Egan</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">By the prisoner</hi>). I have been in the employment of the Post Office over twenty years—I remember calling upon you as to some letters which you said your daughter had received of a very serious nature—I believe it was on Wednesday, October, 19th and as to letters which she had received on the 18th—I had told her that it was necessary that she should see you, and after a great deal of persuasion she accompanied me to your house, and we discussed the matter—one letter was written in pencil—I arranged to go with you to Mr. Lewis's house and see what truth there was in them—when we got there Mrs. Lewis asked us our business—as the mat<lb/>ter did not concern me I left you to open the matter after we had gone into a private room—Mrs. Lewis appeared to be very much upset, and said, "What is the nature of your business?"—you said you had come to see Mr. Lewis, and somewhat hesitated to state the nature of your visit, seeing that it did not concern her—Mrs. Lewis seemed very agitated, and asked if her husband had done anything wrong at the Mint, whereupon you said you would like a sheet of paper to write to him—Mrs. Lewis went to get some notepaper—upon her return you said you might give her an outline of what you had come about, or some words to that effect, and you commenced by saying, "We have come here on a very serious charge against your husband in connection with Constance Phillips. Your husband has been writing letters to Constance Phillips; he has tried to blacken her character, and has threatened to do her irreparable damage"—Mrs. Lewis seemed excited and hysterical—she sank back in a chair and demanded to know what it was—you then proceeded to tell her the object of your visit—you said, "Mrs. Lewis, your husband has written a note to a young lady, Constance Phillips, and has written a very damaging letter with regard to her; she was lately in your employ, and I should like to see Mr. Lewis"—Mrs. Lewis asked to see the letters, but you declined to show them, and said that they would be shown at the proper time—I think you said that your view was that he had been trying to damage the girl's character in a very serious way, and that a jury might consider the letters a defamation of character, and might assess damages of £50, £100, or even £200—Mrs. Lewis said, "Will you wait a minute, and I will call my father?"—we waited—her father appeared, and you briefly told him the nature of your visit—the father appeared very agitated, and said, "It is a lie; get out of my house"—after that there was a slight altercation, and we left the place, after arranging to come the next day, with the object of seeing Mr. Lewis—I do not recollect the exact words, but you did not seem satisfied with the way we were met, and suggested</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190511130216"/>
               <p>that we should go and see Mr. Dawson at the school house, with the object of calling an independent witness, a man not connected with the family—when we got there we were ushered into a small room by Mr. Dawson, and the object of our visit was again gone into—you said that you would show Mr. Dawson one of the letters on condition that an independent witness was brought into the case—you suggested one of the junior teachers, or anybody who could be an independent witness—Mr. Dawson objected to that very strongly, and I then suggested that you should show one of the letters, to show the cause of our coming there, whereupon you pro<lb/>duced one of the letters, and Mr. Dawson seemed perfectly satisfied that it was in his son-in-law's writing, but he made no comment on the letter—there were three letters, but I do not recollect which of them you showed him—the paper was white—we left after arranging to see Mr. Lewis the next day—when we kept our appointment the next morning Mr. Lewis opened the door at half-past 10, and we were taken into a dining room—as I was not very interested in the case I said nothing, thinking you would open the object of the visit—you asked to see Mr. Dawson, said that you had made an appointment, and that you thought it would be more satis<lb/>factory if I was there to hear what was said—Mr. Dawson appeared to hesitate a few minutes, and something was said about an independent witness, a detective, I think, who had arranged to be there, but he had not kept the appointment—after this nobody said anything at all, and nothing was done in the matter, as we were waiting for this independent witness—after fifteen or twenty minutes you said, "What are we waiting for? We had better go, and we will consider the matter"—we had gone about a mile, when Dawson followed us, and we were arrested—we were given in charge—we did not run away, or anything of that kind—we walked leisurely away—I was locked up, and I have felt my position ever since, for of course I have been disgraced in the Post Office—I had positively no idea of any attempt to get money out of Lewis—nothing of that kind had been suggested to me—I had known the girl Phillips three or four years; she has been lodging at my father's house, and of course I have known her, and her father, and her name—both she and her mother lodged at my father's house—I had known the girl a little while before she had lodged there, but not intimately until she lodged there—I lived with my father partly—I am positive we did not say anything to Mrs. Lewis demanding money—you made no threat whatever—I do not recollect your laughing on Mrs. Lewis stating they were not worth 200 pence, or anything of that kind—I was not in a laughing humour; I thought it was a very serious affair—Mrs. Lewis asked if you were a solicitor, when you mentioned the possibility of what a jury might think—your conduct was exceptionally gentlemanly—the serious part of the matter I thought was the damaging letter, and that the girl had left the coachman's house in consequence of it—you insisted on that (<hi rend="italic">The letter written in pencil, and addressed to The Stables</hi>, 9, <hi rend="italic">Hilly Fields Crescent, Brockley, S. E., was then read as follows:</hi> "Sir,—Not knowing your name, I am not able to address you by same, but this note is intended to warn you that you are laying yourself open to very serious things by allowing such a woman as you have staying at your</p>

Also I shall not fail to write to your master. Trusting you will not compel me to do this, I am, Well Wisher"—I regarded that letter as serious—the language you used at the interviews was calm and temperate and it is not true that Mrs. Lewis called out that you were killing her, or that we prevented her leaving the room, or calling her father—there is a speaking tube from her house to her father's house some eight or ten yards away—he came in and asked, "What are you come about, and who are you?" or something like those words—I am positive you never said that you would make the Lewis's bankrupt, sell them up, or make Lewis lose his situation, or anything of that sort—I did not hear you tell Mr. Dawson that you had eight or nine letters—I did not say that we were reasonable men, or anything of that kind—the Magistrate discharged me—it is an absolute falsehood to say that we both bolted from the house—we were arrested early in the morning, and it was not till 4 or 5 o'clock before we could see anybody—I do not recollect a large book being brought in, but we were asked our names—I had given my name before that to the police<lb/>man—I had refused to give my name before, because I did not want to be mixed up in the case, but I did not think it was going to be so serious—you said at the proper time you would give your name, but that it was not necessary "just now"—you said you were the father of the young lady, when we gave our names at the police station, and Lewis withdrew the allegation—the name of the Public Prosecutor was not mentioned at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Nothing was said in the way of demanding money—it was said that a jury might possibly give damages of £50, £100, or even £200—I knew that the prisoner's daughter was living at 24, Embleton Road, Lewisham, where the coachman was employed, but I do not know how long she had been living there—she was there before she went to Mrs. Lewis's, where she was employed only a few days—I saw her when I went to see her landlord, the coachman, about once in three weeks—I was not there on several occasions, nor even on one occasion in each week—I swear that—I never heard that she was to leave in consequence of my visits—I never heard that the people talked about my coming there—I did not visit the mother, because she lived a long way off—the girl was living with the coachman's people—she had a sitting room of her own—I was a friend of the coachman—I went home with him, visited him and we enjoyed music together—he is a married man—on the 20th Mrs. Lewis mentioned about a detective after we had been there about a quarter of an hour—we walked leisurely away—nothing was said about our going to the police station when we left Lewis's house—no letter on blue paper was shown to me by the girl—I went to Lewis's on the second occasion because I had been on the first, and I wanted to see the outcome of it—I refused my name because of exposure; I did not want them to</p>

"That is all I have," but other things were afterwards found—I said, "I shall arrest you for feloniously receiving these things"—he replied, "I know I have been very silly and ought to have known better"—the things were gathered together—the prisoner said, "The clock I bought for 5s., three jugs for 8s., silver watch and bracelet for 4s., two rings and bracelet for 6s., one ring for 5s.; three necklaces given to the children" (I take it they were got for nothing) "I gave him 15s. for six teaspoons, 6d. for a sideboard cloth; the other forks and spoons I bought of him in different lots; I gave him 8s. for the knives, carver and steel"—Mrs. Singleton said, "I gave him 10s. for the gold watch and chain"—Singleton said, "I bought the piece of cloth for 1s. 6d. of him"—he was subsequently charged and replied, "I did not know they were stolen"—Baker was arrested the day before—he was dressed like a common working man, very untidy and dirty in appearance—that was on October 3rd—the goods were taken to the police station and identified.</p>

Oh, do let me go; I will give you another"—I said, "I cannot; I must detain you until Mr. Godwin comes"—he came; I told him in her presence that she was the person I recognised as having passed bad money before—he asked for her name and address—she said, "I cannot give it, for my hus<lb/>band's sake"—a constable was called—he asked the prisoner if she would be willing for me to search her—she said, "Yes"—I did so—I found a half-crown in her purse, nothing else—I found no bad money.</p>
